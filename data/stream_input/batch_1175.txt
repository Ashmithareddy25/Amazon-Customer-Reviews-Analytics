B004EPYZQ2|4.0|FILM RATING:  3.5 stars<br /><br />What I really love the most about writer/director J.J. Abrams' new film Super 8 (2011) is how it made me so fondly reminisce and wax nostalgic for the great, but sometimes a bit \\"cheesy\\" (in hindsight), movies I grew up loving in the 1980s. Like The Goonies (1985), E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Explorers (1985), and even Stand By Me (1986).  Abrams has woven together a good story here about five childhood friends who love hanging out and making movies...at least when they're not quarreling and making fun of each other. It's an homage to himself and executive director Steven Spielberg (and many more of us), who grew up much like these kids, making their own homemade movies. Set in the 1970s, the kids especially like making zombie and horror movies, recording them on their own Super 8mm film camera with a microphone taped to the end of a broomstick \\"boom\\". These boys are all geeks and misfits, like we all really were when we were their age. Come on...admit it...you were an awkward kid too!<br /><br />With legendary writer/director/producer Spielberg on board this project as both producer and \\"Godfather\\", you kind of knew something magical, and a bit cheesy, would happen in this film. I just wish it was a bit more magical in the story and character development, and less magical in the visual effects, lens flare, and alien aspects. Don't get me wrong, I liked all of that stuff, and I think Super 8 is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. But I also can't help feeling that the third act of the film fell apart. I think once the \\"Area 51 Surprise\\" is introduced visually, the film gets weaker. And the fun relationships and bonds that the five boys have, along with their girl crush addition to the group (played by Elle Fanning), kind of melts. Still, there is a lot to love in this summer blockbuster. For one, it's original material that isn't based on a comic book or toy, and it isn't a sequel or remake. Super 8 seems to be the Inception of this year. It's smart, stylistic, and filled with cool visual effects and a great ensemble cast that gives excellent performances. Kudos to Abrams for a well-written script...at least for most of the movie.<br /><br />The first act of the film brings with it some of the best performances by a group of kids I've seen in awhile. All five of the boys, led by newcomer Joel Courtney, create an energetic group dynamic that allows each to feed off the other...snapping sarcastic and sharp dialogue that definitely made me feel like a kid again. And paradoxically feel both the awkwardness and greatness of that time in my life. Kyle Chandler, as the single widowed father of Joel's character Joe, and the police officer who gets to the bottom of the train wreck and it's supernatural circumstances, delivers a solid performance that gels the focus on family built into Abrams script. The same can be said for the supporting role played by Ron Eldard as the single alcoholic father of Elle's character Alice. The entire cast of Super 8 feels right and supports Abrams very strongly in bringing the script to life.<br /><br />One of director J.J. Abrams strengths is bringing together an incredible crew of talented artists and technicians who create productions of the highest quality. While the rumored budget for Super 8 was only $50 million, this movie looks and feels like a $100 million plus production. The production design, cinematography, music, sound, and visual effects are all well executed and support the story perfectly. I felt completely transported back to the 1970s, or at least to my imagination of what the 70s was like. The sets, costumes, props, and everything else in the production design (led by Production Designer Martin Whist) gave the film that historic feel that I just love in the movies. There's something about going to the movies and escaping into a different time, whether in the past or the future, that always works for me. And when its done well, I really appreciate it.<br /><br />Director of Photography Larry Fong, known for his work on 300 (2006) and the TV show Lost, provides some stunning cinematography that literal had me gasping for air in awe. While I'm not a HUGE fan of Abrams' now signature lens flare look that he started with his remake of Star Trek (2009), it works up until I started noticing it too much...same as in Star Trek. I'm hoping that Abrams' learns that less is more sometimes, and lens flares can be great when used in the right places to support the story, but can be annoying when they BECOME the story. While I didn't overly notice the music by composer Michael Giacchino, I also didn't feel like any music was missing at crucial points during the movie. I would definitely like to listen to the Super 8 score again and focus on it because I think there were some good pieces of music throughout the movie. The sound design and sound editing was outstanding on Super 8. The dialogue was dead on and all of the explosions, gunfire, and other special events that I expected to feel from the sound of the movie worked well.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Super 8 is the summer blockbuster to go see in my humble opinion so far this year. While I haven't yet seen any of the many superhero or comic book movies that have filled the screens the last two months, I do know that I really enjoyed Super 8 on the big screen. It's the kind of popcorn movie that I grew up loving and looking forward to. I love going to the theater for a clever, original film like this one. Super 8 starts as an outstanding film (4.5 stars) but ends as just a good film (3 stars). So I've given it an initial rating of 3.5 stars. It's one of those movies I wanna watch again at home on blu-ray to see if it gets better the next time. It may just be a 4 star film for me eventually, but for now it's at least locked in as one of the best movies of 2011, likely to find a place on my Top 10 at year's end.ts done well, I really appreciate it.

B004UQPM4E|1.0|Has anybody else experienced this?  The box sleeve is as expected, but all the disc labels are in very small 5pt Spanish around the edges with no disc title and with Spanish rating emblems.  Am I supposed to insert each disc one at a time to figure out which one is which?    When I figure out what's going on I'll revise my rating and this review, if appropriate.    On another note, I watched 'Superman Returns', to see if it was region locked, with my Oppo-83 and the picture definitely showed color compression (non-smooth gradients) in some scenes. Audio was OK.    Another reviewer said they got a free ticket to go see the new Green Lantern Movie, I didn't - where is the quality assurance.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I had never seen this show but not only love Ed O'Niell from his work on Married With Children, possibly the best sitcom in history, but I had also heard good things about Modern Family from many people. Essentially I was talked into getting the first season but I in no way regret it! The writers et al make it very easy to love every character and while I couldn't say it represents the average family today it probably isn't too far off. This can be enjoyed by anyone!
B001B71NOI|3.0|This was my first purchase from Amazon. I wasn't sure what constituted \\"very-good, good or acceptable\\" As for the delivery = VERY good, as for the condition of the CD and DVD = also very-good, as for the condition of the case = not so good, I guess I would rate it \\"acceptable\\" for I did buy the product knowing it was used - I guess people care for their stuff differently than I - not the sellers fault, however the rating for the entire package did not deserve a \\"very good\\" rating. Just my opinion - take it for what it's worth!
0345442970|4.0|If you like Star Wars and haven't read too many of the books, like me, then this story has probably been overlooked. I have found that the author, James Luceno, knows his stuff and has a writing style easy to follow, for even basic SW fans. This story occurs just before The Phantom Menace and is easily more exciting. It shows Palpatine at his manipulative best and Qui-Gon as he should be, a wise and confident Jedi. I've only read a few SW novels, because I don't want to get caught in a long story arc, and if that sounds familiar then add this book to your list.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|This album shows just how much Mastodon has grown over the years. I can't listen to their earlier albums because they lack voice, they're filled with the same crappy vocals, and bag of tricks all metal bands seem to be doing these days. Blood Mountain took a good sized step away from the mediocre screaming, growling, noisy senseless metal. It had theme, dynamism, good singing, and the band seemed to finally get a voice. Crack the Skye is a masterpiece and I sincerely hope they continue in this vein. It has real story, great singing, the incredible musicianship we've always known the band has, and everything just clicks. If I had one complaint it would be that sometimes I want a little of the aggression from Blood Mountain to appear in Crack the Skye. An amazing album.
B001HN6922|3.0|I'm the mother of a four-year-old boy who has seen \\"Cars\\" roughly 2.7 billion times in the past two years he's been watching movies. It was, and is, his favorite film, and even I don't mind hearing it on the endless loop it seems to be on in our minivan DVD player. My son was DYING to see \\"Cars 2,\\" in the theater, \\"with the glasses,\\" and we went this past weekend. (He even knew the opening date from the ubiquitous TV ads and preview trailers on various DVDs and has been talking about this for MONTHS.)<br /><br />To sum up his review: he wanted to leave halfway through to, \\"go home and play Legos.\\" This was his second-ever in-theater movie; first, \\"Tangled,\\" when he was only three, he loved and had no problem sitting through, even with the 3D glasses on.<br /><br />The \\"Toy Story: Hawaiian Vacation\\" short at the beginning was brilliant. Really shows they could do a \\"Toy Story 4,\\" which I guess Tom Hanks recently hinted at, but please spare us a \\"Cars 3.\\"<br /><br />This was a shoot-'em-up spy movie which MAY have worked with another conceit but had nothing to do with the established Cars universe, so why do a second film? The races were secondary (almost pointless), the entire message of friendship and slow-down-and-enjoy-life from the first film was COMPLETELY thrown out the window, and a little of Tow Mater goes a LONG way. Unless you're a rabid Larry the Cable Guy fan, this is an easy wait for the DVD. And if you're child-free, this is a Pixar film you're gonna want to pass on.<br /><br />I agree with the critics: This is Pixar's first failure. (That Oscar streak has definitely come to an end.) Not the worst kids' movie I've ever seen, but I expected far better from Disney and, especially, Pixar. The plot was pointless and silly (and I grew up a rampant James Bond fan), the dialogue lacked the clever repartee of previous Pixar pictures (what usually keeps the adults watching) and it just wasn't very fun at all. Expertly animated, of course, with plenty of \\"cool\\" chases and spy gadgets ... But that's not nearly enough to carry a movie.at's not nearly enough to carry a movie.
0307716511|4.0|Do siblings know one another better than anyone else might?  That is one of the main questions in Rosamund Lupton's first novel, Sisters.<br /><br />Beatrice (Bee)is a Londoner, engaged, and living and working in New York City -- a very conventional life.  Bee's younger sister Tess is an art student in London, living a much more free-and-easy lifestyle.  They have lost a brother to cystic fibrosis, so they are aware that the gene for CF runs in the family.<br /><br />Bee is the only one who knows that Tess is pregnant and unwed -- and that Tess has participated in some testing concerning the CF gene.  Tess's baby is born, but dies almost immediately after birth. One Sunday, Bee gets a call that Tess has gone missing.  Tess is found dead in a Hyde Park toilet several days later.  The coroner and the police rule the death a suicide and see no way the cause could be anything else.  The family and most of Tess's friends accept this ruling. But Bee knows Tess well enough to know that she would not take her own life, under any circumstances.<br /><br />Bee moves into Tess's flat and, in essence, lives Tess's life.  She takes Tess's job, makes friends with Tess's friends, even dresses in Tess's clothes.  She knows something is amiss, and she is determined to find out what really happened, even if it means sacrificing everything. It does, even her relationship with her fiance, and a risk to her own life.<br /><br />I believe that even experienced mystery/thriller readers will be surprised at what happens in this novel and will appreciate the twists and turns and sacrifices that Bee makes.  I give it a 4.5 rather than a 5, however, because Lupton's use of abbreviations for the various ranks in the London police department is a little confusing. (Who is whose boss here?)  I will, however, keep my eyes open for future works by Lupton and can recommend this one.
1400064287|5.0|The brothers Heath have a remarkable knack for simultaneously educating and entertaining their readers.  They've certainly done so with their very memorable book 'Made To Stick'.  This thoughtful book has endless applications. The concepts are practical and straight forward.  Their examples are marvelous. As someone who presents a lot, this book has reinforced for me why some of my presentations are a 'hit' while others are just so-so. It should be no mystery why this book has been such a bestseller....after all, it too has proven itself sticky.       Bill Wiersma, Author--The Big AHA and The Power of Professionalism

B003LSTK8G|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  Michael Lewis has a nice style in how he assimilates characters and fiction style story telling in real life facts and real people.  This book is purely around how some people foresaw the crash of the subprime and profited from it.  It is not meant to tell how and what caused the great recession or any ancillary happenings surrounding that.  At the same time is not going to get into the technicalities of the subprime or the CDSs used to bet against them.  It tells the story about 3 to 4 characters who again saw it coming and made a great deal of money from it.  All in all Enjoyable read...
B0000024K1|5.0|In the mid-80s, one of my best friends since elementary school started listening to rap. He was always blaring tapes of Run DMC, LL Cool J, Ice T, etc. etc. It drove me up the wall, I couldn't stand any of it. I was a hardcore punker who had discovered the joys of metal, and hip-hop sounded completely alien to me. When this album came out my friend virtually krazy-glued it into his tape deck for about two months straight, and I was exposed to it every day. This was the one that was able to get through to me. This album kicked down the wall and kicked my ass, and as a direct result I listened to a lot of hardcore rap for about 5 years. It all ended for me when Dr. Dre went solo and Snoop came out with his overly laid-back low energy/no intensity style and seemingly every other rap artist started aping it. That G funk crap, I can't stand it. I'm currently playing GTA San Andreas for the first time and getting back to my gangsta roots, digging out all of my old rap CDs and checking out some stuff that I ignored back then. Throughout all of it I'm finding that after all these years, It Takes A Nation of Millions is still by far my favorite of the genre. It's angry and abrasive as hell, yet it flows. Like lava out of a volcano.<br /><br />EDIT: (For some reason I feel compelled to mention: When PE's following album came out, Fear Of A Black Planet... I remember liking most of it, but my friend who had introduced me to them dubbed it &#34;Fear Of A Wack Album.&#34; =\)
0062073486|5.0|I stayed up, on a weeknight, until 1 to finish this!<br /><br />Ten people are invited to Soldier Island to stay at the home of Mr. Owen.  But little do they know, a little justice is about to be served.  Who will die next and can they find the killer before the next one dies?<br /><br />Oh.  My.  God.  This book was frakkin' amazing.  I have never been so afraid to go to sleep in my life.  I have never had as crazy dreams as I've had when reading this book.  I have never stayed up so late on a weeknight finishing a book because I knew it would haunt my dreams and dammit, I had to know who was the murderer!<br /><br />If you peruse through many of my book reviews (specifically the ones of thrillers), you will see the complaint: \\"This was a thriller?!\\"  In my opinion, a thriller should be pulse-pounding, look over your shoulder, frantically turn the next page, stay up late into the night finishing the damned book.  Basically, everything that this book IS.<br /><br />The characters were varied.  Sure, they were all sorts of 1930's stereotypes (but the offensive n-word and \\"Indians\\" were dropped from the title/poem), but they were real, from the religious zealot, Miss Brent, to the slimy captain Lombard, to the officious Justice.  I was surprised at how attached I grew to each character (much more than in some more serious character novels I've read), and there were people I desperately hoped to avoid dying.<br /><br />And then we have the mystery, the reason you even read this novel.  Oh.  My.  God.  (Damn, this novel has elicited TWO slow-mo OMG's from me!)  It is slick, it is crafty, it is interesting, and I TOTALLY didn't see it coming.  Every word is a puzzle, a puzzle that you twist and turn and when you finally read the end, you go, \\"Ah ha, so that's how it was done!\\"  Christie says in the author's note how much work it was and how proud of it she was, and I must say, she should be.  I've not read a novel that surprised me like this one ever.<br /><br />I loved the mood of the novel.  I was constantly looking around in my bedroom (at night, big mistake, as I had wickedly weird nightmares one night) as if a murderer would pop out of nowhere.  And I totally feel that this should be more prevalent in thrillers.<br /><br />This novel blew my mind, even more than my previous favorite Christie novel, \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\".  I highly recommend you stop reading my review and hunt down a copy for yourself, so you can start reading!<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

0140120416|5.0|Dear Amazon Reader, I can STRONGLY RECOMMEND this book to all students.  I have been studying Russian for many years, in fact, here in Spain I have been studying it via Spanish-Russian textbooks. I bought this book out of curiosity and  can honestly say it's WONDERFUL.  I  achieved an honours degree from a Russian Course here in Spain, some time ago.(all translations were done from Russian to Spanish and vice versa) So I can honestly say I am trilingual.  I'm saying this - as from this excellent book I bought via Amazon I am still learning new things - especially about the pronunciation.<br /><br />Congratulations to the author of such an excellent book.  The more books one can study on Russian, the better, but this book is a five-star quality one.  This book is a great beginner for any Russian student who starts from scratch.

B004WJRJNQ|5.0|The first CD contains the Bakesale album, and all the extras are on the second CD (62 minutes). These consist of a few demos of Lou Barlow songs with acoustic guitar and lots of worthwhile experiments in musical dissonance, with several of Jason Loewenstein's best contributions to Sebadoh. This second disc alone would be one of my favourite Sebadoh issues. An absolute must for fans and a good way to start an addiction for Sebadoh.

0307477479|2.0|No matter how much I told myself to keep an open heart and a curious mind in order to truly appreciate [[ASIN:0307477479 A Visit from the Goon Squad]], I just couldn't. First I told myself that it was perhaps that the author's style of writing didn't resonate with me and that I was therefore too critical of it. But the more I read the more I felt that this was certainly not worthy of a Pulitzer. Truly! I won't repeat what other reviewers have already said, but I thought it was thoroughly disappointing when there are some gems of novels - one sometimes discovers purely by change - that would deserve more praise and perhaps even a prize but, but never do. The Good Squad obviously had great PR and Pulitzer judges who should be questioned.<br /><br />Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'

It's a long book and very dense, but the payoffs keep coming.<br /><br />The reason given for the \\"time is running out\\" aspect of the novel may be a bit flimsy, but everything else adds right up.

B004KO803G|5.0|Received the mint green vinyl.  Like standing inches away from a grizzly while it roars in your face.  Scary, awesome, awe-inspiring.    The only thing lacking is the absence of a MP3 downland code with the vinyl.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie is a rather simple sci-fi movie. We liked it because it was interesting and entertaining with a relatively good story line.     If you are looking for a well acted and definitive sci-fi movie then you probably should skip this one.   If you want a clear plot then you probably should skip this movie, you have to fill-in a lot of gaping holes in this plot.   If you are a die hard sci-fi fanatic then skip this movie, it is a typical \\"B\\" movie.     The acting is fair, the story line simple and poorly defined by most standards (except for entertainment), full of cliches and not much suspense. The premise behind the story is only brought to light sparingly throughout the movie.     However, if you can overlook all the negatives, this was actually an entertaining movie. It had a cute love story (but cliche ridden), some neat special effects and a good ending.   We rented it from Redbox for a $1 as it is not worth spending $4 on it though.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|With Evangelion 1.11, director Hideaki Anno is well on his way to right the perceived wrongs that occurred at the culmination of the original Evangelion TV-series and 1997's feature film \\"The End of Evangelion.\\" This remake project, beginning with 1.11, promises to take the Evangelion mythos in directions both eerily similar, yet drastically different from its previous incarnation.    This first installment covers the expository story arc from episodes 1-6 of the orgiginal TV series. Its subtle changes in plot, tightening of the script and scores of visual enhancements were refreshing. All of the original animation has been scrubbed and polished and has never looked better.    From a visual and audio standpoint, the blu-ray version of 1.11 is fantastic. At the bargain price for which this blu-ray disc can be had, it's a must buy. Don't even waste your time with the standard DVD version. Sadly, there isn't a lot of substantial bonus material on the disc, but there's no arguing that Funimation's presentation is first-rate.     Plus, what more can I say about Hikaru Utada? The J-pop star delivers in a major way with \\"Beautiful World,\\" a song that rocks the closing credits from start to finish.    Fans left bitter from the first run of Evangelion should pick this up to have their faith restored, as sometimes things really are better the second time 'round.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|Wanted to hear Scorpions pre Mattias Jabs era. I was told Uli John Roth was an awesome guitar player. He did not disappoint. This album rocks for all you hard core Scorpion fans. Klaus Meine sounds today like he did back then. Only wish this band wasn't calling it quits.
B00382X4XC|3.0|First off, R.I.P Ronnie James Dio & thank you for all your music & humility.  This album is definitely a classic HR / Metal album.  But this edition which I recently bought is not worth the money to anyone thinking about shelling out for it.  The 2nd CD of 7 songs (why only 7 anyway) is a headscratcher.  Did we really need 2 live versions each of \\"Children of the Sea\\" & \\"Heaven & Hell\\", why not add different songs.  And the mono version of Lady Evil?  Whoever made the decisions about this release could not have cared much for the actual fans who were gonna be buying it.  And the actual album, sounds not much different than the original release with the volume actually being lower.  Just throwing that info out there to anyone else considering this for a purchase.  Take care people...

B001QB9H10|3.0|Jason Statham returns as wheelman extraordinaire Frank Martin, in The Transporter 3 (2009) the third installment in the high-octane Transporter series.  Written by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita) and Mark Robert Kamen, the film is directed by Frenchman Olivier Megaton (Red Siren).<br /><br />Reality is not a major factor in a Transporter film.  The objective is to arrange a situation where the immaculately dressed Martin has to accomplish a task involving driving a car, and let the man do his thing.  There is usually a hot babe involved, and Martin typically makes a few stops along the way, where some wildly stylized fights, choreographed by the expert Corey Yuen take place.  The only one that Martin usually relies on for help is detective inspector Tarconi (Francois Berleand).  This is the basic setup for the film.<br /><br />After being in Miami for the Transporter 2, Martin has returned to France, and is at home when a car crashes through his house.  The seriously injured driver taken away in an ambulance, but is killed when an explosive bracelet he is wearing, gets too far from his car.  Inside the damaged vehicle is a sullen red-haired Ukrainian woman named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova, in her feature film debut).  Martin and the girl are captured, and taken to a man named Johnson (Robert Knepper), who offers the Transporter a choice between a driving assignment, or a bullet in the brain.  Very shortly Martin is back behind the wheel of his black Audi, with Valentina as a passenger.  Travelling through France bound for some unspecified destination, each has an explosive bracket clamped to their wrist.  Along the way, there are some wild frantic, teeth clenching vehicular maneuvers, spectacularly executed fights, a striptease, and a few fascinating discussions of cuisine.<br /><br />The script delivers mostly what you expect from a Transporter film, comic book action, crazy stunts, stylized quick cut fight choreography with some unusual weapons, and edgy seat of your pants driving.  Like the previous outings, there's not a lot of reality to the plot, as Martin's car rises from being submerged in the middle of a lake, is still fully functional, and later jumps onto a train, and then between moving sections of the train.  Frank's relationship with his buddy Tarconi, is one of the few things that grounds the series.  The soft spoken wheelman usually doesn't get into deep conversations.

Like the previous outings, there's not a lot of reality to the plot, as Martin's car rises from being submerged in the middle of a lake, is still fully functional, and later jumps onto a train, and then between moving sections of the train.  Frank's relationship with his buddy Tarconi, is one of the few things that grounds the series.  The soft spoken wheelman usually doesn't get into deep conversations.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this recording and let me say the DVD audio surround is awesome. What a fantastic mix by George and Giles Martin.  The depth and clarity of the music is superb and unlike any other Beatles recording. I own the 2009 mono box set which is fantastic in it's own right, especially for purist but the high resolution DVD audio  is in a  class by itself. I can only hope that the  recording studios will continue to make DVD audio and SACD.....it makes old music fun again!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is great.  It's small, compact, and easy to take with you compared to some larger ones.  The three sharpening surfaces all work well and it's kept my benchmade sharp after many uses.  Can't go wrong for the price either.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|After reading the mixed reviews for this film I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring and add my thoughts to the collection here.<br /><br />`Sunshine' follows a crew of astronauts and scientists as they embark on a mission to `kick start' the sun again after it goes into shut down. The crew live onboard a ship called Icarus 2 and whilst on their way to fulfil their mission they come across a distress signal from the original Icarus. When they divert to dock with the original ship a whole host of events occur to throw the mission into jeopardy and which they have to try to overcome to reach a successful mission conclusion.<br /><br />Personally I liked this film a great deal and whilst it doesn't have the big actions scenes of other space based films, it certainly has a high degree of tension. Everyone acts very well and you get a real sense of the claustrophobia of living onboard a spaceship and of the harsh decisions needed to be taken to ensure a mission of this type is successful.<br /><br />There is a certain mythical element to the film with some members of the crew becoming entranced by watching the sunlight and the link to the sun and life is highlighted very well indeed.<br /><br />The soundtrack is excellent. It brings certain scenes to a crescendo and is stirring when it should be and quietly emotional at the right times too.<br /><br />The ending is a touch confused, but not excessively so and if you have watched the film closely throughout it is clear enough to bring you to a satisfactory conclusion. I have to admit the ending is the weakest aspect of this film though and some may feel slightly deflated after the excellent preceding 2 hours.<br /><br />All in all I have to say I enjoyed this film immensely and it is easily one you can watch numerous times. It is well thought out, has some great writing and the direction is impressive too. If you have any doubts about whether this is worth a viewing based on some of the more scathing reviews here, all I can suggest is you give it a try and make your mind up for yourself.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.yourself.

0439023521|5.0|Katniss Everdeen is not your typical hero.  She doesn't even want the credit for being one...at first.  After all, any attention she brings to her family could have bad consequences.  Her poaching the nearby forest for food so her family could survive, her slightly insane mother, who hasn't been the same ever since Katniss can remember. Even her fragile little sister who sometimes can't see past her own selfish needs and wants is at risk if Katniss becomes a hero.<br /><br />But it is exactly Katniss's responsibility to accept when she steps up to the Hunger Games in her little sister's place.  Panem is a world hidden in America's future and darkened by such greed, war, murder, mayhem, and a new kind of aristocracy which threatens the security of all its citizens.  In fact, pitting children against one another is an entertaining thing to be watched like the NFL's Superbowl.  And Katniss is thrust into it.<br /><br />She must survive and win for her family the security and protection all survivors of the games have.  To survive she will need more than her hunting and scavenging instincts.  She will need cunning, speed, stamina, and patience.  She'll have to forget her vengance and blindly trust the other contestants from time to time.<br /><br />More than that however, Katniss must find in herself the faith and courage which will make her the hero Panem, her sister, and even American readers need today.<br /><br />This first story will blow you away.  It is exciting, well written and completely surprising.  You may hate the idea of children killing children, but you will discover in Katniss an incredible character worth believing in.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book! First read this around 1996 when it first came out. Just re-read while I watched the first season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" on HBO. Just as good the second time around.<br /><br />Martin is an author that isn't afraid to kill off a cherished hero or show you how good people can make bad choices. This is so much more realistic than your typical fantasy story where everyone lives happily ever after. Can be depressing at times to read but I for one really enjoy seeing the horror of combat and the twisting of values that can occur when characters undergo extreme events and stresses.<br /><br />Good stuff!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Her sound is the same now as it was at the beginning of her career.  Wonderful clear voice singing soulfully about life with a message still relevant to a listener of any era.  Each song is carefully crafted and shows depth of knowledge and musicianship. What a treat to the ear.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Both Eminem and Royce shine on this album. I didn't think Em could up his game up any more after hearing Recovery, but he did. If any rapper could match wits with Em it would be Royce, and he does not disappoint...for the most part. The only verse that Royce is severely lacking in is his verse in \\"The Reunion.\\" That verse was terrible...when a rapper tries to have a conversation in a verse it rarely works. Royces back and forth representing the girl and himself is irritating at best. However, other than that song, every other verse, by both Em and Royce, is pure fire. A highly recommended album for Eminem fans and raps fans alike.
B0012EJVTY|4.0|Made In Japan is one of the most famous and celebrated live albums in music history, it showcases Deep Purple in their MKII line up, riding high on the success of Machine Head and at the peak of their abilities.<br /><br />The album features a selection of tracks from the first three MKII Deep Purple albums in addition to one cover song, and manages to stretch out around an hour and a half despite only containing ten songs; as you can imagine this means that the songs are considerably longer than their original studio versions, full to the brim with jamming and creativity, in addition to a six minute drum solo.<br /><br />The band perform the music with a rare and powerful feeling that makes the songs sound so much bigger, heavier and more energetic... all the musicians are on their best form, nailing their leads and delivering the music with intensity. Subsequently, it is not uncommon for people to say that this is the best live album ever and listening to the absolutely incendiary version of 'Highway Star,' or 'Smoke On The Water,' you will understand why.<br /><br />The sound is very good considering this was recorded on apparently worse equipment than the producer would have liked and there are no overdubs... you just get the live power and energy from Deep Purple at their zenith. How much you enjoy it will depend entirely on whether you think the jamming and additional solos add to or detract from the experience (Space Truckin' extends to almost twenty minutes) but even if you don't care for those aspects, the rest of the album, when the band are playing the songs as written, is spectacular.<br /><br />This is definitely something you'll want to buy if you are a fan or prospective fan of Deep Purple, I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Man, love this game but they should have planned the level releases way better.  It doesn't make me want them more, it frustrates me to the point that I wanna stop playing it.  Just sayin.
B00123KER8|5.0|Deep Purple really are both survivors and masters of reinvention; in 1969 they were a prog and psychedelic influenced band, with three albums under their belt and when they lost their bassist and singer, they went on to hire Roger Glover and Ian Gillan and subsequently create some of the most acclaimed rock music in history.<br /><br />By 1974 however, Roger Glover and Ian Gillan were gone, and with them the direction that their music had taken for the past four albums.<br /><br />Rather than be slayed by this, Deep Purple hired David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes, and went on to record Burn, one of the best albums in their whole career. Burn saw the band insert huge slices of both funk and soul into their sound, now with a dual singer mechanic and write some of their most enduring material to date.<br /><br />Not only are the new members hungry and determined, but the core of the band is revitalised... Ian Paice's already brilliant drumming reached new levels of creativity and power, while Jon Lord's keyboard style began to incorporate radically different sounds and styles. Add to that Ritchie Blackmore playing guitar like he is trying to prove a point and you have a seriously powerful and creative group, firing on all cylinders and delivering the performance of a lifetime.<br /><br />Tracks like the explosive opener `Burn,' the grooving and soulful `Sail Away,' and the timeless `Mistreated,' are must hear material for anyone with the slightest interest in Deep Purple or even rock music in general.<br /><br />Burn may not sound like `Hush,' and it may not sound like `Smoke On The Water,' but don't let that allow you to miss out on one of the best albums the band ever released. Highly recommended !
B000A59PMO|5.0|I'm 26 yr old female, just watched all seasons through Netflix, and I absoloutely LOVE this show and the characters. This is hands down my favorite tv series yet!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG!!!! Just finished reading this book on my Kindle! This was an awesome Novel! I can not wait for the Movie to come out next year! I am now reading Book Two, Catching Fire and it is also hard to put down! If you are looking for a great read this one is for you!
B004EPYZOO|3.0|Well well well, what can I say.  It is over the top, it`s cast have werry foul mouths and it gets a bit dumb at times.  But here is the thing; the movie is verry entertaining even though it is over the top.   Piper (Amber Heard) is the coolest and most kick-as carecter I`ve seen in years, and becouse of that I`m a fan of Amber now, and the funny thing is that she is the most normal one of them all.  Mason (Nic Cage) is a verry bad man who have died and gone to Hell. Enough said. Now Nic, he delivers a good preformance as allways.  The other carecters don`t stand out much.  I had funn and I have seen the movie 10 times allreddy.
1594744769|3.0|enjoyed the book esp the pics that fell in place would love to know who people in pics were enchanting passing it on to young niece  just one comment to editor--when jakob met emma she tied him up before entering house- in next paragraph  before he enters house she makes him take off his shoes and roll up his pants legs-next paragraph they walk in house and he's tied up
B0034G4ORC|4.0|A simple but good story, superb effects and eccelent acting.  A normal day for Staff sargent Nants turns in to a nightmare for him and his marines.  What makes this movie cool however is this; it`s so realistic it could acctualy happen.  I like it aspeccially becouse when the marines fight, the aliens don`t have foarsfealds and are imposiblel to kill, they do die but so do the marines.  I aspecially like Michelle Rodriques`s carecter. She becomes the hart of the team.  If you like sy-fy, action and drama, then this will be the new adition to you`re shelf.  No really!
B00506NRBS|4.0|It's a very nice book. I'd met Derek in Business of Software 2010 when he talked about CD Baby. This book is a detailed version of that presentation. For me, nothing new but it was nice to revisit his story.<br /><br />As another review says: \\"In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have\\".
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beatiful Disaster was an incrediable book. From the beging I was hooked. The charcters in the book were real and believable. Abby a.k.a pigeon (was one of the main charcters in this book and the story is told from her prospective), was romanticly involed n two relationships protrayed through out  this book.She was smart,witty,and knew what she wanted.Travis a.k.a Trav was after her from the start.During this story he loses his womanizing behavoir to capture her heart. America a.k.a Mer is Abby's best friend.She was a fiecty charcater who was dating she shepply a.k.a shep ( who is also travises cousin ), they also expreinece sum relationship ups and downs.All and all this was a good book with a great story line that takes you through the lives of Abby and Travis and their past that they were despritely trying to forget.I was brought to tears at various parts of this book.
B004LTB5OG|5.0|I thought I had already reviewed this album, but glancing at it, I see that I hadn't. I bought this album when it first came out, and I've listened to it a lot of times since. There are few albums that I don't get tired of after 3 or 4 listens, but this just keeps impressing me. The music is great. The playing is great. This is Pendragon at their best (of course, I think all of their albums are Pendragon at their best). I also agree with the previous reviewer that it would be hard to treat any of the tracks as separate. The album is a whole, and the pieces flow into each other. I also love the little hat tips to classic Yes, and even I think Mike Oldfield at one point. Nick Barrett and company deserve far more recognition than they get. I would rank them among the all time best progressive rock groups that I've heard.
B003UESJFG|2.0|The blu-ray disc was defective and i returned.  the player could never go to the menu...screen went black after \\"loading\\"    i returned for refund.    2 stars because Amazon was gracious and expeditious in the return and refund.
B002HWUU2C|5.0|The Strict Joy album is, in a word, excellent and the bonus live cd is a real treat for fans of Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova!  The bonus concert dvd has some songs that are different than the ones on the live cd and it is truly a gift for fans of this duo!  It is edited with the back story of how Glen & Marketa started their musical careers and how they got together to form swell season and to make the album, Strict Joy.  I hope they continue to make music together.  They are both so talented and work so well together.  Their music is divine live or recorded!!!!
B0015GDVTU|4.0|Wow, this movie isn't what I expected or thought it would be. I thought it would be a real tear jerker, extremely sad. I was wrong. This is definitely a must see movie. Ends on a great note and has great messages throughout the entire movie.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is the rare concert DVD that any Queensryche fan could write a book about. The hardest part is being brief enough to fit the short format that Amazon allows. But I'll do my best...    Musically, the Operation Mindcrime CD was just about perfect. The refreshing intelligence of this band was something that rock fans longing for something with a bit more depth than the \\"party all night\\" subgenre were ready for. And they nailed it almost out of the chute. When they made Mindcrime, a progressive rock legend masterpiece was born.     A great album that tied in a plot worthy of a big budget film with high level musicianship and brilliant songwriting, Mindcrime was the kind of album you could listen to over and over and get something new from it each time. Thanks to the storytelling hints interspersed in between and in the songs, you might also get a new twist in the plot each time. 23 years after it's release and hundreds of album purchases since it's release, I still pop Mindcrime in to my car CD player periodically. And every so often, I catch something I hadn't heard before.    The reason I brought up the CD is that the DVD could have easily been a letdown. The band surely had reached a creative pinnacle with the record. Surely doing a live concert film version would have trouble living up to that standard. And yet the DVD was even better...    The picture quality even in the age of LED technology is fantastic as is the sound. The band's performance in this show is spot on. The visuals could easily have been distracting but they actually add to the show as intended, giving you a better idea of the story behind the album. Tate's vocals are incredible. Wilton and Garmo are great individually and even better together, with the brilliant guitar harmonies they have made famous making my ears happier than ever because I get to watch them do it on video. Scott Rockenfield is a jackhammer with impeccable timing and one of the best drummers I have ever seen or heard. The band is at this point relatively seasoned and melds their sound perfectly live. The interview with Geoff Tate is even great, and the \\"Complete Story\\" Bonus Feature fills in some blanks if you didn't quite get the story when you listened to the album the first 900 times, like me.    I still love Queensryche, but I am less fond of their newer work. I think DeGarmo was a big loss to the songwriting capability of the band. I am very grateful for this DVD as I can see what I consider one of the greatest bands in rock history play a perfect album, perfectly. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this purchase.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|Ok it's Limp Bizkit, what do you expect?  I expect cheesy lyrics, pretty bad vocals but good guitar and heavy beats and that's what you get with Gold Cobra.  Feeling angry about something?  Put this cd on in your car and go for a drive.  You probably won't be listening to this album in 6 months from now, I know I won't but it will serve it's purpose for a little bit until I listen to something else.  Title track is pretty cool, the rest just sort of runs together and sounds pretty good loud when you are alone.  As soon as someone else is with you, they point out how bad the lyrics are and it ruins it for ya.  3/5.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Very good digital remastering on this classic Beatle album. I've been searching for this for a long time it is also known as \\"Beatles 65\\". Great music  2 songs stand out;  \\"Honey Don't\\" great rendition of the legend Carl Perkins with Ringo on vocals along with; \\"Everybody's trying to be my baby\\" good work!!!  Mr. Moonlight is a must for the Beatle collection, In my opion this is some of the best early work of the Beatles yet, another LENNON & McCartney great. This will live forever.
B000UNYJXQ|3.0|Sicko, 2007 film<br /><br />The movie begins with a man sewing up a cut on his leg. Another man cut off two finger tips on a table saw. Fifty million Americans have no health insurance. We meet a married couple who have health insurance, but heart attacks and cancer cost them their home. A 79-year old man works for his medicine. In 2006 Michael Moore began collecting horror stories about health care. You can't get health insurance if you have many, many diseases (such as a heart problem or diabetes). What if you have health insurance? You can still have a problem. Denial letters are rubber-stamped to keep a denial rate that is measured. Insurance companies look for ways to deny coverage to their customers. Physicians are rewarded for denying care, even if it results in a patient's death.<br /><br />Nixon speaks about health care; there was a trick here. Clinton tried to create Universal Health Care, but was defeated. Health Insurance companies have more lobbyists than there are Congressmen. Drug companies also buy Congressmen to get laws passed. George W. Bush raised costs for Medicare patients. The film explains the advantages of the Canadian Health System. Canadians must buy health insurance when they travel to America! &#34;Even for a day.&#34; Those who need help get it right away in Canada. Canadians live three years longer on average. There is a flat charge for prescription drugs in Britain. No fee for medical services. We see how the &#34;Cashier&#34; office works in Britain. You get carfare. Democracy brought National Health Services to Great Britain in 1948, just after World War II. People in Britain are healthier than in America. [Is this part of political oppression in America? To keep people demoralized?] There is a horror story where a child was refused treatment and then died.<br /><br />We hear about medical care in France and its system. Doctors make house calls. Five weeks of paid vacation there. They explain the reason why: the government is afraid of the people, not the other way around. Moore interviews a family about their life in France. [No mention of taxes. Moore needs to push himself away from &#34;Freedom Fries&#34;.] Back in Los Angeles we see how patients are dumped by the County Hospital when they can't pay their bills. In some places in America people help each other when in need (an old tradition). Volunteers who helped on 9/11 were denied health benefits. Insurance companies did this because the system works that way. Do the prisoners at Guantanamo get better treatment that people in America? [Moore is very clever in his examples.] Free universal health care in Cuba has the benefits of lower infant mortality and greater life expectancy (the two are linked).<br /><br />Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. Authenticated events are often recreated for the camera. I think this movie would be better if it concentrated on Canada instead of foreign countries with different languages and cultures. Before 1945 America was the exemplar for personal liberty, but that has changed. Now many European countries are more advanced in personal rights because of their politics. The lack of universal health care correlates to political oppression (low wages and high taxes) since the end of World War II.<br /><br />The novels of Michael Biehl tell about medical care (fictionalized reality).er way around.

B0001MDQ6W|5.0|This was a beyond awesome show. I've read alot of bad reviews, and you have to really be into Dylan's music and lyrics. Understanding his music is the key. I did research and found out that his best buddy is Tom Petty and the sun glasses Bob wears on stange are from a Roy Orbison gift when he passed on. I recommend this to anyone that is into Dylan's lyrics. Make sure it's played with a good sound system, very good acustic music. My favorite is \\"Dignity\\" Great show, Thank you Bob Dylan and I'll cya in Vegas. Not bad for a old man like me. I'd like to find a Petty acustic concert DVD, no luck yet. I'm gonna go watch it again and play along, DYLAN is the MAN !!!!

0553386794|5.0|This is the first book in the Fire and Ice series. My goal this summer was to read all four books leading up to the new release of the book 5 coming out in five days, but that is not going to happen.<br /><br />However, this review is going to get straight to the point. THE BEST SCI-FI/FANTASY BOOK EVER!!! I would place Terry Goodkind first book in the Sword of Truth series right up there. Now I just need to get going and read book two.<br /><br />There is nothing I can write about this book that has not already been written about a thousand times and better than what I could do online.<br /><br />All I am saying is that this was the most enjoyable 800 pages of reading I have had in a long time. I bought book two and need to read it before school starts.<br /><br />Need I say more? Go read this book and be ready to embark on an amazing journey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put down my kindle. Before I knew it, the book was over itching me to continue to the next book. I loved the intensity and passion in both Katniss and Peeta. I hope book two has delivered via whispernet already!
0345522478|3.0|I was excited for this book when I saw the initial story description and having finished it I find myself seeing it as a hit and miss kind of offering.  There are some great ideas which I liked very much, but also some thing that made me cringe and want to slap the narrator and occasionally the author.  :P<br /><br />On a positive note I do like the pacing of the book and the wit.  The widow McDunna was a complete crack up, and I like the use of the Irish mythos in a way that wasn't over done, even if it was a bit simplistic.  The explanation of why Atticus is in Arizona and what he's chosen to do with his life makes sense to me, as does his desire to play keep away from a God that wants his head.  The relationship with Oberon is good, though I do find some of the things Oberon says to be so far out of a dog's realm of understanding that it throws me out of the story.  I think if there had been more information making Oberon a specific familiar with thoughts outside of doggie comprehension that it would have made better sense, but he's just a dog who has been affected by being around Atticus.  For me that doesn't make the jump to understanding traumatized Toto or citrus air fresheners.<br /><br />I do not like how Atticus thinks and acts like an oversexed frat boy.  Sex doesn't bother me.  Sex with at least two goddesses and being lusted after by others...well...kinda par for the course for the genre.  Many of the heroes and heroines of UF are attractive to all sorts of folks, even if the hero/ine themselves are described as being plain or otherwise not overly attractive.  So it's a little Gary Stu, but dealable with.  I despise the interactions with the EMTs and the portrayal of the same.  If you are 2100 years old and as smart as Atticus is supposed to be using power you don't have to give an EMT a wedgie twice is just plain stupid and arrogant.  And I can see setting up problems with authority, again very typical, but when you get into medical folk, in particular EMTs, you're dealing with people who work stupid hours responding to people when their lives have gone to crap.  Very rarely do you find an EMT who is a jerk and even more rarely do they sit there and bicker details versus HELPING the person involved.  It's not their job to determine the legitimacy of a wound, it's their job to save lives and treat the hurt.  People who are into a job for the power over other people don't become paramedics, EMTs or other emergency personnel.  It's fine to keep up with the times and be hip, I don't have a problem with that.  But there is a difference between acting young and keeping up appearances and thinking like a teenager.  2100 years worth of experience should, in theory, also bring with it a bit of wisdom and tolerance, Atticus shows neither.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of comparisons with Jim Butcher, and I'd say Herne has some of the same flow, but it's definitely Butcher lite.  I'm willing to give him a couple of books to hit his stride, I'm not so turned off that I won't pick up another one, but it could go either way for me right now.  I want to see that up with the times Druid with power and a nifty sword and a soft spot for an Irish widow, but I want to see him tempered by the years he's lived and to show wisdom through humor.  Otherwise what's the point of him being a 2100 year old Druid instead of a newbie, except that he gets to make esoteric historical references?aling with people who work stupid hours responding to people when their lives have gone to crap.

B004A8ZX32|4.0|For one, I will say that I only rated the movie so highly because, photographically, it is the most brilliant film I have ever seen! If you're in to eye candy, then you won't be let down.     That being said, I guess to aloofness and abstractness of the story somewhat intrigued me, but I certainly wasn't moved by this film. I mean, the film is bold, because it is, from what I comprehend, EXTREMELY relgious. Therefore I--not being even a spiritual person, let alone religious--don't think I was the target audience. I didn't quite get what Penn's character was trying to find through his reflections, and I also didn't much get why Penn was in the film, being that he was only on screen for around fifteen minutes.    In short, the film isn't bad, it's just not for everybody. I enjoyed it for the visual and musical aspects, but the story is absolutely beyond me, and is kind of a let down for me since it is indeed very pretentious upon Mailick's personal beliefs. If this comes out in IMAX, though, you know I'll be there!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Always have liked this movie for my kids. They love it. I sit and watch it with them everytime. It a funny movie. Thanks
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This anthology is a must have for any true fan of the Alien franchise. The movies alone at the visual quality they are in on these blu-ray discs are worth the price paid. Add to that the complete wealth of information contained on the bonus discs and you have a deal that can't be passed up!
B002ZG975Q|3.0|I saw this movie at The Cinema with my daughter and I thought it could have been better. It is a nice story and not dull or boring. The boy that gets the spell cast on him looks more like some guy who got tatooed all over than a beast.....But..I always liked the myth that someone can like or fall in love with someone ..not by what they look like..but because of who they are...Wouldn't it be nice if it was really true? If not born beautiful, or handsome..one is shunned..made fun of and for what? because they do not fit the Ideal of what is acceptable and they cannot help how they look..if they have thin hair or bad teeth or too tall....I think all people should look more closely and see that beauty is more inside than out...
B00005RZV4|5.0|When I saw this concert on dvd it set a new concert video bar for me. They had their own camera men for the video but also handed out recorders to some audience members over several shows.  The video is always moving sometimes blending several performances in one song and feels raw and exciting.  This is such a great set list for a show and the sound is incredible.  Tho Trent is the Mozart his band is tight and smokin. The band is so good it made my jaw drop the first time I saw it.  I love these live versions and in most cases better than the originals.  I didn't know this whole set list so I had to go and pick up some cds of his back catalog. He plays most instruments on the originals and while those versions are great they sound more like seeds to this.  These songs just sound more well worn and mature here.    If you get a chance check out the the behind the scenes on the dvd. If you're a musician you owe it to yourself to keep an eye on this guy. He's doing some incredible things to help reshape the music market place and he seems to really care about his fans.  This is such an easy recommendation and a great introduction to Nine Inch Nails early catalog.  I have the dvd and just recently picked up the cd.  The CD sounds awesome.  The best live show I own, hands down.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Avatar is the most amazing movie i have ever seen and i do not grow tired of watching it....The extended 3rd version is outstanding with all the added scenes and makes more sense such as the part Grace tells what happened to the school..The color etc is awesome also...I wish there would have been more romance between Jake and Neytiri..not just the one part..when i watched the Theater version,,,I wondered if Jake and Neytiri had sex and how they did it..or if The Avatars even were cabable of such....I thought Neytiri was rather shallow..she doesn't care if Jake dies when The Military is attacking..but cause he rides The Last Shadow, then she likes him again...I was sad that trudy got killed but I was happy The Colonel got his end..and Grace...I wondered why trudy did not wait to start up the helicopter until everyone had gotten in it....If only they would have added the scenes they show on the extra disk...such as..before Jake becomes one of The People..it shows him having to eat something..and another scene where they were dancing and another that i think they werte getting drunk...why didn't they finish those scenes and let us see all of it in the movie? Anyway..This is a movie no one will ever forget...
B002ZG975Q|3.0|In my opinion, everything in this movie progressed too fast or was solved too easily. For example, one minuted Lindy hates \\"Hunter\\" and the next, she's infatuated with him. It happens too suddenly to be realistic, even for a fairy tale. The book goes into much more detail, and while I realize the movie writers couldn't include every for the sake of time, they seemed to have left out key elements. It's always nice to see love triumph over adversity, but if there's no challenge, who cares? I strongly suggest reading the book before, or instead of, seeing the movie.<br />[[ASIN:0061963283 Beastly Movie Tie-in Edition]]

B004RL0AWQ|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />Oh wow. Just wow. I think Kiss of Snow is maybe my favourite of the Phy-Changeling series. If I could grant higher rating than 5, I'd do it. I literally just finished it and I want to go back and re-read it right now. So much good stuff happened in Kiss of Snow.<br />Without revealing spoilers, the things that stuck out for me in Kiss of Snow are listed below.<br /><br />Yeah for Lara, the pack healer, and Walker<br />Sascha and Lucas have their baby!!<br />You get more insight regarding Sascha's mom Nikita<br />A Cryogenic spin<br />The Pure Phy war against the changelings<br />The wonders of the mysterious X Phy ability<br />Who is the Ghost dammit!?<br />and hmm what else happens? OH yeah! Hawke and Sienna finally, finally get together!<br /><br />I totally loved the build-up of Hawke and Sienna becoming a couple in Kiss of Snow. It was so worth the journey. Sienna is a great combination of being young at 19 yet mature beyond her years. It was a great display of age balance. She acted young and immature with trying to make Hawke jealous (such a young person's approach) yet so mature with her knowledge of military tactical maneuvers. I also loved how slowly Nalini Singh built up their intimate coupling but wow, when they did get together it was some powerful let me tell you!<br /><br />The Pure Phy war climax in Kiss of Snow is spectacular. I read it so fast that this speed is one of the reasons I want to re-read it again so quickly after finishing. I was clicking my pages so fast because I couldn't absorb it fast enough. Simply excellent!<br /><br />The X Phy ability is very mysterious. Even for the Phy society the X Phy are a bit of an unknown. Judd and Sascha were trying really hard to research any information about the X but it seems the only known information about X was researched by a human scientist over 100 years ago. (Very interesting how they solve that problem)<br /><br />Because Kiss of Snow just was recently released in hardcover some people may not have read it yet. I just purchased on Kindle and yowsa the price was expensive however I couldn't wait. I see that on Nalini Singh's website there is another book scheduled for 2012 and that can't come soon enough. Any opinions on who the Ghost is? I am at a loss. Who I thought the Ghost was in the earlier books didn't turn out so now I really don't know. Any wild guesses?ust purchased on Kindle and yowsa the price was expensive however I couldn't wait.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|J.J. Abrams has not made a lot of films, but each film has been very good, embracing the genre and giving fans something to celebrate. Even \\"Mission Impossible III\\", derided because of Cruise's shenanigans, was very good, better than the first two installments. But each film has been a stepping stone. Considering the quality of these films, the possibility of a filmmaker of Abrams' skill and caliber working on a personal project has been tantalizing.<br /><br />Now, with \\"Super 8\\", Abrams makes a film based on his own idea. He blends all of his superlative filmmaking skills with a personal story and the effort is almost magical. \\"Super 8\\" is by far the best film I have seen this year. And it will take a lot for a new film to take this position away. It just may end up as the best film of the year.<br /><br />Set in small town Ohio, in 1979, a group of kids gets together to make a film using their super 8 cameras. Originally a zombie film, the director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), a pudgy kid from a large, noisy family, decides his magnum opus needs more drama, so he enlists the help of Alice (Elle Fanning), who his friend and cameraman, Joe (Joel Courtney) has a crush on. The whole group sneaks out at midnight and heads to the local train station. As a train approaches, Charles shouts for the crew to get ready, he wants to capture the \\"production value\\" of the train speeding by. But a truck soon appears and begins driving directly for the locomotive. The kids watch in horror as the truck crashes into the train and the whole thing derails. They run for their lives, trying to escape the carnage. As the dust begins to clear, they realize there have been no injuries amongst them and run off just as ominous government agencies begin to arrive to do the clean-up. Charles and Joel also find the camera. It is broken, but they decide to develop the film anyway. Over the next few days, Joel's dad, Jackson, the Sheriff (Kyle Chandler) begins to realize something strange is going on; dogs begin to disappear, then his boss is missing, then the government steps in and gives him a story about the train wreck. Jackson confronts Nelec (Noah Emmerich), the leader of the army's 'clean-up' efforts. Just as the rumors begin to fly, and stories of mysterious sightings begin to circulate, the town is evacuated because of a wild fire. Joel and his friends try to escape to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />From the moment \\"Super 8\\" begins, you know you are in for something special. Abrams sets the film in 1979 which also seems to be a homage to the sort of film his mentor, and producer of the film, Steven Spielberg made during the same period. Everything about the film seems authentic and real. People are wearing new Walkmans. The clothes and cars are all period specific. The attitudes are even a little more innocent. Even better, when Abrams decides to feature some new-fangled item, like the Walkman, for instance, it becomes a part of the story. This takes the moment from being a simple wink-wink nudge-nudge type of thing and shows how clever Abrams really is. It is very easy to make a visual reference like this. It is much more difficult to make it a believable part of the story. Abrams always does the more difficult and makes it work.<br /><br />Charles is part of a large, noisy family who seems to be bursting out of the walls of their house. Yet, there is always room for Joe at the table. Joe and Charles are best friends and this helps to make the film seem even a little more nostalgic. In fact, there seem to be more similarities in this film to Spielberg's \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" than to the oft-mentioned \\"E.T.\\". Charles large family and their crowded dinner table are similar to the Neary family's. At one point, an electrician is fixing a power line. He stands in the bucket on his truck and rises toward the junction box. Roy Neary was also an electrician who is trying to fix massive power outages. \\"Close Encounters\\" is set in Indiana, \\"Super 8\\" in Ohio, Both feature people from small town America dealing with something they could never have imagined.<br /><br />The real key to the success of \\"Super 8\\" is the kids. Everyone of them gives a good performance and really raises the bar for future child actors. Joel Courtney plays Joe, the son of the local Sheriff. A family tragedy puts a strain on the relationship between the two and Joe escapes the pressures of his everyday life with his large group of friends. Courtney is just so natural, so at ease, he never seems like he is acting. He deals with his grief, with his dad, with the drama in his town like anyone his age would. They escape into the making of their film. Joe is also extremely nervous when Charles announces he has asked Alice to act in the film because he has a huge crush on Alice and becomes a bit tongue-tied. Joe becomes the hero of the film, fighting every inch of the way to find out what is going on and then fighting to end the problem. It is a very good, richly observed performance. More amazing, this is Joel Courtney's first film.<br /><br />Riley Griffiths plays Charles, the director of the film the kids are working on. It is difficult to tell for sure, but I will bet that this character is closely modeled after Abrams when he was a kid. Charles is a funny guy; his face always buried in a movie magazine, thinking of new scenes, new ideas to make their film that much better. He has clearly read everything he could possibly get his hands on and relishes every bit of it, even the stuff he doesn't completely understand. At the train station, he walks around framing the picture with his hands; he seems obsessed with capturing 'production values', like the real train passing. When they retrieve the camera after the wreck, they take the film to the local photo shop and send it away to be processed. His performance is funny, but not overly jokey; he is just a normal kid who loves everything about filmmaking. More amazing, this is Riley Griffith's first film as well.<br /><br />Elle Fanning, the veteran of the group, is very good. Alice seems intrigued to be involved in the film, but she is also asked to help provide the transportation for the group, which puts her on edge when the Sheriff's son shows up. She doesn't have a driver's license and is afraid of getting into trouble. But Joe quickly puts her at ease. When they arrive at the train station, they are all amazed by her acting ability. Throughout the course of the film, she and Joe spend a lot of time together and become closer and their relationship provides many sweet innocent moments to the film.<br /><br />The rest of the kids are all great. Each is different, fun and unique.<br /><br />Kyle Chandler does a great job as Jackson, the man who is a Sheriff first and a dad to Joe second. He quickly realizes something is going on and becomes even more determined to figure things out when he meets Nelec and realizes they aren't telling him the whole truth. His town is experiencing something big, and it consumes him, so it takes him a while to realize his son is getting into mischief. But when he does, he quickly puts a stop to it. Then he becomes busy again, leaving Joe to his own devices. The relationship between the two is not good, and hasn't been good for a long time. Then, the family tragedy only pulls them further apart. Chandler does a very good job of showing us all of the different responsibilities Jackson is dealing with.<br /><br />Toby Emmerich adds another shady government/ villain-type role to his resume. The role is good, believable and suitable for the story. But the character actor has played this role before, many times.<br /><br />Ron Eldard plays Louis, Alice's no-good dad. Louis is haunted by many demons and adds complexity to the film.<br /><br />The real beauty of \\"Super 8\\" is that Abrams is simply a great filmmaker. He seems determined to make films in which he reveals as little as possible about the creature/ monster/ alien/ threat to the main characters as possible. In \\"Cloverfield\\", a film he helped write and produce, the threat is viewed in brief snippets, often in grainy cell phone or camcorder footage. For the majority of the film, you never see it fully. This does two things. It makes the menace more believable and it creates more suspense. Because we can't see the whole thing, we are less likely to find fault in it, or to disbelieve in the existence of it. Also, because the threat is revealed in small, fleeting moments, we are never sure when it will show up. I know some people don't like this film, but the cinema verite style, the unknown cast and the snippets of footage of the creature all served to create a memorable monster film.<br /><br />Abrams continues this same sort of idea in \\"Super 8\\". The threat to this small town is not revealed for a long time. But to maintain suspense, we see bits of what it can cause. Joe watches through small, high windows as things fly into the air. The electrician watches things happening in a maintenance building in the distance. Even when we are placed close to the action, Abrams uses some fairly brilliant methods to hide the identity of the threat.<br /><br />When everything starts to fall into place and we realize what is going on, it all makes sense and we are committed to the ride because we have spent so much time in this universe, with these characters.<br /><br />It is also unusual (unfortunately) for a summer film to capture any emotion, let alone anything that could seem real and move us. In \\"Super 8\\", Abrams sets up the story with a sad event, which helps to inform us of the relationship between Joe and Jackson. And throughout the story, we see how strained their life together is, how difficult. And this all leads to a very emotional moment, which I confess, made me tear up.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Super 8\\" has moments that are funny, scary, suspenseful, exciting, dramatic and more. It has everything. Better yet, everything seems necessary to the characters and the story.<br /><br />A couple of weeks before the film was released, I watched the trailer for \\"Super 8\\" before another highly anticipated summer film. After the trailer, someone mumbled \\"E.T., phone home\\" causing some laughter. But this remark is more of a compliment than a dig. Abrams has captured the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder Elliot and his brother and sister experience in \\"E.T.\\" And because of this, he captures the same sort of innocence, the same sort of wonder for us to relive.<br /><br />If it sounds like I am gushing, I am.

0061784788|5.0|I have been a fan of James Rollins for over five years.  I have read every book he has published.  It has been interesting and fun to watch him mature as a writer.  The Devil Colony is the best yet.  I can hardly wait to see where we go next.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I believe that this album is exactly what the fans need right now.  I have to say I have been on the fence about B for a while now but I fully believe this is the best album to come out this year by far.  It has a \\"throwback\\" feeling to it.  I think that it is more developed and more true to form for Beyonce than anything she has created of recent.  An album with more than 3 tracks that get repeat plays is pretty stellar this day in time.  I do however disagree with the reviews that state \\"Girls\\" is not worth a listen.  Crank the volume and try it again.  I definitely would give this album a listen.  To me this is a must buy.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|It is really fascinating to see the wide range of reviews for a movie.  You would almost wonder if everyone actually saw the same movie.  I'm not going to write an extensive review because, with all the reviews before mine, I probably wouldn't be adding anything that wasn't already discussed.<br /><br />I have a personal gauge for whether or not I enjoy a movie.  It depends on how quickly time seems to go by during the movie.  I've sat through what I thought were bad movies that seemed to go on forever.  For the good ones, time seems to fly by.  This movie falls into the latter category for me.  My wife picked it because it was set in Venice, Italy, and we will be traveling there in a couple of months.  When we started watching the movie, it was early evening and still light outside.  At the end, it was completely dark outside.  I looked around and couldn't believe it was so dark.  I was completely caught up in the movie.<br /><br />If you're looking for a really deep plot, you probably will be disappointed.  Watch the movie with the idea of just having a good time and maybe you'll get lost in it as I did.  And I loved the ending!
B003UESJH4|5.0|If you haven't seen The King's Speech yet, for God sakes, what are you waiting for? I saw it in the theater before any hype. And just got/re-watched it on DVD twice in two days. Like most films, the less you knowing going in, beyond some basic history, the better. A few great things about this movie in addition to what others might have said is the wonderful father-daughter relationship. As Gary Shandling of all people said so eloquently in a father's day tweet: \\"if you are a dad, and are doing a good job, I congratulate and respect you. We all know a real man is someone who can give love he never got.\\"<br />I also loved the use of light and lighting in this film and found it necessary to have a quiet, uninterrupted viewing to really appreciate all the subtleties. This film is filled with humor, which is often delivered, like the main character himself, in a quiet, understated, yet powerful way.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Have savored every episode and can't wait for season four to begin on 7-17.   This series is by far the best thing I've seen on TV in a long time.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I'll admit it ... I've never cared much for Emma. Neither the book or any of the other movie versions made previously. I always thought she was a rude, stuck up snob and quite frankly that Knightley deserved better.     After watching this miniseries I have realized that I missed all the subtleties of Miss Austen's amazing creation. I also realized that because I didn't read the book until AFTER I had seen the other two movies that I approached it already believing that I knew what it was. I, like Emma actually, was quite small minded and prejudiced!     For instance I had never understood the true dynamics of Emma's relationship with her father (who it turns out is quite the hypochondriac ... who knew?). His overprotectiveness has kept Emma in quite a small world thus giving us insight into her rather narrow minded beliefs about people and the world. But it is also a relationship of great love and her care of her Father gave her, in my mind, her first redeeming quality.     The storyline with Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill was always so incredibly confusing to me. When did they meet? Why was their engagement a secret? Why did he act like he wanted Emma? Why was Jane always so reserved and quiet? And most importantly why were we supposed to care about any of it? I just never got their point. That is until this miniseries highlighted the incredible paralell between the lives of Jane, Frank and Emma herself. All losing mothers at such a young age. And finally I understood their relevance. FINALLY I got it!! I appreciated how we see that even though they were playing everyone else for fools, their secret relationship took a toll on Frank and Jane. Because of that I enjoyed watching their joy at finally being free to dance in the square.     Every character was fleshed out. Every storyline was told with precision. I could see the joy, heartache, laughter and light in each and every scene. And I realized with a shock that the story of Emma is actually fun and funny.Thanks mostly to the inspired comic one liners of Austen's most underrated Hero - Mr. Knightley! One of my favorites from his early argument with Emma over Harriet Smith and Robert Martin ... \\" Really, it is better to be without wits than to apply them as you do, Emma!\\" And his little fist punch and growl of frustration because she's so thick headed. I was rolling I tell you. ROLLING! Or after watching Mr.Elton ride away to London with Emma's portrait of Harriet, \\"That man is so full of himself it's a wonder he can stay on that horse.\\" And even during his tender and overly late pronouncement of his feelings to Emma \\"If I loved you less perhaps I could talk about it more!\\" was delivered so perfectly as to evoke a chuckle and a sigh at the same time.       But nothing was as impressive to me as Emma's progression as a character, from a self centered, narrow minded, snobbish and spoiled rich girl to kind, thoughtful and maturing young woman. In the end she is not perfect but she, finally, is at last aware. We leave the story knowing that Emma will always be who she is. She'll always have strong thoughts and definite opinions and she will always try to manage those that she loves. She may even find herself being an occasional snob and making quick judgements that come back to bite her in the butt. Yet we also know that she's enough of a woman to admit when she's wrong and learn from her mistakes. Best of all she's a woman who knows her heart. And who has managed to marry the one man in all the world who could manage her!      So for all you Jane Austen fans out there who, like me, felt incredibly disloyal for disliking her supposedly favorite heroine, for just not \\"getting\\" it ... This movie is for you. It brings Emma to life, giving it shades and depth. It highlights everything that was important and builds on it to the point were all you can see is the good.     I'll go to bed tonight seeing Emma and Knightly standing arm and arm on the cliffs overlooking the oceanand finally will feel like I'm happy that they found their way there together.

0064407667|5.0|Daniel Handler aka Lemony Snicket really hit his stride in the third and fourth book of his darkly hilarious series, but the ingredients are all already in place at \\"THE BAD BEGINNING\\". These books are for smart and different children, they're basically one long starter course in irony. Where Harry Potter readers are lured into a fantasy world that is sadly void of sarcasm, the Baudelaire orphans go through one scene after another that prepares their followers for early hipsterdom. Complicated words? Bring them on. Grotesquely evil villains? Don't mind if I do! These books breathe the spirit of Edward Gorey drawings, Tom Waits songs and Tim Burton movies, all the while maintaining their very own, deliciously dark sense of wonder. If your child can't get excited about Pokémon, asks a few too many inquisitive questions and won't wear those adorable pink outfits, you have a potential Snicket-fan on your hands. Highly recommended, by the way: The genius audio versions read by Tim Curry.
1416583432|3.0|If anyone knows dogs, this book doesn't offer that much insight.  There are a few facts that are interesting, about the differences between wolves vs dogs, and about dog flicker rates vs human flicker rates.  However, I was quite disappointed with the lack of insight for someone who devotes their life to studying dog behavior. Unlike some other reviews, I liked the scientific slant.  After all, she is a scientist and one should expect that from a scientist.  However, some of the conclusions she drew from dog experiments are laughable and huge leaps of reasoning.  Also, there are things any dog owner knows to be true by simple common sense that she refutes.  I agree with another review that this book is heavily slanted towards dogs like yorkies who lost all their predatory instinct.  Lastly, the author interview offers her a convenient \\"cop-out\\" response that she is limited to what science can only prove to be true.  I would respect it more if she drew a line in the sand and stated the facts she learned from the laboratory. All in all, I learned a moderate amount and in the end, it helped me understand my dog better.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I don't normally write reviews because as an avid reader, I find I read so many books that most rarely stay with me.  This was one of the special ones.  If you are a fan of the Twilight [[ASIN:0316038377 Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)]] series, but always felt a little old for the teen angst, or have ever read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander [[ASIN:0440423201 Outlander (20th Anniversary Edition): A Novel]] books (which is somewhat where I see this trilogy going) than you will instantly enjoy.  This tale is a little slow to start but once you get going, the hook is set.  It's mix of witches, vampires, and daemons, and the elaborate settings weaved by Harkness pull you into a tale of fantasy, intrigue, and romance.  The star-crossed lovers (as opposed to Twilight - at least here they are adults!)meet and fall in love and embark on a journey to discover the secrets of an old manuscript.  A manuscript desired by all species, so of course it becomes them against the world, using their band of mismatched acquaintances to help them.  If it seems like I am desribing this as one of those boring plot device stories you've read a million times, I am not - THAT is the true point I am trying to make.  Harkness has taken a genre that has been overplayed in recent years and created something truly special.  I have not been so excited to recieve the next book in a series in a long, long time.  I trust that if you are a reader, than you will enjoy the truly imaginative story she has created.

B0034G4P8K|2.0|After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me.
B000R209NY|1.0|As you might expect, a blockbuster disaster movie usually lives or dies by the quality of its special effects. \\"Poseidon,\\" perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal \\"here's what I'm looking at\\" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death. It's a bland, generic, cash-in of a remake that isn't even afforded the buoy of good eye candy. Don't bother.
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|I've played these games on my ipod touch and ipad, and they work great.  however, on my original droid (this could be the problem because the phone is nearing two years old), the game sometimes lags or jumps.  i wouldn't spend more than 0.99 cents on it.
B000JML7EC|5.0|What a fantastic book! I still have recollections of reading Moby Dick in high school, and wishing I could have read anything else. It was torture...I know it's a classic and all, but it was so dry and boring. So it was with trepidation that I picked this up, and wow what a difference an author makes! This book was so entertaining and easy to fall into. The action is paced just right, and the descriptions of the various places and scenery is just enough - not too much, not too little. While the characters may seem cliche, it's important to remember that they only seem so because our popular culture has drawn so much from them. Stevenson is to pirates what Tolkien is to fantasy - it is the base-line from which everything else draws from. Keep that in mind and give this one a chance. You can't go wrong with free.
0061565407|5.0|I am not a fan of race car driving and I scoff at any idea of non animated movies with an animal protagonist. Marmaduke, Garfield and all other CG train wreck of the particular film for the bottom rungs of mental abilities. The only reason I bothered to read this book is it seemed relatively well thought out and and seemed like maybe a light diversion from my usual science fiction reading.    Also, I read a lot of books, probably a hundred and fifty or more a year and I can say without a doubt this is one of the best books I have ever read. The dog, Enzo who strives to be human comes off as more human than most people we encounter in day to day life. In many ways, he defines what it is to be human better than any of the actual human characters in the book. No small feat, considering his life and the main story really revolves around his master, Denny who is as likable of a character as you're likely to find. Denny is one of those characters that isn't special because of his amazing racing ability, he isn't special because he has supreme intellect or anything else. He's special because in the face of overwhelming diversity he always stands tall and never fails to do what is right. He isn't a character that has some great destiny thrust upon him, neither is Enzo, they are normal members of the there respective species making themselves shine in some of the worst of circumstances, despite there flaws. When one fails, the other is always there to pick up slack, there is a true friendship between them that goes beyond the relationship between a man and his dog. It transcends many friendships among two people all while keeping Enzo believable as a dog.    The prose is is just noticeable enough to give the character of Enzo, the narrator personality without weighing down the story, the pacing is just right and varied at the right points in the story to add to the experiences Enzo is having. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone.    Even if this kind of thing isn't your usual genre (it certainly isn't mine) I still highly recommend it, the book simply defies genre bias and gives anyone reading what we all read books for, a great story with great characters.
0736083863|5.0|As a Pilates Instructor in training and practice, I have found this manual to be extremely helpful in putting the bits and pieces together to better understand the body movement/response when having patients/clients completing the exercises. As my anatomy skills were a little rusty when I first started this new career, I instantly latched on to this text for support and guidance. Very well researched but not over-your-head with technical terms. I encourgage anyone trying to get a better understanding about what is going on inside the body when we are working from the outside to add this book to their collection.
159420229X|4.0|I loved this book, what a fun tale of someone picking up a passion and really going for it!  It's not a self help book, rather it's an amazing story about what is possible to be done when one combines determination and perseverance with structured improvement techniques.  I learned a lot about the meaning of memory and about what is required to become an expert in something.  Very engaging read!

B004EPYZQC|1.0|**spoiler alert.<br /><br />I wanted to like this, but once again a stupid ending ruined an otherwise ok movie. I was even enjoying it a bit and began to think maybe this will be better than 2 through 4, but in the end when they completely defy the laws of physics and have to cars--that might weigh 3000lbs each--that have a combined HP of maybe 1000hp (if tuned) and have a two inch x ten inch tire patch (times four driving tires) pulling a safe that has to be half a million pounds that was built into a building. Not only do they pull it, somehow their mass is enough to whip it like a water skier behind them and smash it through buildings all while going maybe sixty or seventy mph though a city. There is zero chance any two cars in history could have moved that thing an inch...come on people. Really, I know it's just a movie but this is just stupid.<br /><br />Just stupid.

B004RSCWZ2|3.0|I've listened to this album a couple of times and I just can't get into it.  The musicians are excellent, playing is excellent, Susan's vocals are good.  I like Mike Mattison's voice and range - he's wasted as a backup singer on this album.  And to me, the world doesn't need another blues band.  Derek's early work was very experimental, combining music from different cultures and genres.  The last 4 ablums (Songlines, Already Free, Roadsongs and now this) have moved more and more narrowly into the blues, which the DTB played really well, with a lot of soul.  But the creativity?  Gone, baby, gone.  The young kid daring to play Miles' \\"So What?\\" and \\"Footprints\\" is regressing.  The thirty-ish Derek should ponder what happened to the creativity that teamed up with Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on Joyful Noise's \\"Maki Madni\\" and Ruben Blades on that albums \\"Kam-Ma-Lay.\\"    Just thought I'd throw this into the mix.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|After almost 30 years since the original 'Tron' its sequel, 'Tron: Legacy' has finally arrived and in my opinion not only meets, but surpasses all my expectations. Without question there is absolutely no comparisons that can, or should be made in terms of special effects. Things have changed immensely since 1982. I think Disney also clearly understood this time that the true audience for 'Tron: Legacy' were adults and provided an appropriate technology, philosophy and storyline to satisfy that target group.<br /><br />There's definitely not much to complain about in this film. I like the fact that Both Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprised their roles from the original, I think Garrett Hedlund gave a strong, believable performance, as did Olivia Wilde, the soundtrack is absolutely hypnotizing and the special effects certainly do not disappoint. In my opinion the storyline is also much stronger than the original. Of course the fact that there was an original film to use as a foundation and expand upon doesn't hurt one bit.<br /><br />Unlike most Tron fans (I'm making an assumption here that may or may not be valid) it's not the technological implications of the film that attract me. What really intrigues me is the association of Flynn, or any user with divinity. It's a valid metaphor that is expertly inserted in the storyline (as it was in 'Tron') and I find this subtext to be absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />'Tron: Legacy' is a great film that could be enjoyed on a variety of levels by all ages. Disney did it right!
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs is my first experience with this author.  Full of fantasy, I found the book to be a charming page turner.  Like another reviewer I was expecting a \\"horror\\" book when I started reading.  It did turn out to be a \\"young adult\\" fantasy/thriller instead.  However, let me state that Home for Peculiar Children is a worth while read for almost anyone.<br /><br />Jacob, the narrator, is the grandson of a very strange man.  His grandfather tells young Jacob many strange stories about his early years and includes a few very interesting photographs.  Of course, the photos have somewhat of a weakened impact because of our ability to Photoshop pictures now days.  Still, they provide an interesting element to the book.<br /><br />At any rate, Jacob decides that he'd just like to live a normal life but is still curious about his grandfather's experiences.  In the end, Jacob and his father make a trip to an island off of England so that his father can gather material for a book on birds.  It is here that everything is revealed to Jacob.<br /><br />Masterfully told, Home for Peculiar Children is original in the same way that the Harry Potter series is original.  Riggs has created an interesting world, one that I'm sure many will want to explore.<br /><br />I also hope that a continuation of the story will be forthcoming.  So many things were left in limbo that it would be nice to tie up the loose ends.<br /><br />I highly recommend.<br /><br />Peace to all.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|This was great series. The dvd contains the whole season One. It has actors that have now been in 24 and other top series. It is strange that this series did not continue longer because now there are so many lawyer series going on: Suits (USA), Franklin & Bash (TNT)and Good wife (CBS). This seemed to have been out before its time. Now it would be a great success.<br />The main character Sebastian Stark (aka Shark) is a shrew and clever defend lawyer turned to be a great prosecutor. He wants to win his cases. He says that It's war in courtroom. The second best is nothing. Truth is subjective. Truth is what you present it to be and what the jury believes.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Gru, a Russian-born inventor and thief, desperate to be known as the number one villain on the planet, comes up with a scheme to steal the moon and hold it for ransom - all with the help of an army of cylinder-shaped minions he made himself.  But Gru's life is eventually turned around after he adopts three adorable tykes whom he initially intends to make unwitting participants in his diabolical plan but who, instead, wind up making him question his own commitment to a life of crime.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Coffin and Chris Renaud, \\"Despicable Me\\" is a colorful, witty and fast-paced animated feature that has just the right amount of humor, sentiment and moral lessons to make it a well-balanced treat for children and oldsters alike.  The frequent and exciting action sequences also make this ideal viewing for those with deficient attention spans (which seems to include just about all of us these days).  The design of the characters is clever and amusing, and the voice work - by Steve Carrell, Will Arnett, Jason Segel, Russell Brand, and a virtually unrecognizable Julie Andrews - is excellent as well.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|This was quite a strange and different interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. Also, the plot was kind of difficult to follow sometimes (maybe too many scenes were cut off?).<br />In this movie, the detective was more like a modern action hero placed in the 19th century world. Jude Law was Watson in love and distracted of his role as Watson.<br /><br />If the producers had named this movie to detective action hero and not Sherlock then it would have been more believable.
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire, the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy, picks up 6 months after the first book ended and we learn more about what happens after you've won The Hunger Games and pissed off the Capitol.  We rejoin Katniss and crew just before the Victory Tour through the districts and await the start of the Quarter Quell Games, an extra special version of the Games held every 25 years.<br /><br />After finishing the cliffhanger at the end of book one, I immediately purchased book two on my e-reader during the wee hours of the morning and then fell asleep soon thereafter midway through chapter one.  Book two starts off a bit slow again.  I think I'd be less disappointed in the loss of momentum if I hadn't been chain reading The Hunger Games trilogy.  And to be fair it's nice to have a reintroduction to the characters and premise.  Patience is a virtue I'm still working on.  Collins does a good and evenhanded job of reminding you what happened in book one without it feeling like those horrible recaps you find at the beginning of each book in some other series.<br /><br />So I wouldn't say that this is a sophomore slump, but there's definitely some slouching going on here.  While I thought this version of the Games was more interesting, we've already been at the Games and I wanted more progress.  It doesn't help that Katniss is no longer as engaging of a main character as she wavers back and forth in a constant state of indecisiveness.  While Katniss was the star in book one, I found her to be least interesting element of book two because there's not much new to Katniss here as she flits between indecision and survival mode.  Instead, the real focus in book two is the growing force moving Katniss to the forefront of the rebellion.  Katniss is no longer the driving force behind the action and plot development, rather she's become a figurehead or puppet that others use and manipulate.  I wanted Katniss to be more a part of that fight.  I wanted to see a more human Katniss.  And I wanted Katniss to make up her damn mind.  The stage is being set for the third and final book where real changes can shake things up and Katniss will be tested as to whether she's simply a good survivor, or capable of more.  And I hope so because she was pretty pffft in this one.<br /><br />Let's be honest, if you bought the first one, there's no way in hell you're going to just stop and not read the rest of the trilogy.  Catching Fire did it's job of continuing the story and throwing in some changes, but I think we're all ready to see Katniss become a part of the overarching plan, and not just a pawn getting pushed around by both sides.  As much as I enjoyed Catching Fire on it's own, I say let's move on.  Bring on Mockingjay!ss.  And I wanted Katniss to make up her damn mind.

B002ZG994U|2.0|This was a decent new version of the A-team if you consider the actors in it.

0345522478|5.0|I have been an avid fan of sci-fi, and in particular fantasy, for decades. With the advent of Disney's Tinkerbell, many have perceived fairies as happy little winged creatures with magic wands. The reality is that the world of the fae is much darker and has firm celtic roots.<br /><br />So it is refreshing to see someone take a more accurate take on the faeries and celtic mythology, and bring it to a more modern setting. Be prepared for druids, werewolves, witches and vampires. Oh, and an Irish Wolfhound with a wicked sense of humour.<br /><br />Kevin Hearne is a new author to me, and I believe that this is his first mainstream novel, and I am truly impressed. He develops the plot nicely, keeps the pages turning quickly, shows knowledge of the arcane and mythology, and creates engaging characters. There are moments when the tongue-in-cheek banter between the title character, Atticus O'Sullivan, and Oberon, his Irish Wolfhound, had me literally laughing out loud.<br /><br />The book follows the tale of Atticus O'Sullivan, who is actually a 2,000 year old druid, who happens to have in his posession a powerful sword which a ruling member of fae society has set his sights on, in an eager attempt to grab more power. Naturally, our protagonist is rather reluctant to hand over the sword, and things slowly build to a climactic battle. To Atticus, dealing with deities on a daily basis may be tricky, but is all part of a day's work. I especially like the fact that the author brings to life the druid character, firmly removing the \\"old crazy man in white robes\\" image that most people have in mind when they think of a druid.<br /><br />There is a favourite fantasy author of mine who has written a different book with a darker look at the world of the faeries encroaching on the human world, but I'd rather not detract from Mr. Hearne's work. So if you are interested in what that other book is, feel free to drop me an email!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and will absolutely be keeping an eye out for future novels by Kevin Hearne - he has made it to my short list of \\"must have\\" authors with just one book.ls by Kevin Hearne - he has made it to my short list of \\"must have\\" authors with just one book.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|From the reviews I read and one admonition to absolutely avoid this movie, I thought it would be very hard to watch.  It's not just \\"shots of his head and the windshield\\" (even though there is alot of that); There are lots of different, interesting shots, nicely done and it's not just his own turmoil; others' are shown as well.  It's a compassionate film.  Is it vain? So what if it is; it's his movie; if he wants to make a movie and watch himself so be it; nobody else has to watch it. I think he's an interesting looking and intrigueing enough person, just like Chloe.  This is basically a travelog, no different from what thousands of Americans have shot. I've driven cross country 4 times alone and it's pretty much exactly like this.  It also has some jarring emotional angles thrown in to make it a movie.  As far as Chloe's involvement, hey, if it strokes his ego to have thee Chloe suck him off, and Chloe is willing to do it,  good for him- the thing is is that he has spendt most the movie giving us time to think n' wait, thus giving the filmic catharsis weight. Should u watch it?  If you like the American landscape and driving across it, yeah. Or if you just like the idea of Chloe Sevigny and Vincent Gallo as a couple in fellatio, yea.

B00000F14B|5.0|I have seen this movie, oh, a hundred times? Probably more. It is quite simply one of the best musicals ever made. Everybody is perfectly cast, the music's fun, there are no nasty characters at all - indeed, no real conflicts, though every creative writing class says they're a must. The colors are lovely, so are the period costumes, and a movie whose naughtiest phrase is \\"Ye Gods!\\" and in which nobody gets undressed is a welcome change for sore ears and eyes. Don't look for a message, there really isn't one - the one attempt at one, when Harold Hill tells little Winthrop that he always thinks there's a band, is not only maudlin, it's manifestly untrue: Harold's a con man plain and simple, not a salesman who has bought his own sales pitch. But that's the only false note in the entire production which features great singing (including the wonderful Buffalo Bills barbershop quartet), dancing, and rarety of rareties, actual writing. If you haven't seen this movie, you have a treat in store. If you have, well, you can't see it too many times. There are very very few movies I would say that about.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|So I just saw this movie and I must say that it should have been better. Was it good, sure it was good, but why wasn't it great!  This movie tries to have the mind games of Cruel Intentions, the creepiness of Fatal Attraction, and a story that loosely mimics Poison Ivy (The First One aka the Drew Barrymore one). I would say that a movie based on that sounds utterly amazing and then you add Julianne Moore's and Liam Neeson's names to it, it should be golden, but it just doesn't hit any of those marks. For me movies need to have an amazing ending to tie up everything that I have been watching for the last 2 hours (or whatever the time frame is), and this just doesn't. I don't want to give anything away but, I feel like the original ending to Fatal Attraction would have worked here, and it would have felt more real. The mind games were predictable, at least for me, but there are a lot of movies that I say that about. I did like seeing Amanda Seyfried in a more grown-up role, but I left thinking that I just wish her character could have been more desperate, more dark, just more. This movie really could have pushed the boundary and instead it just played itself safe.

B004ZZITEU|2.0|YOu have read everyone's Review here. Yes its true, MA has released their worst album! Even trying to be open minded here doesnt work, because MA isn't able to pull off some of the slop on this album. Six songs here smell of a Poor mans Rammestein, or some Euro -Electronica Band from the 1990's. Im all for some good electronica, but if I want some I pop in some SquarePusher,LTJ Bukem,or Ulrich Schnauss NOT MA. There is some hope on this album though. Its not all garbage, and I think some of the one star reviews are because they are so livid on this effort. Fans of \\"Domination\\" will enjoy Existo Velgore and Blades for Baal and Nevermore. Two other songs did grab my interest, even though I wouldnt really classify them as Death Metal songs, but they have their moments. Check out 10 More Dead and Beauty Meets Beast. To sum it all up, I am very confused about this album. I dont understand why its like two different bands here. ALSO, most of the lineup that you are used to hearing the past few albums is gone, so that could have alot to do with it, and I heard David wasnt intersted much in doing Death Metal , but then what is what the three songs here that are??? FINAL VERDICT\\"Yes, it pretty much sucks, but not as bad as some say. BUT, not worth the long wait, its not the comeback everyone expected, and even though I like Tim Yeung (he is really talented) but lets bring Pete and some of the original members back and get back into the groove!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This movie was so good I watched it twice on Direct TV and want to buy the DVD.   I would have seen it at the movie theaters but the reviews were not good.   This movie flies along.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I think Adele 21 is absolutely fantastic. Not just one song, but about five get me moving! Highly recommend this to all ages. I am in my 50's, and am nostalgic for music from the late 50's and early 60\\"s, so this style is not my normal listening music, but it is on my iPod and I repeat her songs many times. I really can't say enough on this lady! I hope she is coming out with another soon. Love her voice, her emotion and her beat. I would love to see her in concert....albeit an intimate setting.
B00501X6YG|4.0|Of course I enjoy Jon Anderson's voice and that classic string of Yes albums that ran from THE YES ALBUM to TALES FROM TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS, but the only Yes album that followed that classic period that I really took to was DRAMA, which (strangely) was possibly that only Yes album not to feature Jon Anderson singing. The album really gave me a melancholy sense of summer/time passing. The disc featured Trevor Horn singing.<br /><br />I have just heard Yes' new CD, produced by Trevor Horn, with him singing backing vocals, and some new guy singing lead. Thankfully, the new guy's voice sounds very much like an extension of Trevor Horn's singing. The atmosphere is very similar in texture to the DRAMA album.
0920236162|3.0|It's good that there is an inverse out there to the typical princess fairy tale but the story makes me a little uncomfortable.  I'd like my daughter to read it once but it's really a drag to have to keep reading it over and over.  The prince is too much a caricature of the insensitive male and I find this too unfair to my sons.  Unless you're happy with having a strong feminist perspective in your children's books, you may not like this one.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Liam Neeson has done it again! Although the pace of Unknown is nothing like Taken, this movie will keep you jumping out of your seat! In the mold of \\"The Tourist\\" (Johnny Depps' latest) there is plenty of action at the end and a plot twist that would make Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle (Sherlock Holmes' creator) smile. An American amnesiac in a foreign country, a wife who doesn't know him, another man who has taken his place and a terrorist plot with a who is the target twist, Unknown can't miss! You'll love this one and I guarantee you'll watch it more than once.

B0051BVQFG|4.0|It's a fun, summer, sci-fi action flick.  It's not a movie being promoted for the oscars, it's not  200 million dollar superhero movie being pushed down our throats with 24/7 advertising.  The poor critic reviews caused me to think this would be lame, but it was alright.  Not great, mind you, but good.  Story was okay, some of the usual action-movie humor, acting was alright, effects were pretty good...overall it was worth watching if you just want to have a fun time watching a good alien-attacks-earth action movie.  I *might* have been a little disappointed had I taken family to see this in an expensive theater, but for dvd or download it's definitely worthwhile.  BTW, I'm not saying it's okay like some lame b-movie sci-fi like Starship Troopers 3 or  anything like that.  I'm just saying it's not as good as a Independence Day level movie, though MUCH closer to ID4 than ST3.
0439023521|5.0|This trio of young adult novels by Suzanne Collins takes place in the future world of Panem, located in what was once North America. Panem is made up of 12 districts and the Capitol, all controlled by President Snow and various other members of the Capitol city. The citizens of the rest of the 12 districts exist only to provide for the Capitol; provide food, clothing, medicine, coal and very importantly, entertainment.<br />Many years past, the citizens of the 13 original districts had risen up to rebel against a very unfair living arrangement. District 13 was obliterated and the Hunger Games were begun as a way to control the other districts. Each year, a boy and a girl from each district, between the ages of 12 and 17, is \\"reaped\\", their names chosen from a list of all of the children in that district. Once chosen, those two children join the 22 others from the remaining districts for a fight to the death in an arena, termed the Hunger Games. This spectacle is broadcast as required watching for all citizens of Panem, who in the 12 districts get to watch those they know and love get brutally murdered by other children.<br />In District 12, Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old living in the poorest of the districts, supports her mother and beloved younger sister, Prim, with her illegal hunting and creative ways of providing for her family.<br />On the day of the reaping this year, Prim is the one whose name is chosen. Katniss immediately volunteers to go for Prim instead. In her mind, she has agreed to die for her but cannot bear the thought of Prim dying in the Games.<br />What unfolds from here is a spectacular tale of rising up against oppression, with Katniss becoming the symbol for the rebellion. She is joined in the Hunger Games by the first of two love interests, Peeta, who is a baker's son she's known for years.<br />Throughout this story (it is truly one long story broken into three parts), the author does an amazing job of writing flawed characters. Put into this world, there are few who are selfless, or even marginally kind. Katniss herself is surly at best, having been forced to care for her family since her father died when she was 11. For any young adult reading this novel, it truly shows how a young girl feels inside at this age; not always able to see the true motives of those around her or believe the truly good things about herself.<br />This story also a commentary on many social and political issues, interspersed with lessons about what should and should not be trusted in life. The politics of those on Katniss' own side of the war, for example, is a lesson on how those in power are those who disseminate the information, and how they spin it and whether how they act on in is in the best interest of the people. It is a lesson on how human beings treat each other and why, how arbitrary things are in life and how betrayal is a part of that.<br />Although these books were written for YA, they are easily accessible for adults. I found myself riveted, in no small part because of how much the author made me root for Katniss. She is an extremely complicated character, but one I would want on my side in a rough situation. She can't help but protect those who are smaller or weaker than she is, and even those who aren't. She is cold and calculating, though, which makes her decisions and her words unlikable at times, but she is as real a character as I've ever read.<br />I was struck by the more esoteric parts of Suzanne Collins' writing as well. For example, she references other literature, most notably numbering Katniss' army squadron (from the final book, Mockingjay) 451. The numbers have no meaning in the army, and this number is most easily remembered from Ray Bradbury's tale, Fahrenheit 451, another futuristic story about government control. This is only one reference, however. She uses character's names (eg. Cressida, Castor, Pollux) to further reference historical and literary ideas, as well as metaphorical ideas (naming the very evil President Snow, whose breath smells like blood and roses).<br />In all, these novels are well-worth reading for those of all ages who like a gripping futuristic tale that isn't all that far-fetched.Snow, whose breath smells like blood and roses).   In all, these novels are well-worth reading for those of all ages who like a gripping futuristic tale that isn't all that far-fetched.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I'm not sure where the hype for this game comes from.  I paid for it but just can't get into it.  I love strategy games but I think it's the pace of the game that I don't care for.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Nice product, easy to use.    Pros:  Good GPS aquisition, even with movement (faster than the 305 and 310);  Very confortable to use;  Easy to read the information;  Very good indication of the batery life remaining    Mid:  The batery life is more than enough for my type of use (10-15km run, about 1-1.5hrs and in the end still have 80%)  The heart sensor gives good reading and make a good contact, but isn´t very confortable (I´m considering to buy the soft sensor)    Cons:  No distance or time alert;  The Touch bezel could be better, have to put in the higher sensitivity;  The software instalation is a bit odd;  The conection with PC as a mind of it own, hard to updoad the data when we what to;
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I'd give the PC version a 5/5 and possibly a 5/5 on a tablet but I find the game a little too involved for a phone screen.  I played through all achievements on the PC but doubt I'll do too much more with this version.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|It seems a little greedy to require Wi-Fi for a 22mb file..... but whatever....Wi-Fi is available free at every Starbucks everywhere....<br /><br />Halfbrick Studios now has 2 permanent apps living on my Evo 4G. This and the amazingly fun fruit ninja.<br /><br />5 stars.<br /><br />Thank You yet again Amazon!
B004G600A4|5.0|I grew up watching Disney princess movies. I love them. Watching them now takes me back to a simpler time when all I had to worry about was what kind of jelly I wanted on my PB&J. This took me back while bringing a fresh new face to the princess collection.<br /><br />Tangled is the story of Rapunzel, the stolen princess with awesome hair. This version is different than most I've heard or read. I'm more familiar with a witch holding Rapunzel captive and a prince coming to the rescue; instead our story here is of a stolen princess with magic hair, a greedy old woman wanting to stay young forever, and a dashing young rogue just after money. The changes to the traditional story kept the movie fresh and interesting to watch.<br /><br />Some characters feel like throwbacks to some older Disney movies- Max, the horse, reminds me of the horse in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer)reminds me a good bit of the soldier guy from Hunchback, too, but I think the hair has a lot to do with that. I really love that Disney put music in this- other than The Princess and the Frog, Disney seems to have strayed away from singing characters. Growing up, those musical elements were my favorite and probably influenced me to pursue a professional music career. Personally, I like that this movie reminds me of older movies. The animation is really nice- it doesn't feel totally computer generated.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. No sketchy stuff to worry about with little kids, humor for the adults without crossing a line, and a band of unwashed miscreants singing about their dreams. What more could you ask for?
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This made my Mum's day, month, year!!!!  While visiting, she saw this on the television and sat transfixed for over 3 hours.  I had to get this for her and was so excited when it arrived early and for such a great price!!

B004V6MWFU|5.0|Saw Eddie on 6/26/11 in Detroit and was blown away by his excellence and complete mastery of the stage.  He played 31 songs, and at least 7 from this album.  I hadn't heard it yet but the songs were instantly recognizable and enjoyable.  They felt like classics by the time this album arrived and was placed into my cd player two days later.      If you enjoyed Into the Wild, and think you can handle something more stripped down and personal, then give this a go.  The songs are distinct on a first listen, and many are full of beautiful melodies that catch your attention the first time and stay in your head until you hear them again.  I'm just sad I waited nearly a month after its release to purchase this.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Well, it is finally here.....the ultimate edition of this great film.  It never looked or sounded better.   However could someone explain to me the 7.1 DTS sound?  I have the capabilities but it doesn't sound any different than 5.1 digital.  Regardless, I can watch this film over and over again.   It is masterfully produced, directed, cast, edited...It is just stunning; a work of art!
B00506NRBS|5.0|I loved reading this book and finished it the day I started! It was inspirational and almost gave me a sense of validation that my own business style isn't so bad afterall in comparison to the strict professional standards we all think we're supposed to follow. Really great read and I would recomend it to everyone!
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Got hooked on this game the first time I played it. I actually have to stop myself from playing or else I'll go forever. They did a good job on making the vibrations make the game feel realistic. I would have to say that this game beats all my other android phone games, but maybe I'm just saying that cuz I've only had the game for about a week.
193659451X|5.0|Take this opportunity to read Persuasion, it will take your breath away.    Anne Elliot was \\"forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older.\\" She was not given the choice by her family and friends to marry the man that she loved and who loved her. She sent Fredrick Wentworth away to the navy with no promise of ever having their love renewed. Fredrick spends his time in the navy honorably, becoming a captain, and tries his best to forget Anne. Anne, left at home, realizes what a mistake it was to ignore her heart and follow the advice of those who she thought she trusted.     Persuasion takes place almost ten years after these events when fate pulls these star-crossed lovers together again. They must find a way to forgive each other, one for being sent away, and the other for never returning.     Jane Austen wrote Persuasion at the end of her life, and thus had a different perspective while writing it then she did when writing all the rest of her books. This is the only Austen book written after the two protagonists have met and fallen in love. Austen pulls you into Anne's story, demanding that you stick around until you know what happens between Anne and Wentworth. The reader can easily see the emotions that both Anne and Wentworth feel, while both characters are blind to the feelings of the other.     Anne taught me that I have to trust my heart. I can listen to the people in my life that I trust, but they will not be able to tell me what to do to be happy. Anne becomes miserable because she followed the advice of those she loved, but she doesn't blame them because she realizes that they told her to do what they thought was best. I enjoyed watching Anne grow and become an amazing woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up to the people in her life.     One issue that I had with this book is the language that is used in it; it was not written for our day. The language is archaic and difficult to decipher. It is best to know the basic plot before reading this book or else you will get lost in the details of what is happening. However, the joy that is elicited from being part of Anne's life is without a doubt worth the effort.

B004XE0P5E|4.0|I didn't expect to like this album so quickly. I heard the guys on All Music Considered talking it up and I was kind of left with the impression that this one may have to grow on me. Like many, I still listen to For Emma and Blood Bank often,and cannot imagine the day when I would ever be tired of them. This album is different. It is a little over produced, and it is hard to really listen to the lyrics because of the instruments. Still, I think it is a really beautiful album,the third song in particular. I recommend this album, but if you are new to Bon Iver, definately start with For Emma and Blood Bank. I can certainly understand how listeners who adore those albums may not like this one, but I am glad that I am able to like it so much.

B00506NRBS|5.0|From the moment Derek contacted me about my book,[[ASIN:0960683054 How To Be Your Own Booking Agent: THE Musician's & Performing Artist's Guide To Successful Touring]], I've watched his little business grow into a not-so-little business and was amazed at how it doubled every year.

These lessons make sense, plain and simple. With all the how-to books, videos and friendly advice one can be inundated by, learn from Derek's down-to-earth, come-from-the-heart lessons learned from trial and error, listen-to-your-heart and do-what's-right-for-you method. Clearly Derek Sivers is different sort of a business founder and his stories demonstrate that.

If the stories in this little book are any indication of how taking the opposite approach from the crowd can work in your favor, then learn these lessons well. If the lessons in this book can offer you a direction or a theme to guide you, it would be to dare to be unique, strive to follow your heart no matter how far you may stray from what everyone else is doing.

Let them always be your guide. Great, quick read that get's to heart of what being in business is all about.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Great sound effects, old school graphics and intuitive u/i. That being said, all that fun is packed in to a rather large file size (neary 30 mb) hence the wifi only d/l. That would take quite a while even over a 3g network. To the guy who was complaining about gingerbread breaking his wifi and wanting to download over cell service if 4g is available that will suffice as a connection with enough bandwidth  to download so you can download over cell service dummy.  I am tired of seeing people review their crappy phones and give good, practical apps, and entertaining games bad reviews because they are too retarded to either (a) purchase a quality product or (b) make a product that you have work. If the game or app didnt work, don't review it, send feedback to the developer to fix the problem and quit your complaining.

B0057XSCJG|2.0|I saw this movie just because I really like Alex in I am number four. I don't believe neither of these movie are really good to be honest, acting performance is rather mediocre, and storyline very much boring. But I believe this young actor has potential, I find that he actually make the movie I am number four entertaining. In Beastly, he seems to be acting like he is in a Play, I don't really see him connecting with his character. I believe that he probably was not really comfortable with the role, something I like about his acting in number four is that he is effortless attractive. What I mean, is that he seems not to be that vain, his beauty doesn't distract me from his performance, he seems to behave like the boy next door, and that for me is what make him better over others actors. Is my opinion. In Beastly, he just seems not to fit in the role, the idea that there is a guy that will deliver a speech on how Good looking people are the leaders does not seems to fit really, and don't get to hate his behavior, I feel sorry that somebody actually is that silly to said that out loud. And the girl, well she was forgettable, she is beautiful, but her acting was forgettable. So I guess it wasn't for me.

0679746323|5.0|Chang and Halliday are able to reveal Mao's real motives by showing the world of forces Mao had to contend with, as he himself saw it.  The prime necessity was to gain the favor of the Soviets, resulting in a long term game of courting and, alternately, countering Soviet influence.  The new scholarship on the Mao-Stalin relationship fills out the picture, makes many episodes of Chinese history during this era comprehensible.    The amount of historical detail and new research reveals, at last, what Mao was thinking when he undertook many otherwise seemingly-bizarre actions.  The book is a portrait of ruthlessness and animal cunning.  Mao is revealed as the only peer of Stalin in modern history when it comes to bringing about enormous tragedy for his own people.
0307266303|5.0|Found this book after the author was interviewed about it on the daily show. It is a fascinating read that keeps your attention the entire way. While not being of the greatest shape myself, i have yet to try out the methods in this book. What i do know is that shortly after reading this book, the vibram five-fingers and other such products began to come out... seems odd if it didn't work.    Like i said, cannot prove or disprove the facts discussed, but as a rational and thinking adult, i believe what is discussed in the book.    Read it, if not to learn about the practice of barefoot running, then to at least entertain yourself and broaden your horizons.
B003UESJF6|2.0|Did not like this movie at all.  Just didn't have the pizazz of other cartoons.  Was far more juvenile than expected.  Awful story line.

B004L3AR0K|5.0|Love and Other Drugs is a movie about a cocky, confident prescription drug sales representative who meets a woman in the beginning stage of parkinsons and changes everything. This film is one that has a double storyline, and keeps you interested every minute along the way. This is definitely out of the \\"romantic comedy norm, but that's what I love about it. Very original, another must see movie for its generation.

B00000K3UU|5.0|This movie doesn't fail to do Adam Sandler justice in his line of classic movies- a man with no respposibility in life inherits a child against his friends' better judgement, and at first seems like a piece of cake. Sonny (Sandler) later begins to realize that parenting is more than fun and games. Through learning to raise the child the way he needs to be raised, Sonny begins to turn his own life around while forming a relationship he never expected. A must see for any Adam Sandler fan, and a top movie of its generation.

B0007ZEO4G|4.0|By mid-summer 1973, Deep Purple's status as a major heavy rock band was beginning to pick up speed commercially with the general public and the band became a worldwide phenomenon. Once the band completed its last shows in July returning to Japan, Ian Gillan had served out his notice and the search was on for a new lead singer. The band had already taken notice of one Glenn Hughes(formerly of Trapeze), and although Glenn could sing, it was his bass playing Blackmore, Lord and Paice were most impressed by. Months before, Blackmore had threatened to leave the band as the situation between he and Ian Gillan had become intolerable and a decision had been made by the management(what with all of their newfound success) to keep things moving. Roger Glover had come to find out that his days would be numbered too and through a band meeting it was decided to replace him as well.     It didn't take too long for the band to recruit Glenn Hughes into the ranks, and Blackmore had long considered Paul Rodgers as the number one choice for the vocal spot, but Rodgers had already made a decision to work with Mick Ralphs(ex-Mott the Hoople) along with his cohort Simon Kirke to form Bad Company. Purple then opened up the floodgates for any and all singers known or otherwise and plowed through endless miles of audtion tapes until they found a cassette sent by a man whom was currently employed as a tailorshop salesman. David Coverdale's background was quite obscure and had sung in a few local club boogie bands of a middling unreknown: The Fabuloso Brothers and the Government. But once they heard his tone and range, they decided to bring him down for a jam at Clearwell Castle and by the end of the night,Mark III Deep Purple was finally in place.    Burn was recorded in Montreux where the band had had such success a year before recording the classic Machine Head opus, but since then, the sound of Purple was changing again and now the band had two singers which altered the dynamic quite compellingly. The title track is vindicated by this as Hughes and Coverdale do a tag-team effort trading off vocals and harmonize quite well during the chorus of the number. This is an element that runs throughout the duration of the recording with the only sole track featuring Coverdale prominently in the moody blues number Mistreated. Blackmore's playing is invigorating on this album and his solo's on the title number, Lay Down, Stay Down, You fool No One and Mistreated are paramount and compelling. Ian Paice's percussion skills are adapating and progressing quite rapidly as there is a precision and power displayed on tracks like You Fool No One and Lay Down, Stay Down which further show the changes in the lineup and the energy of the band's musical dynamic is re-ignited within a fresh and driving quality. Jon Lord provides the anchor here and his playing stands out on tracks like Might Just Take Your Life, Sail Away and What's Going On Here utilizing the pattened Hammond Organ, tack piano and even synthesizer to further add texture and color to the strong material presented here.     Burn remains as a one off barnstormer of a record that returned the band to the heights of Machine Head. Many had thought that Purple would never be able to equal the success of the Mach II lineup, and Burn is the proof that any doubts were proved futile. As for the future, well, unfortunately Purple's next 2 studio efforts would see them gradually losing focus and heading off down a direction that had more of an R&B flavor within the rock element. With Burn, Purple proved there was much left in the creative engine and turned in a marvelous album that reinvented and rejuvinated the band. 4 and a half stars
B004Y03MQQ|5.0|Another great addition to my Maiden picture album collection. Vinyl 1 side 1 has a picture of the forest in green background, side 2 is a picture of the cover. Vinyl 2 side 1 picture of the forest in red background, side 2 is a photo of the band members. Vinyl 3 side 1 pictures the band band members in a silhouette, side 2 is a live photo of the band on stage. Lyrics are also included for all the songs on the inside of cover.
B000063DI9|5.0|The follow up to '86's Somewhere in Time turns out to be this phase of the band's recording zenith and on the whole scale, more of an actual group effort in the songwriting dept. Personally, I think this record has all of the elements coming together to make this release have an extra touch of classic, yet modern Maiden style in sound. Bruce Dickinson's vocal delivery is as powerful and succinct as ever and his best moments are all over this offering: in the title track(actually, for Maiden its an apex of sorts), the opener Moonchild, The Clairvoyant and The Evil that Men Do to mention at least half of the songlist. The twin guitars of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray once again provide alot of light and shade to numbers like Infinite Dreams, The Prophecy and the hit Can I Play with Madness with an effortless, telepathic nature. The consistency and quality is very high on this effort and in alot of ways Maiden has never been able to reach these heights again, although parts of A Matter of Life and Death and Brave New World come close, but ultimately, Seventh Son is a great closing era for this lineup. 5 Solid Stars
B0058P7KUA|5.0|So far so Awesome! This is kind of an early review to compensate for the fact that the first reviewers are likely to be those who have trouble right away. But so far the game is awesome!<br /><br />It supports my Xperia Play's controls very well, it shows up in the launcher, and it works with my Galaxy Tab 7 although as per usual with the GT installation is always a problem.
B0002EXH40|3.0|After the successful high of 1992's Countdown to Extinction, Dave and the guys in Megadeth bring out a strong and consistent follow up with 1994's Youthanasia. I have to admit this is definitely a release that has had to grow on me over time and while I don't quite have as much of a die-hard love for the mid to late nineties Megadeth, the natural evolution of the band within the time period is considerably successful and, of its time, as more of a surviving phase for the the band's career.     The disc starts off with the heavy and powerful Reckoning Day and the key elements to the Megadeth sound are fully oiled and intact here. Train of Consequences follows and maintains the style established on tracks like Skin O' My Teeth from the previous Extinction set. One thing I've always admired about Dave Mustaine is how his playing comes from a strong rhythm sense of the guitar; granted, his solos are pretty extraordinary and he's always had a bevvy of hot shot guitar shredders to trade riffs, licks and ideas from:Chris Poland, Marty Freidman and current lead guitarist Chris Broderick, for example, to keep his chops in top form. Anyhow, next is Addicted to Chaos which is a mid-paced track that is teetering on throwaway status and I find it filler in tempo and melody. A Tout Le Monde however, emerges as a classic Mustaine song that has a perfect sense of light and shade saddled with a melody that remains timeless and is in fact, one of Dave's best songs ever written. Elysian Fields and The Killing Road continue to build this record with even more substance and add a tuneful heaviness within a melodic sense as the better tracks displayed here. Further along with Blood of Heroes and Family Tree, these numbers fall into the same catagory as Addicted to Chaos in a middling and mid-paced manner that begins to show the problems of getting softer and in, perhaps, a poppier form of hard rock and metal. The title track has some strength along with I Thought I Knew It All and BlackCurtains continuing the consistent vibe of quality executed guitar interplay, not to mention ensemble performance.     Overall, I find Youthanasia as a time marking period for Megadeth and mirrors alot of Countdown to Extinction's triumphs previously, yet also begins the mid-nineties shift in approach to how and where Megadeth were heading further musically. 3 stars
B003TH6P9Q|5.0|The whole mystery crime-solving theme may not be original, since there's practically dozens of them (as the show would often mention: Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, etc.), but the execution and the characters are amazingly lovable. The wit and humor makes me smile and laugh every step of the way, especially banters between Castle, Beckett, and the rest of the team. Fillion and Katic do an impressive job of bringing life to their characters. I have watched most of Castle, and am watching the rest between typing this review. In short simple words, this show is purely amazing.
B000063DHL|4.0|After the conclusion of the World Slavery tour in the summer of 1985 and taking a much needed 6 month break throughout the rest of the year into 'early 86, once Maiden reformed for the follow up to the successful Powerslave album, the band retained its collective sound with a sense of a more refined style that became a bit more progressive in its arrangements and musical delivery. Despite the 8 song entry here, the record still clocks in at just nine minutes under an hour's worth of music and as ever, Steve Harris provides the bulk of the material; yet Adrian Smith turns in 3 tracks that are just as strong as Steve's contributions and really provide Maiden with a strong palette in which to draw from. Wasted Years and Heaven Can Wait were the earmarked singles chosen and became crowd favorites. The title track is a tour-de-force and is an excellent and galloping rocker that offers a middle section which makes the song bloom into something a little bit different from past Maiden songs. Sea of Madness(Smith) is a bit mid-paced while Stranger in a Strange Land provides another powerful and memorable number within the Maiden catalogue. Deja Vu is a Murray/Harris number that recalls the power and speed of such classics as Run to the Hills.     I remember around the time of this release that there was a huge uproar in the metal fan community about the use of guitar synthesizers being present on this release(including Judas Priest's Turbo set around the same time), yet looking back and certainly on the follow up disc, Seventh Son of Seventh Son, the instrument certainly seemed to only add texture to the otherwise quality material that was presented here. Back to the disc. Steve provides another 2 further strong tracks in the Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and the album's closer Alexander the Great which is yet another semi-epic number about a Greek historic figure, something Steve would always touch upon when concerning his lyrics; he was a well read person, obviously and rather than consistently touch upon similar themes of the past:be it satan, sex, god, or partying, Steve showed(s) intelligence backed with an instrumental prowess that is unsurpassed for the style of music he and the band display. Somewhere in Time is a solid effort and opens up further musically the expansions of tone and arrangement within the group's repetoire, thus making them into innovators of their craft. 4 Solid Stars
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie. My kids love it and I can play it 3 times a week and they'll still watch it and give me some time to rest.    2 other movies my kids love and can watch over and over without getting bored with them   [[ASIN:B0030IIZ4M Toy Story]]  [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]]    I rotate between the 3 movies and that works great.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Amazing game, very fun, lots of depth, lots of fun! Get it, worth every penny! It expands a lot so it keeps you wanting to play and actually takes some time and strategy.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I've been using the E7 with my macbook pro via USB into my desktop speakers with great success. whether it's itunes, ripped files, or rhapsody, the sound quality is greatly improved with the bypass of the internal sound card. i've also hooked this up via the AUX feature with an itouch as well as iphone4 using a LOD to bypass the headphone out on those devices and the improvement in sound quality when pairing the LOD with the E7 is amazing. the DAC creates a much warmer sound -- so much less harsh and compressed. highly recommended.
0439023521|5.0|I literally could not put this book down! It was one of the best books i have ever read! I would recommend it for anyone.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Took me a few minutes to get used to the controls. Its a fun game. Works well on a droid x.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Hard to compare, is my first though when I think how good this album is, if I think of the best from the Foo Fighters, my mind takes back to \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" and \\"There is nothing left to loose\\"; then I say... well I would not say its better, but its a tie for these records...    Been hearing it endlessly for the first days, I loved it, \\"Bridge Burning\\", catches you at first, fast drums with rock style, then you get to a more... classic? rock with \\"Rope\\", kind of somehow slow/fast rythm. \\"Dear Rosemary\\" comes to keep you in love for the first time with the album with a chained rythm. \\"White Limo\\" is the one that comes up trying to blow up your mind, with the rough singing.    And then...   When you thought it couldnt get even better...    Comes \\"Arlandria\\" and \\"These Days\\", for some reason I just want to go deaf with \\"Arlandria\\" and sing it out loud... Then  a meaningful song as \\"These Days\\", that touches your rock chords in your mind.    With \\"Back&Forth\\" you keep inmerse on the rock soul that this album brings you up, then you realize that is just \\"A Matter of Time\\" to reach the end of the album with a fast loud song as the 8th track on a great album. This makes you not \\"Miss the Misery\\" from hearing other lame rock bands in the past because now you wonder if this could be the new best album from the foo's.     Then you take a lil break from loudness(not really) with \\"I should have know\\", which is like the calm before the storm.    And finally, a great solid, awesome ending for the album with \\"Walk\\", which also as \\"These Days\\" moves your rock soul back and forth.    To add up, this is a great album.. something that today's music need it badly.
B002N2XI0W|5.0|Lovely easy to read book that plays out nicely.  Just real characters and a real story- apparently the movie is going to be made soon...I recommend it highly!

1451626657|4.0|This is a good book. However, if you order it paperback, it does not come as pictured. It is a red background with a blue man instead. Very disappointing.
0780626494|5.0|The plot is already told in many reviews and synopsis so I am just going to tell you what I enjoy about Blast From the Past...  LOVE this movie!! Since this is a romantic comedy with Brenden Frasier I don't think it was taken as seriously as it could have been. There are SO many political and life lessons that are over-looked - this has to be one of the most under-rated  movies ever made! Watch it and understand all that we have given up and missed out on in the last 5o years... innocence, happiness, patriotism, respect, family, morality...not to mention style and class! Seriously, an adorable movie. My only complaint is some of the off-language could definitely have been left out. I realize it is in there to show the differences between women and culture of 1962 and the 1990's, but it makes Eve less likable and takes away from the overall wholesomeness of the film.  The casting is perfect for every roll (C.W. and B.F. are flawless!) other than I almost think that Eve could have been improved upon. I am not sure who it should have been, but again - I felt more than once that her character should have been just a little more likable throughout and that would be due to both acting and writing.   If you like real romance and have any interest in history at all, you should truly enjoy this movie. There are so many subtle references throughout that it is even worth viewing more than once!
B002N5N5QQ|3.0|I purchased seasons 1 and 2 for my husbands birthday and one of the discs from season 2 isn't working properly. It played one episode fine then kept freezing on the other episodes and now tut DVD player cannot play it at all. It's very frustrating.
1840226447|5.0|This collection of stories by Robert Chambers is an excellent companion to anyone who enjoys the Cthulhu Mythos and wants to delve into some of the inspiration for Lovecraft's fiction. Reading these stories was very much like stepping through a doorway into another dimension. The characters were well written and the plot was filled with madness and lurking horror. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B001KKS4NY|2.0|I expected the book to be used... even used. What I did not expect was that the cover of the book (including the portion that covers the spine) is attached by a few threads. I don't mind worn. But this condition makes the book hard to read and is inconsistent with how I remember the book being described in the sales materials.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|I came out of this movie feeling dirty. Girls getting used & murdered. It was not advertised like that. Girl empowerment, uh no! Girls getting used, and ended with no sense of justice, just sadness. Seem as if Zack Synder's mind was on overload when he wrote this. SFX were great, Zack should have made a dumb live action \\"Sailor-Moon\\" but he made a mess... See at your own risk !!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|So much fun. Great graphics. Om Nom&apos;s face is hilarious when the candy drops. Can&apos;t wait for the new update.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This album is brilliant.  An extraordinary production of unrehearsed pickup sessions balances the brilliance of young blues master Kenny with the artful depths of the generation that lived the blues.  The version of \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" is the best version of that classic ever recorded - recorded live (as was everything) with BB King in a one of the last juke joints at 2:00 a.m. rocked the lucky crowd that heard that BB and the boys would be coming in late to bring it down.  They did.  This CD rocks.  If you have any feel for the blues you must own this one.
B004VGGYXG|1.0|Lucio Fulci ,would not be happy about this being converted into 3-d , this is just a marketing scheme. Don't buy this version of this film, Only buy the real version of this film. I'm a Lucio Fulci fan, and I have to say this is just wrong. Please , Amazon take this version down.      Johnny
B0058VW36U|2.0|A great game! The first app I ever purchased in fact. It makes you think through things and figure out the puzzle, without making you too frustrated. You can skip levels if you can't solve it or pass through without getting 3 stars.    But there's one problem. On my Droid 1 it often pauses and tells me to either Force Close or wait. Usually if I wait it's OK. But now it won't let me play any stage in the last level. I got to stage 7 before, but now every time I try to click on one it just brings me back to the phone's home screen, no force close message. I'm kind of angry that I paid for this one, although it is a great game. I'm going to be annoyed once I beat all the other levels. Please fix!
B004J4WQ46|5.0|If you like The White Stripes, The Black Keys, or even Pheonix....then you'll love The Strokes.  This album is awesome and I find myself listening to it all the time.  It's a great album for a great mood!  Even my 6 yr old daughter loves it.  :)
2070612759|5.0|This book was intended to be read in French. Indeed, that's why it was originally crafted, for students to learn French with ease. Since then, it has become a representative piece of French art. Written at a time when totalitarianism was still a dominant anti-U.S. force, Le Petit Prince is chilling at points despite its optimistic, airy, childlike prose. Don't be fooled. This book is far from childish despite the characters, for, behind it all, each character le petit prince encounters is a representative of a different facet of human nature, often not for the good.<br /><br />I have not read the book in English, yet I would strongly urge you to read this in French if you can. It is not a difficult read. The fact that I have been asked to read this book for high school French, intermediate college French, and advanced French studies, as have many, is a testament to its enduring legacy and the fact that it has touched many a reader.
B004HZ76FQ|1.0|The description for this game sounded awesome but when I loaded this on my phone it sucked major.  just the the view from the bow of the boat and some fish swimming around. It was so lame I had to remove it from my phone.  Now every time i get a new download from amazon i have to see this disappointment in the list to be installed and remember how bad it was.  I am glad it was the free app of the day because if i had bought this crap i would be really really disappointed.  I hope amazon gets to recover some of the losses it has suffered from giving away this junk even if it was just a dime each download it would be too much.  Wish I could remove it from my list and my memories.  Thank you Amazon for FAOTD but this one was a loser.

B0058P7KUA|4.0|Barry Steakfries: Bruce Campbell wanna be? He certainly fits the bill for a fun game! good action, but needs more levels :-)
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|The appeal of Return to Cranford is the chance to enjoy the further adventures of some of the most beloved characters from the first series.  Although Return doesn't have quite the same magic, I enjoyed it very much and will be watching both parts again in the future.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|The game would be great,  but the control buttons keep moving around the screen! Makes it hard to shoot things.
0061353248|5.0|Great book!  I've given copies to teachers - Presents for High School graduation - Great gift for someone who is fascinated by how our minds work.  When you see the end results of tests, and how people react and minds fed, it is amusing.  Makes you wonder how you would have reacted without this knowledge.  Recommend this book for anyone who loves to grow intellectually and have fun doing it.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is very fun.  Good graphics and fun story.  Check it out.  Black screen when I first started but worked fine the second time.  Galaxy S running 2.3.3
B004T0XYM8|5.0|I´m to young to have seen \\"Once upon a time in the west\\" in the cinema, but I have owned this movie in 4:3 Video-format, 16:9 DVD-format (widescreen) and now this Blu-ray with English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio/ AVC (50 Gb). I prefered the restored version.  The restored version was shown in one small cinema in Copenhagen, Denmark in around two weeks last sommer (2010) as the restored the Good, the bad and the ugly in (2009), and I know I just have to wait around a year for bying the restored Bluray-vesion. I will not commend or anylize the restoring of this movie, because the technique from 1968 was different from now (2011). But I can recommend all human beings in the world with a Bluray-player to buy \\"Once upon a time in the west\\" NOW!!! A great reborn masterpiece.     Ole Nielsen, Denmark
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This collector's set is a must have for any serious Bruce fans. I can't recommend this highly enough. The DVDs and CDs are housed in what looks like and old spiral notebook. The pages inside have notes, lyrics, scribbles that makes it look like Bruce's very own notes and thoughts (in the end, they actually are his lyrics and notes <grin>). There is enough digital material to keep you busy for ages.    With the recent death of \\"The Big Man\\", Clarence Clemmons, this collection becomes even more relevant. A friend turned me onto this collector's set and here is a short quote of something he pointed out to me after I had made the purchase:              \\"You are in for a treat.  There is so much in there.\\"              \\"As an added emotional impact with the recent news on Clarence, on one of the DVD's, there is a late 2009              live performance by the band of the full Darkness album start to finish.  It is performed in an empty              Paramount Theater.\\"    And that is just a sliver of what you get with this set.    Here's looking to \\"meet you further on up the road\\", Big Man. You'll be sorely missed.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I had to give todays free game 5 stars after being addicted to it for the past two hours.  On the technical side, the game worked perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy S.  Age of Zombies is a dual stick overhead zombie killing fest (who doesn't love killing zombies).  The graphics are great and the achievements and Open Feint integration make levels worthwhile to go back and try to beat your own top score.  Seriously fun game and worth every penny (even if you had to pay full price for it).
B0058P7KUA|1.0|Downloaded for Galaxy Tab 10.1, installs, starts with menu, but once you start the game it is a blank map with no towers.  The OS back home keys don't even allow you to exit. FAIL
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot. It reminds me of a game called SMASH TV back in the NES era. It's a very action packed and makes good use of the touch screen for the most part. My only complaint is that sometimes the controls seem a little buggy as the joysticks disappear and reappear if you take your thumbs off the screen. The action is constant and I especially loved picking up a buzz saw and mowing down 100+ zombies in a single combo. Achievements are a plus as well. I beat it rather quickly, but it was such a blur that I would love to play this again in my downtime. One of my top five Android games that I've played so far. (I'm using an HTC Thunderbolt and it works with no hiccups.)
1416955070|2.0|I finished this book in one day and the only reason why I finished the book was because of Hodges and Luke. They were the only midly interesting characters in the book. I found their troubles more interesting than Clary's \\"problems\\". Now let us remember that Hodges and Luke were suppose to be minor characters and Clary the main protagonist.    Everyone else except Hodges and Luke were so lame, boring, and inconsistent that I thought the book was a joke. Clary is a flat Mary Sue. Simon is just there and only used as a plot device to strengthen Draco... oh I am sorry Jace and Clary's \\"romantic\\" relationship. Jace is your typical misunderstood bad boy *yawn*. Valentine did not make me in any way hate him despite all the horrible things he had done. I blame the author for failing to make a powerful and deep villain. Also, Valentine seems to be a carbon copy of Voldemort.Isabella and Alec are just there to feed Clary's ego and make her a more likable character to the reader.     The only reason why I gave it two star was because I liked the idea of Shadowhunters but too bad the main characters were so lame that they ruined the plot for me
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this video!! She totally kicks your butt and makes you feel like you want to die, however, it is GREAT!! I highly recommend.

B0058P7KUA|4.0|For being the free app of the day I can't complain. Not something I would pay for but it's a little fun. I lost interest in it kind of fast.
B000021Y77|5.0|Fast paced and intense Run Lola Run is exactly what you would expect of film with its title. I'm not going to waste time on a synopsis but I was completely sucked in to the high speed drama the repititive premise induces and was left intrigued and pretty much blown away by its exploration of actions and their corresponding reactions. A great length and great soundtrack for techno lovers Run Lola Run is a must see.
0439023513|5.0|Excellent trilogy, sad to see it come to an end with book 3, but couldn't stop reading it. Had to see how everything turned out. Excellent writing to get and hold my attention on subject matter that generally does not interest me.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First of all I am a huge Clint Mansell fan and it's no wonder he developed a cult following after this soundtrack. It is amazing and makes the movie that much more impactful. This film just goes to show the power music has over a film. That aside the film itself is a completely sensorial experience. Watching the progression and destruction of these characters you feel as if you yourself are the addict and as the brilliance in shot composition deteriorates so does the characters and audience members along the way. You feel and see what the feel and see and you feel the hunger and desperation for their chosen vice. A beautifully heartbreaking portrayal of addiction and destruction that left me completely engrossed, repelled, and sucked dry of all emotion by the end of the rollercoaster of a film.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|The murder mystery part of this movie was alright. I definitely found myself looking for clues and suspecting multiple different characters throughout the course of the movie. The romantic portions of the film, however, were not well-executed. The dialogue and plot developments between the heroine and her love interests was very forced and did not feel natural or intimate at all. It was clear that the director was that of the Twilight saga movies. I would suggest skipping this film and watching Sleepy Hollow instead, which it was unable to emulate.
B003UESJHO|5.0|This film is worth watching for the acting by Christian Bale alone, but I truly want to commend the screenwriter and crew for doing such a phenomenal job in creating an all encompassing world for these actors to thrive in. The story itself, nothing new, still manages to weave an intricate and complicated plotline as the two lives of these boxers plays out and presents a perfect setting for Bale and company to shine. Definitely something worth checking out.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|I only played the first couple of rounds but that was enough to bore me.  The maps are so small you really do nothing more than run in a circle.  Your basic weapon is a joke so it's all about running away while you wait for weapon upgrades. Bigger maps and a sincere weapon upgrade system would do wonders for this game.     The developer is obviously trying to be witty with the dialogue, but it comes off as juvenile (in a bad way) and tired.      I would have given this a 3 star rating if it wasn't for OpenFeint.  Developers need to realize people do not want OpenFeint.  And if they are going to bundle it into their games it shouldn't start up automatically when you load the game. I'm guessing half of the errors people are getting from the game not loading are actually related to OpenFeint not loading.  It's just additional bloat.  Including OpenFeint dropped Age of Zombies down to a 2-star rating for me.
1433527189|2.0|As of July 7, 2011, Amazon.com changed the price of the ESV Bible and this good 400+ reviews are for   [...]  ESV Study Bible (TruTone, Natural Brown) and raised the price of this TruTone Bible by 50%.

I also purchased this Bible pictured in thsi current page and the stiches im pink leather is very coarse.

076115678X|5.0|Easy and fun book to read about everything curly hair.  It explains the process of maintaining curly hair, from A to Z, even includes a DVD.  Best thing for me was reading about the testimonials and pictures of women who have accepted and learned to love their curly heads.  I had previously heard of Lorraine Massey and her recommendations; her products are nice, but they are not totally natural, still have chemicals in them.  The guide helped me to understand my hair type which has helped to ease my frustrations.  My hair does look healthier and prettier.
0307595862|5.0|Once again, the Scandinavians do not disappoint. After reading and enjoying the works of Karin Fossum, Henning Mankell, Johan Theorin,Camilla Lundsberg, Arnaldur Indridasson, and of course Steig Larssen, I was more than happy to try a new author (well, new to me). The Snowman is the first Jo Nesbo novel I've read, and I must say I was very impressed. It is a dark, twisted story with plenty of twists and turns, and many characters to boot. The storyline is rich and complex, but Nesbo is a master storyteller and in his capable hands, the plot flourishes and entices the reader to keep on reading, while trying to unravel the mystery that is the Snowman.<br /><br />Harry Hole, recovering alcoholic and detective extraordinaire finds himself trying to solve a complex case. Birte Becker, an attractive woman, mother and wife, is reported missing. The only clue left is the discovery of her beloved pink scarf (a present from her son) wrapped around a snowman. As Harry Hole and his partner, the attractive young Katrine Bratt dig deeper, they discover an unpleasant and chilling fact - over the years, a startling number of women who are wives and mothers have gone missing, never to return. Who is stalking and preying upon these women? When another body is discovered, also a wife and mother, Hole reluctantly faces up to the fact that he has a serial killer on his hands, and works tirelessly to solve the case, even as he finds his own personal life collapsing around him.<br /><br />What made this such a rewarding read was the way the author constructed his plot - throughout the novel, I was piecing together the puzzle pieces, trying to figure out the connections between the victims, the motive, and how Hole goes about solving the case. The story is multi-layered and the main characters are deeply complex - there's Harry Hole the 'tortured' detective who is haunted by the ghosts of his past; there's Katrine Bratt, newly assigned to Hole and who appears to be harboring secrets of her own; and, there's the Snowman, a ruthless and merciless killer bent on his twisted agenda. Even the minor characters are interesting, thanks to the way Nesbo weaves them into the story - each character has his/her own story, and this proves important in the overall picture. This is one of those crime novels that had me thinking about the story long after I had finished reading it. Highly recommended.'s the Snowman, a ruthless and merciless killer bent on his twisted agenda.

140053271X|5.0|I've had all the other Nook's and this is the first that I truly love.  The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Im by no means a Depp fan but if you enjoyed the oddworld stranger series, you will appreciate this movie very much.  That was my first and last impression.  I see alot of \\"parents\\" complaining this is not a kids movie.  I dont believe it was touted as one.  Neighter was Pirates of the Carribean.      We've watched it a couple of times over the past week or so and it keeps my daughers' intrest.  No she doesn't get the story or the story line nor care about it.  If they do mention the world hell once or twice, it falls on deaf ears.  Most of the characters a little crazy kooky but there is so much going on from one scene to the next, there is never a dull moment.    Personally I love it, finaly something a little different in an animation than watching the same old cut dry and bland, built for money machines like toy story, cars and I dunno kung fu panda.  Pixar move over, take a big step sideways actually.
0525425578|5.0|A joy to red.   Grisham picks up with the characters from the first Kid Lawyer book without a lot of recallling details about them all. Theo has matured; the Gresham humor is just right, and we don't have intricate information as inthe regular novels.  I loved it.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Cary Fukunaga has directed an ethereal version of Charlotte Brontë's oft-adapted novel Jane Eyre. The film's muted visuals convey the gothic story's mystery while hinting at its internal passions.    Our heroine Jane Eyre's (Amelia Clarkson) youth involves characters who resemble the grim child abusers in a Charles Dickens novel. The plot's pace quickens once Jane (Mia Wasikowska) reaches young adulthood and moves to Thornfield Manor, a forbidding castle surrounded by equally impressive grounds. There she encounters housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) and begins tutoring the lord's French ward Adele (Romy Settbon Moore). Mrs. Fairfax tells Jane that Lord Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) has moods that are as unpredictable as his travels. Jane feels drawn to Rochester, even though she feels that the more she learns about him, the less she knows.    Here Jane's renowned \\"plainness\\" comes from her soft features and downtrodden position. Wasikowska's youth contributes to the character's believable confusion and sexual curiosity. Most importantly, she conveys Jane's stoicism, wisdom, and imagination. Fassbender's Rochester is slightly frightening but magnetic, amusing, and acutely observant. He tells Jane that she is no more \\"naturally austere, any more than [he is] naturally vicious.\\" She is as sharp, and correctly describes him as \\"the most phantom-like of all\\" her \\"unreal\\" experiences at Thornfield. Fukanaga brings out the novel's poetic language, making mere exchanges of words more intense and erotic than many a lovemaking scene.    Inspired by Northern English folk music and gypsy fiddling, Daro Marianelli's sweetly passionate score is haunting. Yet the film's painterly aesthetics, from a stormy sunset to the resonant final image, is the movie's most prominent aspect. While Fukunaga's attention to historical detail lends a realistic rawness, the movie's exquisite colors convey a fairy-tale-like quality, accentuating Rochester and Jane's allusions to magic.Thornfield is alternately beautiful and menacing. A naturally-lit nude painting evokes a sense both ominous and sensual, much like Jane's attraction to Rochester. An individual who feels trapped is silhouetted against a window showcasing other worlds. Jane and Rochester are filmed outside in a way that makes them appear to be spirits of nature.    Wasikowska sometimes underplays the deceptively tame Jane, and Fassbender is occasionally too dramatic. On the surface, this is a straightforward if suspenseful adaptation of Brontë's classic melodrama. But beneath is a rapturous, even transcendent tale.

B0058P7KUA|3.0|The rounds are nice and short. Mass zombie slaying will probably never get old. But on two different tablets, the game loses track of the thumbs over the controls. Suddenly the guns will stop firing, or worse, Barry will stop moving as the zombies surround him and game over. Using fixed controls instead of the floating ones is even worse. With the controls hopefully fixed in an update and this game will rock.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Lightning killed the integrated Intel Pro 100M NIC on my wife's 2003 vintage Dell Dimension XPS.  I ordered this Intel card because of all of the good reviews.  I ordered the card at 5:16 A.M. Thursday and Fedex delivered it to my door at 5:30 P.M. Friday, the next day.  Ten minutes later I was up and running at high speed.  Thanks to the good advice I received from the good folks at Virtual Dr tech forums I had a plan of action.  I disabled the integrated card in the BIOs, then I shut down and installed the new Intel card in the bottom most open PCI slot, then I booted up and when Windows detected the new hardware I put in the software disc that came with the card.  Viola, I was up and running.  It couldn't have been easier.  The card works great.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This is a gut-wrenching movie that illustrates the horror of the holocaust and the Nazi machine that turned the world inside-out.  The story includes all of the elements of an engaging, provoking movie. It leads to a tragic climax that truly brings home the devastation of the evil that millions in the world swore never to forget.<br /><br />I think the PG-13 rating is correct. It is quite disturbing due to the events -- not to anything too graphic.
0553386794|4.0|This book is good -- really good, actually, although at over 800 pages, I did certainly grow weary of it by the end (and to think it's only the first in a series!). What distinguishes this as being superior to other books in this genre is Martin's better writing, his impeccable eye for the details of the story, his character development (with one exception as noted below), and the quality of the story itself: it fits together harmoniously, while still having many tantalizing clues about possible storyline developments in the subsequent installments. The only area where Martin falls is in his decidedly off-putting and unsexy treatment of women in the story. There is plenty of rape, \\"wetly glistening manhood,\\" and abuse, visited upon his female characters, who are about as nuanced as cardboard cutouts. Women are either weak, grasping and incompetent, or so stern as to be sexless and mannish (which is a form of elevating compliment from Martin -- if only women could be men, they'd be so much cooler!). This comes across to me as the domination fantasies of a geek who never got laid, and it's not much fun to read. If you can get past this failing, or not focus on it overmuch, you will probably enjoy this book. Good fantasy or science fiction gives you a world you can get lost in, if not exactly believe in, and here, Martin succeeds entirely.

B00009W0U4|3.0|Bottom line is that the events and harrowing images presented in `Irreversible' are just that, completely irreversible.  You will not be able to shake the imagery, and so for those of you who do not wish to subject yourself to senseless and gut wrenching acts of violence and rape, please excuse yourself from this page and consider watching a different movie.  That isn't to say that those who watch this film are watching it because they enjoy those things (I hope that NO ONE particularly `enjoys' this film) but for those of us who embrace the ideals behind cinematic expression, `Irreversible' is a film that we want to see, at least once, in order to appreciate the directorial vision and actorly bravado.<br /><br />In other words; if you watch films solely for entertainment purposes, WALK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />I'll just yell minor spoilers here so no one gets upset, although I can't really accept that these are spoilers since the main topic of discussion with regard to this film is the events I'll relay in the following, and they really are things every viewer should know BEFORE going in because these are not surprises you want to encounter when watching a film; trust me.<br /><br />`Irreversible' is told in counter-chronological order; starting at the very end of this tragic tale and working its way backwards to the tender beginnings.  Opening with disturbing depictions of rampant sex as the two main characters weave their way through a claustrophobic gay-club in search of a man responsible for an outlandish atrocity; `Irreversible' immediately starts to live up to its name.  When twenty minutes of absurd camera angles and dimly lit sexual encounters ends with one of the most disturbing murders I've seen on film, I was beginning to wonder if this was going to really be worth my cinematic `interest'.  As the clock ticked backwards, another gross act of violence took place; that being the now nearly legendary rape scene that clocks in at nine minutes and is, quite honestly, one of the most disturbing sequences I've seen put to film.  In fact, my cinematic curiosities were not enough to keep my eyes open and I missed a good chunk of it because I didn't want to watch...I just couldn't.<br /><br />So, with two horrific images lodged in my brain for all time; was this venture worth it?  Yes and no.  From a visionary standpoint, the film has its highlights, but for the most part I found it slightly underdeveloped.  The script was never really complete; nothing more than a basic idea, and that was admitted by the film's director.  The dialog was largely adlibbed, but that really wasn't the issue, especially since the lack of direct dialog added to the more panicked and natural state of the characters.  The main issue I have with what director Gaspar Noe did here is that he played too heavily on gimmick to create an emotional response that felt forced and manipulative in the end.<br /><br />I am not opposed to irony, but `Irreversible' was not a film that NEEDED that to succeed.  In fact, the irony of the film's ending (and the dialog that surrounded some of the preposterous `premonitions') took away from the power of the film's core.<br /><br />But, one thing that `Irreversible' has in spades is powerful performances, and they really don't get any better than this.  In all honesty, Monica Bellucci delivers what may be the best supporting performance of the aughts here.  She slips so far beneath the skin of Alex that you feel her every crippling emotion.  While the rape scene is horrific to watch, the aftermath is even more disturbing because it feels so raw.  Just look at her hands; the panicked way she beats them against the ground.  You can feel her pain in your gut.  Vincent Cassell is also fantastic here; delivering a fiery performance for the film's first (or should I say last) half and then switching gears for a charmingly immature take on a playboy.  Albert Dupontel is also superb here.<br /><br />The acting is the film's largest saving grace, for it injects so much humanity into the film's masochistic core.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I feel as though I can't really recommend this film.  Gaspar Noe went out of his way to disgust and repulse the audience that he lost something key in the process.  `Irreversible' becomes almost too consumed with its own horrors to deliver something that feels truly important.  Instead it feels merely stylized and self-absorbed.  The film's conclusion is too prophetic (especially the conversation between Alex and Marcus while lounging around their apartment naked) for it to be taken seriously, and that is probably where the film's construction is the biggest downfall.  Had that conversation taken place on the outset of the film then maybe the eventualities of the evening would have delivered a more severe blow, but having the conversation take place AFTER we witness the atrocities of the evening almost make the dialog feel foolish and insulting; like the whole film is a joke.<br /><br />If that makes any sense.<br /><br />I understand the idea behind the reverse-chronological delivery being akin to the film's title, taking a stab at the idea of `reversing' the worst night of their lives, but the script and the film's construction are not balanced here.  One cannot work with the other and so something had to change to make this film what it needed to be.manity into the film's masochistic core.

B004WJREPO|5.0|Great package. It worth any cent you spend on it. I am not going to waste my and your time talking abou the album itself once threre is a lot of reviews about it. I am rating the package and the quality of the remaster wich is simply wonderful.   5 stars for the remaster, the book, the package, the extras (2 cds and 1 dvd)and the download quality.  4 stars for the album itself.  3 star for the way the Cds are attached on the back cover of the book...       Paul has made a wonderful job here as he did on Band on the Run and Mccartney. Over the years Mccartney II has become better and better. I would not recomended this album if you are not a fan of Paul, but if you are, the Delux Edition is the one to have.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book! I was hooked from the first page and read it in a few hours. Like many other reviewers, the book was not what I expected but definitely in a delightful way.  The photographs and handwritten letters added an extra dimension to the story, although some were slightly difficult to read/view on a kindle.  I was slightly disappointed in the abrupt ending but hopefully it means that there is a sequel in the works. Overall a very engrossing, quick read. Highly recommend!
B001375PI6|5.0|British author John LeCarre went on to write a bookshelf of excellent spy novels, but his masterpiece may have been 1963's \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\", a brillant, even definitive evocation of the harsh moral ambiguity of the Cold War.<br /><br />At the center of the novel is British spy Alec Leamas, tough, dedicated, but dangerously close to burn-out.  Leamas is recalled to London after a defecting double agent is killed trying to cross the Berlin Wall that divides Communist East Berlin from Democratic West Berlin.  Leamas is asked by the Secret Service to pretend to defect in order to get close to another Communist agent in East Berlin.<br /><br />In order to provide Leamas with his bonafides in the East, the Secret Services pensions him off on a pittance.  Leamas will fail at life after the Service,  including falling in love with Liz Gold, the young secretary of a London Communist Cell.  Ultimately, he will be approached to defect.<br /><br />In East Berlin, Leamas will find himself in the middle of a power stuggle within the East German Secret Service.  Leamas will discover that all is not as it seems, and betrayal can run many ways, all of them dangerous.<br /><br />Many of the principal characters in \\"In From The Cold\\", such as the spy chief called Control, and British agents George Smiley and Peter Guillam, would appear in some of LeCarre's later novels, most notably the trilogy that begins with \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" is very highly reocmmended to fans of John LeCarre's superbly cynical espionage novels.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|Pretty predictable as a movie but fun none the less. I could have gone for more character development as it seemed to try and do yet another book rip off but not nearly as well as others recently have.

B00006JKOM|3.0|Jethro Tull had been making side long progressive rock albums with the band's folk elements mixed in that \\"Too Old Too Rock and Roll: Too Young To Die\\" registered shock waves among the band's faithful. Ten songs (originally), short by Tull standards, and an aggressive storyline that Ian Anderson insists to this day was not about him about one \\"Ray Lomas,\\" who is an old leather/biker rocker who can't abide by these new punks who can \\"live and die upon your cross of platinum.\\" The comic strip from the inner sleeve pictures Ray to be more than a little bit similar to Anderson, and the cover image of \\"Ray\\" throwing a disrespectful fist to the masses only threw more gasoline on the fire.<br /><br />However. \\"Too Old To RnR\\" has aged a lot better than it has been given credit for. In the liner notes, Anderson asserts that the album was conceived to be a stage play about Lomas' rise from Game Show winner (\\"Quizz Kidd\\") who comes to the big city to discover he's a man out of time (\\"From A Deadbeat to An Old Greaser\\") until he just can't take it anymore (the title track). But before you know it, the cycle brings Ray's stylistic world back into fashion and he's headed back to the top (\\"The Chequered Flag\\"). Add a pair of bonus tracks (the delightful \\"A Small Cigar,\\" which sounds like it would have come between \\"Big Dipper\\" and the title song in the storyline, and \\"Strip Cartoon\\"), and you round out this reissue.<br /><br />Musically, TOTRNR is a middling Tull effort, but sounds like it was set up from \\"War Child\\" and that album's more concise compositions. The title track is still one of my favorite Jethro Tull songs, and among the rest, I have a fondness for \\"Salamander\\" and \\"Big Dipper.\\" Probably for Tull completists only as it marks a transition from the wide ranging epics of the past towards the more folkish and concise albums in the future.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Main Street Indicts Wall Street<br /><br />It's amazing what can happen when a camera is placed in a room before people who have agendas, and normally demure and sophisticated professional types grant interviews, \\"against my better judgment\\" then right before our eyes, they become snarling, self serving hypocrites. But that's what happens in Inside Job, an Oscar winning documentary about the 2008 financial meltdown and the ensuing Great Recession in which 40% of the world's wealth was wiped out, almost overnight.<br /><br />The film does an outstanding job explaining \\"securitization\\", the process by which your mortgage gets sold by your local bank to a Wall Street investment bank which cobbles it together with hundreds of other mortgages to form a security which is then sold to investors around the world.  The resulting CDO's as they were called, became Exhibit A in the financial crisis, along with SIV's, RMB's and a host of other securities whose value was, as Humphrey Bogart put it in The Maltese Falcon, \\"the stuff dreams are made of.\\"<br /><br />But if the financial crisis of 2008 has a villain, it's probably a device called the credit default swap, and the film did a great job explaining what these are.  The film could have driven home the villainy of these devices by showing that of the $700 billion dollars in bailout money authorized by American taxpayers at least a third of it went to taking these devices off the books of the banks that bought them.<br /><br />The film also did an outstanding job in highlighting the peculiarly American custom of rewarding failure.  It pointed out the outrageous rewards given to Merrill Lynch CEOs Stan O'Neil and his successor John Thain for nearly bankrupting the once great brokerage firm and driving it into the arms of Bank of America.  The producers could have been even tougher.  Wachovia, a $600 billion dollar organization at the time, came within a few hours of bankruptcy and its CEO walked off with a $14 million dollar sendoff package.<br /><br />Finally, there should have been an interview with Meredith Whitney, the analyst who's call on Citibank finally got the attention of asleep-at-the-switch Washington regulators,but all in all, this film is an important record of the nightmare that greed created.there should have been an interview with Meredith Whitney, the analyst who's call on Citibank finally got the attention of asleep-at-the-switch Washington regulators,but all in all, this film is an important record of the nightmare that greed created.
0312600844|5.0|Few books bring me back for a second read, and no other book has done so in less than one year. I have never before reviewed a book on Amazon but the negative reviews for this book have inspired me. This is not fluff fiction. This is not summer beach reading. This is solid American fiction at its best. If Dan Brown's writing is a rapid white-capped stream, Franzen's is a calm flowing river, powerful with depth and width.
B0038NN3B4|1.0|I love the old Atkins Diet books.  They are the only diets that have worked for me and I feel great on them, and I love my Amazon Kindle.  As a \\"Grey Nomad,\\" (an older Australian travelling around the continent's wildernesses in a caravan,) I am able to carry a library in my handbag, but woe is me.  The new Atkins book is not available on Kindle in Australia.  Let's hope it becomes available soon for those of us in the Antipodies.
0307272702|5.0|Mr Taubes does an excellent job reviewing the facts about how the body produces fat from carbohydrates.  His book made me very aware of the amount of sugar and carbohydrates contained in the processed foods in the market place and the misguided dietary studies based on the calories in/calories out assumptions widely accepted by \\"nutritionists\\".  We have been duped by bad science for years. This is a must read for anyone interested in eating healthy and understanding the diabetes epidemic in our society.  I purchased 6 additional copies and passed them out to my family and friends.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|To put it simply this album is amazing. Justin took a huge leap in changing his style. In Bon Iver's first album, Justin, created an emotionally haunting and beautiful album. In my opinion he had a lot to live up to. Once he announced that album number 2 was in the making it immediately became one of my most anticipated albums of all time. Bon Iver opens up with a bang and ends on a different note. The album is very similar to the first one, emotionally charged, but in different ways. While the first one makes you think that Justin is the saddest person in the world, his sophomore album has sad and happy emotions blending through it. I'd definitely recommend this album, if you can pick it up on vinyl I would say do that. It adds so much more to the musical experience. Get it, and help this guy create more music.
B0051MKNV8|3.0|Just got back from a 12 hour flight where I saw this on the plane. I also enjoyed it quite a bit too. I teach psychology and like the brain pill idea to make you smarter and I like the character changes. I am would have like more explanation (even if it was pseudo-science of course and how it works and especially the after effects/side effects). Overall, the movie was gripping but my biggest problem is for someone that is suppose to be so very very hyper intelligent on the drug, why did he (and the others on it) make so many mistakes? SPOILERS COMING...............................................................................................................<br /><br />-why not get advanced knowledge in chemistry early and learn how to make the drug himself before running out, and improve on it early too?<br />-with all the money he was making, why not pay off the Russian RIGHT AWAY, that would have really helped him<br />  -and there's more of these things<br />-also, why doesn't his super secure apartment have an alarm hooked to the police of a cell phone call would have done it, duh.<br /><br />anyway, would love to hear comments if you're still reading as this means you probably watched it already.

B001AQT0ZO|4.0|Baz has done a great job on this modern re-telling of Shakespeare's classic story!

0525476881|4.0|Reading any John Green book is a treat. I'm usually sucked in from the first paragraph. I don't think this is his strongest work, but it's still a good book. As always, entertaining and quirky supporting characters make the story more than a one-note plot. I loved the use of graphs and footnotes to illustrate Colin's obsession with a theorum to predict his future relationships. Yes, it's a little unbelievable that such a socially awkward kid would have had 19 girlfriends by the time he was 18, let alone 19 NAMED KATHERINE), but I suspend disbelief here for sake of a clever story.
6305907145|4.0|This adaption isn't as bad as others are making it out to be on here. Sure, if you're a hardcore Austen fan, then you'll be up in arms, but if you enjoy an interesting period film, then relax and take it for what it is. Contrary to the book, this Fanny is endearing, and you find yourself rooting for her, which is important, since the story is really about her to begin with. I think it was fairly well-casted, apart from Mariah, and it was an enjoyable 112 minutes.    I should warn you, there are moments of vulgarity, involving overly graphic sketches of rape, and a sudden, unexpected nude scene. That alone is probably why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Those two moments seemed out of place.

B004EPYZU8|1.0|I knew I was in trouble after only watching about 2 minutes of this truly wretched movie.Computer generated effects and terrible music vidoes does not a movie make. They literaly spent hundreds of dollars on the script. I feel that a single star rating is much to generous, but Amazon does not give a zero star option. This movie is a true pantload!
B0039SFKSW|1.0|Asia's latest pop-rock effort is, well, more of the same.    Pop. Rock. Just like the candy.    There is absolutely nothing substantial or worthwhile here. Pretty much just a collection of songs written for an aging fan base that will not or simply cannot accept the fact that their favorite 80s band has been treading water for nearly 3 decades. Wetton and company have not been relevant since 1982. If you want progressive rock, look to Rush...rock-solid musicianship coupled with well-crafted lyrics.

0307716511|5.0|The mistake I made when reading this book is I started it when there was too much going on around me.  To read this book properly, you need to pack a lunch and go to the beach or a quiet room.<br /><br />When Beatrice received word that her sister Tess has committed suicide after the death of her baby she goes to London to arrange for the funeral.  She soon realizes that maybe Tess's death was murder.  But was it her married lover or maybe the guy who was stalking her?  Why are the notes made during the delivery of her baby missing?<br /><br />The book is written in the form of a letter to her sister and it jumps around quite a lot.  At first it was confusing but on reflection it was the best way it could have been written.<br /><br />It's original, different and really good.  When I finished it, all I could say was \\"Wow\\"! One of the most unique books you will read this year.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I have played all the Angry Birds without problems. Starting with two updates ago it has gotten buggy, with frequent animation freezes and delayed response to input.

I was unhappy with the bugginess. The force close issue in Picnic may drive me away from Angry Birds altogether.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|I don't feel it necessary to comment on this production as it has already been done so very eloquently (and not so) many times over already here.  Suffice to say I concur with the majority... a splendid production in every way!!! I'm so thankful I had the good fortune to catch it on the big screen and now own the blu-ray to view endlessly.      I would like to just make one comment concerning the main source of irritation to many viewers, i.e. Nick Jonas.  I have to admit that I also strongly resented his appearance and vocalization initially, but after several viewings I have come to the conclusion that he is either not all that bad considering the role he is playing or that the otherwise strong cast makes his relative inferiority not so important after all.  It also helps that I shut Michael Ball out of my mind as I'm listening to him.  If I want to hear Michael Ball I have the 10th anniversary video.  And like one other reviewer said, there's no way Michael Ball could have been carried on or off the stage by Jean Valjean.  Nuff said about that.    What I really want to say is, if you haven't read the book that this awesome musical is based on, please consider doing so.  Trust me, if you love the musical, you'll only increase your love and appreciation of it.  Boublil and Schonberg did an excellent job of transmitting the spirit of Victor Hugo's masterpiece considering their limitations (mainly that of time).  And for those who may never read the book, the fact that even this much of it is made known to the world is wonderful.  In fact I think Hugo himself would be pleased. And there are many who may not care to go any deeper, and that's fine.  But there is so much more contained in the book that you miss out on.  Not just in the story itself but even more importantly in the way Hugo tells the story. Admittedly, it is quite a tome, but even if you skip the detailed historical bits that go on and on for pages and pages (as I did my first reading... I am now on my third reading and taking the time to even read those) you will get a much fuller view of the characters and their interactions as well as their thought processes, and have your literary fancy tickled meanwhile.     Anyway, I could go on and on but I realize this is not the place to review the book.  I just felt compelled to remind all you lovers of the musical out there that music, lights, action and all, it is only a semblance (albeit an excellent one) of it's source, Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\". Do yourself a favor and please read the book.

B0056WODZ0|5.0|Dragon Bound is an engaging story from the first page. The story is very is very well written with strong lead charactors.  The premise of elder races (faries, dragons, goblins) living hand in hand with the human races is great and I liked how their is pockets of another world living right along side ours.  This is a book with a story that is well developed before the romance starts and I must say that the smex scenes are steamy.  Out hero is an Alpha male of the first degree and the heroine is a strong female lead without going to Zena on us.  Their are plenty of well developed secondary charactors and plenty of twists and turns.  I have already pre ordered the second in the series.  This book is a definate keeper which I will read many times.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|The plot of this detective story keeps you reading, but try not to wince at the dreadful characterization. There wasn't anything close to resembling a real human being in this story, and almost all of the women are either whores or are borderline insane.
0756404738|4.0|I think most of us who've read this second book in the series have all agreed that it is not as good as the first.  The main flaws have been already pointed out numerous times, but I thought I'd add in my opinions anyway.<br /><br />First off, the good stuff.  Again, the author wrote a good novel.  Overall, I enjoyed it and recommend it.  For me, this is the story of how Kvothe went off on an adventure and truly learned the name of the wind.  I think that's what this novel was mostly about.  Kvothe's ultimate development as a namer.  However, there were some issues that didn't make a lot of sense.  I'd like to discuss those.<br /><br />We know, from the first book, that Kvothe has accomplished great deeds, he has a Fae disciple, and is currently \\"hiding out\\" as a small-village inn keeper basically waiting to die.  We also know he no longer plays the lute and apparently can't perform any \\"magic\\" anymore.<br /><br />We don't know why, and this book doesn't bring us any closer to those answers.  We just basically get more of the same history of Kvothe for basically one year.  Book one of this series basically covered Kvothe's birth to 15 or 16 years old or so.  Book two covers basically one year of Kvothe's life.  It's certainly an eventful year, but we spend a great deal of time on things that perhaps didn't need all that much time and we gloss over a lot of events too.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br />It's hard to discuss this book without spoilers.  Be aware I'm about to spoil things here:<br /><br />Some things that didn't make sense in this book:<br /><br />1.  Kvothe takes a trip from the University to the Maer on a ship that sinks.  He's robbed multiple times, he looses the Gram he created, but throughout it all he keeps an apparently expensive lute (with case).  How does someone do that?  \\"Here, take my money and my shoes, but don't take my lute?\\"  I can understand that having Kvothe enter a new city penniless makes for bigger drama, but this situation didn't make much sense.<br /><br />Likewise, I got really, really tired of Kvothe being penniless.  By the end of the book, he began to have cash, but does he need to be so poor all the time?  I found the whole pauper bit overdone and tiresome.<br /><br />2.  The whole \\"I chew on an herb every day so I won't father a child\\" deal is quite outrageous.  Okay.  This is a *fantasy* novel, so such an herb could possibly exist in a fantasy universe.  Let's give him the existence of such a wonder-herb.  But, he chews on it every day?  In preparation for sex but other than his sudden excursion into the Fae to have sex, he's never had sex before and doesn't seem to be indicating that's something he's been looking for.  We never see him searching for this wonder-herb, we never hear of it before, we never see him buying any, and he never discusses its existence prior to the sudden revelation that Kvothe has been primed and ready to have sex but not father a child for who knows how long.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />I hereby recommend any future fantasy author who wishes to include such a wonder-herb in his or her next novel call it the Rothfuss.  \\"I'd been chewing on some Rothfuss for a few days prior to entering that inn, so I knew the baby the tavern wench claimed was mine couldn't have been.\\"<br /><br />3.  Should we even begin to discuss the fact that an entire nation of seemingly intelligent people don't even begin to understand the basics of human propagation?  No, we shouldn't.  However, I fail to see the purpose of including this in the novel.  To make the Adem seem stupid?  To make it seem like they don't care about fatherhood and fathers aren't important?  I sort of got that somewhat anyway, but not entirely.<br /><br />4.  My biggest disappointment in the novel was when the current Kvothe attacked the two soldiers robbing his inn and lost, badly.  After all this, \\"I was trained by the Adem.\\" and \\"He's stronger than he looks.\\" (from Bast in the first book), he loses tocommon solders?  Honestly, I was ready to put down the novel at this point and stop reading the series all together.  Really?  He's that bad off now?  How did he forcibly stop a Fae Prince in book 1 but lose to two common thugs in book 2?  Does a day make that big of a difference in his skills?<br /><br />I do think the book indicated he may have intended to lose to the thugs, but I wasn't convinced.eries all together.  Really?

B0058ZWRVC|3.0|There was one thing about this movie that I found repulsive.  Stewart was born in 1990.  Ryan was born in 1976.  The movie was distributed in 2009, which means it was probably made in 2008.  Considering how young Stewart is and looks in this one, Ryan's character is probably at best creepy and probably a pedophile, something you just can't see from Ryan and the writers offer no character development to explain how either character could do what they did.  Ryan has unique star talent but his stage presence is likable and charming, so for him to play a creepy pedophile, significant character development is necessary and missing entirely from this movie.  Couple that with Stewart maybe being 18 but looking 16 at best, and non-pedophiles will probably find part of this story to be gross.      That said, the movie is an exceptional period piece if you're interested in the development of Stewart and Eisenberg as actors.  Both struggle with parts that are too adult for their real life stage of development, but both seem to get better at their roles as the movie progressed, meaning that you can actually watch these two transition from being child actors to adult actors and because of that I found the movie very interesting. At the beginning, Stewart is so uncomfortable playing a romantic role that it is hard to watch, but by the end of the movie (with someone her own age), she takes on a different glow altogether and is much more comfortable in the role.  You could speculate an entirely different outcome of her role in Twilight had she not done this movie first (this one was filmed only a few months before).  And much of the same can be said of Eisenberg but not as dramatically as Stewart.

Furthermore, I started having lower back pain and I was concerned working out would aggrivate it.  However, this video has relieved my back pain, given me more energy, and really increased my strength.  I think this video is the perfect blend. I do sweat, but I never feel over exerted. I feel better after doing this video every time.  The moves are simple to do, and there is a great variety of movement.  I am currently 31 weeks and I still feel great doing this video.  I'm sure I will do this one all the way to the end and even post partum.

0307272702|5.0|I would like to thank Gary Taubes for writing this book and getting this information out to the public. If anyone has seen the treatment of Mr. Taubes by media personalities, you realize the risks he has taken in order to inform the public about the truth behind the rising rates of obesity and diabetes in the last three decades ever since everyone started telling us to eat low-fat and high-carb. This book is highly recommended for anyone who has wondered why some people get fat and others don't, and maybe why their own efforts over the years to keep their weight under control have failed when trying to follow the advice of nutritionists, doctors, dieticians, and fitness specialists. I personally am in the process of making sweeping lifestyle changes in accordance with the scientifically-backed and intuitive information in this book and others like it. This book, I hope, will change the world! Thank you Mr. Taubes!

B002JVWR9U|5.0|My mother arrived for a weekend visit with Vampire Diaries First Season in tow.  My goal was to dote on her during her stay, watching whatever she wanted to watch, serving whatever she wanted to have at meal times.  I was not immediately receptive to The Vampire Diaries as I am a devoted Twilight fan, as is she.  After the first episode, she asked if we could watch another...again the answer was yes because she wanted this.  At the end of the weekend she returned to her home leaving her Vampire Diaries with me...her 'mother knows best' smirk securely in place.  I could not return it until after watching it twice and learning that the original books were written in the early 1990's convincing me that this is not a Twilight knockoff, but a genuine work.  Upon learning that, and reflecting on the new found common ground for me to share with my mother, I am hooked.  Her copy was eventually returned to her and I ordered a copy of my own.  Now we enjoy \\"VD\\" weekends where we get together and watch our favorite show, with our husbands' blessings.  The characters are well developed and the plot is rarely transparent.  When the actors say in interviews that they can't wait to see the next script to see what happens, you know you have a good one.  The merchant was Frank's Online Store, 973-272-4142.  They had very competitive prices and shipped immediately.  As an Amazon Prime member, my order arrived within two days in exceptional packaging.  This transaction definitely rates a 'do-over' as I will happily order again when other products of interest come available.

B004EPZ07K|5.0|I went to see this movie being very excited and also somewhat nervous after hearing so many negative reviews (which I normally do not pay too much heed, but I was highly anticipating this movie), and being a big comicbook fan I had hoped the movie would have been received better. I was greatly surprized to find that it was immensely enjoyable, and I was confounded as to why there was such a general dislike for the film. The story is simple and characters somewhat campy, but it works really well for a typical super-hero movie. I thought the special effects were great, with the minor exception of some of the aliens at times. I thought the inclusion of so many details for fans to spot was done excellently, without detracting from the story or causing unnecessary cunfusion to the general audience. It really was a nicely told story that kept its focus and allows for a great deal more to be shared with a continuing saga. I really hope to see a sequel!<br /><br />I feel that in a summer full of super-hero movies, Green Lantern was being too strongly compared with others, and not being allowed to be judged as it is. Instead, I hear things like 'Thor was better'. Well that may be, but this movie is nothing like Thor, and comparing them so generally doesn't do either one justice for what it acheives. Where Thor was about a god learning humility, Green Lantern is about a man overcoming fear, and proving that what makes humans great is their ability to be brave when afraid. I really liked that despite him starting out as kind of a jerk, Hal Jordan still chose to do what was right even when he felt incapable. I hope to see his character grow more in more films.<br /><br />Overall, I had a great time seeing this film, and while I haven't read a Green Lantern comic in over a decade (I am loosely familiar with the new rebirth and such, but I really am a big fan of the Emerald Twilight story and also Guy Gardner's character. The last Green Lantern comic I read was Kyle Rayner's origin, but anyway...), I thought this movie was one of the best interpretations of a comic to film that I have seen in a long time. I don't feel a comicbook movie necessarily needs to be as acurate to the source material as some people do, as long as the story told shares the message and tone. I feel Green Lantern did an excellent job conveying a realistic beginning to this super-hero. I put it on par with Iron-man and Batman Begins for its cinematic adaptation enjoyment level.<br /><br />08/25/2011 edit<br />I saw the movie again in the dollar theater. It is such a fun movie! The comedy comes off great, the villian is one of the creepiest, the constructs are a lot of fun to watch and the action is well-paced! Hopefully for a sequel we will get to see more interactions with the corps, and hopefully more adventures in space!.), I thought this movie was one of the best interpretations of a comic to film that I have seen in a long time.

B004QSQML8|2.0|I saw this movie when it was originally released. I remember thinking the story was weak and a bit silly. But I thought the makeup, especially on The Darkness and Meg Mucklebones was pretty awesome. This new release pretty much confirmed my original impressions. The picture on this Bluray looks pretty good. It's an older movie so my expectations were tempered. But colors, contrast, sharpness are all good. It's probably as good as the master print will allow it to be. But I found the audio very inconsistent and harsh. Dynamics were all over the place. Music and background noise competed with the main dialog and made it difficult to understand. I found myself continually turning it down to compensate. And indeed the story/plot is weak and pretty silly. Characters are thin and there is little or no background to help us understand or care about them. But some of the makeup still holds up. As \\"The Darkness\\", Tim Curry is barely recognizeable in his full body makeup. And Robert Picardo's \\"Meg Mucklebones\\" is awesome but only on screen for a few minutes. I like the extended version, but prefer Tangerine Dream's score. For me it fits the fantasy theme of this movie better. Overall though, the movie is pretty lame and Tangerine Dream's music and the makeup is not enough to redeem it. This is probably Ridley Scott's weakest movie.
0060526491|5.0|I bought this book a while ago and I love it. I keep it in a safe place so it won't get dusty or spilled on. The quality of the book is so precious. The paper is silky and easy to ruin with the oil on your fingers. I didn't really like the cover slip so I took it off and beneath was a classic looking Oyster Boy image! The book is morbid but cute. I would definatley buy this as a gift for a friend. Worth the price if you're a Burton fan.
B004G6009U|4.0|\\"Tangled\\" is an entertaining family film with quality animation, fun action sequences, and - though some gags are quite over done - some great humor.  The actors are spot on.  The film looks spectacular - especially the beautiful scenes of the lantern launchings. But don't just take my word for it.  My four-year-old daughter LOVES it!  (Though some parts might be a little scary for younger children, she didn't seem to be bothered, and there was nothing I deemed inappropriate.)<br /><br />The movie looks phenomenal on Blu-Ray - most CG movies do.  The extras on the disc are the standard Disney extras.  My one gripe is that you can only get the digital copy with the more expensive 3D Blu-Ray combo pack.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I was truly surprised on how this book got me so quick. For those of us who are heading into a forgetful time in our lives, just added to the suspense of this book. Its truly fun to have a summer read worthy of telling friends at the beach.
1416955070|2.0|I think I'm burned out on the YA urban fantasy books flooding the market.  This book takes a young female,Clary, and puts her in the hero role.  Although she is unsure of herself she manages to save the day.  Clary is average looking and is friends with another average looking boy, Simon.  However, Clary is drawn to Jace, who is attractive.  Clary doubts her looks; yet, still drools over him while being completely oblivious to her best friend's crush on her.  This sort of story line has been done sooooo much since Twilight (and yes it was done before Twilight - it just seems Twilight spurred on the YA paranormal/fantasy genre).  It was an alright read just not anything new.  The reason I didn't like it as opposed to thinking it was ok is because I'm not a big fan of the forbidden love angle.  I can do without the possibility of incest.

The Emperor cannot see the cloth himself, but pretends that he can for fear of appearing unfit for his position; his ministers do the same.

Suddenly, a child in the crowd, too young to understand the desirability of keeping up the pretense, blurts out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all and the cry is taken up by others. The Emperor cringes, suspecting the assertion is true, but holds himself up proudly and continues the procession.\\"    In a nutshell what we have here is an amateur who:    1- Can't play very well (all tracks are the most basic of basic, no high musicianship whatsoever on this collection, the addition of synths DRONE on with block position keyboard chord patterns changing methodically)  2- Can't write very well (Lots of \\"speech singing\\" here, someone writes our words and forces them into ill competent backing tracks)  3- Can't sing very well (falsetto meaning false, one who can't really sing so to mask the poor voice the falsetto is used as a cover)  4- Upon critical success of the past effort can afford higher end recording gear and instruments.

This is quite a stone destined to float to the bottom of the pool.     Avoid this one like the plague. Don't even consider sampling it. It's THAT horrible.
B0046IGOIO|2.0|I'm a long time Doors fan. I've purchased every bootleg and \\"official\\" bootlegs that I've been able to find. I don't think this is a bad show at all, but I can barely listen to it. Bottom line-The sound quality SUCKS! There are quite a few others to choose from. The Pittsburgh CD is a personal favorite. The Boston shows are interesting for if no other reason the fact that Jim is VERY drunk. Detroit is a great show. I don't regret buying this since I'm a completist, but if you aren't a hardcore fan, definitely pass.
B004WESFZW|5.0|the movies was cool the way that everything happened was well done, i would tell everybody to see it ,very enjoying
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|Probably my favorite \\"official\\" bootleg of all the shows recorded for Absolutely Live. Some have critisized this show for being lazy or reserved. True it's a little slow getting started, but it takes off quickly. Jim doesn't interact much with the crowd until late in the show, but maybe he was trying to put the focus on the music instead of antics. You've got to remember as their career went on Jim found himself in an unenviable position. He wanted to be taken seriously and was getting deeply into the blues. Others just wanted a freak show, and the never ending screams for Light My Fire. Listen to this disc with the right expectations and you'll be rewarded. Of particular interest is what is in my opinion the coolest version of When The Musics Over I've ever heard. Enjoy a relaxed and confident show with Jim and the boys.
B004UA8D1O|4.0|I would recommend this movie, 3D effects were OK, nothing spectacular... but the movie was good. I seen this before I bought the 3D version, pretty stunning & touching, great cave scenery. Slow at beginning but real interesting in the middle & at end.
0553381687|5.0|It has been a long time since I read fiction. This book is well worth breaking the fast with.<br /><br />What a phenomenal story Mr Martin spins. Not just the story but the desolate, menacing and ruthless world that he creates. Reader beware,this book sucks you in. Mr Martin's writing is so effortless and his story so compelling that before I knew, it was 11:30 PM in the night (well past my bedtime!)<br /><br />But know it for what it is and what it is not.<br />This is not a book on fantasy, magic exists but only subtly.<br />This book is not dark...HBO's Rome is dark. STARZ's Spartacus is dark.<br />There is sex but very little of it and no where meriting the fuss other readers made. I would rate the book PG 13 for that.<br /><br />At its heart it is about family drama. The protagonist relocates his family to corporate headquarters and faces a sweltering degree of politics and family squabbles.<br /><br />I would not have picked this book had I known its real genre.<br />But no worries the story will blow your mind.<br /><br />Here is the best part.<br />I am on to my second book \\"A Clash of Kings\\". Mr Martin is just getting warmed up with 'GofT'.<br />The next book is darker and far better.
0061537969|5.0|I stop people on the street that have this book, to talk to them about it.  I am always excited for people to read this.  I love Enzo!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Please ignore Amazon.com's editorial review from someone who obviously isn't the usual sci-fi/fantasy/indy reviewer and misses the point of the whole thing.   The movie is beautifully filmed, has an amazing and widely represented soundtrack, and a unique storyline. The fight sequences are visually appealing and contain some of the best Chinese cinema stylized choreography I've seen. If the people involved in this worked on the Star Wars prequels Yoda wouldn't have been the only one with interesting fighting capabilities.     Have an open mind and just see it; don't flock/hide behind negative reviews.
B00000IQV7|5.0|I always love tell my kids about people that are \\"real\\".  Patch is a person who really did build the \\"gutzunthite\\" (sp?)institute to help others.  I try to show them that its all about giving and not by getting!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|It's an ok shooter, reminds me of old supernintendo games. Better controls than Gun Bro's.  Got it as free app of the day.  Works on the Atrix 4G.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|How shameful it is to take a classic novel and belittle it so thoroughly.<br />The music, script, and cast were a discredit to Miss Austen.  Do not waste<br />your time or money.
0743243153|4.0|I read Peck's book in 1984 after a devastating loss of love in my life. What I remember all these years that helped me work through my feelings is 2 concepts: 1) His first sentence, which every one has mentioned that \\"Life is difficult.\\"; and, 2)how much energy we exert by not trying to feel and that this very act of not feeling made ones emotional state more difficult and creates a barrier to healing.<br /><br />My interpretation of these concepts was that if I let myself feel and go through the grieving process it would actually hurt less and it would take a shorter time period to heal.<br /><br />I remember it was a tough book to get through; however, I clinged onto those two concepts and they really helped me heal.
B0040JHXTS|4.0|Loved the music cover to cover.  Darkness on the Edge of Town has always been one of my favorite albums.  The Promise is excellent as well.  Had Darkness on the Edge of Town originally on vinyl LP, and then redbook CD, when CD was invented.  The BAD:  the cheap paper packaging ripped while removing a disc from the Promise CD cardboard container insert.  For the price of the 3oth Anniversary Edition, I would have hoped for better quality packaging.  Glad to have bought it cheap on Amazon at $78 versus $119 at Best Buy and other retailers.
B0041T52S6|2.0|I love this movie, but the one i bought was a rented version, so it didn't have any of the special features. :(
B00068TJM6|5.0|Bought this watch for someone else, but ended up wearing it very recently - some wedding (my cousin's). Looks very nice and works like a charm!
B0030DL3FU|5.0|is very very good
B00006GO99|5.0|I'm an amateur jazz listener, but was whistling each of these tunes, from the second time through! Nice, pure jazz from one of the greats. Inventive, creative, sometimes even funny little happy licks and progressions. Very happy toe-tapping kinda tunes for the most part. Loved it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I can tell it was made by the same creators of Smallville. Love the movie, really craving to watch the next.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|This game is very fun. the graphics are okay and the gameplay is okay. I do enjoy the story line. Thus game is definitely worth to download.
0971407614|5.0|Of all the exercise books and magazines I have read or skimmed through,  this is probably the best overall book for bodyweight exercises.  The author presents a gamut of exercises for the whole body, with illustrations.    I highly recommend this book.   It would be great if he had a video with a few programmed routines such as one for upper body, one for lower body, an overall total body workout or perhaps a five day exercise regimen.
B00328G4V6|4.0|I thought that this album was going to be a gimmick. Some depressingly unfinished hendrix songs. Or maybe just hendrix messing around in the studio. I was wrong. This is quality hendrix. As a long time fan of hendrix I could tell some of the songs would have had more layers but even in their raw version they are great. None of these songs would be a rock hit on the radio, but good music is subjective and most of these tracks are long blues and rock jams. Also these songs are very well mixed.    Stone free- Good     valleys of neptune-good, but definately not finished    bleeding heart-ok    hear my train acomin-very good, however nothing compares to the live version at isle of white. And I mean nothing I've ever heard. improvised genius.     mr bad luck-great    sunshine of your love-clapton is either jeaslous or proud    lover man-a real gem, I think its better that the previously released studio version. Less rock and more rippin blues.     ships passin- awsome    fire-never cared for this song    red house-good    lull-good    cryin blue rain-good but again would have been epic if it was finished    Anyways this is good hendrix and not just a gimmick. It holds its own with first rays and south saturn delta but certainly does not surpass or match them. The good news is that the hendrix family claims to have enough unreleased masters to release an album every 12 to 18 mnths for the next 10 years. My guess is these albums will be similiar in that they will contain some truly epic releases backed by some fillers such as different versions of already released songs. That is fine with me.
B001794FOK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Jumping around the globe gives an interesting action-vibe, especially when the two jumpers jump into dire and unusual circumstances.  Actor Jamie Bell, the second jumper, is a great character.  He is a foul-mouthed, little punk with attitude.  It's funny having him as a foil against the more straightlaced and less experienced first jumper, David, played by Hayden Christensen.<br />Watching the two squabble as they hopped the around the world was, again, just funny.<br /><br />This film is a Sci-Fi, action, and adventure film aimed for teenagers.  There's also the usual love story between the first jumper and his high school crush.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|app that Amazon won't let me download because of their restrictions.  Gingerbread broke my Wifi, let me download it thru the cellular system!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I experienced none of the problems that other people did. I installed it, opened it, and it worked fine. It took a little bit to load Feint, but I just checked no. The game is well designed and fun to play. Halfbrick does it again.
B00009Z574|5.0|I recall my disappointment when buying the Tormato album when it was first released.  Probably like most Yes fans, I expected everything to be a continuation of earlier material, which, in hindsight, is obviously unfair.  But I've lately acquired a new appreciation of Yes, especially in light of their fantastic recent material, so I picked up this CD.  It's great.  And what's more, it seems to fit perfectly in with the \\"classic Yes\\" period.  I don't know what I was thinking all those years ago.<br /><br />An interesting side note: While ripping the CD, the \\"Composer\\" column that appears on Windows Media Player lists the members of U2 along with the Yes as composers for Don't Kill the Whale.  While I can easily imagine Bono approving of the song, this collaboration is obviously impossible.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Rosamund Lupton's \\"Sister\\" is narrated by Arabella Beatrice Hemming, who is disconsolate when her twenty-one year old sister, Tess, is found dead, an apparent suicide.  Bee (as Tess liked to call her) is determined to prove that Tess did not take her own life, but was the victim of a clever and malevolent killer.  Bee composes a letter to Tess, letting her know that no matter what the police believe, she will not rest until she brings Tess's murderer to justice.  There is no shortage of suspects but precious little evidence to go on.<br /><br />Tess was an artist and free spirit who took chances without fretting about the consequences.  She believed in \\"experiencing the present without worrying about the future or cluttering it with the past.\\"  Beatrice, on the other hand, was never that adventurous.  She and her fianc&eacute;, Todd, have a safe and unchallenging relationship; they \\"were always better shopping partners than lovers.\\"  Bee regales us with anecdotes about her childhood, her relationship with her parents, and her memories of Tess, who brightened up every room she entered.  After Tess's death, Bee moves from New York back to London, where she interviews Tess's friends and acquaintances in an effort to find out who had the motive, means, and opportunity to take the life of her beautiful and talented sister.<br /><br />Lupton lyrically explores the powerful bond between Tess and Bee, who were close in spite of geographical separation and marked differences in temperament and personality.  Bee expresses herself with raw emotion that is painful to witness.  We cannot help but empathize with this self-deprecating woman, who torments herself because she was not at Tess's side when she was needed most.  Lupton hints that there is more to this case than meets the eye, and the suspense is excruciating while we wait for the truth to finally emerge.  The ending is a shocker, with a twist that few will see coming.  \\"Sister\\" is a gripping mystery and a poignant glimpse into a special relationship that even death cannot destroy.elationship that even death cannot destroy.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|this game is so fun with great graphics and very realistic.  if you enjoy fishing you'll love this game.  its worth every penny
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I heard Adele sing Rolling in the Deep on NPR and later listened to the entire CD on their website.  It has been a long time since I felt compelled to purchase any music but this CD was a must have.  Love the music.
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|This movie has some decent effects and had the potential to be good but it fails to deliver.  It plays out like a poor Twilight knock-off using an alien instead of a Vampire.
B004KD5TQI|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I really like this CD it just does not have all the songs from the movie and I loved the movie.  Darn shame.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is so fun! No lag at all. I was worried about that because I have 115 apps and games on my Vibrant. This game doesn't lag at all. It's funny too. My 5yr old is going to love it. Good thing he can't read yet. I could do without the cuss words.
B00005R2IS|4.0|From all of the 3 movie it was the one that I'd rated as O.K. movie. This is supposed to be a beginning of the Mad Max. Where it all started. And I did watch it because I was interested in the movie trilogy. It wasn't too exciting to me, and I've found the family of the Mad Max to be a boring thing. Just being honest. I predicted that something would happen to the Goose(a friend of Max) and his family. So maybe therefore. Also I know that it should have been in the movie as it was necessary to depict, but I didn't like what savages did to women, or men they've found. So to be short it was okay to see. No overwhelming feelings.
0439023513|4.0|I loved the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. This book started out very interesting.  But the conclusion to the war was very strange, in how the actual gun fighting ended.  It didn't fit with the rest of the story.      On the other hand, I was expecting a major twist at the end in terms of who Katniss would pick, Peeta or Gale.  You don't find out until the last paragraph of the book.  It is not a major twist, and the way this unravels feels very natural and just right.  I liked the ending of this part of the story.    It's just the ending of the war that was really odd, and thus 4 stars instead of 5.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This author is an amazing writer!! I was not able to put this book down the second I picked it up. I am not usually the type of person to choose books that are \\"futuristic\\" and stick mostly to books like Lord of the Rings or The Game of Thrones... but this book is a MUST READ! The author is very cleaver in making you feel like you are the character in the book. There is not one minute of humdrum or even want to put it down. I didnt want to go eat when I needed too because I didnt want to get away from it! ON to the second book now and Im fully engulfed.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|It's rare that a grammy award winning CD appeals to me, but Esperanza Spalding's Chamber Music Society is phenomenal. Spalding and her band deliver complex and organic performances here. There are bits of a Brazilian influence as demonstrated in the cover \\"Inutil Passagem.\\" The music and vocals are constantly evolving into fascinating forms. If you're in the mood to have your mind expanded, pick up this CD. You will not be disappointed.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Highly anticipated tight clean work from both Nas & Damian a must have Album for for true positive music lovers. Bless Rasta through out the earth
B0036EH3U2|3.0|The show itself is enjoyable.  However, the \\"grain\\" techniques they used to give you a gritty look just takes me right out of the story sometimes.  This is not 300 type grain.  This is some seriously bad overdone grain.  I play this on a 1080p 73\\" where all blu ray looks great accept this show.  The sad thing is that just when you start to get used to the bad picture they will throw a bright perfect picture scene at you and then you go back to the bad which makes it all the worse.  Now if you watch your shows on a small screen it probably wont matter but being that this is blu ray and the Producer boasts of how great the picture and sound is at the beginning of each season you would expect better.  This item was under review for a while by amazon because according to them people were complaining about something in the set.  I can only imagine that this was the problem.  They probably thought the discs were defective.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|It's a good movie. I liked it a lot more than the first. I remember watching it as kid when I disliked it, found it boring. Many years later I've decided to come back to it. I found it to be good. Interesting story and good time killer.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Awesome! I have this game for my PSP slash ps3 and it is way better on my Evo!! touchscreen works flawlessly!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i enjoyed the gameplay, until having spend several hours playing it lost my state and i had to start from the begining, until it crashed again.  this game is not worth your money, its a decent concept but no attention to detail or basic follow though. save your money for a developer who cares about quality.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Great deal for high-quality sound perfect for anyone who wants to take their first person shooter experience to the next level.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Just like any other large game on the android platform, if a game won't start, restart / reboot your phone then everything starts working again...<br /><br />That being said, the game is mediocre at best. Poor graphics and glitchy UI.
B000S8SXL2|5.0|This movie is really good, I remember I saw it long time ago but finally I bought it, the history is amazing and sad at the same time, reflects a little bit what happened on the holacaust.
B00008AWOG|5.0|As an Opeth fan for whom \\"Blackwater Park\\" was a sort of gateway drug, I've come to appreciate this album just as much, if not more, than BWP, which quite frankly I need to put away for a while in order to come back to with new ears. In the meanwhile, Still Life approaches perfection - the band's signature blend of raw strength and beautiful finesse, both within and between songs, Åkerfeldt's genius on guitar and surprisingly good metal lyrics, and the loose plot that drives this concept album make it a must-own for any Opeth fan or open-minded music aficionado in general. (Most of my tastes tend toward classical, jazz, and acoustic music, in fact - Opeth and Still Life are both far too brilliant for me to turn my back on.)     From the opening haunting chords of \\"The Moor\\" to the epic \\"White Cluster,\\" Still Life grabs you and never lets you go. Yet Akerfeldt and co. save their best for last - between Face of Melinda (among the band's favorite songs), the dazzling variety of Serenity Painted Death and its gorgeous acoustic coda, and the frenetic White Cluster, complete with a solo jaw-dropping even among the sterling standards Mikael has set for his playing and his fans. Sure, Still Life predicts the brilliance that would become Blackwater Park, but even if it were the band's only record, it alone would guarantee that Opeth would be talked about with reverence and imitated by aspiring guitarists and drummers everywhere for years to come.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|I installed it and got the black screen.  I let it sit for about 10 mins and it finally went to the menu. I noticed it did not scale anything correctly and couldnt use the controls because they were below the screen area. Great game on ipod and was hoping to play on my DROID X
B003YOMNCM|3.0|Higdon & Tchaikovsky Violin Concertos is a Deutsche Grammophon recording from 2010 under the direction of Vasily Petrenko who leads the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and played by the amazing Hilary Hahn. Here she first plays Jennifer Higdon's Violin Concerto. This piece is dedicated to Hilary Hahn. Unfortunately it is dreadful mess. The second piece is amazing being Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D major, op 35. Hilary Hahn has written the music notes and they are both informative and well-written. Even so I can not give this recording more then 3 out of 5 since the first piece is frankly a joke. Even so I recommend it for the amazing Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. 3/5.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|After trying various cup holders and hooks, etc, I am really pleased to find something that actually works on my Peg Perego stroller. The bars on this stroller are pretty thick and all the cup holders that are made for umbrella strollers don't fit (the bars are a lot thinner on umbrella strollers). This caddy has a velcro strap on each side that you can adjust to fit securely between the open space of the handles. There is a snug cup holder on each outside edge of the item, with a space in between for sunglasses, maps, sunscreen, or snacks, etc, plus a zippered pocket on the inside for keys, membership cards, or whatever. One reviewer mentioned that it swung a bit (but you can tighten those velcro straps so that it barely moves at all) so you need covered drinks, and maybe that's true... but we always use those anyway, and the drink holder pocket is flexible enough to hold a good size, tall cup and keeps it steady. I am a very happy buyer and highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't have cup holders on their stroller and even those who do, but want a little more storage space. Also... it stays on very nicely when you fold the stroller, no need to remove. Love it!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I bought this over a year ago and I am now writing a review. I was playing WoW a lot when I purchased this and wanted to try it out and see if it helped my gaming. Unfortunately I could not get use to this gamepad at all. I must be one of the ones who couldn't adapt from using a keyboard as this made the game frustrating for me.<br /><br />It is a great looking and feeling product and I can see how someone could really enjoy using it but I am old school and after playing PC games for so many years I could not convert. The price now is a lot cheaper then when I bought it. If you are interested in trying one we all know Logitech produces great products and this one does not feel any different. The keys are soft and it lights up nicely. the LED screen is nice and the software is really easy to set up and customize. It reads games on your PC and allows you to customize the controls for each game.<br /><br />I am not going to give it 1 star although I didn't like it. It is not a terrible product and deserves a 3 star rating because it does look like it would do what it is suppose to if it was your thing.
0201721481|3.0|As a user of this loathsome language - c++11 looks better - for over twenty years I agree with the positive reviews for the dead-tree fourth edition; it's best in 'class'.<br /><br />My concern with the Kindle edition is that the code examples are not only printed in small type, but also printed in a faint gray-scale. Why? This makes the book almost useless under anything less than full sun or a spotlight. I use a Kindle 3.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|We (me and my wife) bought this for our nephew a few months after he was born. He loves it. It really entertains him. His parents love it to, because it is an educative toy and helps with the development of the child.    Great purchase.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its good, cant get enough. I wish the updates could keep up quicker. Play it you will love it. Yo
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Great game play and upgrades. Controls like robotron from the 80s. Very fun but also very repetitive.  Finished 3 boards in 10 minutes of play.
0545265355|5.0|A friend of mine posted a link to this book and the title intrigued me. I decided to look it up and see what all the fuss was about. I am not sure I understand why people are trying to get it banned. It does deal with children but it is written perfectly and the material may be violent but it is perfectly executed. I truly felt like I was there with Katniss and with Peter the entire time. You can easily visualize the environments and you can feel the passion, the anxiety and the fear the entire series. This is by far the quickest read I have ever had with 3 books. I read them all within a week which is a feat for me as I am a busy person. I just had to find out what happened to each of the characters.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. It is violent but it is not overdone and I think it is a great read for anyone. It may not be suitable for young readers but it is a great story that is truly engaging. I am certainly glad that I read it. If this is something on your list, move it to the top and read it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Here's why: The art is delightful, the animation is smooth, and the li'l candy-eating guy is cute and endearing. The levels are brilliantly designed. Pure fun! Best $0.99 you'll spend on a game ever!
B0058VW36U|5.0|A polished game that is cute, challenging, and addictive. Each level introduces new ideas to keep the game fresh. I hope the game is supported well with new content.
0786838655|5.0|This is the first book in a young adult series.  I am really glad I saw the movie before reading the book--otherwise, I would have hated the movie.  The movie left out tons of book action!  In the book, Percy Jackson discovers he is a demi-god:  half human, half god. He goes to Half Blood Camp to figure out which god is his father and after that, he is sent on a quest.  His quest is to find the stolen lightning bolt of Zeus and return it to the mighty god.  This book had tons of action, great characters (I loved Grover--Percy's protector who is a goat disguised as a human) and a lot of humor.  I have the rest of this series on my Kindle and look forward to reading them.  These books can span the YA audience and adults could love them too.<br /><br />[...]
B0000033WC|5.0|Let me begin by stating that I am not a huge VU fan. I heard there first three albums and thought they were ok. I never understood all the hype surrounding this band. I would read comments that stated they were better than the stones more original than the beatles, and my response was always that these critics must be smoking crack or something of that nature. One day I was reading about an album that went virtually unnoticed but was worth seeking out. The cd in mention was the velvet undergrounds loaded. I thought to myself what do I have to lose, Ive heard everything else by this band I might as well finish what I started. Thats when it happened, the opening track who loves the sun came on and I loved its quirkiness and humor. Casually rolling into the next outstanding track sweet jane an obviuos highlight made me really take notice. Reeds singing and acoustic strumming fill out this song perfctly. Rock and roll was next and by this time Im cranking this cd to maximum volume. I wont go over every song to save your (and my) time. Sweet nothing has to be mentioned. Some have called this the velvets hey jude the way it builds and thats pretty fair to say however, This is a classic in its own right that doesnt need to be compared to anything else. Alot of people including VU themselves have disregarded this album as mediocre or to commercial. In my opinion they have never been better.
B001LYD2K4|5.0|The second solo album from Michael Schenker Group is from start to finish a non-stop machine full of thick guitar sounds and thunderous beats from late great Cozy Powell.     There is not a weak track on this record and it sounds as fresh today as it did when it was released. I maybe younger than the record, but my ears tell me all I need to know. This is one of the many records I own that is so dynamic it simply does not get old.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|works great on the DROID X. It seems like it will be fun once I get used to the controls.
0738702994|3.0|I really expected more from this deck. You may love it, I didnt. I ordered 2 other decks as well and loved them, I was very let down by this one. And....It does not come with the bag as shown. The packaging was nice and it comes with a nice book. The deck may be for you but it wasnt for me. I dont like the fact they show a bag and there is no bag...I expected more. The artwork seemed a bit blurred as well...just my opinion.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Have you ever been in the middle of doing something and you catch yourself grinning ear to ear like a Cheshire cat? And, you can't stop smiling no matter how hard you try...  Well, this happens to me every now and then...whether it be when watching Miss USA (OMG, their smiles are contagious), when watching one of my favorite romantic comedies or just reading a damn good book. Needless to say, my jaw seriously hurts today because during the entire four hours it took me to read Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire I couldn't stop smiling. (My boyfriend even pointed it out to me, making some off-the-wall comment about how he makes me happy...ha ha...well I let him think that's where the credit was due and kept on reading). It's really hard for me to fathom anyone NOT loving this story. Beautiful Disaster is officially tied with my other favorite bad-boy love story, Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles. (And, yes I can have more than one favorite!!)  Abby Abernathy & Travis Maddox's journey is an exciting and addicting page-turner, with beautifully developed friendships, relationships and rivalries. I absolutely fell in love with Abby & Travis and their messy, heart-breaking, wonderfully sweet, crazy relationship. I wouldn't put this book down to eat dinner (that's a BIG deal for me because food is way up there on my list of priorities). Sold on Amazon Kindle for only $2.99, there is no excuse not to read this enthralling love story from Jamie McGuire.  I gave Beautiful Disaster 5 STARS because it surpassed all of my expectations and requirements of a great novel.  It was FREAKING AMAZING!!

B001UW58YK|5.0|This is worth every penny.  The picture is very clear.  Michael is very entertaining.  I like his genre.  Recommended for every classy standard afficionados out there.  The music is amazing.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is an outstanding light to keep by the door, in the car, or in the bedstand. It's a little heavy for carry on the belt or in a pack (i.e. not a great backpacking light), but for situations where weight and size aren't a major issue. Basically, anywhere a 4+D cell Maglight would work, this will work and blow the mag light out of the water. On Turbo mode, this is comparable to a car mounted flood light, and in low mode, there is plenty of light to negotiate a trail or house on a dark night. I think the programmed modes are a little corny, but if you want a flashlight that will flash SOS or create a disco in your living room,the modes are there.<br />FWIW, I have average sized hands, and this light is a great fit in my hand. I also like the fact that it runs on AAs, so if the charger dies or there is an extended power outage, fresh batteries are available everywhere.
1932100660|5.0|The simple message of eating a whole foods/plant based diet resounds throughout the book. Dr. Campbell backs up his conclusions and ideas with a myriad of research studies that we in the West are simply ignorant of. Buy this book, read it, and then pass it along to someone you know in the medical field.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I'm not one to be verbose, so I'll stick to the short and sweet. I tell my buddies this film reminds me of the awesome 80s sci-fi flicks we grew up with. I wish there were more of these movies around.
0061251321|5.0|I'm a voracious reader of books on personal development, leadership, self-improvement, etc...this is by far the best book I've read in the last six months.  It has completely changed my view of leadership and personal growth and resonated with me on a level that I've seldom experiences.    Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|always remember EVO will fail you trade it in and get you an Epic don't you think you deserve it
B000W746GK|5.0|We watch this one less frequently in our house, in part because the kids don't like the basilisk.  So when we do watch it, there is a lot that I don't remember, which is a delightful re-discovery.  There is no question that this is the best modern series of kids films that adults can also enjoy.  The way the kids grow, the wisdom of such amazingly wonderful characters like Dumbledore, and the struggle against evil never ceases to captivate me.  Warmly recommended.
8590379825|4.0|I like the writing style of the book. To the point, at times I would say terse, with short example code. It is not an easy-read book: one sentence could make you think for an hour about the implications, but it is a relief that it comes at less than 300 pages, compared to the 900+ I often see in programming books. What I find clearly lacking is a one page summary at the end of each chapter that in a reference guide style sums up the syntax or library functions introduced in the chapter. Now you have to read through the text to refresh your memory.
B00003CX95|2.0|I have always received good products from Amazon.  The DVD Braveheart works 1/4 of the way through the movie, Then it stops and starts at the beginning.  I would like to return.
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a well put together and thought out puzzle game - the controls are intuitive and the supplied pictures are great.  The fact you can add your own pictures adds a whole new dimension and adds a lot of longevity to the game.
0316069353|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again I did not need to know anything more than it was MC's work he is my favorite writer Now waiting for more. thank you amazon for your site to buy books and thanks to the person I bought from.
B000W796OM|5.0|This is an absolutely great story, deepening the characters and adding a wonderful new presence, Sirius Black, but also Lupin.  Everyone develops, some in unexpected ways, particularly Hagrid, who comes into his own as a professor.  It is very fun and the plot twists are fascinating and intricate.  Definitely, the best childrens' series of magical stories of all time.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I finally finished the Blu-Ray so I figured I would give my 2 cents on the anime. I was very impressed with the dubbing in this particular version of HotD. I've over time become somewhat used to bad dubbing in Japanese anime so I was glad to hear the voice actors putting in a lot of effort. They really did a good job of making the characters sound and act realistically.    The Blu-Ray itself has great quality and because of that and the fact that it's uncut I noticed things that I never noticed in the original airing. The audio quality is also top notch.    It has simple packaging with 2 Blu-Ray's. Eight episodes on the first disc and four episodes on the second disk.    Like others have mentioned it is an action packed zombie apocalypse style anime with lots of blood, fan service, and a bit of vulgar language. Nothing worse than the kind you hear on the streets. You can learn much more about its contents from the current highest rated review so I won't go into a lot of detail. I mainly just wanted to touch on how impressed I was with the quality of this version.    Overall Rating 5/5 stars. Enjoy the anime.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This is a really cool game if your into the Minigore game types. The graphics are really nice and so is the game p lay. This game is a must and being free on the Amazon market today is outstanding. samsung galaxy s 4g
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Rating this film \\"one star\\" is about three stars too many. Out of the entire film, perhaps three or four minutes are actually scary. The rest is a mish-mash of incompetent improvised \\"acting\\", a missing plot, and a failed attempt at editing disguised as \\"directing.\\"<br /><br />I'm not often genuinely mean in my reviews; I make an exception here because this film is another triumph of marketing over manifestation, of hype over quality and content. Like \\"Blair Witch\\" before it, this film was rated a \\"smash hit\\" because it was hyped into a frenzy, not because it actually had anything to say or new content to present. A few special effects were quite good, and there are a few nicely scary bits; alas, they comprise less than five percent of the film, and the rest of it gave me a headache that three ibuprofen didn't cure.<br /><br />There was no \\"acting,\\" and the performers desperately need to review their rules of improvisation (I'm an improv coach myself, I know whereof I speak). There was no \\"directing,\\" it was all spliced together from the raw footage. There was no \\"plot\\", only a collection of events strung together from which the greatest wisdom that we could infer would be \\"Don't talk to demons through a Ouija board.\\" And a lot of people are out good money, because this country loves to praise hype rather than value quality.<br /><br />Ain't nothin' to see folks, move along, move along...
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I usually do not care for zombie like games but this is actually fun and funny.  Oh, the wi-fi thing is no big deal for me.  I use that over 4G as 4G is a battery hog.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Great game. Pretty funny. Appealing graphics. A good time killer for sure! Easily recommendable. Can't wait to play through the rest.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Reboot your phone after installing if you have initial problems with the game not loading- this will likely remedy the issue.<br /><br /> This game is  satirical and highly amusing. Great control system. I only wish it was longer.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|Stellar set of songs that I play over and over again while driving and painting. So glad someone turned me onto them.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|greatest game of all time. love it on my ps3 and now its free on my phone as well?? yes pleaaaaase!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|They do not disappoint. This album was worth the 5 year wait. Do yourself a favor - turn the vol up and sit back. It's a great trip back to the garage band days.
B000092T6M|5.0|The thing that comes out the most is Michael Kamen's thrilling, romantic music score which totally makes this movie sizzle. Kevin Costner makes a fine Robin Hood, a little Americanized, but his good looks and fine delivery make him memorable. Surprises on performances that hold up well are Christian Slater's Will Scarlett, intense and passionate. Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio shows her great acting ability and star power. Alan Rickman snarls as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Morgan Freeman shows great restraint and power as Robin's benefactor. And all those amazing English character actors as the bullied people! Sean Connery's star turn as King Richard is completely awesome. A great release of a movie that has only gotten better with the years-great photography and effects (those arrows in 3-D!) make this a must have DVD.    Edward Cibener
B004U52VPS|5.0|We got the game and I immediately set it up with my 15 year old grandson (he indulges Gramma) soon his mother was playing too. We laughed and talked about how much fun we were having -- soon my son (44) joined and 16 year old granddaughter played too. I have taken it to work and lunch time has become Angry Bird Haven ....This is the BEST investment in fun I have made in a LOOOOONG time!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I've recently become a Mad Men fan but haven't seen the first 3 seasons.  I was so happy to find them on Amazon!
B0036EH3UC|4.0|I purchased the boxed set along with \\"Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)\\" and \\"Battlestar Galactica: The Plan\\" as listed in the \\"Frequently Bought Together\\" section.  \\"Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)\\" is included in the boxed set so now I will have to return the standalone DVD and pay postage \\"because the return is not the result of Amazon's error\\".  This item should not have been included in the \\"Frequently Bought Together\\" items.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Works fine on Captivate running CM7. Fun, like Robotron but with lots more weapon options. Have not had any buggy behavior.
0307456625|3.0|This didn't live up to its hype I decided.  After hearing so much about it I was really looking forward to it, but there was a lot that could be improved.<br /><br />A new detective business has opened up in Botswana.  Ad its run by a woman.  After her father leaves her a good bit of money, Mma Ramotswe opens up the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.  She solves simple crimes brought to her by people of her town.  But that's not all she does, she also reminisces about the past and certain periods in her life.  But this isn't your ordinary mystery novel.  Its more about the people of Botswana than it is about solving cases.  Mysterious are solved, but its not the main focus.<br /><br />I really liked the characters.  They were all interesting and compelling.  I would have liked for more description on them actually; something more of the culture and life to make me understand them a little better.  Ramotswe herself is an especially well written character with a lot of personality, although I don't always follow her train of thought all the time.<br /><br />For a plot this is where the novel lost me a bit.  I found it too jumpy and too much going on.  It evened out by the last third of the book but getting there was tedious.  I also had a bit of trouble with the writing.  While it is representative of the rhythm and language of the area, for those not accustomed to it it can be hard to read and I found it distracting when I just wanted to read the story.  This too evened out towards the end though, or maybe I just became used to it.<br /><br />I won't be rushing out to find the next book but I will probably be reading them eventually.  I want to see what happens to the characters, but there are other books calling first.<br /><br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency<br />Copyright 1998<br />235 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Fun twin stick shooter. I like the design and score. Nice clean graphics. Works perfectly on my samsung galaxy s captivate. I'll check it out on my asus a500 tonight. The only thing that could make it a bit better is adding bluetooth controller support. I would love to use the nintendo classic controller via wiimote to kill some zombies. Not a big enough deal to lose a star though :)
0385342039|2.0|it was a ridiculous story that i just couldn't get into.  i tried and tried to enjoy it, but it jumped from detail to detail of the plot line.  it's basically about a girl whose great-aunt comes back to haunt her into getting a beloved necklace back for her.  ridiculous things happen and it ends even more unbelievably.  i know it's suppoed to be fun and lighthearted, but just not for me.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Ok may be not THE best, but it is a great movie that everyone will enjoy.  It is also a movie that you don't mind watching multiple times (important information for road trips and rainy Saturdays).
0670022411|2.0|When I first read a description of this novel I absolutely couldn't wait until it was published.  It sounded exactly as another reviewer described it -- supernatural/fantasy for intelligent adults.  I'm sorry to say that I was sadly disappointed.  This novel, as best I can describe it, is a floundering combination of vampire- and magic-story cliches and overly sappy romance.  There were points where it could have redeemed itself through more graceful description, but it failed.  The only thing this novel had going for it in comparison to similar novels was the inclusion of interesting historical and scientific details, but even this was marred by confusing explanations, at times, of the hardcore science ideas (and I've studied biochemistry, including genetics, so I should have understood it).    It didn't start out too badly.  I was intrigued by Diana, the protagonist, her relationship with magic, and especially with the secret of the lost manuscript, which was one of the things in the description that really drew me into the book.  I was interested in the tension between her and the vampires and daemons.    It all went downhill from there.  I can't remember exactly when trying to finish it became more of a chore than a pleasure, though it wasn't very far in.  I wish I had written this sooner because I'm starting to lose exact details, but I remember as I was reading thinking that this was a poorly-executed version of \\"Twilight\\" meant for adults.  I don't consider myself particularly well-read in the supernatural/fantasy genre, but even I could recognize the majority of themes from other novels and/or other types of media.    Without remembering specifics, here are my main gripes with the novel:    1) The basis of Diana's character, which I liked and found intriguing at the beginning of the novel, changed drastically within a very short span of time, resulting only because a vampire had entered her life.  And not in a good way.  She went from being an independent woman to a pile of goop who couldn't live without her vampire within ten feet of her being at all times (slight exaggeration ... yes, but you get my point).  Oh, and ... well, I'm trying not to give away any real important details in case someone looks at this and for some reason still wants to read the book ... but the part with Diana and different types of powers?  I feel like a preteen girl might be wowed.  I was not.    2) Matthew.  I wanted to like him; I really did.  I think I would have, if it hadn't been for Diana's character.  But he comes onto the scene, and not only does Diana become some antiquated version of a delicate lady, but he keeps telling her how she's too brave and willful.  Ugh!  If I don't believe it through your characters' actions, I'm certainly not going to believe it when they keep saying with nothing to substantiate their claims.  On that note, my other main gripe with Matthew's character is the classic \\"I'm a vampire so I'm super dangerous and you can't trust me except you really can because I'm the male protagonist and I might hurt you a little but I'm not going to kill you\\" thing taken from nearly every modern vampire story there is.  They keep saying he's dangerous, and I guess he is recounted as having done some ... reprehensible things.  But I'm just not feeling it, and to be frank, neither is Diana, which is a problem.    3) The pacing.  In hindsight, I realize that a lot of stuff did happen, yet as I was reading it felt like way too much dialogue -- way too much of Diana speculating over things -- and hardly any time on the actual action.  Note to author: when exciting things happen, make sure your main character is there.  We, the readers, are already living vicariously through the protagonist.  Don't make the protagonist live vicariously through other characters.    It was just overall a huge disappointment.  I will say that I had high expectations going in, so maybe that affected how bad I thought it was, but I did like it at first, so I'm not sure how valid that argument is.  It was just ... bad.  I felt like everything the author really wanted to make sure I knew was stated way too bluntly and repeated so many times I want to literally stab the book.  The romance was nauseating, the characters were far too one-dimensional, and the ideas were too cliche.    I guess if a reader really enjoys bad romance novels and vampire/magic cliches, then they would like this novel.  There were, as I said earlier, some interesting parts to do with science and with alchemical history which added a nice, mature touch to the few parts where it came in, and the writing itself, looking at the language and not the story, was competent.  All the same, if I were Deborah Harkness, I would stick with history articles/books and the wine blog, and leave fantasy to the many other talented authors out there.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Ice Age:The Dawn of the Dinosaurs(released July/09)is the latest in the Ice Age franchise with the return of the \\"herd\\" of Manny(Ray Romano),Diego(Denis Leary),Sid the Sloth(John Leguizamo),Ellie(Queen Latifah),Crash(Seann Scott) and Eddie(Josh Peck).It is another whirlwind adventure with the same heart the previous films have had.<br />This time around Ellie is pregnant and Manny is the doting but extremely nervous father to be.A crisis of sorts comes about when Diego realizes that Manny's priorities have changed and feels it's probably best Sid and he moved on.Diego leaves while Sid ventures not too far only to find three dinosaur eggs from an unknown species.He instantly declares himself their parent and comes back to show HE is now a parent also.Manny warns him to return the eggs to their original location but Sid will hear none of it.He leaves and the eggs hatch and we see he has become the proud parent of three....baby tyrannosaurs!They of course bond with him declaring him to be their mommy.<br />Well it is of course natural that whose ever eggs they were,they are going to come looking for them.And sure enough the mother T-Rex shows up to claim her young.Sid puts up some objections which deters the mother not a speck.She picks up her babies AND Sid and heads for the underground cave from whence Sid first got the eggs.In the mothers travels she passes Diego,who witnessing the surreal scene,decides to follow the T-Rex,which works out well as Manny,Ellie and the gang hook up as they are also following the mother.Their pursuit leads them all into a huge underground cavern which harbours a nature time capsule full of supposedly extinct dinosaurs of which the mother T-Rex is just one.<br />Almost immediately they run into a weasel with an eye patch called Buck(Simon Pegg).He lives there and has been chasing a large Baronyx called Rudy who took his eye.He talks with an Aussie accent and is more than a little eccentric.He guides them from here on into the underground world they are about to enter.First they navigate the chasm of death where the air is filled with helium gas.They next move on to lava falls but get ambushed by a pack of smaller carnivorous reptiles after Ellie gets separated from the rest due to unstable rocks.The group attempts to double back and save Ellie from certain death.Diego is first there and becomes her saviour until Manny can get there.<br />Meanwhile Sid has been in a parent contest with the mommy T-Rex but it is a losing battle.She's all over him like a dirty shirt.She welcomes Sid into her family but the next day Sid is separated from his kids and the mother after an attack by giant Rudy.He ends up on a floating rock in a lava field headed for lava falls.His screams are heard by all and Buck,Crash and Eddie decide to head out to rescue Sid.They commandeer a pterodactyl and just as they spot him and head in they are jumped by other flying reptiles. Through alot of fancy maneuvering and some sling shots by Eddie and Crash,they save Sid just as he starts to plummet over the falls.<br />Meanwhile back on the rocks with Ellie she has finally given birth to a sweet baby girl they will call Peaches.It's another Ice Age tear jerking moment.Sid arrives on the scene to witness the newborn but regrets that as they start to head back home that he never had a chance to say goodbye to his family.Just as they reach the entrance Rudy pops up scattering the group.At that moment the mother T-Rex  stampedes onto the scene and pushes Rudy over a cliff.Thinking that Rudy is now gone Buck decides to come topside with the rest.Just as they are about to leave the cavern Rudy's call is heard echoing in the distance and Buck decides to stay to hound his old nemesis.The group returns to the surface and introduces little Peaches to her new cold environment.Diego says he plans to stay with Manny and company as he has all the adventure anyone could ever want with them.<br />The running gag Scrat is of course seen throughout thefilm.This time his pursuit of his ever lovin' acorn is temporarily halted by the presence of a girl flying squirrel called Scratte,whom he sets up a domestic life with.Lou Rawls\\"You'll never find\\" plays in the background as the two court but Scrattes demanding ways finally frustrate him so much that when he spies his acorn(which now also has its own song sung to the tune of \\"Alone Again,Naturally\\"),he returns to it with glee.But the two are soon arguing again and when the acorn is slammed into the ground this causes a lava explosion which sends Scrat and his nut back to the surface.As he dances about with glee the piece of ice hurled skyward as he broke through now returns sending the nut back to the cavern below and seals the hole.Scrat simply loses it and screams.<br />This film,like the last,comes in at around 91 minutes,and it has the consistent quality of the first.The payoff at the end(with Diego staying on and the group being together again) is anti-climactic.The real payoff is the birth of Peaches,which,as I said,is another tearjerker of a moment.The plot is fast moving and the world is populated with alot of fascinating creatures.You will notice that the creatures themselves,like the T-Rex mom and Rudy,are all drawn without sharp edges and less than realistic faces as not to scare the small-fries in the audience.This is not Jurassic Park and the Ice Age creators know and deliver to their demo,not alienating their adult viewers(with their smart dialogue)in the process.<br />Technically the film has been transferred into its 1:85:1 a/r and the picture is crisp and clear.Extras include some commentary and trailers.<br />All in all yet another winner from Blue Sky animation that the whole family can enjoy.it of his ever lovin' acorn is temporarily halted by the presence of a girl flying squirrel called Scratte,whom he sets up a domestic life with.Lou Rawls\\"You'll never find\\" plays in the background as the two court but Scrattes demanding ways finally frustrate him so much that when he spies his acorn(which now also has its own song sung to the tune of \\"Alone Again,Naturally\\"),he returns to it with glee.But the two are soon arguing again and when the acorn is slammed into the ground this causes a lava explosion which sends Scrat and his nut back to the surface.As he dances about with glee the piece of ice hurled skyward as he broke through now returns sending the nut back to the cavern below and seals the hole.Scrat simply loses it and screams.

1577311523|5.0|Amazing book. I Have read dozens of books on Zen and living in the present. This is the only one my girlfriend could read and understand.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I LOVe the CD. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. I like 8 of the 12 songs on the standard CD. I originally didn't have high hopes for this CD. Didn't care for \\"Run the World\\" too much. BUT with songs like End of Time, Party, Countdown, etc. the CD more than makes up for one ok song. I have even grown to love \\"Run the World.\\" I get what she was trying to do. I do have to say that as much as I love the fact that Beyonce is trying to grow as an artist, I still do miss the Dangerously in Love Beyonce. Definitely worth it. I LOVE YOU BEYONCE!
0439023513|2.0|after finishing this book, i wished i had stopped at \\"catching fire\\" and considered it an open ending. all of the loose ends that had been building through the series are tied up clumsily, without gravity and without climax. worst of all, the \\"battle royale\\" theme that initially excited fans is completely skipped in this book. it will probably be hard to convince yourself not to read this book if you read the other two but i must say, after finishing, i thoroughly regretted the final experience.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|Thumbs down! I'm sure its fun, if it'll open. Force Close every stinking time. I'm running android 2.2, Mytouch 3G.

0307272702|4.0|This is a really important book!    Gary Taubes, 'WHY WE GET FAT' should be read by everyone who's  ever wondered why it's so hard to lose weight and even harder to  keep it off.    The author, a science journalist, has done his homework - extensive research and a dash  of hard scientific evidence. And, let me tell you, the medical  profession, the diet gurus and the pharmaceutical companies don't emerge too well from all this.     It's not 'calories in/calories out', it's not about the 'demon fat' and it's not really genetics either.    It's 'carbohydrates drives insulin drives fat.' As simple (and complex) as that!    There are a few clunky sentences here and there (Taubes is American after all!)... but, as I  said earlier, this is a really important book.    Read it and get lean!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Game runs very smooth on Acer Iconia Android 3.1. Controls are very intuitive.  No complaints, especially given it is a free app. Download this game!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|great ui...the two touchscreen thumbpads move around with your thumbs!  When your thumbs are in the way you can move them and keep playing! Simple top-down arcade shooter action with some nice retro graphics and a sense of humor.  Worth the $3, but get it while it's free!
1416955070|5.0|I have to say, this is a really good book. Though not too unpredictable, Clare has woven a fantastic fantasy world.<br />Clary Fray thinks she is a regular, run-of-the-mill teenager, until one night when she goes to a club in NYC with her best friend, Simon. She hardly expects to witness three teenagers commiting murder, but, lo and behold, she does. Only, she isn't supposed to be able to see it. She and her mother later have a fight and Clary refuses to go Upstate with her mother and their close friend, Luke. She storms out to go to a poetry reading with Simon. At the coffee shop were the reading is being held, she see one of the boys who commited the murder, shining eyed and golden haired. This is when things start to get interesting.<br />This book is irresistable! I read the whole thing in three days flat and went right out to buy City of Ashes. And to everyone who is saying this book has too many similarites to others, I dare you to come up with something completely original, plus you can enjoy the books anyway if you haven't read the ones that have claimed similarites.<br />The bottom line is, you can enjoy these books even if they have similarites to other ones. The story line is not the same! But the one thing I can get on about is the way it's written. Not bad, but could be better, and the phrasing can get a bit strange at times. But other than that, the dialogue is very witty, with sarcastic, none too serious Jace around.<br /> I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to immerse themselves in a funny, witty, and complex fantasy world.
B00132D808|5.0|Well... before to say what I want, I want to say sorry, but my english is bad.    About Pretty. Odd. It's really different from the preview album of Panic! At The Disco. Is very classic, mature can I say.    In some way is a lie when the first song say \\"You don't have to worry 'cause we're still the same band\\", 'cause the style is really different.    But is an excellent CD. All the songs are lovable and charmy. One of the best CD's I ever heard.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|One of the most important films of the decade. Inside Job is a clear conscise explanation of the financial crisis facing the world.
0345529057|5.0|I was drawn in to the Game of Thrones mini series that was recently aired on TV.  But with the constant introduction/referrals of new characters it was hard to keep everyone straight.  So I purchased the book set and am now finding clarification.  Wish I had read the book before the mini series aired, but will most definitely read the second book before airing.  Great writing........books are much better than mini series.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Some times when I launch the game I can sit there for 30 seconds or more waiting for it to open. However as annoying as that can be it is totally worth it.  I have played a lot of twin stick shooters for android and none of them control this good. Even on my HTC Incredibles smaller screen I felt like I had complete control over the game.  This is the first android game I have played that didn't feel like a mobile game.  This game could have easily (and it is) been on the PSP.  If your phone can handle this game it is a must download.
0385341008|3.0|Book Club Review<br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society<br />by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows<br /><br />Our book club's book for July was THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY, by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows. We felt like the last 12 people in the world who had read this book!  For those of you who may not know, the main author became very sick during the writing of it, and her niece took over and finished the book for her.<br /><br />The selection of this book was somewhat controversial in that we usually stick to mysteries, thrillers, and novels of suspense. Some of us had sort of \\"heard\\" that the book was mysterious. We'd somehow gotten the idea that it was similar to Diane Satterfield's THE THIRTEENTH TALE which was the Gothic rage a few years ago (some of us had read it, though it was not one of our book club selections). Others thought it might be kinda, sorta like the Flavia deLuce books (which was controversial because many of us don't like those books). So we took a leap of faith and had a different reading experience, one that many of us didn't expect, which is part of the fun of being in a book club.<br /><br />The book is an epistolary novel, told exclusively in letters between a woman living in postwar London and the people of the isle of Guernsey, which is located in the English Channel. Juliet Ashton has survived World War II and has been writing a successful newspaper column about the war and its aftermath. The books makes her quite successful and she is looking for her next project. Out of nowhere comes a letter from a man living on Guernsey who has ended up with a book that used to be owned by Juliet. The two start a correspondence, and her new friend Dawsey tells her about the island's \\"Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,\\" which was founded on the island during Nazi occupation. The society, started to cover for one of its members for being out after curfew and for eating contraband food, turns into a \\"real\\" club that attracts a group of colorful characters from the island, from an old woman who is a sort of natural healer/witch doctor, to a man courting a widow, to an aspiring actor. All of these people share custody of one woman's daughter - a woman who fell in love with a German soldier and was later taken away to prison. The correspondents become mutual admirers (though there is one crabby lady in there, who is played for laughs as an Old Prude) and soon enough, Juliet has found her new writing project - and must visit the island to meet all the people she has befriended.<br /><br />There's really not much more to the book than this. There is no plot to speak of - just a sort of romantic subplot that feels more like a thread to hold the book together than something the authors felt strongly about. As a group we were quite divided.<br /><br />Those who loved the book (exactly half of us) felt that it was not only a throwback to an era of greater civility, and stronger community, than our Internet-based era. The book's heart is always in the right place - telling the story of the Nazi occupation of Guernsey with sympathy not only for the islanders but also not taking the easy route of making all the Germans 100% evil. We see the privations suffered by the people as well as that English \\"stiff upper lip\\" that got so many through the horrible war. There's no doubt that the people of England had a very different experience of World War II than we in the States did, with London being bombed to ashes and the people walking around even today with memories of their losses - but handling it with dignity and a lack of drama. There is some witty writing and a happy ending, and TGLAPPS is much like The Thirteenth Tale in its love of books. We had some very good discussion about that: With books about bibliophilia selling scads of copies, can the \\"death of the book\\" really be imminent, as so many seem to be predicting?  It's also a fast enough read, tripping along wittily andalways with sympathy and respect for its characters.<br /><br />Those who didn't care for the book (exactly the other half of us) head their noses put out of joint starting with the cutesiness of the title. That led to a good discussion of titles and the expectations they raise in readers. Some of the more vociferous critics felt the title was a canny marketing gimmick designed to sell a lot of books (and one that worked). One can't really dislike the lead character, Juliet Ashton, but she can be awfully glib in a way that makes her seem shallow. She's one of those people who tries a little too hard to be witty and delightful, and it grated on some. Those who like to dig their teeth into a story found little to meet that need here; we argued (quite enjoyably) over what a \\"novel\\" means, and whether a book with so slim a story really qualifies for that category. Each letter is almost like a short story that attempts to tell a bit of history of an anecdote about life during wartime (and the book truly does elicit sympathy for what the people of Guernsey went through), but the cast of characters seems straight out of a cozy, with everyone being either \\"delightful\\" or \\"colorful\\" or \\"warm.\\"  In other words - not much character development.<br /><br />Interestingly, we have read books that we all enjoyed (for example, NINE MAN'S MURDER by Eric Keith, A DARKER DOMAIN by Val McDermid) that were enjoyable reading experiences that didn't generate as much \\"discussion\\" about novels, the reading experience, what a book is or should be, and so forth. (Maybe because books that fire on all cylinders don't allow for this type of \\"criticism\\" to come up naturally.) So, as a book club book, this one is definitely a winner. As far as individual tastes, though, \\"results may vary\\" as The Potato Peel Pie Society might say in a recipe.acters.

B00005JKED|5.0|Wham--this film hit me square in the chin.  It's a knockout.  The pace,tension and action are relentless.  And the performance by Denzel Washington is nothing less than stunning.  So,shut off your phone,pull up a bowl of popcorn,put your favorite beverage in a cooler by your side--and enjoy an absolutely terrific and compelling film.
1594744769|3.0|This is an entertaining fantasy adventure.  Though not the most exciting or memorable, it was a pleasure to read.  It reminded me of Harry Potter.  The author left the story with an open ended conclusion, so as to allow sequels to the book.  I especially liked the old photographs in the book.  They added a sort of eerie realism to the story. So if you are looking for a quick, but not deep read, then this book is for you.  I would call this type of book a perfect summer vacation type of read.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Love it!!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|whats up with all these wifi dl's? bs. why cant i download using internet. hasnt been any good programs in a while
B0058P7KUA|3.0|The game is ok. the v-joysticks are a bit hard to control. Graphics arent too bad and the animations are pretty decent. Just not my type of fun game.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I got this when my son was 4 mos old and he just lights up every time we turn it on. He loves interacting with it and my husband and I both find the music endearing. I bought it used so it seems to have held up well. Great toy!
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|The wife and I are huge LMFAO fans; we've seen them twice in concert already and will JUMP at the chance to see them if they ever come close to us again.    The day their new CD - Sorry For Party Rocking came out, we decided to head to the big city to pick up a copy. There is nothing like actually buying a CD; you own it, it's in your hands...it probably feels the way old folks feel about vinyl records. MP3s don't even come close to having an actual CD; however, this one seemed to be almost impossible to find....but we weren't gonna give up. We ended up going to 3 different stores trying to find the DELUXE EDITION and finally lucked up at a Best Buy...I think we bought the last copy in Lexington, KY.    As soon as I opened it, I was a bit disappointed...there was no booklet! The CD cover is simply a piece of paper bent in half, unlike their first CD. I expected more from a \\"deluxe edition\\" but it did come with 4 additional songs and a temporary tattoo.    We popped in the CD I didn't like it at first; after checking out what booklet was there, I quickly noticed that Wii.I.Am produced it and did a lot on it and you could automatically pick up on his influence and I'm not a huge Will.I.Am fan, so I wasn't very impressed; it sounded like it was less rap and more techno/auto tone and I know LMFAO is better than that.    After listening to to the CD a few times through, it quickly grew on me.    The  CD starts off almost like their first CD with \\"Rock the Beat II\\", which I love; it's a great way to start off.    The title track, \\"Sorry for Party Rocking\\" reminded me a lot of a classic Beastie Boys song and it quickly became one of my favorites; it should be their theme song.    The CD contains several amazing songs such as their number one hit \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" (which is also an amazing video!), \\"Sexy and I Know It\\" and \\"Put That Ass To Work.\\"    Be sure to check out the video for \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" in our Video of the Week section!!!!!    Then you have the fast paced \\"Take It To The Hole\\" with guest Busta Rhymes, which is a perfect fit for the \\"go crazy\\" feel of the song; you can NOT listen to it with out moving!    There are a few songs that I'm not very impressed with, such as \\"Champagne Showers\\" and \\"With You\\".    I would have given this CD a 6 out of 10 fins at first, but after listening to it several times and thanks to song #14....I gotta give it a 9 out of 10 fins....    .....it would have been 10 out of 10, but no booklets...come on guys, don't forget about us folks that still BUY music they way it should be bought.    ** On a side note, if you don't know who LMFAO is, I strongly suggest you look them up; they are amazing and hilarious and REAL. When we saw them the first time, they were outside Rupp Arena, just walking around and meeting fans...it was really awesome. Not only do they make great music, they make hilarious videos and truly live the \\"party rock\\" lifestyle.....everyday they are shuffling.
B00007GZR5|1.0|Wow. I seriously cannot believe that anyone would watch this theatrical abomination! The plot was so slow, everyone in it was a not-so-fantastic actor ), the dialoge was lame and the music was so loud I could barely hear anything else! Okay, so the special effects were cool, but that really doesn't make up for the bad acting and lack of plot. Also, the special effects were better suited for a children's fantasy movie, although the theme was very mature -- dealing with death, heaven, hell and suicide. It just left me shaking my head in confusion. And plus, the main character (Chris) was completely uncaring about his children, and more interested in his stupid dog and a TREE one minute, but then a loving, doting father. Honestly?!?! Talk about mixed messages. This really could have been an interesting story, the main idea was thought-provoking, but it was executed in such a haphazard manner. There were tons of holes in the plot, supposedly there are not ruled in heaven, and then suddenly there are. This could have been a good movie, but unfortunately it very fell short of my expectations.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I feel like they must have rushed it out too quickly or something.  My Archos 43 is listed as supposedly being compatible and I've found a few people who were able to managed to get the game to run if they ran the VTL loader (which runs horribly on the Archos 43, but it's meant for tablets, not PDAs like this or smartphones) and killed every single background application first (even things like the device settings should be closed.)  It seems it requires that you free up a lot of memory on devices like these that have less than 512MB of memory (eg almost everyone but tablet users.)  I've tried absolutely everything though and just can't get the thing to work at all with the VTL or Zeam launchers and > 120MB memory free (and no game should actually require that anyone do all of this just to get it running.)  What's more, the game just simply crashes during the loading screen.  Obviously a completely unhandled exception or something.  It doesn't \\"force close\\" or produce any error message whatsoever, just suddenly I'm staring at the loader again after waiting some 2+ minutes to try to start it.  That's bad design in my book as this means it doesn't even catch that there is an error at all, but just does something it shouldn't be doing probably.  I even tried using the Logcat program to see if at least something showed up in the system log to reflect such an absolute crash, but just couldn't find anything.  Whatever it's doing to cause a crash like this just seems very bad to me.  I tried twice to report the issue and never even received so much as acknowledgement that it might not work despite being listed as being compatible.  I also see a lot of other people having problems with devices that should be able to manage it (some of which are more powerful than mine.)<br /><br />Frankly, I just feel that it simply wasn't developed enough.  It needs more optimizing (especially the load times -- that's just ridiculous) and cleaning up as well as a lot more compatibility fixing to work on more devices (and of course it should be able to report basic errors, but everything should be able to do that.  How can a user diagnose or repair issues when they are given absolutely nothing to work with?)  Given that I basically can't run the game, I can't say if it's just a quick and dirty port (perhaps from an iPhone version?) or what, but whatever it is, I think it just seems to not really be ready for the market yet IMO.  I regret that I made the mistake of actually buying it since I missed the opportunity to get it for free.  Now it's just taking up space uselessly for me since I can't even get past the loading screen no matter what I do.  I keep updating in the hopes the problem will be fixed, but still nothing.  At this point it seems kind of hopeless that I'll ever play this game on my PDA.<br /><br />EDIT:  Looks like the main issue is memory.  You really need around 120MB completely free to play this game.  256MB memory devices like most SmartPhones and PDAs (eg the smaller \\"Internet tablets\\") are going to have troubles.  I managed to, by a lot of work, free up enough to get the game to run.  I'm using a rooted firmware along with tools to kill off a lot of the normally running programs and the Zeam Launcher (home screen replacement.)  If I kill everything in the system monitor before trying to play I get just barely enough memory free.  Overall it IS a fun game, but I still get a few crashes from time to time which is more than just a bit annoying.  They still really need to work on the game's efficiency or something -- or just give up and make it officially require 512MB of memory.k on more devices (and of course it should be able to report basic errors, but everything should be able to do that.

9626341041|3.0|I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version. I found out when the book on  CD got here that it's abridged...not what I wanted at all. Although it lasted a car ride back home from school, I would prefer to listen to the whole book, not a synopsis.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is a fantastic app!  The current version (as of 7/7/2011) has 70 sounds that very realistically mimic a variety of background noises.  You can layer up to 3 different sounds and adjust the volume separately on each to get the right balance for your comfort.  I've used various sound machines to help me sleep for over 20 years.  This is better than all of them!    I wish this app and these sounds were in a stand-alone machine so I could use it every day without worrying about wearing out my phone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Better than A.B. I found it to be more it to be more of a brain teaser and less reliant on luck. Very very fun!
076115728X|5.0|This book is amazing! It's great to show kids that even though they goofed, they can make it into some pretty amazing art! i can't wait to use it i nmy classroom.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Definitely worth the wait for this app to launch, not necessarily worth the wait for it to load though... ridiculously slow on Samsung Vibrant.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I'm having tons of fun with this game. Well planned and executed. I love the different zombies. the controls for moving and shooting are really easy to use too. works perfectly on my G2.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|For a Beatles lover, a lover of a love story, and proud revelation of the need for the world to have more \\"feel rocking sexy\\" flicks this is sure fire WIN. There is not depth in the story line just a great showcase of how music can be the backdrop for a great movie.  The art was great and you get attracted to the unique lens the filmmaker gives the audience Thoughtful, great character placement and a bit off the beaten path.<br />This one will stay in the collection.
1594202842|5.0|The hundreds of energetic reviews here serve as a testament to just how powerful a piece Amy Chua has written. Although her memoir could be seen as a battle between Eastern and Western styles of parenting, it is so much more than that. It is about a mother who gives it her all to raising her children, and expects--OK, severely demands--that they give every drop of effort to achieving success. The Tiger Mother style of parenting is no doubt an extreme one, but at its very essence its motivations are inline with Western parenting: the prosperity of the child. And, prosperity is in the eye (and culture) of the beholder.<br /><br />Whatever your reactions are to this memoir, they're likely to be strong. Be prepared to be shocked, disturbed, touched, amused, and amazed. And, be prepared to take a good hard look at what you assume matters most in life. Whether or not you sing the praises of the Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, it will be hard to get the memoir's soul-shaking lyrics and beat out of your head.
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|I actually bought this movie because of Greg Kinnear.    I wanted to see him mellow and more real and this movie does that.  It's a beautiful, thought provoking and very Nicolas Sparks.  He really likes stories with heart.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I am too young to have lived through this talking head. But I know my dad would have enjoyed this look at a figure that was larger that life in the Vietnam era. The lessons were great and totally worth understanding.  I like this as a classroom history addition on movie day. If you are a history teacher this may be on your must see list.
0143118420|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! The movie wasn't good, but what book-inspired movie is?!  It was well written, funny, heart wrenching and REAL!    Its definitely a must read.
0767802470|5.0|This is a great movie about war as told from the point of view of an enemy.  You truly feel for the men of the german submarine service even though it doesn't make sense near the begining it all becomes clearer as the story goes on.  One of the true telling points of the movie is to watch how the first officer changes as the story goes on,  he goes from a well groomed and precise hitler youth to a beaten man as the story goes on.  As the movie goes on you start routing and feeling for the crew of the submarine as they struggle just for survival in the harsh conditions of the north sea.
B003UESJHO|4.0|Great character acting and some really unique material based on a true story. I have no complaints with the script, the acting, or the actual movie making part of this film. The best actor portrayal in this is the character Dickie played by Christial Bale. The director did a great job unfolding this as a unique viewpoint, and it was entertaining-<br />but not amazing<br />My overall vote is this one is not a keeper, not a movie you need to watch over and over, and not a big enough Rocky triumph. You just felt like the lead character was going to get sucked back into the dysfunction as soon as the credits rolled.<br />No happy place for the viewer to glob into. Let your boyfriend watch it while you clean out your closet.
B000002H6C|4.0|that is right this is the fifth time i have purchased this album. first 2 times on cassette tape .then a few times on cd. why ? and justice for all in my opinion is the best album metallica made . i didn't care for the black album or load or reload, st anger was interesting but i didn't get into that album either.the lyrics and the music on this album are at a level metallica hasn't matched since.  and the double tom's tuned low are awesome as well.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|I do not reccomend this as great watching- but I appreciated it.  The acting is GREAT, the story line is unique, the cinema fantastic,  and I just could not get past the underage boy having sex with a 40 year old woman to dive into the lovestory part of this that was crucial. A young boy falls in love with an older woman, then later finds she is on trail for war crimes, and we see a span of 30 years of life. For those who squeam at inappropriate stuff this killed me the same way the squid and the whale did. It sucked out ALL of my happy. I acknowledge the work as being great.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Good free game, might not be worth $2.99. Although this game definitely falls into the category of &quot;throw zombies into something because it's in style&quot;, I still enjoyed it and found it fun.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Great actors being great- the action ADHD jigjaggy movement was the killer of what could have been a great charcater makeover. I love action movies but this was an established character and a loved personna that was crushed. My husband begged to leave the first 5 minutes. The story line was trounced for the sake of the action, we never ever fall in love with the lead character and that is tragic because: Who does NOT want to be Sherlock Holmes? Cinematics were dark and felt very dingy, I never felt I got a clean look at anything just more dirty smelly feeling coming through the camera.  I wanted some light, lightness of humor, lightness of love, lightness of mood.  Not worth the evening it robbed me of.  Action lovers- it will not be awesome enough and mystery lovers there is not enoug plot to temp you.
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I found this movie entertaining, which is really all you can ask of a movie. I had read the book, and although obviously there had to be some changes, I thought in general it stayed faithful to the spirit of Carl Sagan. It's good to see a science-fiction movie in which battles with aliens isn't the main theme.    One thing surprises me. Although I haven't plowed through all the reviews, nobody seems to have commented on an allusion which I thought was fairly obvious (and is also in the book). Ellie encounters her 'father', who tells her that he has taken this form because it would make her feel more comfortable. He then goes on to say that it has always been done this way. Now, that seems to me to be very sensible; if you wanted to arrange to meet another type of life-form, the best way to do it without provoking alarm would be to adopt the same corporeal form as those whom you going to contact. The suggestion that it has 'always been done this way'.... well, maybe it has, except that it was on this planet. I'd find that logical and perhaps that was what the movie and Sagan were suggesting.    It would be far more logical for an advanced alien civilization to adopt that strategy than for an all-powerful deity to do so, wouldn't it?
0470901071|5.0|I just wanted to say that I purchased the Kindle edition of this book and studied for about a month before I took the test. While I was working through one of the example simulations in the book, I was having difficulty getting the network to work correctly. I emailed the author, Mr. Lammle, and he responded back the same day with the answer. Since I had purchased the Kindle edition, I did not have all the bonus materials that came on the CD with the hardback. After I sent Mr. Lammle my receipt, he emailed me digital copies of all the extras. I passed the test on the first try. I just wanted to say that the book was thorough and complete and the author very helpful.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Installed to my nook but when run only got a black screen. Only way to get out was to hit home button and my adw desktop had crashed. Tried two times, same result. Did not show up in the installable list for my stock Nexus one, so could not even attempt a test there. So what does that mean? The original reference google phone is not on the list?
0670022411|1.0|Given the author's credentials, I was expecting an erudite occult thriller.  Instead, this book's passive and perpetually endangered Mary Sue heroine and her preternaturally devoted and chaste vampire lover make this a slow-paced (and incomplete) wish-fulfillment fantasy better suited for the post-\\"Twilight\\" set. And, erm, vampire yoga?
0451197968|4.0|At a time when the most popular games were Family Feud (1976-1985), The Joker's Wild (1977-1986) and The Price if Right (1972-current), The Running Man is an oddly prophetic look at game shows forty-three years in the future. In the year 2025, the mega-corporations control society and the most popular game shows are reality shows... reality shows of death!<br /><br />I read The Running Man as a science fiction novel (not as a King/Bachman novel) but I became most interesting in King's early vision of the future of TV gaming and the control it has on people. Look at all the abysmal shows that have been run over the past two decades, especially the ones where conniving producers purposely mismatch the characters for the sake of artificial drama (The Real World) or pin humans against each other in challenging conditions for prizes (Survivor) or just viewing dysfunctional people (The Osbournes and so many others).<br /><br />Stop and think about it. Isn't it just perverse?<br /><br />Well, ethics beside, The Running Man has a more lethal twist to the genre, as you can probably read in every other review. Considering King/Bachman's future, it is dystopian in the fullest and filled with all sorts of evils. In a sense, it's unilaterally drab. The whole \\"dreary, dystopian Big Brother\\" future has been done in the 70s, the 60s and before - so that aspect isn't anything new. The characterization is also fairly unilateral. It's a short novel so it doesn't have much time to build up the character of Ben Richards, besides his socio-economic status and his love for his daughter and wife (hmm, that's about it).<br /><br />The ending is obvious even to someone who hasn't seen the movie (I hate sci-fi films, with a few minor exceptions). The unfolding of the ending, while predictable, was a blow-for-blow series of bluff, call, bluff, call. It's very well-scripted, nerve racking journey to the end.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|If you're at all a fan of dual stick shooters like Geometry Wars, or funny dialogue like Serious Sam, try this game out.  I'm not a fan of touch screen controls for games, and while I did have some minor issues, this game mostly controlled very smoothly. The graphics were crisp on my Evo 3D and the sound was good too.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|This game works great on my HTC Droid Incredible running CM7. It took a long time for it to load, but once it did, it was pretty smooth. However, it will not run on Nook Color (also running CM7). The screen stays black or will reboot the device. The splash screen never displays.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|I don't know about anyone else, but when I sit down to watch a Nic Cage film, I'm usually going to watch one of his bad movies. Why? Because they're hilarious, and this movie is no exception. The special effects are just laughable, and you can spot the green screen a lot of the time. The acting is atrociously bad. Terrifically bad, or terribad as I say.    By now you must be wondering why I rated this movie 5 stars, after dissing everything about it. All of these terrible elements of the movie come out and make the movie not an action movie, but a comedy of sorts.    The lines read by the actors are hilarious. The first time I watched this movie, my friends and I were cracking puns about something that was said every minute or so. We were laughing so hard that we couldn't breath, and tears were coming out of our eyes. Not to mention, as I said earlier, the special effects are literally laughable. These effects would have been acceptable in the 90's, but today they're just hilarious.    Seriously, if you're going into this movie expecting to get an Academy Awards level movie, you're at the wrong place, don't buy this. If you go into this movie with an open mind, and expecting it to be so bad that it's funny, then you will enjoy yourself immensely. I mean come on, he drinks beer from the guys skull at the end, and kills a room full of people while straddling a woman. From the moment he comes on screen with those ridiculous Oakley's you will be laughing.    This is Nic Cage people. What do you expect? Either you love him or you hate him. The number of good movies he's had can be counted on your fingers.    If you're a fan of cheesy cinema, then this one is for you.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins presents his thoughts and experience in a clear and concise, while also non-apologetic, manner. I could not recommend this more to those interested in any of the many forms of theology, though brights will find this a particularly intriguing read.
0307454541|3.0|I found this book to be very overrated. It was very highly recommended by several of my friends and I looked forward to reading it. I picked it up and put it back down several times over a couple of months before I finally got \\"into it\\". After a captivating prologue, the first 1/4 of the book was boring and slow moving. Then it picks up and you really are drawn into the story, even though the writing leaves something to be desired, because the plot is really good. I felt that the last 1/4 of the book read much like the first 1/4. Boring, tying up loose ends, but taking much, much too long to do so. The character development is mediocre too. I didn't feel like I cared enough about the characters to want to read the rest of the books in the series.
0553381695|5.0|After reading the first book in the set I was insanely hyped for this book and I must say it does not disappoint. I also loved the larger print size of this novel and my eyes are very pleased. Don't doubt this book at all just buy it.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|My mom actually ordered it from the site for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She ordered it three weeks in advance along with four other items for the Free Super Saver Shipping deal. The other three items arrived promptly within 5 days. After my mom had already paid for the items, a problem arose with the pool.It was \\"no longer available.\\" she called immediately to confirm that her product was still coming. the response was that she should just select the item from a different provider. No help on how to get refunded by the provider she had already ordered from. My mom, confident because she had already paid for it, decided to stick with her guns and wait on the \\"no longer available item\\" to arrive. six weeks after she ordered the item, it arrived. shortly after, the item came back up as available through the same seller, In the Swim Pool Supplies, for about $30 more(its current price.)     The pool is time consuming to blow up if you don't have an apparatus to inflate it. Once blown up, it deflates rather quickly with the heat intensity. I have to spend at least 45min in advance getting it set-up before my daughter can play. The sprinklers don't need a lot of water power to spray. If you turn the hose on full blast, you get a full blast reaction. All the accessories are fun and easy to blow-up.     The gift is awesome-the service, not so much. I am glad that my mom stuck to her guns on this one. It saved her $30-$40 extra which I would not have spent on this particular pool. The $27.99 plus tax she spent is the price I'd say this pool is worth.
B004V2S4SS|5.0|I won't lie to you, when I first saw \\"Medium\\" in our greek channel, I said \\"Oh come on another show with dead people asking for help!\\" because thats what other shows/movies have shown to me, but I sat and watched it, I gor caught by its suspense, and intense scenario, I immediately bought all seasons, and finaly received the 7th today!    If you like a down-to-earth but also supernatural kind of show, this is the one....

B0058P7KUA|3.0|The usual and very annoying openfeit startup issues aside, the game is somehow shifted down on my screen: there is an about 20 pixel wide black band on top of the landscape screen, and the bottom of the picture is outside of the screen.  Edit: removing one star, because I can't start the game again, it would not start, would just get stuck on the black screen forever (openfeit issues I suppose). Tried restarting the phone - the game would still not start.

0385335989|5.0|I am so glad I've read Drums of Autumn and proved the negative reviewers wrong.  I almost decided not to push deeper into the Outlander series, but my addiction won out.<br /><br />Gabaldon keeps me riveted with her incredibly well researched history.  Never has an author set a stage so well, thrown out old misconceptions and painted such a grimy yet beautiful picture of life in the 18th century.  It is also a pleasure to read about places I've been and the area where my wife was born and raised.  I began The Fiery Cross last night.<br /><br />This is fantasy at it's best.  Sure, it is a romance novel read by men like me, but it is at it's heart a fantasy.  I am a sci-fi and sometimes fantasy reader so I accept the unreality of fantasy.  That does not mean the historical settings are any less real.  In real life Jamie and Claire would have been dead a dozen times over but fantasy allows them to survive every scrape they find themselves in.  Fantasy is Fantasy and Gabaldon is a master of fantasy.<br /><br />Drums is very hard to put down.  Whereas I almost dropped Outlander half finished due to a sometimes dragging storyline, Drums moves at a fast pace and presents two parallel story lines that keep you riveted on not just two but now four main characters and their intertwining destinies.<br /><br />History is made with Drums of Autumn.  Read it with the prescience that you too will be back for more the moment you finish the last page.

B004WMKSH2|3.0|Advances the story adequately at a slow pace with a few action and comedy pieces.  Sometimes got so slow for so long I began to loose interest.  Needs a good 20-30 minutes cut out to make it a better film that is more in line with the pacing of the previous Harry Potter films.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|I'm a fan of hard to follow movies.  The Cell, The Fountain, Vanilla Sky, Inception, etc. this one does not disappoint.    I won't ruin it with a critique trying to sound like I am an English major or expert movie critic... who the F cares?    What does matter is this:    1.)  Multiple dimensions script and in play.  2.)  Guns.  3.)  Hot chicks.  4.)  Action.  5.)  Guns.  6.)  Hot chicks.  7.)  Tripped out plot, but if you follow it, it is worth while.  8.)  Swords.  9.)  Guns.  10.) Hot Chicks.    One can't go wrong with this flick, and beyond the top 10 above, it actually does have a good story... should your mind be apt enough to follow it.

The kind you don't have to work at to like, or pretend to like, THIS is what art is.  Mr. Waits, may you never stop and may there be a decent enough piano around everywhere you go.  I would like to nominate this album for Best of the Best, Best of the Beasts, and Best of the Brats.<br />Mozart's got nothin' on you, Tom.  Buy it today and you can enjoy wishing you'd done it last week.....It (for no neocortical reason) calls to mind (for me) some of Frank's Wild Years and One From the Heart.  Blah, blah, blah......'tis a masterpiece, and certain to increase in value with every listening.

B000784WMW|5.0|Every actor in this superb cast is part of something very special. Ms. Clarke and Mr. Dalton are first among equals, and their scenes together are wonderful.  Ms. Clarke is a lovely, modest, and principled Jane Eyre, with a core of steel.  Mr. Dalton was born to play Edward Fairfax Rochester.  His voice is a gorgeous instrument, beautifully handled.  It's a delight to watch favorite scenes dramatized so well. The salary dispute is more exhilarating than a fencing match, and the renunciation scene is powerful. All praise to director Julian Amyes and dramatist Alexander Baron for honoring Miss Brontë's novel with this fine production.
B004G6009K|5.0|I bought it for my kids and I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. The quality of the image plus the superb sound and music make Tangled a classic. 3D version is of high quality. A must-have for CGI and Disney aficionados alike.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|Good authentic musical rendition of movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to John Williams' orchestration of his music.  When I heard the drum music, I could vividly see the young girl running along the maze to go to the temple to make her wish.  The music had a \\"patter of little feet\\" sound to it!  The other pieces were beautiful as well with a traditional, but at the same time, contemporary Japanese sound to it.  I recommend seeing the movie \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and then buying a CD from Amazon.  I got my CD in less than a week and it was in perfect condition!
B0000025JT|5.0|By 1980 Barbra Streisand proved she was a tireless and intelligent performer. Wanting to stay current she hired the Bee Gees to write and produce her new album called \\"Guilty\\", Streisand's most successful album to date selling over 20 million copies.<br /><br /> Highlights include the title track, a duet with Barry Gibb, which was a #3 Pop hit and garnered them the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal By a Duo, the beautiful and haunting \\"Woman in Love\\" that went all the way to #1 for 3 weeks and became a Streisand standard, and another duet with Gibb called \\"What Kind of Fool\\" going all the way to #10. The CD only contained 9 tracks, but it is widely considered to be the record that made a comeback for Barbra.<br /><br /> In 2005 on the 25th Anniversary of the album's release Columbia rereleased \\"Guilty\\" with renewed audio sound. On the back of the CD came a bonus DVD with behind-the-scenes footage on the making of the album, interviews, videos, and more.<br /><br /> In the same year a sequel album, which was far less successful than \\"Guilty\\", called \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" was released, but still managed to sell over 500,000 copies.
0061997811|5.0|I love this book.  It spans all 8 movies and has all sort of fun extras like Harry's letter and a Yule Ball program. Bright, colorful pictures and comments/stories about the actors make it a fun and easy read.
B001HN694K|5.0|I especially enjoyed this version of Alice in Wonderland. As someone who grew up reading the books and then seeing the animated Disney version, I was quite thrilled to hear that they were doing a live action version, and then to hear that Tim Burton would be directing was a dream come true. It's Alice in Wonderland for grown ups, but it can also be appreciated by older children as well. The costuming is beautiful, the Mia Wasikowska is breathtaking, and Johnny Depp provides another grand performance. I highly recommend for anyone who is an Alice in Wonderland Fan, a Johnny Depp fan, or a Tim Burton fan!

B000001FB3|5.0|Much consternation surrounds any overview of Rainbow's `Down to Earth' album, released in the summer of 1979. Some circles, the serious metallics, pan the record as pop nonsense after the metal majesty of the Dio-era records. I used to be in that camp although I did like the album but I just thought it didn't hold a candle to `Rising' or `Long Live Rock n' Roll'. An while I still consider the Ronnie records among my all-time favorites, `Down to Earth' has grown on me to the point that I consider it a monumental achievement in its own right. Did the band sell out? Well, yes and no. Two deliberate singles in \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" (love it) and \\"All Night Long\\" (love it less) were the traditional side openers but of the rest is classic Blackmore. Graham Bonnet was also another reason I felt this record was soft but I've come around on him too.  He is great on his only MSG record and the first Alcatrazz disc so I'm now a Graham Bonnet fan. Anyway, \\"Eyes of the World\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" are true masterpieces and should be given more consideration when this LP is evaluated. \\"Love's No Friend\\" is a slow blues and \\"Danger Zone\\" always got me.  If you want to slight Rainbow for their change from classic metal to AOR then fine but I really think the Joe Lynn Turner years deserve this distinction. `Down to Earth' is a classic Rainbow record, with or without the late great Elf! PS, last record for Cozy as well (RIP too).
B000E41MS6|5.0|It came just in time, and with an additional disc( 2 disc 3s). Good series to start off with. Excellent service and product was in excellent shape!!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I was never a huge fan of the default calendar app, and had found Touch Calendar to be my best option for an alternative to the default from the Google market.  When this was released as a free app, I thought I would try to see if it worked better than Touch Calendar.  After having using this for quite a while now, I can easily say that I am so glad that I downloaded this app.  Its initial display upon opening the app is so much nicer than Touch Calendar, and I really like the customization options that it offers.  And then there are some nice features like touching a date to see a popup of the events (and their times) on that date, is a really nice feature.      Then there is the widget.  I've never seen an interactive widget like this one.  It is very obvious that some thought was actually put into the design of this app.    The only downside to the app is its price.  I probably would never have paid 5 for it, without being able to try it first.  But since I was able to get it as part of the Free App a Day promotion, it was a nice risk free option.  Knowing what I know now about the quality of this app, I would certainly agree that the app is worth the price they are charging.

0385341679|5.0|This series includes Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever, & the newest Shadowfever. I read the entire series in 4 days because once I started I couldn't quit reading it. Just when I thought I figured out whats going to happen it throws another curve ball...I was laughing hysterically at some parts of the series, crying in other parts, & falling in love with the lead male Jericho Barrons by the end of the series. Shadowfever was the best book in the series but you must read the other four before reading Shadowfever or you won't understand what's going on.

Both discs, The original version with extras, and the exclusive black & white version with intro from the director, look incredible! And the Dolby TrueHD sound envelops around yo for true scares out of nowhere... Internet features, some deleted scenes, running commentary, and a killer award-winning performance by Marcia Gay-Harden!
B002ZG993Q|1.0|Thinking man's thriller? Whatever! Slow paced doesn't even begin to describe it. There are no twists. I thought it was all predictable and cliche. There were no characters that I cared anything about.  Wish I could get my 2 hours back. Oh, but my husband did like the half naked prostitute.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|I get the black screen upon startup and eventually would come on after multiple back key.  The picture is then overblown and overfills the screen.    I guess I will play with the setting to see if something would work.
B0041VIJQG|5.0|Robert Plant shows how aging rockers can continue to grow as artists. In that sense, Band of Joy is easily the equal of Dylan's \\"Love and Theft\\" and \\"Modern Times.\\" Somebody needs to send a copy of these records to Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey!    Not recommended for those looking to hear 21st century updates of Led Zeppelin II or IV. Plant stretches out in the direction outlined in III, as well as his 1994 collarboration with Jimmy Page and his more recent work with Allison Krause.

B000ECX0QU|4.0|At the moment Topaz was released the espionage based on the recent episodes derivative from the Cold War and the boiling point recahed by the Soviet misils in 1962, a lot of of good films concerned for this issue were released such as Manchurian Candidate, Seven days from May, Dr. Strangelove, Fail safe. These films without including the saga of Bond films or The man from UNCLE (for instance).<br /><br />And I make this brief account because the impression after forty five years - specially for the negw generations of movie lovers looks totally different.<br /><br />In this sense this was (since Thirty nine steps and Sabotage) the third film related with this subject.<br /><br />Effectively, Hitchcok focuses his attention around the neglected affective repercusions respect the people who was involved. I mean the international conflict is left aside to carve in relief certain unforgettable sequences (such as Juanita's death and the unmasking of Jarre as the link)<br /><br />Watch Hitchcok on a wheelchair in the airport. A true suspenseful movie although the elapsed years.
0307341550|5.0|Make no mistake, Sharp Objects is NOT an easy read.  Not because it's dense or the language is overly complicated (exactly the opposite on both counts, actually) but because the characters and setting are so wholly distasteful and vile that you may find yourself squirming in your seat, alone and with no one to relate to.  And Sharp Objects, with it's bitter rivalries, decomposing families and casual murder, is a difficult place to find yourself all alone.    Let me step back a little bit.      This is a brilliant book, and undeniably so.  It spins a unique and captivating narrative through the one of a kind voice of it's flawed, flawed, FLAWED protagonist.  The characters are distinct beyond expression and will remain in the dingier parts of your mind for years to come.  It's a trip, to say the least, but a trip I would not recommend for everyone.  It's an amazing book, but I can perfectly understand why people might hate it.    The whole story is yellowed at the edges and reaks of illness and decomposition.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to move through it without having a sinking feeling in your guy and a gritty taste in your mouth.  It's a merciless trip that makes you feel as sick and broken as the characters, and if that type of visceral experience is not something you'd enjoy, you'd best move on.  This is not your typical \\"suspense-mystery-thriller\\"; there is no scene where our heroic heroine has her back to the door, cold sweat on her forehead and her pistol cocked and ready because the killer may be INSIDE THE HOUSE! ...Instead, we're given scenes like the one when our protagonist (an adult) does exstacy with her teenage sister and her friends and then goes wandering alone in the streets and we, the readers, are left to deal with the moral implications of this.  If you're expecting the \\"killer in the next room -- ah!\\" tride and true, SAFE kind of suspense where you know things are going to be okay, this is not the book for you.    In fact, the moment you pick it up, youKNOW things aren't going to be okay.  Our main character is a self-cutter, her sister's sick all the time from mystery ailments similar to what killed her other sibling in infancy, her mother is obviously CRAZY, and children in town have started dying brutally and inexplicably.  Is there a 'who-dunnit' element to the tale?  Yup.  Is there a twist ending?  At least one, depending on how you look at it.  But those elements are pushed into the background, the volume turned down on them, so that character development and tone could be cranked up to eleven.  It's an even, well layered tone and the characters are incredibly well-drawn out, and the end result is kind of like watching a gory movie: if you don't like to squirm in your seat at least a little bit, you're not gonna have fun.    Still, if you've any interest in darker tales and disfunctional (read: murderous) folks, this is a quick, captivating, flowing read with some superb writing and unforgettable imagery.      If you aren't fairly warned now, you'll never be.  Cheers.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Through tireless interviews and skilled prose and narrative, Barbara Demick brings the human face to the northern half of the Hermit Kingdom.  The text gives a voice to six North Korean defectors from very different backgrounds who each risked their lives in order to reach the freedom of South Korea.  I found myself captivated by the stories of life under the control of the regime; of the dreams of professionals and students desiring to join the Party; of the second Arduous March (starvation period in the 1990's); and of the varied means of escape employed by the defectors.  I cannot thank Ms. Demick enough for this compilation of personal stories.<br /><br />The Kindle version is very good, notably in the way the photographs remain intact.<br /><br />Recommended uses:  This book would be highly appropriate for readers over the age of 12, and would be a welcome text for a high school to college-level student of Asian studies, social studies, world history, or political science.  I would recommend this book for professors and instructors to use with their students in developing the understanding of the human factor and plight of the North Koreans under the current regime.  One possible assignment in reinforcing the text would be character outlines of each defector, detailing the defector's background, social rank, education, circumstances prior to defection, method of defection, and issues with post-defection adjustment.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, I highly recommend Kim Hyun Hee's text, \\"The Tears of my Soul\\", a story of a North Korean agent, and \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\", a story of life and death in one of North Korea's prison camps.

0670022411|3.0|I was really excited about reading this book when my mother raved about it, but I wound up having mixed feelings by the time I finished it.     **Semi-Spoiler Alert**    I can appreciate an intelligent read, but the vast majority of this book delved far too much into the world of history, science and whatever else in order to expand on the plot. I'm a fan of the History, Discovery and Science channels (and not-so brainy ones), but this bored me to tears at times. It got to the point where I almost gave up entirely throughout several parts of it.     Much of the past, mythological or science-related parts probably could have been explained in a few, short paragraphs. In the end, it felt like it took up about 50% of the book, almost coming off as pretentious at times. In fact, the term \\"DNA\\" now stands for \\"Damn, not again!\\" in my somewhat limited vocabulary.    The other part that annoyed me a little (a lot) would be the relationship between the characters. I loved some of them, and certain parts had me laughing - in a good way. Diana and Matthew were likable at first until they started liking each other, and that's where things got lame.    It was as if the lovebirds in the book resembled the obsessive and clingy relationship between Twilight's Bella and Edward. DNA?! Really, it was Bella and Edward, only with an odd fascination/obsession for tasting and smelling wine as part of their courtship. This was novel the first time, but then it just got to the point of being overdone. Dead. I kept laughing throughout most of it, picturing my own likely reaction. (\\"Smell the wine, Diana. What do you smell?\\" \\"Get off it already, would you? You freaking smell it!\\")     I like a strong male character, but I also like a strong female character. Diana was initially strong in her own right, but things eventually lead into that kind of Bella-worthy, can't-breathe-without-him neediness that drove me mental. If I wasn't rolling my eyes at the overload of genetics and repetitive backlog, I was aiming it at the mock sado-masochism and wine fetish thing going on.       The author's work background and her being a first-time author helped to explain much of this. I have also come to the conclusion that she really likes wine. However, I just felt like there was a lot lacking with the actual plot. There would be times where I'd get sucked in, and other moments where I would literally be skipping pages to get to the fun bits (or to finish the book). By the time I finished, part of me wanted to find out more. At the same time, it also left me feeling annoyed to have read so much, but without gaining much action or closure from the experience.    I can't say that I would read the book over again, as I have with others. If this hadn't been the author's first attempt, I'd probably give up on the rest of series all together, but hopefully the next run will be more of a satisfying read.

B0000931QA|5.0|So I've heard a few songs off of this album before, but for some reason I never bought it yet. Now I have a used copy of the original BMG edition from the 80's, and it sounds superb (Qualiy-wise and music-wise)! ON TO THE REVIEW: Queensrÿche's 1988 concept album, Operation: Mindcrime, is the band's major breakthrough into critical and commercial success (not counting their following album Empire). This album contains an extremely strong and powerful story/concept, which will easily please progressive music fans (like myself), along with some very catchy hit singles for the mainstream rock fans, such as \\"I Don't Believe in Love\\". The concept involves a drug \\"junkie\\" named Nikki, who is disillusioned with Ronald Reagen era society and is coerced into serving as Dr. X's pawn in eliminating corrupt political leaders. This album explores such topics as prostitution, greed, and drugs and how it has impacted 1980's American society. There is also a tragic love story between Nikki and a prostitute-turned nun, who he is forced to kill by Dr. X. After his lover's death, Nikki goes into a psychotic frenzy on the streets, until he is committed to a mental hospital. This is where the story originally began, as the protagonist remembers the events that have previously occurred. This album is extremely ambitious, but accessible in its approach, and for that, it has rightfully earned the respect of many hard rock and heavy metal fans worldwide (including me). There is a sequel, simply called Operation: Mindcrime II, which is about Nikki exacting his revenge towards Dr. X. However, I DO NOT recommend it. It is basically rehashing what made the original classic so brilliant, the music and lyrics are extremely forgettable, and uninspired, and it fails to explore outside of its creative boundaries enough for it to be the slightest bit \\"interesting\\". Just stick with the original classic, you'll be better off that way. Operation: Mindcrime I is an essential album for any hard rock/heavymetal fan before death, and it will live on as one of the greatest concept albums in music history.
B001P1FZDK|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite albums to date. If Animal Collective's earlier albums are too strange for you, then I suggest you listen to this before you give up on them. I really do feel that Animal Collective have successfully found a way to bottle up childhood and put it into music.    In the Flowers is a great opening track with ambiance and a sweet dancing rhythm .The next track, My Girls, is a super catchy song with a great beat to it. The music in Summertime Clothes truly embodies it's chorus (\\"I want to walk around with you\\")in the most perfect way. That and Bluish are the best tracks on the album in my opinion, with the later being a tune that could almost put you in a trance like state if you listened to it long enough, with it's talk of warmth and love (\\"I'm getting lost in your curls\\"). Lion in a Coma fills you with an exotic energy and No More Runnin is the music you could hear in between the stages of awake and asleep. However, despite everyone's opinion, Brother Sport is my least favorite song on the album. It's a little too repetitive for me.     But don't let that keep you from listening to that and the rest of this great album. It makes you feel as though, as one youtube commenter put it, \\"like high diving into a pool filled with light in the most beautiful colors no one has ever seen before\\".

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are some of the best books I have ever read. They draw you in and won't let you go. I cried; I laughed; I loved; and I felt like I was actually part of the story. I cannot wait for these to be made into movies. Yes, they have very gruesome parts, and I would not recommend them for the reader who is easily disgusted. I also do not recommend them to the younger generation. When reading them, keep your heart and mind open. You might find some similarities between the books and things going on in the world around us.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Very much enjoy the classic shot em up style. Also the jokes are corny but still fun. I recommend this game. Also nice graphics and smooth controls
B0058P7KUA|4.0|It took several attempts to get the game to start.  The first several times I got a black screen for about 15 seconds, then it dumped me back on the home screen.  It finally worked the fourth or fifth time I started it.  I think that stupid OpenFient may be to blame.  If it doesn't start, try it again four or five times before you give up.<br /><br />Once I was able to get the game to start, it's pretty fun.  It's a dual-joystick game like the previous Free App of the Day PewPew 2; you move with one joystick and aim with the other.  You can move in one direction while firing in another.  You move around avoiding the zombies while blowing them away with your pistol, grenades or various powerup weapons like a shotgun or buzzsaw.<br /><br />Works well on the Motorola Xoom tablet.

0066620996|4.0|This book provides valuable insight into the keys to greatness on multiple levels - from individual employees to senior management to the company as a whole. Some of the examples may be dated (Fannie Mae most of all), but within the parameters of their research it makes sense. No matter what level of the ladder you're currently on, or where your ambitions are aimed, this book can give perspective that will aid in achieving your professional goals.
B0043U98RY|5.0|I have watched many series (24, Lost, Six Feet Under, Etc.) and this ranks as my favorite. It is a very realistic and truthful version of life in this time period, and the plot and writing is excellent with many twists and turns. The only thing I would caution potential viewers, is that in keeping with the reality of this time period, it is very violent and sexual.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|After all of the critic reviews panning this movie I was going to pass but I'm sure glad I didn't!  I now see that for the most part the critic reviews are based on anti-war, anti-military, anti-USA! After getting used to the camera shake in the beginning it started to actually work quite well.  The action was intense and believable.  The marines, for the most part, performed their duties as they should.  The aliens were believable and the effects where excellent but not in your face.  It was a fun ride!
0307739961|1.0|Vintage Books, A Division of Random House, Inc. sold me their $7.99  (ISBN 978-0-307-73996-4)  copy of \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" for $12 ??? plus shipping.

0062059882|5.0|This is a great book and a really nice hardback edition hence the five stars. Would love to own the signed limited edition but it's waaaaaay too expensive. However when I received my copy from Amazon, the page edges have been cut very unevenly and looks quite sloppy. Anyone else received a copy like this or is mine a faulty one?
B00559B9N8|4.0|This was a fun little book. It's easy to read, admittedly, it's a little predictable, but it is a \\"young reader.\\" If you enjoy fantasy even a little you will enjoy this bit of \\"brain candy.\\" Most of the characters were well developed. There were multiple plot lines that were nicely woven into each other. My only real critique is that the book ends rather abruptly. It's almost as if the author was pushing a deadline or simply got tired of writing. Otherwise a delightful read.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|I love this studio and their games, can't wait to play this one.  Just hangs when launching with a black screen.  Will try uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that fixes the issue.
0307593495|1.0|I stuck by this book, even though a key plot element was practically underlined and in caps early on.  As soon as Hakan disappears anyone who has even read cursorily knows where he is.  Maybe this was done to underscore Wallender's deteriorating mental condition.  If like me you know something about the author and his politics, it wasn't very hard to figure out what had happened.  Also, the book would be about 100 pages shorter if no one drank coffee or got caught in sudden downpours.  Will Linda Wallender take over as the new lead character?
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Fun game for sure. Gets challenging and I enjoy the little boss battles. My main issue is that it takes a very long time to load on my phone. I just timed it as we speak and it took about 60 seconds! It's loaded as quickly as about 40 seconds but it always takes a long time, and sometimes it even hangs and never loads. My phone is an HTC EVO 3D. Game is fun though.
0307917509|5.0|This is the first novel I've read by Jo Nesbo.  I was feeling as though something was missing in my life after reading and enjoying Steig Larson's trilogy beginning with the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  Mr. Nesbo has now filled that void and I'll be purchasing other books written by him in the near future.  The story was captivating and held my interest from start to finish.  The characters are beautifully crafted.  Karen L. Twichell, Author/Speaker

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Excellent. Read Name the Wind first. I have recommended to at least 10 people and given as gifts to at least 2!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. I spent my whole work day just angsting to pick up this book again.    The story revolves around a couple's friendship & subsequent dysfunctional first love. Angsty, funny, romantic, and sexy -- I could have gobbled this up in one sitting. I was sucked in from page 1 and felt very connected to the main characters but also to the secondary characters. I'm really not sure if this is YA or not - there is drinking & smoking & sex - but it never felt gratuitous or overdone. Just realistic & natural to the story, given that this book is about college students.    I love this author's voice and can't believe this is self-published. The kindle version had some awkward formatting (strange indents before paragraphs) which annoyed me at first, but I got used to it.    Totally recommend this read & I'm looking forward to reading anything this author puts forward in the future!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I had originally beat this on my PSP and now to have it on my phone is amazing, same great game and I highly recomend

0316789798|5.0|This is a fantastic book for kids learning to draw.  It starts out with a simple shape and slowly shows you how where to add on other shapes to create really cool animals!  I had it as a kid and absolutely loved this book and enjoyed drawing all kinds of animals for hours.  This book is very simplistic yet teaches kids how to become artists!!  I highly recommend it.

B003L77GG0|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I have been a DIEHARD Smallville fan since its inception in 2001. Although I have thoroughly enjoyed each season, season 10 is definitely the weakest of the series.  One of the problems of this season is that they take DC's greatest villain Darkseid and reduce him to a \\"smokey\\" afterthought. Smallville has always done a great job of integrating villains from the comics and putting their own little twist on it to fit a CW budget but Darkseid fails to make the cut considerably. Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, and even Doomsday have all been transfered from the comic book pages onto the TV screen with great results but Darkseid literary makes an appearance for like 10 seconds in a total of 22 episodes. There is so much untapped potential with the Darkseid character which ultimately makes this season disappointing. Another disappointing element to this season is the sub plot of Oliver Queen revealing his identity to the world. This contributes nothing to the overall plot arch and what makes it worse is that it was directly ripped off from the movie Iron Man. The introduction of Cat Grant leading the opposition against the superheroes is pointless as well. Her character is annoying, irritating, and contributes little to the season. They should have used the hot Cat Grant from season 8 and perhaps introduce an interesting little love triangle when Lois Lane leaves for Egypt. Like I said, most of this season has so much untapped potential. Another disappointing element of the season is the return of Chloe. Chloe is one of Smallville's most popular characters and her return is shoddy at best. The episode \\"Collateral\\" which introduces her return and is a rip-off of the Matrix is perhaps one of the worst episodes of the series. Other elements of the season such as the Vigilante Registration Act, The Suicide Squad, and the government's involvement of superheroes is shoddy, contrived, cheesy and unsubstantial at best. The episode Fortune which blatantly imitates the Hangover movies all but exemplifies the problem of this season in that it borrows from all sorts of popular movies and in the process loses its identity as a great Superman show. Also, Clark Kent decides to shed the Black trenchcoat and wear a Michael Jackson inspired \\"Thriller\\" jacket to reflect his growing optimism and hope necessary to become the Man of Steel. Unfortunately the new costume is very very cheesy. He would have probably been better off he kept the Black Trenchcoat untill he becomes the Man of Steel.            Despite the disappointing nature of season 10, The series finale blew me away. I have to say the Series Finale is the best series Finale of any television show EVER! They did a perfect job of wrapping up 10 seasons of great memories while leading the groundwork for his role as Superman. I was absolutely shocked at the quality of the final episode especially since the rest of the season was mediocre. Other highlights include the season premiere as well as the 200th episode \\"Homecoming\\" which are some of the top episodes in the series. Overall, If you watched all of the other seasons and enjoyed them I strongly recommend you pick up the Final season to see how it all ends. The package is a mixed bag but the resounding conclusion will more than make up for it!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|game is a lot like the popular geometry wars. it just does it with zombies. pretty fun, addicting, and free (for today). i recommend it, but not for lower end devices, as it is a big download and could be too much for them to handle.

B0058P7KUA|5.0|Ok firstly this is a fun game with decent graphics.  It seems like a throwback to the old school NES games that I played as a kid.  It's a solid 4 star game.  The dev has a list of devices that this won't work with.  If your screen has multi touch issues it won't work right.  If it doesn't work with your device and it is multi-touch capable contact Amazon or the dev.  If people don't stop leaving 1 star reviews just because an item doesn't work with their device we are going to lose the free app of the day because devs are getting tired of bad ratings for things that aren't their fault.  It's why bit hack pulled apparatus from the market here
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I've been hoping this game would get ported and finally it did! I loved this game on my iPhone and was bummed to discover it wasn't available after making the switch to android. Glad to see it finally made it.<br />This is a great game, best zombie game, with hours of playability and a fun arcadey approach. I just wish the corny jokes were better. I mean they're just bad. And I hope this Android version sees the amazing seasonal theme updates. Keep up the great work.

B004XWMXX8|4.0|I haven't really paid much attention to Selena Gomez until now.  Besides being just another attractive celebrity, to me she had always been just another Disney princess that had alot of media coverage because of her involvement with Justin Bieber.  But for some reason, the album cover caught my attention here on Amazon.  It seemed to promise a sophisticated sound not present in her previous offerings, and so it has-- to a certain extent.      Although most of the songs, and of course the lyrics, are of the typical Disney-teen-pop variety-- by which I mean persistently sanguine and meaningless--they are still very well produced, and Gomez's voice is surprisingly good, bordering on excellent.She is easily a better singer than Miley Cyrus and Vanessa Hudgens, and her public image is certainly more wholesome.  Considering the demographic of this type of music, that can only be considered as a plus.      Yet, despite the teeny bopper element still present, there are a few songs here that show an evolution toward a more mature, adult oriented sound. Whiplash and Outlaw, in particular, could have come from a recent Britney Spears or Katy Perry album.  Although I enjoy practically every song on the album, the songs that show real progress are the ones that I like the most.      This is a very solid album, and it makes me think that the next one will be even better, especially if the mature elements of this album are explored further and with the same-- or better- quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three books!  The third was my favorite in all. The first two played off of each other, where as the last one found it's own voice through the Mockingjay.  A great trilogy that I will recommend to all.

0596805527|5.0|And with it's girth, I suppose it should be.  The other book on JS that I have is \\"The Book of JavaScript\\" on No Starch Press.  It's a good book with lots of examples, but what I was looking for was more reference on the syntax and how to make sense of other people's JS.  About 15 minutes into the first chapter of this book I understood more about code that I have to maintain than I had with several weeks poking around at specific questions on Google.  I'm now (actually) looking forward to rewriting a bunch of this code to make it prettier and more flexible.  Can't wait to get further in.      First class programming book.  Thanks to the author for keeping it current (this edition published April 2011).

B0034G4ORC|2.0|Well, I saw a lot of Marines, but I saw very few aliens.  I saw a lot of running by the Marines.  I wonder if they had a small budget.  Anyway, this is one of those movies where all the best parts of the movie are in the trailer.  Save your money and your time.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|Lots of potential, strange twists for story purposes.  While a dying sun is believable (although not quite so soon), a few other scientific science facts were blatantly wrong (as in most movies, though, for entertainment purposes).

B002ZG99TK|3.0|FILM RATING:  2.5 stars<br /><br />Unstoppable (2010) is director Tony Scott's latest attempt at creating another engaging, smart, techie, action/thriller/drama movie like Top Gun (1986), Days Of Thunder (1990), Crimson Tide (1995), Enemy of the State (1998), and Deja Vu (2006). Unfortunately, Scott doesn't quite get there with this one. While Unstoppable isn't quite unwatchable, it's probably not all that re-watchable. Once you've seen it, there's little to go back for. Even at 98 minutes, the movie dragged on for me. Scott has all of the technical cinematic ingredients, as he always seems to have in his movies. But once again, after failed attempts with The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3 (2009) and Spy Game (2001), Scott just didn't have a really good story and script to work from. At least that's my excuse for him. I know he can put together incredible movies like the five I listed above, all of which are favorites of mine. But like every great movie, it all starts with the script, and screenwriter Mark Bomback just didn't come through here. It's not a bad story. It's even written well in terms of dialogue. But there's just no emotional core to the characters. They're very one-dimensional...and even the great Denzel Washington can't get his character Frank into my psyche or my heart like so many of his other great characters.<br /><br />Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson give solid performances and round out a solid cast. But they seem to have nothing really to act for. A runaway train with no one at the helm just doesn't make for much of an engaging plot here. I kept wishing Dennis Hopper would show up and give this Speed (1994) wannabe a bad guy that I could hate. I kept thinking that Unstoppable was basically a remake of Speed with a train instead of a bus. And haven't we had enough Speed remakes already? And to be honest, didn't Scott just work with Denzel Washington and trains in The Taking Of Pelham 1-2-3...the year before? Hopefully Scott finds his way back to a good script soon because I definitely love his style of filmmaking when paired with good material.<br /><br />On the positive side, Unstoppable looks and sounds absolutely spectacular on blu-ray, which is the format I saw it in this week. As always, Scott brings on board a great director of photography (Ben Seresin) who provides simply awesome cinematography. When it comes to shooting planes, trains, and automobiles...and submarines, motorcycles, helicopters and any other possible moving piece of machinery, director Tony Scott is about as good as it gets. I'm sure the coordination necessary to bring all of these various moving metal objects together into one camera frame requires a whole team of assistant directors, producers, and various crew. But it's those scenes, when all of these various moving metal objects are actually moving around with each other, that kept me involved in the movie. The multiple helicopters, trains, and automobiles are just incredible to see together.<br /><br />No one seems to bring all of the technical action and stunts together in the editing room like Scott. Of course credit should be given to film editors Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon, who did a good job keeping the film moving along with their final cut. But Scott's filmmaking style is definitely stamped on the cut as well.  Reinforcing the incredible action in this film is top notch sound design and editing by sound supervisor Mark P. Stoeckinger, with his accompanying 28 other sound department crew members. Unstoppable was nominated for the Best Sound Editing Oscar last year, and you can definitely hear why when watching this film! Rounding out the technical praise for Unstoppable, is good production design by Chris Seagers and his enormous team. Every little detail shines through in the sets, locations and with all of the trains, cars, and helicopters. The textures, colors, and materials used throughout the film give it a modern feel that works nicely on film.<br /><br />I was a bit torn between giving Unstoppable 3 stars or 2.5 stars, but I settled on 2.5 because I think the likelihood of me watching this movie again anytime soon is really slim. There's just nothing in the story to go back to. No emotion to feel again. No thoughts to think again. No riddles to unravel. And no character tension to try and release. Unstoppable is a first class production, as director Tony Scott is well known for. But in the annals of filmdom, Unstoppable didn't make much of a mark. It just rolled on through at 70 mph, leaving the tracks empty for the next film to come along and replace it.or 2.5 stars, but I settled on 2.5 because I think the likelihood of me watching this movie again anytime soon is really slim.

006112429X|4.0|I picked this book up after reading a review of the film by the same name starring Tilda Swinton.  Although \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is a little on the longer side (400 pages), author Lionel Shriver uses every page to tell the story of Kevin.  This book took a little warming up to, but by the end, I was wishing there was more to read.    \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" tells the story of a school shooting from the eyes of an unexpected character: the perpetrator's mother.  Through a series of letters to her ex-husband, Eva Khatchadourian takes us into the mind of her sociopath son.  The story takes place two years after the momentous 'Thursday' (as Eva refers to it) and gives a window into this mother's life, now consumed with both grief and guilt over her son's actions.  Eva follows the timeline of her son Kevin's childhood, detailing the events of his life from birth that led up to his horrific crime.    I'll admit, when I selected this book, the topic intrigued me, but I was a little worried that it would be melodramatic and cliche.  This book surprised me.  Albeit the author's style takes a little warming up to (she uses a lot of big words and her style can be a little flowery), but Lionel Shriver writes in a way that really brings the audience into her story.  I could feel her frustration, sorrow, grief, etc, throughout the book.  Her style is at once haunting and endearing, at once extremely detailed and pleasantly vague, only giving details here and there about Thursday.  Like I said, it took me some time to warm up to this book, but by the end it had me in tears (a rare accomplishment for a book).  Shriver is a gifted story teller, developing the story bit by bit and building to an extremely powerful ending.  \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" definitely gripped me; I'm looking forward to seeing the film.

0525425578|4.0|Theodore Boone is back! When author John Grisham introduced the \\"Kid Lawyer\\" last year he suggested that he intended to write a series of juvenile books featuring the 13-year-old legal whiz. His purpose: open up his main genre to a younger audience. The pay-off: another generation of readers to get turned on to the likes of The Firm and The Pelican Brief as they get older. Perhaps he's onto something.<br /><br />In this episode, Theo's girlfriend and classmate, April Finnemore, is missing. The entire town of Strattenburg turns out to look for her and is turned upside down as information begins to surface. Distant relative and general reprobate Jack Leeper has coincidentally escaped from prison in California, has been seen in Strattenburg, and has been known to correspond with the eighth-grader. Police find in him a perfect suspect. Theo's Uncle Ike offers another choice for the eighth-grade boys to focus on: April's rarely seen, washed-out musician father.<br /><br />Action begins with the first sentence of the book: \\"The Abduction of April Finnemore took place in the dead of night, . . .\\" and continues page after turning page. Young adult readers will enjoy it; intermediate readers will, too; in fact, Grisham fans of all ages will like the fast-paced stories featuring Theo Boone. This great summer fare warrants four and one-half out of five reading glasses. I, for one, cannot wait for the next story starring my favorite teen-aged lawyer.<br /><br />--Benjamin Potter, July 8, 2011
B00004WKII|5.0|I purchased this used, but in good condition. It was EXACTLY as described. It was a b-day present for my hubby. Highly recomend, this was a steal!!!!
B000HWZ5X8|1.0|Let me be clear, my score of this title is so low because of the horrible remaster job, not the content. The material and record itself is great; one of my favorite Plant records.    Honestly, this is one of the worst remaster jobs I've ever heard. They apparently re-eq'd it and I've never heard anything so bright, harsh and shrill. I'm serious, it's like the high-end is cutting through your skull. It is so unbearable that I didn't make it through the whole CD - had to turn it off. This is odd, because the remasters of \\"Pictures at 11\\" Now and Zen\\" and \\"The Honeydrippers\\" sound good to great. Again, I have to ask \\"What happened?\\"    Buy this album it's great! But buy the orginal release, still readily available.  Your skull will thank you!
B0054JURZA|5.0|In a nutshell, this album is a great and deeply emotional piece that uses simple melody and rhythm as well as vocals that are more instrumental than anything to paint a plethora musical landscapes.  I cannot listen to this album and not feel some deep emotion stirring within my being.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|My family and I watched this series through a few times -- the teenagers several times actually.  We have gotten an incredible value out of this purchase.  1/2 point off however as the very last disk (series finale) was missing, and 1/2 point off for BluRay not even being available.      A side note:  We've been watching Big Bang Theory a lot lately, it's shot on the same soundstage as Friends was, at the Warner Brothers lot.  There are some elements that are the same, e.g. the front door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, the pillar to the right of the Friends kitchen (Monica bang!) and the little hallway leading to Monica's mystery closet.  It took me a few episodes to make the connection, but my Mom figured it out only 10 minutes into her first Big Bang episode.  I enjoy seeing that connection between 2 TV series I like very much.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The whole family is addicted to this game. We are always trying are best to go back and score higher and higher than each other or at least have 3 stars on every game and trying to get all the bonus fruits in each stage. That said it is basic mind nubming fun and runs great on both my HTC Eris (too small though) and my Motorola Xoom (size does matter). The game quality, graphics and sound are great, however sometimes you want a little finesse but you have to place your finger over the bird to set them up in the sling shot. I can work with this but sometimes I wish my finger was a bit out of the way so I can see exactly how I have the bird lined up and pulled back.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Fun game with corny humor.  Looks and controls great with the touch screen.  Very smoothe scrolling considering the number of enemies on screen.
B0045U9WPU|5.0|Delirium is an amazing book and one of the best i`ve reaad in a while. I loved how its not a traditional love story that you see everywhere. Its unique and not many like it. Lauren Oliver did a great job with it and I hope to see more from her. The only thing about this book was the ending. Well written,yes, but if you got into the book as much as I did, it is abit dissapointing.
B004G6009U|5.0|Just finished watching \\"Tangled\\" on BLU RAY and it's everything other reviewers have said it is - and better.<br /><br />I suspect like many adults in their 50's, the last half-decent Disney we saw was \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" - and that seems like a very long time ago. Since then Disney has done some right saccarine pap, but this clever little beauty is back on track in a big way. Truly beautiful animation, great vocal work from the 3 principal leads, songs that are actually witty - characters you like and root for - and a very clever modern telling of an old tale. You can 'feel' John Lassiter's presence and heart all over it (Pixar)...and it's a genuine sensation to look at on BLU RAY (I believe the 3D version is even better).<br /><br />Very, very good indeed - well done to all involved.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|With 1,746 reviews on Amazon for 'Avatar' as of the posting of this review there's not a lot that needs to be said but to simple weigh in as to whether one enjoyed the film or not. The film offers the audience magnificent special effects, all the action you could ask for, glorious soundtrack, an important if not original storyline (see Fern Gully) and a pleasant love story with a gorgeous alien girl. Its got it all!
B004E9SU14|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums of the year. If you have not heard this record, you are missing out.    My favorite Songs:    \\"Come Closer\\"    \\"Rearrange\\"    \\"My Fantasy\\"    \\"Happenstance\\"    \\"Inhaler\\"    \\"Telepathy\\"    \\"Better Left Invisible\\"    \\"Colour of the Trap\\"
B000F1IQN2|5.0|`Munich' (2006) is a powerful, intense, sobering and complex examination into the unseen world of international espionage and political revenge. If you enter into viewing this film with a pre-conceived worldview or mindset that is wired to accept only clearly defined categories such as black and white, right and wrong, good and evil and them and us, fasten your seatbelt and prepare for a paradigm shift.<br /><br />The film begins with the massacre of the Israeli athletic squad at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany by the PLO and moves on from that heart wrenching historical event to weave a fictional tale of Israel's response through a convert scheme to hunt down and assassinate those responsible. At first it seems self evident as to which side is justified in their endeavor and which side deserve no reprieve from their impending punishment.<br /><br />However as the web of intrigue deepens, ethics tested and unavoidable compromises made the line between the righteous and the unrighteous slowly begins to blur and ultimately disappear. Matters are further complicated by the discovery of other covert groups, political and non political, with agendas that may hamper the Israeli game plan.<br /><br />The viewer will have much to consider by the end of the film. All the traditional questions such as \\"those who live by the sword, die by the sword', or \\"violence begets violence\\" come to mind as well as new ones that maybe you haven't considered. Emotionally and mentally drained by the time the credits roll by one is ultimately one is left to wonder if there is any answer to the eternal cycle of hatred and violence at all.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|works great, droid 2, fun game to play. basically a smash tv clone but nothing wrong with that. looks good runs smooth and best of all its free
B001P9KR8U|5.0|'Slumdog Millionaire' is one of those films that we unfortunately seem to be seeing less and less of. It's exciting and uplifting with a storyline that has you ready to stand up and cheer at the end. It shows how one person can rise out of poverty and live the life he dreamed of. Nothing is guaranteed, but you only have a chance if you're willing to try.<br /><br />Another aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the fact that the story took place in India. I find the location and people fascinating and tend to gravitate towards anything and everything dealing with the Indian landscape, both physical, cultural and spiritual. Obviously this was a film I was destined to appreciate.<br /><br />I was impressed by the performances delivered by newcomers and stars; Dev Patel and the lovely Freida Pinto. However there were also a number of excellent though minor performances by actors who are all but unknown in American but actually quite famous and popular in India. The two I'm thinking about in this category are Anil Kapoor who played the part of Prem, the dishonest game show host and Irfan Khan the police inspector. I thought Anil Kapoor was amazing, in my opinion delivering the best performance in the film.<br /><br />Recommended viewing!
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|I am proud to own this copy, nice transfer and sound. Now to anger a few people... I think this movie is the best one out of the TNG movie series. An all around good movie, the borg reappear with their leader, we get to see how we invented warp drive (sort of) all kinds of fun, very entertaining! Just so you know, this is an upgrade from a vhs tape, eewwww! Enjoy the movie!
B004VFYOA2|5.0|I was in the military serving in the UK at the time of the Donington concert, and I was lucky enough to get to go.  Still have the ticket stub and the concert book.  All total it was a 13 hour concert with not only Whitesnake, but Aerosmith, Poison, Choir Boys, and Thunder.  It was an incredible show, and I have been waiting for this release ever since I heard it was coming.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Yet another 5-star album from the mighty Symphony X. Continuing in a similar vein to Paradise Lost, but tightening up the riffs and the songwriting a bit. Russell Allen is firing on all cylinders as always, proving why many consider him modern metal's finest singer. Michael Romeo is in top form, with jaw dropping guitar solos and razor-sharp riffs. The lyrics are, as usual, the band's weakpoint...but the fact is when you can sing like Russell, you can deliver any lame lyric in such a way that the masses will raise their fists. I saw them play a few songs from this album on their tour back in April, and I'm glad that they didn't disappoint with this album. Definitely a must-listen.     Here's the thing that all of you are missing: sitting here and comparing this band's albums from 10 years ago with this one is a pointless waste of time. Bands grow, change their sound, evolve, devolve, etc. It's the natural order of things, otherwise you become a band like AC/DC where every single album is the same and their 2011 album might as well have come out in 1979. It's time to stop judging a 2011 album by a 1995 standard, and start enjoying this music on it's own merit. Doing that, it's easy to see that this album is better than 90% of the metal out there nowadays, and should be appreciated as such. V is an incredible album. Iconoclast is an incredible album. They're just two sides of the coin that is Symphony X.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|Wifi download went fine. Samsung Nexus S 4g would not give me anything but a black screen for a few moments. Then force closed. Uninstalled.
B000063JDE|4.0|When you start a journey into David Lynch masterpieces you should start with this movie.  A classic story telling of David Lynch of strange people with a strange plot in a strange weird world. One of the best movie in the century.<br /><br />Be ready to the other David's masterpieces of works.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|The cover for the front is amazing well worth it, as well as the sides. The back sucks it peels up constantly but still i keep that  covered with a case so i do not see it! Also, took about 20 minutes to apply(i like it perfect) but overall very easy to apply. Also be sure to wait to put on a case i did not and the edges pealed up, but i was able to fix and waited about 8 hours and then i was fine!
140053271X|4.0|It's a good reader. I own both original Nook and this. I use this only for reading books (no annotation, markup, Web browsing, etc.).    Good: lightweight, long battery life, good contrast, quick display refresh.    Bad: hardware buttons, accidental page turns, must have B&N account.    Good hardware buttons are a MUST, and the original Nook's win. These buttons require more force, and that's if you press the center of the button. Good luck if you press either the top or the bottom portion of the button. In short, feeling the ridge beneath your thumb and pressing doesn't mean the page will turn.    I often accidentally tap the screen slightly while reading, and it causes a page turn. There is no option to disable the touch screen while reading.    I was required to connect the Nook to a B&N account on setup. I get my books elsewhere and don't have a desire to hook up with B&N online right now. Blah.    Overall, improved over original Nook in many ways. Very quick. Touch screen can be nice. Disappointed with the hardware buttons.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|black screen on startup then force close. uninstalled and reinstalled 10 times, still no go. running honeycomb 3.1 on galaxy tab 10.1. will reevaluate if patched.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|Before you review and leave a one star rating because it doesn't work on your phone think about it. Should the game get a one star rating because YOUR phone isn't supported? I mean seriously some of these games are great and get bad reviews because people download games that don't work on their phone. If the game doesn't work then CALL Amazon and they will refund your money, that is if it was a paid app and not the app of the day. Thanks for reading.

B0058P7KUA|5.0|I often wonder if the 1-star morons have f'ed up their phone or tablet.  I put this one on my Iconia A500 and it works flawlessly.  Fun and challenging game....and the price was right!
0756655307|5.0|I was never big into comic books, but I loved watching the tv shows/movies. This book is great, even if you aren't a die hard comic book fan, its a great read.

B004H8GLXQ|4.0|There is nothing like a well executed gothic tale with the eerie atmosphere, the mystery, the shadowed sense of danger and the slow but steadily building plot as the reader anxiously awaits the crescendo and Dianne Setterfield has certainly manage to create one with her book The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book we meet the innocent Margaret Lea who works in her father's book shop and has a great love for 19th century books, including of course, Jane Eyre. Margaret receives a mysterious letter from a famous modern author, Vida Winter, in which she is summoned for an interview and an offer to write Miss Winter's biography.<br /><br />It intrigues Margaret as Vida Winter is well known to be elusive and one who has never truthfully told her life story. Every interviewer has come away with a different version. Of course the reader knows as does Margaret that she should avoid this task, but the reader also knows that Margaret will pursue it. When she first meets Vida Winter she is told:<br /><br />\\"Life is compost...You think it a strange thing to say, but it's true. All my life and all my experience, the events that have befallen me, the people I have known, all my memories, dreams, fantasies, everything I have ever read, all of that has been chucked onto the compost heap, where over time it has rotted down to a dark, rich organic mulch. The process of cellular breakdown makes it unrecognizable. Other people call it the imagination. I think of it as a compost heap. Every so often I take an idea, plant it in the compost and wait. It feeds on that black stuff used to be a life, takes its energy for its own. It germinates. Takes root. produces shoots. And so on and so forth until one fine day I have a story or a novel.\\"<br /><br />And with that both the reader and Margaret become intrigued with Vida Winter and want to hear what she has to say if it is the truth or not.<br /><br />Setterfield pays homage to other gothic tales whose ideas she has let germinate in her own compost heap, Jane Eyre, Villette, The Woman in White, Middlemarch, among others. She has remained true to form, but created her own original twist which this reader appreciated.yre, Villette, The Woman in White, Middlemarch, among others.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book kept me guessing all the way through!  It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a book this much.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first read [[ASIN:B000RIKZEG Batman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Print]] which I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.  I never read \\"Sin City\\" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great film [[ASIN:B00006BSBW Pulp Fiction]] and I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as \\"guest director\\" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like in [[ASIN:B000065V38 Chungking Express]] where it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.<br /><br />My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\".  \\"Sin City\\" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
1402210086|4.0|It's circa 1816 in England and the Hon. Mr. Penicuik, persuaded by gout and poor digestion that he's on his last legs, is making his will. His considerable fortune will go to his adopted daughter, Kitty Charing -- on the proviso that she agree to marry one of his great-nephews; otherwise, it all goes to the Foundling Hospital and no one else gets anything. There are six young men to be considered: George Rattray, a baron, but he's already married; George's rather smarmily superior brother, the Rev. Hugh; Dolphinton, the only earl in the group, but sadly lacking in the way of mental equipage and right under his mama's thumb besides; Claude, an army captain, but he's away in France with his regiment and nobody likes him much anyway; Freddy, heir to a viscountcy and a man of great fashion, but he has a fair fortune of his own and he's simply not interested in marriage; and, last and also rather least, there's Jack, a gambling, flirting, undependable, self-absorbed, improvident rake. Of course, being the Bad Boy of the group, he's the one Kitty has always languished for. Not that any of them have any intention of being manipulated by the old man this way. Kitty considers running away to London to seek her fortune -- her conception of society being taken mostly from romantic novels -- but then she thinks maybe she can fake a betrothal long enough to escape, with the help of the amiable Freddy, whom she talks into helping her. And so Kitty begins nervously moving out into the Real World, with the unknowing assistance of Freddy's parents and sister, and as she discovers just how complicated things can be (even with a guide book), she also gets involved (naturally) in the problems and affairs of several other young people, all in true Jane Austen style. And Freddy, who has unexpected depths, begins to reconsider the situation. The writing is light-heartedly droll, the dialogue is frequently laugh-out-loud funny, and the characters are nicely and subtly drawn. Even the plotting, while occasionally (and deliberately) absurd, is nevertheless believable. While this isn't great literature -- really, it's a superior sort of fluff -- it's still a delightful read. Really, the BBC should have filmed this back when Hugh Laurie was still doing Bertie Wooster, because he would have been perfect as Freddy.ing, while occasionally (and deliberately) absurd, is nevertheless believable.

0385341008|4.0|What a different take on how to tell a story.  I haven't encountered this before but it was a welcomed change.  The authors told the story of the main character Juliet, and all the sub-characters through letters that were exchanged to each other.  I found it rather entertaining and refreshing to read.  If any of what was written was close to the truth regarding WWII, it was also eye opening.  A quick and enjoyable read!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|If you like non-stop action films this one is a must see, kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B004YESKU0|5.0|Why bother if you have them already? I know it's probably a waste of money After all these are not remastered or anything like that. Their just the cd's repackaged with a little different look that's all. For those familiar with the current Led Zeppelin mini albums this package has the same look etc once you open it up. All five cd's have the original artwork and lyrics that came with the single cd's etc. Again nothing special or hidden, just what they were before in a new box. I liked it, so I bought it and I don't regret it. Like the title says, it's a cool little package.
B004QSQML8|5.0|As soon as a friend of mine told me Legend Ultimate Edition was coming to blue ray I knew I had to order this, the bonus was that it was compatible with my playstation 3 so that sealed the deal, the transfer to blue ray is fantastic makes the film seem like it was made a few years ago and  not in 1986,the colours are so vibrant and Tim Curry's portral of Darkness for me is a good reason to buy this film alone,the extra scenes just add to the film not take away, Rob Bottin's make effects are fantastic so is the late great Jerry Goldsmiths score, if you already have this on DVD sell it and buy the blue ray.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is an awesome book. I instantly wanted to re-read it. It really was one of those books that you couldn't put down. I hope the author write more books similar to this one.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|This book was amazing just like all the previous ones before this. It had me in tears and it had me Lauging out loud, in fact my husband thought I was going a little crazy. Becky Bloomwood is funny and amazing and Luke oh Luke had me mad and also at aww on how much he loves Becky and Minni!!!! I truley recommend this book and well as the others of the series. And hope there is a Movie sequal to this.
B0055JP7EU|5.0|Season 6 of Doctor Who is the best written so far.  I have enjoyed Matt Smith as the new Doctor.  Steven Moffat as the producer and writer of Doctor Who has breathe in new life to the series.  Every episode is a story in a larger story.  This episode answered questions and gave us new ones to answer when the second half premieres in August.  I was totally surprised at who Dr. River Song really is.  GREAT JOB
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|At first I didnt want to read it since I had seen the Movie, but once I started I blown away because the book is nothing compared to movie. Dont get me wrong I luved the movie so much in fact I just rented yesterday because of all the reading Ive been doing of Becky Bloomwood. This book had me in tears and laughing so much. I could not put it down finished within a day and went strait to the next of the series. Wish there was more of Luke in it, but i guess since it was about Shopahoic obviously i understand. It a pleasure and it was amazing reading this book.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|they did a great job with the game. but the updates should come out faster. People will get annoyed and lose interest... like I am starting to. come on now, if you make a game people love to play, you have to come out with the rest of the game sooner then a year later. and yes, I have gotten all the fruit I can and 3 stars on everything...
1593272774|5.0|If you enjoy LEGO and machines, this book is for you. Very nicely done with clear pictures and no text. OK, there is some text in the first 4 or 5 pages, but from that point on it is just a page after page of pictures showing how to make simple machines. Even if you never touch LEGO, the pictures are fun to look at.
0743201140|3.0|This may be one of those uncommon common-sense sorta things, but DO NOT buy a used version of the book, since the code in all probability would have been used/expired already. I was browsing a bookstore and bought a used version on a hunch(not having heard of it before), and when I got to the meat and potatoes, the plate was kinda snatched away. Decent read so far, but thought I'd put this warning out.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|Our whole family watched it and loved it (kids are ages 12 - 16)!  We aren't pro movie reviewers but see enough movies to say that this was up there with some of our favorites this year - not quite as good as \\"The A-Team\\" but right up there.  I have to admit that we do love military heroes and are probably partial to a film with kick-butt military heroes.  Hope that helps you decide.
B0057AOS3I|2.0|Ok so I have always been a fan of Destinys Child. When BeYAWNce went solo I tried to give her a chance but she became so annoying. I was really disappointed to know that other artists were writing songs for her. I should have known because I liked some of her songs but couldnt stand her voice. She sounds the same with every song she sings. So I watched the video for \\"THE BEST THING I NEVER HAD\\" recently. I liked the words to the song. I decided to find out who wrote and produced the song. WOW BABYFACE is a legend in my eyes. He wrote the song. I have never purchased a BeYAWNce cd, so I decided to listen to samples from this CD to see if I would like to download it. I thought maybe she has grown as an artist. WELL LETS SAY AFTER I LISTENED TO IT-----> CHECK THE HEADLINE. LOL!! I woke up in time to write this review. I will continue to listen to LEDSI,ADELE,MUSIQ,MAXWELL,JAHEIM,FANTASIA,J.HUD,JILL SCOTT,RKELLY and other great artists who know REAL MUSIC. Beyonce has not evolved as an artist to me. She is doing the same things she did when she first went solo. During those times I have purchased Letoyas & Michelles cd which were both great. Now I cant wait to see how good Kellys cd might be next month. I always give people a chance.
044661758X|4.0|The concrete blonde was lets say quite an intriguing and well written  book by the author... i found the book overall to be a great read no doubt, im a night reader so at times i will read the book until 3pm to get in a few chapters... basically everyday i was reading this book..plus if i found this book really boring i would probably throw the book in the trash and be partying haha... jk on the book trashing and uh yeah the partying also haha really..... yeah but the book was great though at times, a little slow but nonetheless great...if you like mystery novels and want to know a little of how the court system works and interested in books that have meaning and or fair twists then heres your book. another great author who writes such books like michael connelly is  jeffery deaver.     Pros  1. interesting characters and story  2. Gives knowledge of court system and \\"women\\" business  3. good details of the crime scenes   4. draws you in as if your there will the characters  5. to me i found the book to have a fair good message or meaning in the end so you decide if it does  Cons  1. at times a little slow as in takes time to get into the \\"chase\\"  2. The murderer or \\"follower\\" as they say is a bit surprising but if catched up early could be expected  3. tells a lot of what streets the main character is drivng on which is a bit boring  but its good for fair detail of the LA area     So in my conclusion is this book a           1. Don't bother and save your money  2. read at store book only or a to pasttime read  or   3. A BUY!    Honestly though it did have its little boring parts at times, for me the slow and boring parts of the book was small compared to the whole book and for the most part found the book to be quite great and interesting so i say its a (3) A BUY!  hope this review helped     extra: If you like this book i also recommend The Empty Chair( 5 star by me) by jeffery deaver and (4 star by me) Lincoln Lawyer by michael connelly
B004TGQ7LC|5.0|Ms. Corbel never ceases to amaze me, her latest album contains all the things that make her a superstar, her etheric voice, soothing arrangements and harp mastery but this album has an added touch that try as I might I can't quite even understand what it is nor how she did it! The album heavily steeped in the living Celtic tradition has an added influence that prevails through all the tracks. It is something that I can't explain and even so much so that I've put off writing this review for some time feeling nothing I can say can do it justice. Its an influence that sounds like it came from Faerie itself! Just like Turlough O'Carolan sitting on his favorite hill for hours than composing his unique planxty style of music. This added element on this album is definitely Celtic in roots but I've never heard anything like it before. Its like the spiritual side of fantasy. One doesn't just happen to think of faeries and other sorts of creatures of that ilk when listening to this but they think of those things with a sense of awe that begs the listener to leave their bodies and join with them, dance with them, become them, see the beauty in all things like they do and than return with a spiritually heightened state of mind. Maybe I'm being too poetic, but seriously its like a sunrise, the only way to express it is through poetry.    The songs on this album have a long range from popy love songs, to deep fantasy, to historic to sweet and fun.  Each track captivating, each making one question how an artist can be so good. Hearing the whole album through and it returning once again to the 1st track you will not want to change CDs but to listen to it again, than repeat this process for days.  Corbel fan? buy this! you won't be disappointed.
0761536434|4.0|This book is exhaustive and detailed, as other reviewers have pointed out. You could hardly ask for it to have more content. However, it is frequently repetitious. I understand that the story of video games is about several different stories going on at once, so it's often necessary for the narration to go back and forth between previous years, and the \\"current\\" year in the book. However, this is often done in a way that seems to assume that you haven't read any of the other chapters that have come before. It feels like your grandfather is telling you this story, looping around and going on diversions to the point where you sometimes wonder if he's going to get back to what he started telling you about a minute ago.    Kent also drops in large block quotations from his interviews, rather than work the information into the text in a more seamless manner, so in order to be clear about what he's writing, he frequently has to repeat something that was said in the quotation. He also uses block quotations that are from other written works (e.g., magazines and newspapers) that are offset in a way that closely resembles his main text, instead of resembling the interview quotations. The source for these is given in an endnote, so if you want to see who said it and when, you have to flip all the way to the end of the book. (I also have some typographical issues with the book, but those are obviously on a more nerdy level that few people care about.)    Overall, with some editing work, this book could stand to be at least a hundred pages shorter, and be much more readable in the process. You probably already know whether you want to read it or not, so if you do read it, you can make your life easier by doing a lot of skimming.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Long overdue, but worth the wait.<br /><br />I came upon Name of the Wind somewhat by accident and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Once finished, I eagerly waited for the sequel.  And waited, and waited some more.  Those familiar with it will know that this second novel was delayed several times.  It seems that Mr. Rothfuss is somewhat of a perfectionist when it comes to his writing, which caused at least some of the delay.  While not perfect, this is a good read and it lives up the the promise of the first novel.<br /><br />The character of Kvothe is engaging and his adventures are interesting.  It has been fun to see him mature.  When it comes to a work of fantasy fiction, there isn't much here that is utterly new, but this is definitely not some of the derivative drivel that is on offer.  The idea of magic being broken down and studied as a science is fairly novel.  The style of bouncing back and forth between his present and past works well.<br /><br />It is going to be fun to see how the author manages to finish up the story in Day Three.  Let's hope that it doesn't take as long for this one to be published.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|I rarely watch movies (and have been TV-free for 15 years), but I took exception and saw this, hoping for a modern spin on a beautiful fairie-tale.  I was keenly disappointed in Hollywood's efforts to translate ancient story to present-day production.    First, it is completely unbelievable that a person so verbally horrible to others would be allowed to make the speech he did, without being called on it by school authority of some sort.  Second, it's hard to believe that a son so put off by his own father's behavior would so embrace it - typically the opposite is true, even in cases where desperate desire for paternal love is the case.    Then there's Vanessa H., who has yet to impress me.  She can't sing any better than the other girls out there of her age, is average fare where acting is concerned and the only thing I see that she has going for her is that she's \\"eye candy\\", to use one of Kyle's phrases.  So does that mean our 'beast' will only fall in love with a sexy lil' thang?  Hardly inspiring, that.  Her character is a 'green freak', but she's chomping on boxed/processed candies, drinking Starbucks-esque lattes and decked out in synthetics while pumping pop/rock into her ears.  Something doesn't quite jive with what they're telling us.  There's actually nothing that sets this heroine apart from her peers - she's social network addicted, constantly on the cellphone, and gives little girly noises when she speaks.  She's drawn to Kyle because 'even though he's wrong, he's real about who he is'.  So beauty, apparently, equates to 'real'.  Good to know - Timothy McVey suddenly is so very beautiful.  Like, no way, and... well, no way.    The tragic hero truly is self-absorbed thru the entire movie, even at the end, when he's supposed to be so changed: he won't return her calls, because *HE* is upset with how things are playing out.  When he's not self-obsessed, he's played as desperate to a painful point - where he has no pride at all.  The extremes don't createa balanced character at all.    Neil Patrick Harris - very funny, completely over the top, though.  He's just unbelievable.  And that's leaving out the 'blind-guy-kicks-arse-at-darts' thing.  Of course tutors would just sit around, twiddling thumbs for months on end, providing snarky dialogue to try to redeem the movie.  Or is he a friend of Kendra's, just waiting for his own curse to be lifted by doing penance babysitting Kyle?  It would've at least added something deeper to the very flat and Disney-imitated plot.    REALLY high on the list of things not to miss are the drug dealers.  Her dad gets in an argument, baddie #1 pulls a gun, Kyle kicks it away, baddie #2 kicks Lindy down a flight of stairs, then both baddies (and Dad) stand staring at each other while Kyle carries her back to her apartment building, returning just in time for Dad to shoot baddie #1.  Dad turns on Kyle, who knocks it away again (!?) and then baddie #2 in his rage and anguish *DOESN'T* do... anything.  Do you think if you were a thug and someone kills your brother and was unarmed, YOU'D just turn tail?  Hardly.    Our witch?  You couldn't slather her with a more dramatic air.  Her curse on Kyle... is \\"Embrace the Suck\\".  Oh, yeah, that'll do it.  Be sure to add a close-up of her retina to make it seem magical, or it'll fall flat.  Wait, it did, anyhow.  They couldn't decide on a look for her, either, so she goes from vamp to dreds to Pulp Fiction to Fairy Witch-mother... it wasn't coherent or well done.    I've read that the book is better in the comments, here.  I'll have to try it.  I really had such high hopes.  They were dashed quite thoroughly by the finished movie.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I had a time with this movie.  I had to watch it three times to really get it.  The story keeps you thinking you know what is coming and at every turn you are brought to a sudden stop that makes want to go back and view what led to that moment.  I was left with questions about the main characters and how much they had planned the scenario.  Of course anything Kevin Spacey is in has to be a winner.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|Band<br />Come Taste The Band; the tenth Deep Purple studio album (and sole release from the short-lived MK4 line up) is truly underrated and misunderstood, although it thankfully seems to have seen something of a critical reappraisal nowadays, thanks in part to this amazing 35th anniversary edition, in addition to growing appreciation for the late guitarist Tommy Bolin.<br /><br />Right from the off, Come Taste The Band is big, loud and impressive. Opener `Commin' Home' bursts out of the speakers with pure rock fury, adding back into the band's sound some of the harder and faster rock edge that had been absent from their previous album Stormbringer (which at times can seem like its just 50% Soul/Funk and 50% Quiet Songs/Ballads.)<br /><br />Come Taste The Band definitely has power and force, but it also has variety. The funk/soul influences that the MK3 band had started using are there in tracks, but there are also more rock orientated numbers, and a few musically exciting pieces like `The Drifter,' which stray into altogether different territory. `Owed To G' even has a little of the classical vibe which the band used to play with quite a bit.<br /><br />One of the standout moments on the album is `Gettin' Tighter,' which has an absolutely gigantic chorus, which is so energetic and filled with attitude that it puts a huge grin on my face every time I listen to it. It also contains a brake-down of solid funk in the middle, which some fans may object to, but that brake-down is in a very rocking song and this is part of the success of this album, a fusion of the new and the old styles in a dramatic and joyous fashion.<br /><br />Though for the longest time (until '93), Come Taste The Band was the only Deep Purple album without Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, you really should not let that put you off, in Tommy Bolin the band found a perfect musical fit. Blackmore's absence may cause you some concern, however remember that Paice and Lord are still there, the album still has that trademark Purple sound in the undercurrent behind all the funk and soul. Paice's unique drum fill style is still there, and Lord's amazing keys abilities are present and correct.<br /><br />If you liked Burn and especially if you liked Stormbringer, then Come Taste The Band is a must listen experience... the effective Coverdale/Hughes partnership is as great as it has ever been, and the general songwriting is absolutely top of the line. I really recommend this album... just don't buy it if you are expecting it to sound like Smoke On The Water, understand what it is first, then jump right in.<br /><br />** If you get the 35th Anniversary edition, there are 3 bonus tracks (a single edit, a b-side and a jam) a very detailed set of linear notes, and a second disc containing an impressive remixing job, which unearths some new music within the songs and changes the fade outs, track order and emphasis of the mix. **e undercurrent behind all the funk and soul.

0553805371|2.0|Although I found this book to be interesting, in part, on the whole I found it to be grasping for a more solid foundation.  I was very curious about the author's ideas about creation and the necessity for \\"something to come from nothing\\" via creation.  Unfortunately the science behind the central ideas remained completely vague to me and the mathematics, well ???? come on - in short it can be summed up as \\"at the quantum level we don't entirely understand everything yet, so sure, something can come from nothing, since it sure seems like it did . . .\\"  Apparently this conclusion eliminates the necessity for God, since Science somehow can now also work miracles?  I'm not convinced that Hawking has figured anything out, other than how to sell more books.

It deserves a spot in your library along with Rocky Horror, Army of Darkness and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
0920668372|1.0|My first review of this book was admittedly harsh, and attracted multiple venomous personal attacks from fans of this book.  So I withdrew my original review and am posting what is hopefully a calmer, more rational negative review of this book.  I dislike this book for two primary reasons:    (1)  The images more so than the words imply some sort of unhealthy parent-child relationship.  I don't understand why the mother has to surreptitiously slither across the floor to check on her child in the middle of the night.  Why doesn't she just walk in?  I also don't understand why she feels the need to drive across town with a ladder, climb into the house of her adult son, and rock him to sleep.  Although this may have been intended as humor or an allegory, to me, there is a disturbing undertone of clinginess and need.  There is attachment parenting, which can be healthy, but there is nothing healthy about rocking a grown man to sleep.  In addition, this is a CHILDREN'S book, so it is easy for a child to view this content and associated images literally.  Save the humor and metaphors for ADULT fiction.     (2)  The part of the book that really infuriated me was the implied \\"quid pro quo\\" relationship between this mother and son (i.e. \\"I'll take care of you as a child, if you take care of me as an aging parent.\\")  Again, this may not have been intended, but that is what is implied.  I am not the only one who feels this way, since many Amazon reviewers, who gave this book five stars, commented positively on this \\"full circle.\\"  One mother in particular, had a poor relationship with her adult son, and decided to send him this book as a \\"wake up call.\\"  Seriously?  You really need to guilt your son with a children's book into having a relationship with you?  I personally feel that your child did not ask to be born - you chose to have him or her.  I don't like witnessing parenting with expectations.  Love should be given to a child unconditionally, without the expectation thatthe child, when grown, will take care of you in old age.  I took care of my own mother for 15 years when she was ill until her death earlier this year.  I did so gladly, lovingly, and without her expecting me to do so.  I would never want my now 5-month old to feel as if I expect him to take care of me when I'm old.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game works on my EVO 4G just fine.  It is a little slow on start-up (i.e. the \\"black screen\\"). However, I compared it with some Pop Cap games (Plants vs Zombies, Peggle, etc.) and the start-up time is about the same. The big difference is that with the Pop Cap games, you get some nice graphics to distract you.  A2SD is supported: 26.70MB to 625K after the move to SD card.  (Note: a previous reviewer fixed their problems by moving the app off the SD card.  I didn't need to do this, but if you are having troubles, try it.)<br /><br />As far as the game goes....  The graphics look nice on my screen.  Though, I'm not too fond of the controls.  I found they work better for me in \\"Fixed\\" mode vs \\"Floating\\" (this can be changed on the option screen).  The game play is good, but I'm only on level 3.<br /><br />It's too bad this game doesn't seem to be working for other EVO users.  I always read the reviews for each free-app-of-the-day to get a feel if an app is for me or not, and this is the first app I've seen that EVO users are having issues with.  (Though there are other phones having the same issues.)<br /><br />And for you people complaining about the complainers, get a life.  The only way to get anything fixed or changed is to speak up about it.  And everyone has the right to voice their opinion.  It's not like there's a list of incompatible devices and people are still installing the app on those devices, and then complaining that it doesn't work (yes, that is pretty stupid).  But obviously, people are having issues and it's just not one brand of device.  So far problems have been reported on: EVO, Fascinate, Galaxy, Honeycomb, MyTouch, Nexus One, Nexus S, Nook Color, Optimus V, Thunderbolt, Transformer, Xoom (I'm sure more will follow).  And these problems seem to be not even constant across the brands either--it works for some people and not for others while using the same type of device.  It's clear the app is the problem, not the devices.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|An athlete's . If you've never been an athlete , it may be difficult for you to understand the wonder and awe and breathless charm and mercurial rapture depicted by Burt Lancaster in many portions of THE SWIMMER . In a resume littered with great performances (many of which i've seen) , i seldom encounter a film better suited to it's lead actor . Burt's , by turns , quizical , charming and ever-so-slightly befuddled character , is one of the finest i've ever seen any actor deliver . From any decade . This , for me , is instantly one of the 100 greatest American films i've ever witnessed (in a lifetime of tens of thousands of films seen thus far) . I saw it for free as i do have the ability to stream it via Amazon and my killin' new PRIME status  . This IS a BRILLIANT film . It still TOWERS above the lion's share of film that's been made subsequent to it . That it is SO very expensive (well beyond my reach even used on dvd) , tells you infinitely more than it's 4 star rating . Which is a joke . If you ever were or currently are an athlete , you owe it to yourself to SEE this magnificent motion picture .
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Okay so the graphics are not HD or even super detailed, but the music and sound fx make up for that. You can even hear a little &quot;dojo&quot; music in the background left over from Fruit Ninja. (:<br /><br />It's an entertaining game that will make your thumbs hurt (like Gun Bros).
B0000ACY0Y|3.0|The newly remastered and expanded CD is a tale of two different styles. The original is overproduced with silly backup singers; over instumentation etc; But wait! the bonus tracks included (7) save this CD! This is what sounds like the post-Byrds country movement, the melodies stand out much better and the acoustic work is better appreciated. This should have been the first release. Overall not too bad, but far from anything Chris HIllman has done.

B003XRZZFM|2.0|While their last 3 albums still play on my Stereo often this new release just didn't make it. Dimmu Borgir really has to thank their label for all the propaganda done to the album but musically speaking it is a disappointment. Kicking out Mustis was a bad move and to make it worst Vortex is gone too and they made a huge difference in Dimmu's sound.   Only outstanding track is \\"Gateways\\", the rest is just a boring Excessively symphonic album.

How many hairpin turns can one book take? And then, the ultimate insult for me as a reader -- a sickeningly sweet ending. It takes guts as a mystery writer to not make it all work out for the main character at the end of the book. Karin Slaughter, by the way, does that very well.
0451205766|5.0|This book was so good. I have never read anything about mafia or criminal life and all my thoughts on the mob were based on what I was told through movies and tv (pretty much Fat Tony from The Simpsons). I have a completely new outtake on the mafia after reading this. It was so incredibly interesting. It's a long book but took me two days to read because I could not put it down. The character development and seeing how different characters changed and dealt with situations was so good.    I had never seen the movie and I refused to see it until I bought the book. Even though usually the book tends to be better, the movie was still outstanding and definitely did it justice. So go, stop reading whatever you're reading now, which is probably Amazon.com because you are obviously reading this review (unless you can double read like a warlock), and go buy \\"The Godfather.\\"
0061537969|5.0|This was a great story!  I read the book on a flight from TX to NJ, and raced through it. I couldn't stop reading. I laughed out loud, cried serious tears, and hugged the book when I was finished. Yes, people were looking at me like I was crazy, and I felt that way about the book. It moved me!    I immediately bought the book for my father, who recently lost his job, only to be told that they book changed the way he felt about his entire situation.      This book is powerful, especially for anyone going through difficult times, and is a must read for pet lovers who like to talk to their pets and wish they could talk back.      I highly recommend this book, and have been shouting its praises to anyone who will listen.
0312427999|4.0|The Shock Doctrine puts many of the events of the past 30 years in a context that they have not been in before.  She argues that much of the aid that goes to countries is not intended to help this place but rather is used as a tool to open them up and pillage them of their resources.  The author provides many examples to back up her argument and for the most part, is very persuasive.  I have to admit that had I not witnessed what has happened in the past few years I would have found this a little harder to accept but the events seem to bear her out.<br /> One of the basic tenants of economics is that competition is good because it drives people to innovate and find the most efficient way to perform a task.  This is capitalisms big advantage over other economic systems in that it encourages competition and drives competition.  This is not the capitalism presented in the Shock Doctrine.  Rather than being a system that wins out over other system by it merits as is taught in school this is crony capitalism that receives no-bid contracts with limitless budgets through connections in government and then proceeds to waste the money or just out and out steal it.  What is so amazing is that the people that claim to be so worried about the budget when they are out of power seem to have no problem allowing stuff like this to happen when they are in charge.  I have to think that there is another agenda at being carried out here that the true goal if the reforms is to enrich a select few at the expense of the many.  While there are many fans of Milton Friedman and the positions that he advocated while alive and that others push for now, I cannot help but wonder if they are aware of his actions recounted in the Shock Doctrine.  I would love to hear them defend them.

B004EPZ08E|5.0|Perhaps this is partly due to the very vocal and very packed theater I saw Horrible Bosses in, but I have to say that it was one of the best experiences I've had watching a comedy in a long time. This movie is funny, really funny. The writing is vulgar and clever, often at the same time. There is not one weak link in the cast. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis play the three main guys getting pushed around by their evil bosses. They then hatch a plan to kill each others bosses. Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell play those three evil bosses. You also get other big names like Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland and an unexpected cameo from Bob Newhart. Everyone is great, but I have to give a special props to Jennifer Aniston. We finally get to see her in a role that showcases more of her talent than everything else she has done combined. She's funny, sexy and pulls of some nasty lines with ease.<br /><br />I didn't plan on seeing this today, but I got bored, read some really positive reviews, felt spontaneous and headed to my theater. Best decision I've made in...well today. Forget the latest Hangover and check out one of the best comedies for grown ups in a long time.

Grandpa Joe takes Charlie on the big day and they are guided through the wonders of Wonka's factory. Throughout the factory tour, children lose their way and only one will win the ultimate prize.<br /><br />You have to love Charlie - a boy, who lives in crowded squalor and eats nothing but watery cabbage soup, yet turns down a life of chocolate if his family can't join him in the chocolate factory. I love the themes of family, honesty, integrity and parenting within this book. Even kids will recognize the nasty kids - the one that chews too much gum, the spoiled one, the one who watches too much TV, the gluttonous child. Parents and kids will cheer for Charlie throughout the story.
B004JC0AV4|5.0|There has to be a determination to get through this book. You must also have read the first two of the trilogy to hope to understand the warp and weft of the story. In short, you have to be committed to complete it. There is no stomach-churning violence as in the first two books. It is really more of a conventional crime thriller. It's no less successful for that and for some, that might be a relief. There are still surprises; a couple of which made me smile wryly. It's the thought of how the state apparatus (or a small part of it) can treat a person in such an awful way that is the main thrust of this tale. It also sheds a different light on Sweden; a place potentially more exciting than one might otherwise have supposed. The love dimensions are there. They are plural and to my mind, only partially resolved. This inconclusiveness suggests another book but alas, this is no longer possible from this riveting and inter-weaving writer.<br /><br />Ian Hunter.<br />Author of `e-Love' and `e-Dreams'.

0439023513|1.0|I really should have checked out this author before wasting my time on this series.  Now I wish I had.    I HATE being manipulated by an author, screen writer, musician - you name it in the arts.  Flags started going up for me, to which I SHOULD have paid more attention, early into Book 3.  I don't need this moralistic author to tell me war is hell.  Why waste my time to see great characters from books 1 and 2 - trivialized into nothingness - just grist mill for the author's, now so unflatteringly revealed in book 3, unvarnished biases?  Coated with moral superiority in those biases to boot.  She wantonly throws good characters, whom we've come to love, onto the ash heap - killing them off right and left in meaningless ways.    The ending, of course, is the true ash heap of this series.  What a waste.  Now I can't recommend the series or the author to anyone.  And believe me I won't.

0470901071|5.0|I used this book in addition to Todd's live class to pass my CCNA last month. I enjoyed the casual candor and language in this book. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to pass the CCNA. It's also been quite a handy general reference at work. Anytime a guy at work needs a simple explanation of a particular technology I simply show them the relevant chapter in this book.
B004M8KLYQ|4.0|My favorite albums tend to grow on me. This did the opposite, somewhat: I was enthusiastic at first, but after a couple dozen listens over a few weeks, several of the songs started to irritate me. (In fact, however, I'm writing this review a few weeks AFTER that period of immersion; as I revisit the album now, I like it better again.)    There are still many glorious moments. Some songs have a dreamlike quality that I love, and I like Harvey's voice and the rhythms. One song that is still a favorite is \\"In the Dark Places\\". There is a video online, by the way, that complements the song's atmosphere wonderfully - the one with the bells. Another favorite, \\"England\\", is not about war but fits the album's broader theme of a critique of the fatherland. I see it as sung by a first- or second-generation immigrant who has adopted England without being accepted in return. It's a poignant song that can still bring a tear to my eye.    This is a powerful album, and I'm glad I got it. NPR podcasted a performance of this album in concert that is also well worth hearing. It's pretty close to the studio version but with a different energy, and for some songs I enjoyed it more.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|this game is very fun. download quick and opened so I could play. I just have to get use to the joystick and gun control. Other than that FUN.. HTC EVO latest fresh rom.
B004TLM284|4.0|The smartest move that Britney's ever made was to make an all dance album. She was nevr that big on ballads. Her voice suits her well with only dance-pop songs in the same vein as Kylie Minogue, imo. I must advise u that if you're looking for somethin that has more depth and more thematic, don't get this album. It's more for club goers and people who are looking for dance, feel good music. Quality-wise, its no different from katy perry or rihanna's. It follows the generic sex/partying trend that nowadays people r cravin bout. If u don't mind that, u will find the pulsating thumpin beats irresistable. Most of the songs are redundant. It's all bout flirting and random hookups and orgys. It's certainly makes up for the lackluster Circus. It's her best since Blackout n In The zone.<br /><br />1. til the world ends (4.5/5)- a perfect song about the apocalypse-theme events.<br /><br />2. hold it against me (5/5)-best song that came out this year.<br /><br />3. inside out (5/5)-definately one of the STAND-OUT tracks<br /><br />4. i wanna go (4.5/5)-repetitive, but hearing brit's robotic voice is quite amusing and entertaining<br /><br />5. how i roll (2/5)-does nothing not for me..it sounds incredibly lame especially that guy's voice. feels like i'm watchin a target commercial.<br /><br />6. (drop dead) beautiful (5/5)-HOT...that's all i have to say<br /><br />7. seal it with a kiss (3/5)-cute but juvenile<br /><br />8. big fat bass (5/5)-i never really cared for will.i.am's music but he really shine on this track. this song completely slays!<br /><br />9. trouble for me (5/5)-love it alot<br /><br />10. trip to your heart (2.5/5)- like seal it with a kiss..it sounds pretty cheesy in a lyrical sense<br /><br />11. gasoline (5/5)-LOVE this song! it makes me want to hit the REPEAT button on every chance i get!<br /><br />12. criminal (3/5)-sounds ridiculous as rihanna's there's a thug in my life.<br /><br />13. up n down (3/5)- cute, flirty song about a guy watching her dance across the floor and liking it....<br /><br />14. he about to lose me (4/5)-i really like the beat<br /><br />15. selfish (2.5/5)-boring lyrics...*yawn* sounds kinda gwen stefanish<br /><br />16. don't keep me waiting (4/5)-perhaps the strongest song on the deluxe edition.<br /><br />Avg rating: 4.3<br /><br />MOST PLAYED TRACKS:<br /><br />1.

B0045HCJR6|5.0|I love love love this movie.  I had it on VHS when I was younger and since I am hearing impaired I need closed captioning.  A lot of DVDs of this movie have a \\"special features\\" disc which is NOT captioned/subtitled and cost over 25 bucks because of it.  It was nice to find JUST the movie AND have it be closed captioned!!
0756405890|5.0|Image you just finished reading another book and you felt all warm and fuzzy cause the hero got the girl, the bad guy got killed and the kingdom lived happily ever after... Then you start this book and realized you wished you had read this first!!! I started reading this book and immediately tumbled into the greatness that only comes from a truly EPIC story. There is absolutely no way to read this without sensing the craftsmanship that went into its making. IF you buy only ONE book this year... I feel sorry for since there are 2 of these currently available!!! Borrow money from Granny/ check your couch for change/ break the piggy bank/ but grab The Name of the Wind & A Wise Man's Fear!!!
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Forced closed the first few attempts to play the game. Rebooted tablet, but still forced closed. Finally started with a black sceen for an extended period (I thought it was still hung-up). When game worked it was OK. I paused the game and that was it...Black screen again. Too much work to get the game to play correctly.
0756404738|5.0|This 2nd installment of the trilogy is excellent! The expansiveness of the plotline and the \\"realness\\" of the hero make the reader feel every bump, bruise and misstep of this VERY lovable main character. There is no way to not get swept away in the adventure of this very well told tale.   WARNING!! This is not a hack and slash \\"hero never loses\\" type of story. The writing is memorable and the books are filled with quotable dialog as well as impassioned descriptions of situations.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Much like everyone else stated this game is buggy to start. I downloaded the game fine and restarted my phone after it would not load the game. I finally got into the game and it was a good bit of fun. I shut the game down and when I came back to it later I had all sorts of freezes and slow loading issues.<br />The gameplay is easily worth 4 stars but the buggy nature and poor scaling of this title brings it down to two stars.
0553582461|5.0|I have to say, as i read these 6 books 1 by 1 I often got frustrated, but now that this series is completed I understand that as a whole they were wonderful. Fitz is far and wide the most tortured(emotionally) main character I have ever read. None of his choices were easy or simple; and while we can give our two cents on what we might have done better or different, this character was always \\"IN CHARACTER.\\"   **spoilers**  Questions:   1: Will we ever read about the Fool and his trip with the Black man?    2: Will we ever follow the doings of the next generation, Dutiful/Swift/Nettle?  3: Will the new dragons/new elderlings meet with the 6 dutchies characters once they start to live in the ancient elderling cities above Jhampie?    Thanks Robin for sharing your grand vision !!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This story is like nothing else I've read.It was defiantly about redemption in my opinion.I love the it was so dysfunctional yet neither one of them really cared about that aspect .My one complaint would be that Abby was flip flopper she changed her mine so fast and then changed. It back again from one extreme to another so many times that I think she might have been bipolar and she drug Poor Travis into it he was so constant about his feeling that she seemed to me shallow at times and I couldn't  believe that she couldn't unstained why he was insecure about there relationship........but all this added up to be a really great original story were the writer was not afraid to let young h/h drink have sex a cuss for young adults this was refreshing to not be tipped toed around I also like they were a tad bit older and in college away on there free to do as they please .I do believe this has been of my favorite reads
B004ZQRJFO|4.0|Considering this is the price of a normal record, I feel 11 tracks don't do it justice. Yes, it is great. The lyrical content in this record is great. Royce and Eminem are at the top of the game right now and this album helps prove it. My only dispute with this purchase is the lack of songs (only 11) and it doesn't feel like a full record. 'Loud Noises' and 'I'm On Everything' are my least favorite, while the rest stand strong. Worth a purchase, but don't be disappointed when you only get 11 tracks. The album finishes and starts playing over before you know it.
B000T5O48U|3.0|I know, CUJO came first, but I needed a catchy title for the review.  I saw this film in 1983, and everything in the movie was as I pictured it in the book.  Very good job with that.  The slow moving plot was necessary I think to get you to care about what happens to the characters.  It's hard to enjoy a movie if you don't feel some emotional attachment to the characters.  Overall, the story was very well done and when Cujo came on the scene, it kept you on the edge of your seat.  Now, for the bad news.  (Spoiler alert)  THEY LET THE TADDER LIVE.  ARRGGHHH!!!!  The way it ended spoiled the whole thing.  One thing I admired about this story was that it was one of King's most uncompromisingly honest.  He even mentions this in effect, saying, \\"Sorry, folks.  Bad things do happen to children sometimes.  It's a fact of life.\\"  No, I don't enjoy seeing bad things happen to kids, but when Donna broke open the rear window of her car (using the butt of a policeman's gun of all things.  By the way, I'm surprised all that glass didn't get on Tad and cut him to pieces.) went into the house and resuscitaed Tad, this story lost all credibility.  Nice touch having Cujo, who we thought was dead burst through the window just as you think they're safe, but...sorry.  The ending ruined it for me.  Three stars out of five.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|This looks like a decent product, but it doesn't live up to its description of working with every case except the Apple bumper case. The thick part of this adapter is too thick to enable the door on the LifeProof iPhone 4 case to close.
0521397812|5.0|This book is worth its weight in gold. It can be utilized as a warm up at the beginning of a lesson, as a teaching tool during the lesson and finally as a closer to the lesson which puts the students in a better mood before they leave class. Best of all, the ideas in the book really apply to teaching of English and not just fun and games.
B004LWZW42|2.0|I'm not totally going to bash this movie like I did Predators or Machete lasy year but X Men The First Class released back in June I'm going to go ahead & say it if you like this movie that's fine every movie has it's fans & it's haters so it's my opinion not against anybody X Men The First Class was directed by Matthew Vaughn he directed Kick A      s     s I haven't seen it yet. Stars James McAvory as Professor Charles Xavier, Michael Fassbender as Erik Lansherr aka Magneto, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Jenifer Laurence as Mystique, Janurary Jones as Emma Frost, Rose Byrne as Dr Moia Taggert. Open the movie to Poland 1944 we have a young Erik Lansherr who was captured by Na  zi's they got his backstory right he's being used by this doctor we he kills his mother he gets uncontrollably angry the effects where he destroys the room look like Secret World Of Alex Mack effects that old show on Nickeloden but we get to fv     c          k ups  were introduced to a young Charles Xavier who hears something what could it be? Mystique & guess what? Young Xavier's like oh you can stay with us. Never did Xavier & Mystique live together or grow up together. Could just put the step brother plot in. But then again do we need another guy like Vinny Jones. We go to about 18 years later Erik is now an adult tracking Dr Schmit down for revenge. Xavier & Raven Mystique's real name there living together in Las Vegas where Xavier is going to College he has a head full of hair when he went completely bald by 18. Hels going around picking up chicks is he Gambit all of a sudden & he's saying groovy. He talks about mutations openly in a bar WTF!? You ge to see him drink from a bong looking thing were introduced to Moria MacTaggert of The CIA we also are introduced to the main villains The He      llfire Club  led by Sebastian Shaw couldn't 20th Century FUX used them for X Men 3. Well we get to the main plot The He       llfire group want take over the world what else! He wants this Colonel to put missiles in Turkey to start a war.Which leads into The Cuban Missile Crisis. MacTaggert convinces Xavier to help The CIA & they go to this Division called X. Oh yeah guess how Xavier & Erik meet he saves him from drowning cause Erik was going to kill Shaw in this particular scene. They round up other mutants to train to of course fight evil. Also Hugh Jackman makes a Cameo where they try to funny & failed but it was cool to see him. They to to be funny when they when Xavier & Erik capture Emma Frost. Hank McCoy is thrown in they totally screw him up where he made this cure & it backfires but the tranformation was over time not in 2 seconds & he's in love with Mystique. Beast is a tragic character. Let's get on with the grande finale more like grim finale. Magneto gets his hands on Shaw kills him despite Xavier telling him not to. It was cool how Magneto did it though. The Military fearing the mutants fire missile at them Magneto tries to use them against The Military Xavier prevents it we get a fight between them MacTaggert tries to stop it a bullet deflects off Magneto hits Xavier in the spine he's paralysed. Magneto is remorful so he leaves Mystique joins him. Erik goes by Magneto from now on he helps Emma Frost get out of the pokey. The problem with this movie is they try to mesh too many stories like they did in X3 & X Men Origins Wolverine. The story between Xavier Erik they were friends for years not 2 weeks & since when did Magneto take part in the 1st X Men. Just throwing Beast's story in with a 2 second tranformation. too many stories going on & a prequel was not needed I hate prequels more than remakes. James McAvory was forgettable Michael Fassbender wasn't any good as Magneto Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan were better they had better interaction you believed those 2 were friends I'm sure that Michael Fassbender & James McAvory are good actors. Janurary Jones doesn't have much to do. Kevin Bacon was forgettable the animated Sebastian Shaw is better. The He     llfire Club should've been done in X3 they were filler anyway. I liked Rose Byrne & Jenifer Laurence they were the onlh likeable characters. I can't believe Rotten Tomatoes & IMDB have ranked above The 1st X Men movie  & X2  X2 was the best even X3 was better it tried to tell a story but it had a lot of good action it has it's problems though. Even X Men Origins Wolverine was better you atleast had a strong lead & some decent fights. Of couse who was the studio that released this movie 20th Century FUX. Tom Rothman needed to milk another franchise & looking at the money it made he was successful. I'll review a better movie next.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Works fine on Samsung Fascinate. The only problem I have is the aiming isn't as tight as I feel it should be.
0061777250|5.0|As a student, Medical Anthropologist, and researcher I have worked in the overall field of Death & Dying since 1964, taught college classes in it starting in 1973, and worked with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, Raymond Moody, IONS, IANDS. and with large varieties of people who have experienced Near Death and/or other \\"paranormal\\" experiences. Early on it was apparent that progress toward understanding of this area would best be found in mysticism (Classical through modern) and in quantum mechanics. Therefore, throughout my work in research and teaching I have read and accummulated many dozens of related books. I also have read many \\"materialist\\" based science books, often purporting to be counter-points.<br />I would not have thought it possible to capture, within a single binding, the essential perspectives of all views in so many disciplines, the exact thoroughness of open review and presentation, and the comprehensive anticipation of any questions a reader may have. I especially appreciated the consistent theme of patience Dr. van Lommel unwaiveringly demonstrates toward his most vicious critics. That he happens to be right is comforting; that he also happens to be gracious is too often professionally astounding.
0061906220|5.0|My 2 year old learned the song in pre-school and would sing it all the time.  The story has a great lesson behind it and all my nieces and nephews (ages 5-10) love the book as well.  Also, you can't find this book in a bookstore for the same price.  I got it for about half the price!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|What can I say about CATS? Being the 2nd longest running musical-{behind \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\"} in Broadway history, not one word can describe CATS! Preformed in many countries around the globe, it became the most popular & became everyone's favourite musical. Eventhough I never saw it live, but the DVD is just as good as seeing it live. I just love it & so will you! A very great addition for any DVD library. NOTE: Bryn Walters who played \\"Macavaty\\" also plays \\"Plato\\" that does the elaborate dance w/Victoria at the Jellicle Ball.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|I would easily rate this game 4-5 stars if it didn't constantly have the black screen issue on several different phones (Evo, MT4G, Evo 3D). Fun game when it works.
B002ROKQKG|4.0|I only bought this book because we were reading it at my book club.  I was not looking forward to it and was even thinking about skipping this one.  I am so glad I didn't.  I am not a football fan and didn't know too much about Mandela.      This was an informative book, more of a biography than a novel.  I now know what an amazing and interesting person Mandela was.  I would have preferred it if there were less details about football.  Sometimes it was a little too descriptive. I had previously read Power of One by Bryce Courtney. So, it was great to read about South Africa from another perspective.  Everyone in my book club rated this book very highly.     I am still not a football fan.
B001ILFUNW|4.0|Personally, I don't understand why this movie wasn't better aclaimed when it came out. It is on the long side, but it is one of the best romantic comidies i have seen in a long time. French Kiss is funny, touching and a great film.    Its really the chemistry and friendship between Luc (Kline) and Kate (Ryan) that make this movie great. You can tell from the fist time they meet that they are meant for each other, they just need to stop fighting for two minutes to figure it out for themselves! The clashing of luc's crazy and grab life by the horns phylsophy with Kate's paranoia and ultra controlling nature make for hilarious moments and a very witty film.    French Kiss is a great film, but it does have its slow moments. However, the very few flaws are well worth get through to enjoy rest of the story. Highly suggest you find a way to buy or see this movie.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Another excellent Jason Statham movie! It held true to the original movie with Charles Bronson (which I liked), only with much better acting and updated special effects.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|[[ASIN:B0031RAOVY Hachi: A Dog's Tale]]This is one the few movies I can watch over and over and it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. The true story of Hachi's loyalty to his owner cannot be matched. I would say more, but anymore would give away bits and pieces of the movie, and you need to experience it all for yourself. Really.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|i just moved it from sd card to phone its only like 25mb and that worked fine i rebooted and did everything else but untill i moved to phone all i got was black screen hope this helps
B0058P7KUA|4.0|9-10 reviews every day are didnt work on Evo phones and yet you continue to own the junk phone and leave junk reviews. GET a real phone!
B0058P7KUA|1.0|tried various attempts to run and unfortunately it always give me the black screen of death. Ininstalled / reinstalled still the same thing. After 4 attempts I accepted the fact that this game is not EVO friendly.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|droid 2 running cm7 latest nightly. im about to find an older version on the internet and see it it loads up.
B0058VW36U|4.0|this game is SO much fun! the makers are very creative, and it makes you think a lot to get 3 stars. the little green character is very cute and makes me laugh! if it wouldnt fc so much and make my phone restart, id give it a 5. og droid.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|installed game on HTC EVO.  fun game when I first played.  however I'm having problems starting the game.  it simply locks up the phone.  hoping issue will be resolved as it looks like a fun game.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the hands down most beautifully done show of all time. I love everything about it- cinematography, CGI, acting, and story. They say firefly does in a season what most shows fail to do with 5, and they deliver on that. Please just turn off mainstream television and buy this, you shall not be disappointed.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|My parents actually introduced me to this movie when I was really young i'd say 6 or so and every since then i've loved it( im in my early 20's,) so it's been years and this movie never gets old. Some people may consider it as cheesy...yes it was done in the eighty's, but they just don't movies like this anymore. And i love it!!!    As the item description states a young Dorothy is called back to Oz by her friend the scarecrow when he sends her a key to Oz. Bringing the idea of Oz back up to her Auntie Em, as well as her troubles sleeping her Aunt decides to send her to Dr. Whoorly in search of hoping that his new \\"technology\\" will help bring all this childhood nonsense to an end. Instead the visit leads her returning to Oz only to find that it is no longer the same... everyone has been turned to stone--and her friend the scarecrow is nowhere to be found.    Fairuza Balk in my opinion played an excellent dorothy-- and of course I love jack pumpkin head and Baleena the talking chicken. The Actors in it are casted well and I couldn't see anyone else in their place.    Being an extreme Oz fan, I will say it is nothing like the original Wizard of Oz with Judy, but it does stay true to L. Frank Baum's characters in the Oz books, which I also think should be read cause their fantastic.    All the same, depending on how scared a kid gets, there is some scary parts in this movie that may frighten them-- but I would defiantly give it a chance... had I been born in the eighty's I would have raved about this film. so good it really is an emerald gem! C: And a great gift who has an eye for unique films and appreciates them. A def. 80's classic!!!
0545128285|5.0|Being such a fan of the Harry Potter books & movies, it was fun reading the book referenced in the Deathly Hallows.  The other stories are very entertaining & having Dumbledore's input about each one is a lot of fun.  For any Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend it.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|As is the case with everything Stevie Nicks does at this point in her career, you know what you're getting right out of the gate so nothing surprises.  That's a sword that cuts both ways and \\"In Your Dreams\\", her latest solo CD, is emblematic of what Nicks has become.  What does that mean?  Well, for starters it means a lot of vague, meandering lines that sound like they were written by a high school sophomore rather than a lyricist.  It also means lots of references to dreams, ghosts, visions, mountains, forests, vampires and what-not that is just so much gobbledygook to listen to.  Let's face it, Nicks' stardom has enabled her to indulge in her precious fantasy world for 40 years and it's gotten repetitive and utterly tiresome.  She claims that her collaborations with producer Dave Stewart consist of poems she wrote that he set to music, which is not exactly how professional song lyricists operate.  Lyrics are meant to be sung.  Cadence, rhythm, syncopation and sound are intrinsic to them in a way not required of poems, which explains why much of this stuff sounds like she's simply reciting lines to a plodding melodic back-beat.  It's amateurish.  So why a 4-star rating?  Well, that sword cuts both ways, remember?  When disciplined, Nicks has a way with both words and melody, as the slight but sturdy \\"Secret Love\\" indicates.  That's one of several gems in this collection that deserves to be called her best in decades.  It's concise, specific and lovely.  \\"For What It's Worth\\" is classic Nicks without all the folderol and co-writer Mike Campbell has set her evocative words to a beautifully gentle melody.  \\"Midnight (A Vampire's Dream)\\" may have a whacked out lyric but it's a solid cut that once again proves Nicks has a knack for pop-craft when she is so inclined.  Best of all is \\"Annabel Lee\\".  Here, Nicks adapts Edgar Allen Poe's rhythmic poem (which is the best lyric found on this CD) and sets it to a sweeping melody totally appropriate to the words.  It ranks with her best work and shows that this would-be hippie sorceress knows what she's doing when she can get out of her own way.    Even some of her songs with Stewart, such as \\"You May Be the One\\", \\"Everybody Loves You\\" and the title tune, manage to click despite some lyrical mishaps.  And \\"My Heart\\", her other Mike Campbell collaboration (unfortunately available only at Barnes and Noble) sounds like Nicks in her heyday.  You can thank Stewart's role as producer for much of that.  He manages to create a soft-rock atmosphere on this CD that at times harkens back to the 70s without pandering to them, and it's clear that Nicks is in her comfort zone with this approach.  Her singing is stronger and more flexible than anyone should expect from a 62-year old woman with her history, and she once again proves that she knows how to scratch and coo the max out of the most convoluted lyrical ideas.  Yes, it's another mixed bag from rock's fairy tale princess, but what else do you expect at this point?  At least this time there is cohesion to the follow through and some very solid cuts to add to the Nicks oeuvre.  Who'd have guessed that at this late date she still had it in her?
B0058P7KUA|4.0|The game is fun first off. I had absolutely no control or loading issues on my EVO 3D. Do make sure your phone can handle this game before you buy it though. The campaign is a little short, but tthe survival modes are fun and make up for it in my opinion.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Great game tribute to games like smash tv. Found myself repaying this game as it was such much fun on the go.  Thanks amazon
B00007K02F|1.0|You don't have to be a Jane Eyre fan to know that the casting of this adaptation is all wrong.   It begins with Anna Paquin, one of the worst actresses in recent memory, as young Jane. While she's not as abominable as she is in later roles, she doesn't start the show off with anything that would make you care about Jane.     While Charlotte Gainsbourge is a tolerable Jane, she's so sappy and spaced-out that it's fairly hard to empathize with her if you don't know the real Jane already.    And then comes William Hurt. Why anyone would cast a man with the emotive range of a cactus to play the dynamic, volatile Mr. Rochester is a mystery. He dribbles out the classic lines like a child who hasn't learned to control its drooling. I don't know how anyone could believe that a brilliant, passionate, and tortured mind could lay behind that deadpan face and dry-as-dust voice. The character should exude energy and brilliance through every move and gesture. I don't know if I can blame Gainsbourge for her flat portrayal of Jane when she had absolutely nothing to play off of.     I'd recommend both the 1983 and 2006 versions to anyone who wants to actually enjoy this story.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game, best I have played in a while. If you like tower defense games, this is the best I have played.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|As a fan of the novel, I felt that the 1983 adaptation starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester was perfect. Zelah Clarke is believable and likable as the sharp-witted Jane, and Dalton plays the brooding, passionate master of Thornfield with passion and panache, doing justice to Rochester's brooding, intense speeches without making them ridiculous.     Being so fond of that very faithful adaptation, my hopes weren't high when I began this one. But since I had memorized the previous one word for word, I tried the 2006 version for a change of pace. I am so glad I did! While it is certainly not as faithful to the original dialogue of Bronte's classic, this version is a wonderful take on the characters of Jane and Rochester. The language is toned down, but the passion is still there!     Toby Stephens plays up the humorous side of Mr. Rochester, which while present in the book has rarely been showcased. He can also brood right along with the best of them. Ruth Wilson plays a believable Jane, but more innocent and less sharp than Zelah Clarke's. She and Toby have fantastic chemistry.    Despite skipping over some of the most moving dialogue in the novel, this adaptation keeps the heart and soul of this story and characters well intact!
B003XREL98|5.0|This novel by E.M. Forster (1879-1970) was first published in 1924. E.M Forster had visited India twice before writing this novel, and had become an opponent of imperialism.     Summary: Adele Quested visits India with Mrs. Moore in order to make up her mind about marrying Mrs. Moore's son Ronny. Adele wants to understand the 'real India', so she befriends an Indian: Dr. Aziz. Mrs. Moore, Adele and Dr. Aziz go on an expedition to the Marabar Caves which turns out to be a disaster. Mrs. Moore undergoes a psychic experience and never recovers from that, and Adele believes she was sexually assaulted by Dr. Aziz. After the arrest of Dr. Aziz tension arrises between the British and the local population in town. On the way back to the UK Adele admits that she was mistaken.     The main themes in this book are the misunderstanding between Adele and Dr. Aziz, the mystery about what really happened during the expedition to the caves and the colonial rule of the British in (then) British India.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Its an amazing album but Amazon beeps out the \\"bad words\\"  Besides that fact I freakin love gaga and this album is so different.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|John Ratey's work is an wonderful explication of neurological & hormonal phenomenon & how these are impacted by exercise. Positively.  The book is organized into nine chapters each of which tries to establish a causal impact of exercise on learning, stress, anxiety, depression, attention deficit, addiction, hormonal changes & aging. Finally, Ratey talks about the regimen - how much weekly exercise is good, or good for a start. The message is clear. While there is some argument around how much is the bare minimum, there is no equivocation around something is better than nothing.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book very highly for its honesty, its content & its mirth.<br /><br />@souvikstweets
B004OC07F8|4.0|Yeah. I thought this was about how to discover a true blue ocean not create one. I thought the focus would be more on fresh innovations. Nevertheless, this book has invaluable information.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I saw the series on science channel and bought it. The series were great. The movie had too many changes to be similar enough to the series and it felt like they had to make it more mainstream to appeal to more audience, although I feel it wasn't good enough for people that didn't watch the series and it was too far off the series for people that did watch the series.    Still, it's more of Firefly where it was shut down and I still love this show.    The box was damaged when I received it unfortunately. The plastic thing in the middle that is supposed to hold the disc in place was broken off which caused the dvd to move inside the box while it was being shipped and this damaged the dvd to the point that it's not fluent anymore on my dvd player. And that's a little disappointing for my first Amazon purchase.

0646497855|3.0|In my opnion this book is good. It has some helpful tips especially writing section. By reading this book one can increase his or her skill a bit high But the most important is to practice and practice.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|I loved the plot.  I don't want to spill the beans so I can't say to much about it.  But it has some amazing twists.  Liam gives a great performance. He's too cerebral for Hannibal Smith and some other of his recent roles. But this role fits him perfectly.  And there were no real bad performances to pull things down.  I recommend this film highly. I notice that the feeling is not completely unanimous, but I also notice that (as of this writing) the positive reviews strongly outnumber the negative reviews.  Read some of both and then make your own choice.

B003L77TZI|5.0|What a fantastic and magical-sounding album! There is a sense if euphoria in Teenage Dream that is truly one of a kind - a passionate, but enjoyably-silly love and plenty of sexual double entendres. Of course the lyrics are SUPERFICIAL - THIS IS POP! GET OVER IT, HATERS! No matter what pejorative comments Katy might receive, she is destined for even more success. She's already the Queen of Pop with FIVE Billboasrd #1 Singles!! And to the haters, she has shifted at five songs with FIVE MILLION digital sales each and almost six with Teenage Dream! Who knows what will happen with Last Friday Night as well. Then there is also Peacock, Hummingbird Heartbeat, and Circle the Drain that have potential to be the next hits on the radio. AMAZING ALBUM. <3
0446691437|5.0|I could not believe how one page had me laughing, another page had my crying and the next one had me looking at the people around me with a whole new clarity.  This book is in a class of its own. I bought a second copy for a writer friend.  I'm keeping my copy.
B000001EPB|5.0|Great, addictive, imagination-inspiring Irish dance music.  Some of it is slower but most of it is upbeat; two songs have singing and the rest are instrumental.  My roommate was playing a song from this album, and I just had to know what it was.  I looked it up, listened to more samples, and was hooked.  I just bought it and have been listening to over and over for the past few days.  After I played it for my mom, she ordered it too.  Get this CD; you won't be disappointed.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I put my 7 week old under this and it occupies her for half an hour easily so I can get things done around the house. She hasn't started sleeping in her crib yet, but when she does, I'm hoping this will put her to sleep, though she's a great sleeper as it is. It's really cute, the branches move up and down and music is very soothing. The price on Amazon is the cheapest around too.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I was hesitant on buying this since the last time I looked on amazon here it was only three stars, I'm glad to see that more people have rated this higher :D This is such a sweet and heart wrenching movie. You really feel for Kyle..I mean Hunter lol The romance between this couple was so sweet! I really enjoyed it and it reminded me a lot of the Disney cartoon Beauty and the Beast which is my favorite Disney film besides The Little Mermaid lol. Unlike a lot of the people that reviewed I didn't read the book first...so I went into this movie with an open mind lol. I would definitely recommend this for any true romantic :D

B0036S4C6G|4.0|This book could have been alternately titled \\"A bunch of people and what happened to each of them over time\\" (though that would have been much more unwieldy than \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad\\"). Egan does a great job of mapping out the complexities of life as people age. What starts out as a cohesive group of friends or family members gradually disintegrates, disperses and metamorphosizes with time. What happens to people and how those experiences transforms them can almost never be predicted based on their initial states. (Been to a 20th high school reunion lately?)<br /><br />Goon Squad, as other have observed, is less a cohesive novel than a series of short stories or character studies loosely bound together by the relationships between those characters. But these are tasty short stories. Complex and -- most importantly -- real. I never had the sense that I was reading a book; instead, I felt as if I were eavesdropping on overhead conversations. If you can pull that off, you've made it as an author.<br /><br />Lives rarely go as planned. There are detours and disappointments aplenty. The promising fall into irretrievable depths, while the mediocre sometimes find their way to unexpected success and satisfaction. How do these things happen? Why? Good literature like \\"Goon Squad\\" helps us to ponder these eternal questions by giving us an intimate window into the lives of our fellow travelers.

0553386794|1.0|SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />I read the first three books in the series hoping that the next book would be the one that helped me understand what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Empty characters -- the few of which you enjoy will be killed or maimed.<br /><br />Endless war scenes with no hope of success.<br /><br />Fantasy?  What fantasy?  The wolf thing?  Well that doesn't last long, they get killed too.<br /><br />Its just a book about endless sword fights between people who are either not sympathetic or for whom you dare not care as they are about to be destroyed anyway.  Someone could make the argument that the book contains politics and intrigue -- not really.  The characters would have to be characters instead of just support material for their swords in order for there to be actual intrigue.<br /><br />Its a sad day when I read three books in a series and not only have no interest in reading the fourth but are decidedly happy not to read the fourth.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Super fun. Love the quirky descriptions. The disco and Zamboni zombies are awesome. Easy to play, and amusing to show friends.
B004WJRDN2|1.0|McCartney was AT BEST a mediocre album with one or two good songs on it.  McCartney needed John Lennon and George Martin.  On his own, his work is mostly mediocre.  Fragments and bits and pieces of good things - but lacking across the board.  Sixty plus bucks for a Special Edition of this record is stupid...obscene.  Even if you like the record (and I do, sort of) it's almost all filler.  Pleasant, forgettable, humdrum.    McCartney II is far worse - somebody wrote along the way that it \\"shipped gold and was returned platinum.\\"  The low point of a lot of self-indulgent McCartney crap.
0307477479|5.0|Brilliant and totally deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.    Egan absolutely understands music, people and the culture of that world. I thought this book might be trite or light-weight but instead it is a deep, meaningful and insightful novel.  Dark and at times sad, but also tinged with tremedous humour. The Powerpoint works in ways I never could have imagined.    Those who didn't get this book really missed out on one of the most interesting and dazzling pieces of literature of recent years.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I love the point that flickjunkie made about this film. The fact that no one can simply enjoy this film anymore. I think that's how all films are. People never watch or do anything because of sheer desire to, but instead only because of the ratings that critics give it. Atop the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of American Cinema is an amazing & prestigious accomplishment, but it also puts a negative light on the film because it means that people should have expectations for it that are so high it is ridiculous. Everyone approaches it, almost randomly, as the greatest film of all time, & then is disappointed only because they thought it would be better.<br /><br />People must consider the time period in which this film was made & realize what a film of influence & importance this was. Innovative cinematography, as well as great music & very unique narrative structure. It is more than groundbreaking because it has had such an effect on cinema. Almost every director you can name is clearly influenced by Welles' style of direction.<br /><br />Review by AWC
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This movie really rocked! I know there will be a part 6 coming, for sure... that even makes it more satisfying than ever!! Way to go, characters of Fast Five! Keep it up!!! Whooo!
B002ZG981E|4.0|This story tests your mental acuity and plays with your perceptions of reality.  Christopher Nolan was the perfect choice to organize this complex story since he organized two other complex stories – Memento and Following – so well.  However, I was still confused by the rules of entering another’s dreams.  For instance, I didn’t understand why dreams had to be realistic or why someone would act defensively while dreaming.  I thought the point of extracting and planting ideas while someone is dreaming is because their defenses would be down.  I liked how in the end, you're left questioning what you really saw.  In a movie about planting ideas, I was left wondering who was really the one planting ideas.  I kept thinking about a question asked earlier in the movie -- if you don't know which reality you're in, why not choose the one you like best?  I could go back and think about how and when this idea got planted....but I think my head would explode.be so defensive while in a dream state.  I thought the whole point of entering a dream is that this person's defenses are down and they'll accept whatever reality you show them.  I also wasn't sure if all Perceptions are automatic or if you plant them there, since Cobb had them, too.       Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this film, although at times, I felt it moved too slowly.  I thought director Christopher Nolan was the perfect choice to organize this complicated film since he so carefully organized two other complicated films of his, Memento and Following.  I also liked the musical score chosen with it's deep trombone sound adding drama at key points.       Inception is about planting ideas.  With the mindbender ending, I was left wondering who had been planting these ideas all along.  I was left thinking about a question that had been asked in this movie -- if you don't know which reality you're in, why not choose the one you like best?       I could go back and think about how and when this idea got planted....but I think my head would explode.
B0038M61BE|5.0|This CD has one of the best performances in Jazz. If you love Jazz or not you must have it. Highly recommended
B000002MFE|5.0|I have become obsessed with this music. I know I have heard the original version of Layla many times and probably the acoustic one at some point, too. However, introduced to this music sort of by accident, I have listened to it for several days now.     Somehow, my image of Clapton was built on those extended electric guitar riffs whose obvious technical brilliance didn't resonate musically with me. And all too often hard rock singers sounded to me more like screamers.     Obviously, Layla and Tears in Heaven are the most powerful cuts, but I find Alberta and Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out, singing in my head, also.
1936719010|4.0|\\"Do The Work\\" by Steven Pressfield is another manifesto from The Domino Project started by Seth Godin.<br /><br />The point of these books are to be short, easy reads that drive a message home designed to move you past a certain type of \\"roadblock\\" IMO.<br /><br />This book does exactly that.<br /><br />Yes, it's repetitive, yes you will read some things you've heard before, yes you can get the gist of the book in the first 1/3rd of the book.  Then, you're supposed to \\"do the work\\" and ship something out to the world.  You'll overcome what Steven calls \\"The Resistance,\\" and get to the business of shipping.<br /><br />If you read the entire book you will be left with only one thing to do...get to work.<br /><br />And that's the whole point, which the book drives home very well.<br /><br />Why not 5/5 stars?<br /><br />I think some, not all, but some of the repetition could have been replaced by expanding on points within the book.  Other than that...you should find it a solid read IMO.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|First I'll say the one thing I don't like about the game - no multiplayer. Now that that's out of the way, this game is a ramped up version of Smash TV, but funnier and runs smoother. Perfect, perfect controls and tons of cool weapons. The game's challenging too (although I beat it in a day, there's a survival mode to keep you interested way past that which is also a lot of fun, and has no end). The game also has a great sense of humor, with jokes embedded in every line of dialogue, sound effect, and even level title. Highly recommend this.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This app works perfectly fine on Lg Vortex. not sure what else to say about it. No issues so far.
B0055FR5PS|4.0|I haven't had a good \\"aliens invade earth and get their butts handed to them\\" in a while, so I sat through the excruciatingly painful Gotterrdamerung of \\"Skyline\\" and lost my lunch somewhere in that slimy, pregnant circle of the Inferno.  So I was very happy to get into the good ol' GI boot-thumping of Battle Los Angeles. Yeah, as  science fiction it left me wanting more - hence the deduction of a star. I wanted more back-story on the aliens.  But the movie shone in realistic military action, pushing through the fear and confusion.  Fog of war, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and a primitive,  gruesome alien vivisection to figure out how to kill the critters.  And THANKS to the producer for letting the humans win!  I'm so weary of Hollywood human-haters.       I definitely would recommend it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|First, if you are in the market for an INCREDIBLE box set, you found one. As far as I know, this is the ONLY TIME ALL THE OFFICIAL VERSIONS OF THE LP ARTWORK HAVE BEEN REPRODUCED IN OVER 40 YEARS. (except for ABBEY RD, YELLOW SUBMARINE and LET IT BE, of course.) Even in the era of LPS, reprints of SGT PEPPER on vinyl removed the light pink-to red cloud design created by THE FOOL, for the inner paper sleeve. Later, the Sgt Pepper cutout insert was no longer in new Vinyl editions. In many reissues, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR LPs took the booklet out later LP reprints. Even some reprints of the LP artwork for the WHITE ALBUM changed, like the embossed title (in later vinyl LPS, \\"THE BEATLES\\" is just printed in grey ink. Even the upward facing cut to remove the WHITE ALBUM LPs (well, CDS in this case) has been restored on the MONO BOX. When the artwork for those newly remastered CDs of 2009 was designed, the CD package layout changed drastically in every case, when compaired to the original LP artwork. Sure, the front covers look the same as the LPs, but that's it. SO, if you want to own the ORIGINAL LP ARTWORK in CD sized duplication, this is it. (Except for 3 album titles previously listed, which were only stereo mixes.) These lps dont even list the songs as \\"Tracks\\". Everything is just like the first printings of the LPs, believe it.  This BOX is as close to the original LP artwork as you are going to get. So, that is the first thing to consider, when you decide if you want to buy a cheap reproduction, or the offical EMI product. The fake boxsets changed the artwork, to make a cheaper product. The fake boxsets ended up removing many of the extras touches that make these reproductions so authenic, and worth collecting.<br />. Let us consider whats different between the fakes and the authenic boxsets.<br /><br />1. The Paper inner sleeves are missing, especially the SGT PEPPER pink/red inner sleeve. All the real mono boxset CDS have these.<br />2. The MAGICIAL MYSTERY TOUR booklet is gone, and the fake CD cover doesnt have the LP<br /> subscript beneath the photo of the Beatles in animal costumes, \\"includes 24-page full color picture book.\\"<br />3. Poor manufacturing of the fake CD covers overall. FAKE WHITE ALBUM LP replicas opens on the side, not the top of the cover.<br />4. The CD titles usually arent in chronological order, when you open a new boxset. EMI's boxsets have CDS arranged by year, PLEASE PLEASE ME to MONO MASTERS.<br />5. The plastic inner CD sleeves of the fakes are very flimsy, and tear easily. The real ones are made better, & fit snug.<br />6. Blurry reproduction of FAKE boxset artwork, possibly using cheap ink. (bad smell reported upon first opening CDs.)<br />7. Some mono CDs are reportedly not playing properly in some models of CD-player.<br /><br />As for the mono mixes, some of the early albums sound MUCH BETTER in mono. The DOOM OF EARLY STEREO SEPERATION cursed the early Beatle's albums. You would hear drums, bass, rhythym guitar, and other sonic bits in LEFT CHANNEL, while the right channel would have the vocals, maybe a little percussion, and the lead instrument. You cant listen to that in earphones, cos the modern ear has been trained to hear the Bass and Bass drum in the CENTER of the stereo picture, for over 40 years. MONO restores that natural posistion of the bass elements. And, by playing the mono CDs' bass thru TWO woofers, instead of one, the bass punch is doubled. This is why MONO mixes in general, are said to be more \\"punchy\\", and have more presence. (cos on stage, bass drum and bass notes are in the center as well.) There is another PRACTICAL REASON why mono sound is very handy. AT BEATLES PARTIES, PLAY THE MONO VERSIONS, SO EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM HEARS THE SAME SONG. With stereo albums that have a lot of \\"movement\\", or swirling effects between the speakers, or might still have poor balance on the bottom end, depending on your relationship to the two (or five) speaker placements, the song you willhear wont have all the elements. One person near the left speaker might hear a drum and bass mix of DAY TRIPPER, and another person might hear an accapello version of THIS BOY. Therefore at parties, es, MONO IS COOL. (This only occured to me tonight, when i was walking around my room, away from the \\"perfect posistion\\" chair for the stereo sonic picture. EVERYPLACE in my room had the SAME SONIC PICTURE. Cool.)<br /><br />Naturally, most of us want to get our hands on MONO versions of WHITE ALBUMS, SGT PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, and  REVOLVER. EACH SONG is a different mix, compared to the stereo mixes. Since on the psychedelic work, one channel always seemed to have been devoted to either sound effects, which by then moved between the speakers, in order to reproduce the effects of aural hallucinations upon the listener. And, that's cool and valid, dont get me wrong there. But, each mono mix was accomplished completely seperately. When it comes to the basic levels of the major instruments, they remain the same from mono to stereo. Nevertheless changes snuck in. In mono, \\"SHES LEAVING HOME\\" plays faster by a semitone. I'm ONLY SLEEPING has different backround guitar leads. SGT PEPPER (reprise) is very different, with lots of stage banter by Paul. I remember hearing cowbells appear in new places, one song is shorter by a minute (HELTER SKELTER), and some songs are longer (Got to get you into my life, Dont Make Me Cry). Some songs sound Very Heavy, very INTENSE in mono, like YER BLUES. POW! It's really punchy and dirty in mono, and REVOLUTION 2 (rock version) sounds more dense, like HARD ROCK, like JOHN wanted. (HE didnt like the stereo mix of REVOLUTION 2.) THE WHITE ALBUM differs all over the place...a little tambourine here, a bit of echo there. Usually, the sound effects (PIGGIES, BLACKBIRD, BACK IN THE USSR, etc) get changed, since those knobs were turned in such a way, that each mix was an individual performance. On the MONO PAST MASTERS CDs in this boxset the original songs from the YELLOW SUBMARINE LP appear in mono, to replace the stereo only songs from the STEREO version of the title. ITS ONLY A NORTHERN SONG has a VERY different mono mix, as does ITS ALL TOO MUCH, compared to the stereo.<br /><br />Lets face it...MONO BOXSET is the OBVIOUS collector's dream, unless this set comes out on vinyl. (hahaHAHAhaha-HAH!) Recently, it appears that the Original MONO BOX SETS are being liquidated, so as to be removed from the market. Limiting availability increases its \\"collectability\\". I doubt EMI-APPLE will release these mono CDs as individual titles; if it DOES happen it wont be in this format. (ie Mini LP reproductions, MONO Mix). The problem with the market getting flooded with cheaply made, inferior quality MONO BOXSETS shouldnt worry the discerning shopper. Right now, these last MONO box sets are getting liquidated. I spent only about \\"one Benjamin\\" for a NEW MONO BOX from one of Amazon's largest drop sellers. When these MONO boxsets are gone, EMI might not reprint--who knows? If you are EVER going to get one of these, this might be the only chance you have, before you have to buy NEW copies from collectors, with the price jacked up way beyond the original price. Since HELP and RUBBER SOUL appear here in both mono and stereo versions, at least you wont have to buy the 2009 stereo remasters of those 2 albums, to replace your old 1987 mastered copies. Plus, these are the ORIGINAL LP STEREO mixes of HELP and RUBBER SOUL, not the new mixes George Martin made for the first CD release of those two titles. Do you still need more persuasion to splurge?

B0000033J9|5.0|I loved the movie of so many years ago.  Listening to the great quality reproduction was amazing.  As an ex ballerina, I enjoyed the Russian music.  Amazon delivered more quickly than I expected.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|The best books are not those which make me say \\"How well he writes!\\", nor \\"I loved that story\\"...rather, the best are those which make me burn to write, and remind me of the stories still aching within.    I read John Locke's 'How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 months' all this morning, about half of it while my son took a guitar lesson. I'm glad that Locke invested the extra time to write a shorter book, so I have more time to write and market mine.     Locke's actual experience (not theoretical insight) challenged my assumptions and habits, about using Twitter, Facebook and my blog, and about how to write for my target audience.     I'm no rookie online. I started my satire site, ScrappleFace.com, in July 2002 and posted fake funny family-friendly news stories to it for about 8 years, garnering all kinds of encouraging plaudits. Don't go there now, unless you want to skim the archives. I haven't written a story since September 2010 because I'm wrapped up in hosting a show called Trifecta on PJTV.com. Don't go there either, unless you're unnaturally interested in politics and news. The satire site did result in two books. The most recent -- [[ASIN:B003PDN7YK Laughing at Obama: Volume I]] -- topped the political humor category for a while. I mention this only to say that even a seasoned internet vet and experienced writer, who's spent much of his career in marketing, received a lot of valuable information from this book.     I wasn't half way through before I decided to read it again, and to use it as a handbook (always close at hand on my iPad thanks to the Kindle app).     Thank you, John Locke, for multiplying the joy you received from your experience by sharing it with others. (And, O, yes, thank you for sparing me much of the pain you gritted out, and the burden you shouldered.)    Live the Freedom,  Scott Ott  [...]    P.S. I've purchased dozens of books via Amazon, and I don't think I've ever written a review. If I did, I don't recall it.

B002GJT4Y6|5.0|Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets ultimate edition is a very good purchase, Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets ultimate edition has an extended cut of the movie (which is what the fans want to see). This one is worth the money, however Harry Potter Ultimate Editions 3,4,5, and 6 are not worth the money. Harry Potter Ultimate editions 3,4,5, and 6 do not have an extended cut of the movie, we know the extended cuts do exist because ABC Family Shows them, but it is hard to edit the commercials, what I want to know is why would the WB would promise to release the extended cuts and then turn around and re-release the theatrical cut. so do not buy Harry Potter Ultimate Editions 3,4,5 and 6
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this  book so much that i read it twice, book are like old freinds. I read the book the first time, and I did not think of it that much. When i read it again, I got misty eyed and I sobbed at the end, it is a rather short book. The innocence of the dog, Enzo,the intellect of Zoe, Te hatred of the evil twins, the sorrow of Eve and the strong will of Denny makes everything so put together. I feel like I know the characters. When you read the book enzo will grow in your heart too.

1600108512|3.0|This book is very pretty to look at and well-put together. However, unless you already know the story, the panels and narrative will be confusing with their pacing and layout. It's not a good introduction for people who haven't heard the story. I'm still glad to have it in my collection though! I feel that was what it was intended for.
031603441X|5.0|Fascinating book.  Keith Richards may look scary but he sounds like a really good guy.  And a very accomplished musician.  I had no idea.  A lot of musical details that were a bit much for me as I'm not musically inclined (although I love to listen).  But otherwise quite fascinating.  I do believe I like Keith Richards.  And for someone who was high so much of the time he really remembers a lot.  I wish I remembered a fraction of what he does.  I recommend this book.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I devoured this book.  I stumbled in to work two days in a row bleary-eyed from staying up all night reading it.  I was thoroughly engrossed in the story.  The characters had depth and pulled you in to the story.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Super easy read<br />2. Sympathetic characters very well developed<br />3. It's only $4.99<br />4. I could not put it down<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. No plot whatsoever.  The book wanders all over the place.  \\"I love you,\\" \\"you're no good for me,\\" \\"I'm no good for you,\\" \\"I can't live without you.\\"  There is no central plot but you're drawn in anyway.<br />2. The editing could be much better.  The margins were scattered and formatting/grammar left much to be desired.  It wasn't enough to put the book down, mind you, but it was noticeable.<br />3. The language was pretty raw and the f-bomb was dropped frequently.  I probably wouldn't have started reading it if I'd known. By the time I realized it bordered on excessive, I was sucked in and decided to skim over the tedious use of expletives.

B001NU4CM8|5.0|There was a great schism between Rick Wakeman and the other members of Yes. 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' had little for him to do, and Wakeman felt he needed something else to keep his sanity.<br />This is that vehicle: a soundtrack for a British mini-series.<br />And this was the start of Wakeman's incredible journey...<br />This concept album dealt with the long, adulterous life of Henry VIII, and the six women he used in order to sire a male heir. Each track is a musical interpretation of each wife. Each track is a great showcase of Wakeman's versatility as a composer, arranger and a keyboardist. And each track has excellent musicianship from all around.<br />This is , without doubt, an excellent example of progressive rock at its best.

0321525655|5.0|Remember that old commercial showing a guy eating chocolate and a guy eating peanut butter crashing into each other as they round a corner?  It was a smart way to advertise Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which considered itself an ideal marriage of ingredients that most people would never have dreamed of.<br /><br />PRESENTATIONZEN is a lot like that commercial.  You read it and feel as though four people, each intently oblivious in his own world, have crashed at a 4-way juncture, blending How-To with Self-Help, Philosophy, and Art.  Let's start with Art.  You can save five bucks and buy the Kindle version of this book if you wish, but I don't know why you would, so beautiful is the print version with its glossy photos of zen gardens and lovely slides showing many arresting images by way of example for those wishing to make Power Point presentations.<br /><br />The philosophical aspect comes from the \\"Zen\\" you see in the title.  Author Garr Reynolds, an expat resident of Japan himself, constantly weaves Zen-like wisdom into his advice by discussing the beauty of simplicity, the need for a less-is-more approach, and other bits of wisdom designed to thwart \\"death by Power Point\\" (we've all been there).  This ties in with the \\"How-To.\\"  In simple steps, the book shows how you can make a live presentation, whether you work in business, education, or the public sector.  Finally there's a dose of self-help to the book.  Reynolds counsels would-be presenters on the need to get in touch with the child within all of us, the need to take risks, the necessity of connecting with the audience by ignoring negative voices that whisper fears of failure.<br /><br />Each chapter ends with a section called \\"In Sum\\" which offers the highlights of what you read.  Many visuals are provided as well.  The only annoyance is that, sometimes, they are crowded together on a page with copy that you can barely read.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderfully simple book with complex considerations.  It should be required reading for all businessmen especially.  By the nature of their job and its expectations, they are the worst offenders when it comes to carnage through Power Point (Professor Plum did it in the board room with a slide show).  If their boss's won't buy them a copy, maybe their beleaguered audiences will.  It's all in the name of mercy and Zen.usinessmen especially.

1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick by Chip Heath and Dan Heath (Random House, 2008) Reviewed by Steve Gladis, Ph.D., July 2011<br />Overview: Making ideas last or, as the authors put it, \\"stick,\\" is both simple and compelling. It's simple if you know six basic principles and compelling if you're on the other side of someone using these powerful strategies. The authors (brothers and faculty members--one at Duke, the other at Stanford) are no novices to best sellers; just check out their other blockbuster, Switch.  The focus of Made to Stick is clearly on influence. While not new, the concept and their explanations of the principles will be new to many readers. They cover six major principles of influence or \\"stickiness\\": 1) Simplicity: The Kiss principle...keep it simple, stupid; 2) Unexpectedness: Shock, surprise, and attention-getting tactics stick in the mind of the audience (however large or small) and are the staple of every good public speaker; 3) Concreteness: Making it real in detail makes it stick; 4) Credibility: Reputation is the key, and getting people to believe in you makes your words stick; 5) Emotional: All decisions ultimately rest on how we feel about something. Deal with emotions or they'll deal with you; 6) Stories: At our core, we're tribal folk who rely on stories to understand the world. And when it comes to sticking, the Heaths have created a book that will stick around for many years. An easy mnemonic to remember this process is SUCCESs: Simple-Unexpected-Concrete-Credentialed-Emotional-Story-and \\"s\\" just to make the word spell right!

0765365278|3.0|But my review is.    I wish this book went through two or three more edits and perhaps even the first 300 pages given an updated rewrite.  Mr. Sanderson has proven in other novels that he can spin a tale, there's no denying this.  Unfortunately the first few hundred pages are slow, badly edited and even fall to high school creative writing errors.  On top of that, it's a slow start to this epic tome.  Things happen, sure, but nothing really connects the scattered pieces, or shards if you like, until the last 400 pages.  Cutting out the simple mistakes and perhaps smooth out some of the clunky first chunk of the book, a 850 page book even seems within the realms of possibility, making the long process of telling you the story OF the story ABOUT which this story is ... about, much easier to digest.    However, I can't rate this higher or lower than 3.  Each story line was intriguing and even self-contained.  The indirect relation between the three made for some curious speculation and intense scrutiny along the way.    Last gripe.. what the heck is with all the spren?  Windspren I get.  Firespren, okay... then they get into some whack spren, that probably would even exude whackspren in Roshar.  I mean... anticipationspren? *throws hands up in frustration...spren*    Still, the last half is great but you can only see the true greatness at the end by moving through the beginning.  And the pictures are an interesting diversion and makes it seem more personal to me when I see sketches of various things within the world.    I do look forward to the next chapter, as I expect a greater care would be given to the proofreads.  Note, I do believe this was something that Mr. Sanderson had started to write some time ago, leading me to suspect the early portion had some age-old editing and the last half showed his improved stylings.  Who is to say.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Make sure you restart the phone after installing. After restarting it takes about 20 seconds to load but after that it was smooth sailing...pretty good game!
B0058P7KUA|2.0|Picked this up for free, uninstalled after about 10 minutes.    As others have mentioned, the controls are not good (you have to point the gun to shoot, not just tap, which is very hard to do while you're also moving the character).    Also, the premise is just far too basic.  This is like an early-1990s top-down shooting game.  There is little variety other than the gun you're using, and no objective other than to kill all the enemies on the screen (which number in the hundreds).  The Android platform is somewhat limiting, but you can do more with it than this!
0440241901|1.0|One of the worst books I've read in a long time. Very disappointed in a book with high reviews. Silly situations that puts the characters in situations that are suppose to be funny but are simply eye rollers. There are so many other talented women writers out there...bypass this one.
B000MTOKZK|5.0|I recently purchased the Rhino mini LP replica edition.  Since Amazon lumps all the reviews together, it can get confusing, since there are so many different versions released.  This edition comes housed in a firm cardboard sleeve, which is an exact reproduction of the original artwork and back cover notes.  The inner CD sleeve is also exactly like the old album sleeves, with listings for other label releases from the 60s.  The sound quality is fantastic!  (One important note though; this version does NOT include any bonus tracks).  Interestingly, I find this album much more accessible than some folks seem to indicate.  In my opinion, it's an easier listen than \\"Love Supreme\\" for example.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is NOT the ORIGINAL trilogy. The so called fans who enjoy the dumbed down and outright stupid Special Ed. versions will probably buy the large box which will also include the 3 latter cartoon films Lucas made in this series. What is the point to this box? Is it just make it a point to slap me in the face again and tell me that I can't buy the good original theatrical versions, but I may buy these awfully maimed films? I just can't watch them. It's too sad seeing my childhood memories being destroyed by a money hungry bearded guy out at the Skywalker ranch. I always thought I would sit and watch Star Wars with my kids, but now I try to get them hooked on other franchises. Mainly because a certain individual think it's funny spitting in the face of the fanbase that built him. Never again will I buy a Star Wars movie. The last time he gave the good films a 4:3 aspect ratio and bad artwork, calling it a bonus disc. I never watched the ruined CGI version. In fact I nearly left while watching it in the cinema. Horrible horrible stuff!    Basically, I just wrote this review to let you all know this product does not deserve your money. If you like CGI cartoons in films and poor artwork on the cover, then get the other large horrible box which also includes the horrendous new episodes 1-3 in addition the \\"classic\\" episodes. Don't worry, as usual Mr. Lucas refuses to publish the good versions with a decent transfer. Greedo still needs glasses in this version on BD, and the Sandtroopers have silly out of place, cartoonish animals in the background.
B0019IB26I|4.0|good music but poor recording.the vidio on tv was cleaner sounding then this cd. buzzy and brakeup in this recording, too bad...  very fast service. got here in two days. i like amazon alot and will keep buying from  them.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I love this CD/DVD set. When I first read the reviews and saw the song list I remember thinking I did not know all of the songs. After hearing the quality of the recordings while previewing the songs on Zune, I knew this was a great live set that I wanted to own. I took a chance that the DVD would be great and it is.    While the scene's of Neil playing on stage are a bit dark, they are from 1971, 40 years ago now. So, it is rather remarkable that the DVD is as great as it is.    I highly recommend this set! Neil is very relaxed and comfortable. His voice and his playing are outstanding as are Massey Hall's acoustics.     What a treat to go back in time with Neil!

This game is not like all the other repetitious games out there on the market. Highly recommend.
0380977788|5.0|I began to read Coraline with no expectations beyond a hope of being mildly entertained; it is, after all, a children's book, and I was checking it out to see if my son might enjoy the storyline. Much to my surprise, I was completely sucked in almost from the first sentence; I fell asleep about 2/3 of the way through, and had the most vivid dreams I've had in years - and they were much like the book: creepy and dark, counterpointed by light and hope.<br /><br />I attribute the book's success at least in part to the fact that the childlike voice of the narrator is entirely appropriate to the main character's point-of-view. Coraline faces life as it comes, the good, bad, and indifferent, with a courageous honesty that belongs almost uniquely to childhood. She is herself, whether she is bored and annoyed with her everyday parents, or staking all their lives on her ability to outwit the unimaginably evil Other Mother creature.<br /><br />Children have this balance of imagination and pragmatism, and incorporate both in their creative play. This story captures that attitude perfectly, so you're swept into Coraline's perspective on her little world which so unexpectedly becomes larger and darker one rainy day.<br /><br />There are profound philosophical points that could be construed as morals of the tale, but the story stands on its own; it is great for its own sake, not just for the lessons it holds.<br /><br />I very much look forward to sharing this excellent story with my son.

0307716511|4.0|Received from Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />I have a younger sister and am consequently obsessed with stories about sisters especially ones where the older sister protects and looks out for her younger sister(s) (examples: The Hunger Games, Entwined).  I even have a goodreads shelf with books featuring sisters.  So requesting this from Amazon Vine was a no-brainer even if it's a bit darker than what I usually read.<br /><br />And overall I thought the link between sisters was the strongest material presented within the book although that may be because I have a sister.  To start, I was a little shocked to see that the sisters are five years apart (as are my sister and me) and I felt that eldest sister Beatrice sounded much older than her 26 years of age.  But her feelings of protectiveness and the feelings that she had failed Tess in the days before her death weighed heavily on me and kept me turning the pages.  Her grief was real and palpable to me even as she attempted to turn productive and solve the mystery behind her sister's murder, especially as almost everyone deemed it a suicide. However I think I may have put in some of my own feelings toward these characters because I didn't really like Beatrice; she's snobby and unkind but living in Tess' shoes enacts a change in her. From the presentation of Tess, I mostly liked her character.<br /><br />I also was impressed with Lupton's narrative skills; Beatrice alternates between recounting the story to policeman Mr. Wright and her sister, thus switching between first and second person.  She also changes between past and present tense.  Although sometimes a bit confusing, this was mostly presented clearly and kept me in suspense as it seemed that the killer was caught and would soon be sentenced.  However all is not as it appears in a mystery.<br /><br />There were multiple candidates for the murder of Tess and lots of false avenues.  By the end, I was so turned around that I had no idea.  I'm not entirely satisfied with the conclusion, because of the reveal of the murderer and also because of Lupton's narration. To say there's a twist is probably patently obvious to you but I was definitely thrown off.<br /><br />One last item I didn't like was Lupton's repetition of certain phrases when describing someone or an event.  The one that struck me most was when Beatrice would pause and a character would assume it was because she didn't understand; this popped up repeatedly and irked me. Other reviews have pointed out other repeated phrases.<br /><br />Overall: A mostly beautifully written thriller; especially recommended (with reservations if this isn't your kind of book) to women with sisters.of the reveal of the murderer and also because of Lupton's narration.

B000063DFQ|4.0|By the end of the Beast on the Road tour, it was clear that Clive Burr didn't have the stamina to be able to withstand the tough schedule that Maiden had been accustomed to since his recruitment for the debut album 3 years previously. Once again, the band had a change in lineup and settled on former Trust drummer Nicko McBrain, whom they had known as a result of touring together within the past year or so.<br /><br /> From the opening salvo of Where Eagles Dare, its apparent that Nicko was just as strong as Clive, if not even more energetic and dexterous in his abilities as a player, to become a worthy replacement and, with the passing of time, a key element to the band's overall sound. Bruce Dickinson comes into his own on the second release with Maiden and instantly its apparent that he surpasses Paul Di'Anno by leaps and bounds not only vocally but as a songwriter specifically; and Revelations follows in with an arrangement that builds and grows beautifully and displays the best elements of the band with Steve Harris' pulsating bass and the twin guitar attack of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith coupled with Dickinson's lyrical concepts that contain an otherworldly sense of imagery.<br /><br />Track 3 would become a Maiden staple in the Flight of Icarus, penned by Adrian and Bruce, this number would be one of many songs that would establish them as a powerful songwriting team within Maiden and sustain it for the next several years, if not into the present day. Die with Your Boots On consolidates the album thus far with a powerful precision in tempo and the by-now classic elements of what defines the sound of Maiden. The Trooper is a classic number penned by Steve Harris and is yet another quintessential tune that has lasted throughout the years as prime Maiden. Still Life is one of those rare Murray/Harris collaborations that adorn a Maiden release every so often, and although Dave may not be as prolific of a songwriter, when he does present a song, its easily up to par with the regular inputs from Dickinson, Smith and Harris. Quest for Fire although, is a bit of a mid-paced number and has a slight touch of filler here, but within the collection of material presented thus far, this is easily forgiven. Sun and Steel comes next and is another melodic rocker from Adrian and Bruce and to me, personally, is another number that slips through the wealth of the Maiden catalogue as a hidden gem. Harris completes the album cycle with To Tame a Land and continues the trend of ending each record with a longer track ala Phantom of the Opera, Hallowed By Thy Name, etc. Although an interesting track, its a bit lacking in the hook dept. and seems a bit labored in spots.<br /><br />Overall, Piece of Mind is a consistent and even better follow-up to 82's Number of the Beast and would begin a string of quality albums that would sustain this particular lineup for the next 5 years, and even though today they have managed to turn out quality records since the reunion, with the addition of Janick Gers, the 83-89 lineup is best known and remembered as the most fruiful period and classic lineup for this band. 4 and half stars.ular inputs from Dickinson, Smith and Harris.

140053271X|5.0|Love it.<br /><br />This baby reads books from many sites on the web, from B&N and from my local library.  I have read them all with simple file managment.<br /><br />Personaly I prefer Amazon and wish I could buy books here, as we buy everything else here.  But unfortunaly my test kindle file would not work on the nook, not the nooks fault as it reads files from everyone else.<br /><br />Choose the nook for it's simple touch.  We own two of these one for my 11 year old and the other for my wife and I to share.<br /><br />It looks cool.  Works well.  And our local library has a nice selection.  Chose this over the kindle for looks, simple touch features and the library support.  I know if B&N ever fails I can still get e books anyplace else.

This is a great package - really nice heavy duty slipbook packaging with some great art cards as well which are asking to be framed.    Too many great bits for me to mention but one of my favourites is Scorsese himself as one of De Niro's passengers - unforgettable!    To UK/Euro buyers - this one works fine on UK/Euro blu-ray players and I think this package beats the UK edition - and is just as cheap.    Total bargain!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Bought the 405CX initially since it was on sale (these never go on sale it seems like) and second of all for the form factor (can be used as an everyday watch). But as I began to use it more, I started to really enjoy all the cool things it can do. I have the forerunner 305 and as much as I love that watch, this improves on that. I love ther wireless transfer to my pc and I love how I can visually track my progress especially now that I'm training more based on HR than pace. The satellite pick up is a little bit better than the 305 but in my opinion not by much. So it still takes some time to pick up. I wish they have more screens/views for the many things I want to track during my run like the 305 but I guess that's something you lose if you want a smaller watch. That said the auto scroll feature does the trick just fine. Battery life is great. I charge once a week and it only takes 3 hrs to fully charge. Keeping GPS off after runs does help battery life. I do wish they had different colors (I.e. Black) instead of the blue color that it only comes with for the CX version. Over all I am very satisfied with this product and look forward to a more improved version (waterproof, smaller, diff color, quicker satellite pick up)
B004T0XYM8|5.0|I can never make my mind up between this and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.    Im not going into detail about why this film is so great - just watch it. Forget True Grit. Forget John Wayne. Watch a classic - a true classic.     For all european buyers - this one runs fine on any UK/European blu-ray players so dont worry about that. The slipcase matches the UK 'The Spaghetti Western trilogy' box set quite nicely too even though that is completely unintentional!    Just buy it - you wont regret it!

0307595862|5.0|listened to this book via audible books. the story held my attention throughout.  it was suspenseful, and the character of harry hole was a good creation; a smart, curmudgeonly codger fighting his devils while solving difficult crimes.  I have started on 'the redbreast' now and will probably listen to any more harry hole books that are available.<br />a very enjoyable read (listen).<br />I posted this review to offset the one star ratings this book has.  I do not deny the right of those who wished to rate it a 'one', but I wanted to express my humble opinion as to what a wonderful book it is, and that it deserves a 'five star' rating.
B004SB60OC|5.0|This soleful album touched my heart in so many ways. The beautiful melodies combined with such raw emotional lyrics really causes one to think about how it feels to hurt and deal with love lost.  Excellent album!  I highly recommend it.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I've just finished watching this movie and I do not understand some of the reviews I've read.     The camera work is nearly flawless. It adds to the suspense. Denzel Washington is quite comfortable with his character. This role is classic Denzel Washington. He and Chris Pine have good chemistry and Rosario Dawson steals the show as Connie, the trainmaster who orchestrates the rescue. Lew Temple's portrayal of the welder-turned-hero, Ned, is slightly overdone, but servicable.    You may start out watching this movie just to kill time, but you'll soon be drawn in and lose track of time. I couldn't believe how quickly this movie moves along.    BUY IT, RENT IT OR CHECK IT OUT AT THE LIBRARY. JUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
B004N44SOI|5.0|First I would like to say thank you to Amazon for giving us free samples to listen to. Second, thank you Nikki Sixx and the other band members for putting this album out! This one rocks!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I can't go a day without listening to this album, I think it's GaGa's best yet.. she's grown so much since The Fame. It takes more than one listen to fully appreciate, but overall it's an amazing album. Britney and Katy etc, can't touch it. My favorite tracks are: Heavy Metal Lover, Marry The Night, The Edge of Glory, Hair, and Judas. The only track I really dislike is Americano, but others love it.
B00000AFDW|3.0|When you hear the opening bars and vocals of `Psycho Circus' burst out of the speakers for the first time, it is a wondrous moment. It sounds like Kiss, having reformed the original line-up at the end of the 90s after a decade and a half apart, have actually pulled it off. For five minutes and ten seconds of glorious stomping glam rock and roll, it feels like they have returned to their heyday form. But alas, after this superb classic Kiss opener, 1998's `Psycho Circus' somewhat implodes.<br /><br />It would have seemed sensible at this point in their story to employ a producer from their classic heavy period, such as Bob Ezrin (`[[ASIN:B000001EL3 Destroyer]]', `[[ASIN:B000001FZP Revenge]]') or Larry Kramer (`[[ASIN:B000001EL5 Rock & Roll Over]]'). Instead they went with Bruce Fairbairn who had mostly helmed albums for glossy mid rockers like Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Poison and Van Halen, as well as The Cranberries. Consequently, with the Kiss sound on this album augmented by keyboards and effects that would never have appeared on one of their records the first time around, the band sounds watered down and over-produced. Then there is the additional problem that too often the songs bear little resemblance to the music they would have made in the 70s.<br /><br />That said, none of the songs are terrible. It is also the third Kiss album in a row that showcases strong, well-crafted, largely non-corny songs from Gene Simmons in a late career renaissance. In fact, his are mostly the best of the album - the moody `Within' and `Journey of 1,000 Years' are truly fine, if unrepresentative of the Kiss sound. And the folksy `We Are One' sounds like it could have been a good track on his 1978 solo album. Though they again fall into the tired trap of trying to re-write `Rock and Roll All Nite' (twice), his version - `You Wanted the Best' is ok (if hokey) for what it is. Paul Stanley's `I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll' is far superior. While Stanley's title track is far and away the best song on the album, and `Dreamin' is excellent as well, he is also behind a few clunkers. `Raise Your Glasses', written with corporate writer Holly Knight, doesn't sit quite right with the set and the Peter Criss voiced `I Finally Found My Way', with its tinkling piano and country crooner leanings, is woefully wrong and out of place. On the other hand, Ace Frehley's only contribution, `Into the Void', is convincing.<br /><br />Sadly, though much more satisfying than any of their albums without make-up, the bottom line is that `Psycho Circus' was just too unrepresentative and muddled in approach - and too calculated - to resuscitate the glory days.

B004LFO0FG|1.0|This album to me is lackluster.. there's only 2 or 3 songs I really like. Britney never could sing, and now she can barely dance. Her lyrics are childish and stupid, and her fans are delusional. Isn't she done yet?
B000001EXR|4.0|This almost not released record is often unfairly lambasted. It is true that Kiss had almost run out of puff on more than one occasion (1985 with `[[ASIN:B00000AF96 Asylum]]', 1989 with `[[ASIN:B000001FQQ Hot in the Shade]]'), but `Carnival of Souls' is a different kettle of fish. It could not be further from the Kiss of the 70s or indeed the Kiss of the 80s. It sounds muddy, it is heavy and dirgey. The subject matter is almost nihilistic at times (`Hate', `Jungle' - both excellent) and the vocals have a 90s drawl to them. If 1992's heavy, dark and dirty `[[ASIN:B000001FZP Revenge]]' lacked a sense of fun, `Carnival of Souls' was close to miserable in comparison.<br /><br />Recorded somewhere around 1995, the frivolousness with which Kiss were equated was most definitely `out'. It was a time when the sounds of grunge, indie rock and grunge metal were the approach that gave a band cred. `Carnival of Souls' was coproduced by Toby Wright who was aligned with the likes of Alice in Chains, Slayer and Queensryche. So Kiss' intentions on this effort are pretty easy to read. Measured against those benchmarks, `Carnival of Souls' could easily be dismissed as a wanna-be effort. But measured against other Kiss albums, it is a far more intriguing creature.<br /><br />This album is the band's greatest departure and contains some of their most interesting and unusual songwriting. They also go back to Kiss basics by backing one another on vocals and relinquishing the last dozen years of screeching in favour of their lower registers. Bruce Kulick even sings the final track (`I Walk Alone'). A great (and unusual) thing about it is that the six tracks co-written by Gene Simmons are all well crafted and among the strongest of his career. In abandoning silly sex romps as a subject matter, he seems to have really risen to the occasion and equaled himself with the ever-reliable Stanley. `Hate', `Childhood's End', `In My Head' and `Seduction of the Innocent' are all dark, durgey grunge metal with occasional melodic flourishes thrown in. Stanley's six songs are also good. The funked-up grunge of `Jungle' is excellent and, if it weren't for the subject matter, the closest to sounding something like a tradition Kiss song. The morose ballad, `I Will Be There' is also outstanding - a vast improvement on the equivalent on 1992's `Revenge'.<br /><br />`Carnival of Souls' is a dislocating experience for the most part. It takes a lot of getting used to and is initially hard to get all the way through in one listen. It sounds under-mixed and it definitely doesn't sound like Kiss - which is probably why it has been so badly received - no pop rock melodies or fist-raising anthems here. Dark and gloomy, it is the only real heavy metal album they ever recorded. But if you are prepared to stick with it, you realize it is not only the riskiest and most intelligent thing they ever made, but quite riveting on its own unique terms.nal melodic flourishes thrown in.

B0011UBDTK|5.0|I have been wanting to purchase the Complete Series from the moment I saw it! (Even though my sister and I already owned all 6 seasons.) Finally, I gave in and purchased the set, and I am certainly glad I did. This is the perfect gift for any SATC fan; the packaging is beautiful with pink velvet (I am sure Carrie would approve) and the inside is sleek. The discs are separated by season, each with descriptions of the episodes and beautiful pictures of all the girls throughout the seasons. The Collector's gift-set also includes a bonus disk with music and commentary from the show.<br /><br />On the downside, I have experienced some difficulty playing some episodes on my laptop. This may not be the problem normally, as most people play DVDs with a DVD player (haha) but it has been frustrating. I am not quite sure if it is the lap top or the actually disks, but it is very disappointing. Besides that, I would highly recommend this gift set to all; I purchased one for my sister's birthday and she loves it as well!

B004SBULWE|4.0|This little app kills your battery very fast. Really easy to use. I recommend you don't kill any running widgets or your OS might have to reboot
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The 1090T (or the slightly faster 1100T) will provide most of the speed you'd get out of a $900 top-of-the-line Intel i7, at about 20% of the cost. Add to that the features standard on AMD 880-based (and also cheaper than Intel) motherboards, and you've got an excellent foundation for a gaming rig on a budget -- or a somewhat future-proof general purpose rig.    The ONLY issue you may encounter is that of heat if you go to overclock it (and I'm guessing you want to, if you're buying a Black Edition CPU). I am able to get 3.6 GHz (+400 MHz) just by disabling TurboCore and tweaking the multiplier in BIOS. 3.7 requires a minimal bump in voltage. 4.0 is perfectly stable at 1.44V, but the stock cooler is not up to the task. Stress testing pushes the Core temps into the 62C range in a matter of minutes, resulting in a blue screen. I do not see this as a failure of the CPU itself, and the stock cooling is adequate for the official speed ratings and somewhat beyond. Brief tests revealed that my particular CPU may be good as high as 4.23 GHz, but until I can attach better cooling, I will not even think about it. Still, even 4.0 is 25% over the rated speed, and will get you back most of the raw number crunching you are giving up by not getting an i7 Extreme.    Drop $40 or so on a Cooler Master Hyper 212 and a second fan, and you most likely will cruise at 4 GHz without raising a tremendous racket or having to invest in watercooling. Sure it's not the bleeding edge of performance, but it's reasonably close and at a price most of us can live with. Since the TurboCore feature kicks up the voltage (to 1.475V) and frequency (to 3.6 GHz) when 3 or fewer cores are loaded, it seems pretty apparent the only obstacle to continuous 3.6 GHz operation of all six cores is that the stock heatsink is JUST adequate for it. The CPU doesn't need anywhere NEAR 1.475V to run at 3.6 GHz, and you may find that turning OFF TurboCore and bumping the multiplier to 18.0 for all six cores actually results in cooler and faster operation. I did not have to bump up the voltage AT ALL from the stock 1.375V to run at 3.6GHz.    Even if you decide not to overclock it (which would be a shame, being a Black Edition), it's still screaming fast at 3.2 GHz. I built this rig to do two things: (1) be an audio workstation, and (2) play Minecraft at 2048x1152, and it does both of these things quite respectably. It's a HUGE upgrade from my dual-core 2.4 GHz Athlon 64, which was getting long in the tooth (but still works perfectly).    Get a decent motherboard to underpin it (you can afford to, the CPU is reasonably priced) and you can take this CPU a long, long way. The value is tremendous. I can't really recommend the 1090T over the 1100T, being that the price difference is a mere $10, but I don't think you'd be disappointed in either one. If you want to squeeze still more speed out of it, go with 1600 MHz or 2000 MHz DDR3 memory.

0553386794|4.0|Often, with epic fantasy, it is \\"do or die\\" with regard to reviews. You get masses of people that love a particular author, or you get masses that hate them. Then, it becomes a mini-ratings war as to which reviews dominate (See: Terry Goodkind/Robert Jordan/ George R.R. Martin).<br /><br />I expected Game of Thrones to be an epic fantasy series without par, given all of the hype surrounding the series particularly in light of its HBO feature. What I found, instead, was a series that holds a large amount of promise, yet also has a few drawbacks.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-George R.R. Martin weaves a tale using a myriad of characters. There is no predominant character or storyline. (This is viewed as a positive given the sheer scope of the work).<br /><br />-No character is fully good or bad. Variegated shades of grey characterize the personalities of all but a few characters.<br /><br />-Martin is (shock!) willing to kill off characters that the reader has fallen to love. Many epic fantasy series (read: almost ALL) go along without deaths among the cast of main characters. The key with this work, however, is that you are attached to so many of the characters that it becomes okay that one of your favorites has perished. This also helps with an emotional attachment to the storyline.<br /><br />-Martin is, without a doubt, a masterful writer. The prose is beautiful.<br /><br />-If you like tales of knights, with chivalry, and little magical interference, this is the book for you.<br /><br />-The political intrigue in this book is intense, leaving one guessing the entire scope of the book, peeling layer upon layer of mystery down until finally the truth is revealed. Or is it?<br /><br />-This volume will leave you wanting more with the second book in the series, despite the fact that the book is a lengthy read. However, as mentioned, his prose reads easily.<br /><br />-Realism. I view this as both a pro and a con. You become attached to the characters. The world is not \\"chivalrous\\" despite the appearance some characters give. Swearing, blood, gore, sex, etc. are highly present and brutally detailed. The book is written very realistically in a world that appears similar to our own at an earlier era (with obvious exceptions). Thus, this does not feature new creative worlds, races, magic systems, etc, but a brutal realism.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-For me at least, this book was not as creative as some of the other epic fantasy authors I have read (Sanderson in particular, Jordan). Don't get me wrong. The intrigue in this book alone makes it worth the read; it is a brilliant work, yet I find myself drawn to unusual worlds, unusual systems. However, if you are not looking for such creative, unusual worlds, then this remains the book for you. Again, this is a minor \\"con,\\" as I enjoyed the book greatly.<br /><br />-As mentioned, if you enjoy a main character, or if you enjoy a \\"clean\\" epic fantasy, do not pick up this title. It isn't for you. However, if you have doubts, I urge you to give it a try.<br /><br />All in all, this was a very promising start to an epic fantasy series. It is a realistic title, engrossing, and masterfully written. I will reserve judgment on its relation to other epic fantasy authors (Goodkind, Jordan, Sanderson, Brooks) because, well, we all enjoy different things in our fantasy. Thus, it is not for me to say that Martin is better or worse than any of the aforementioned authors, simply that they all share the same league, in my eyes, albeit for different subgenres within their genre., sex, etc. are highly present and brutally detailed.

B002ZG975Q|4.0|Kyle is hot, rich, and self centered.  And these are the perfect qualities in his eyes for being class president.  Kyle gets a wake-up call though when he teases a witch-like girl in his class and she puts a spell on him, turning him into a scarred, tattooed freak.<br /><br />He has one year to get a girl to genuinely tell him she loves him or he will be cursed with bad looks forever.Kyle goes into hiding and while trying to win over the girl that his heart really yearns for, he also learns a thing or two about inner beauty.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a take on the old Beauty and the Beast story, but it works.  I really enjoyed this one.  Alex Pettyfer plays Kyle.  You might recognize him as the lead from I Am Number Four.  He's good eye candy.  Even when he was the tatted up bald beast, he's still pretty hot.  Mary-Kate Olsen plays Kendra, the witch, and even she was pretty decent and looked great. Vanessa Hudgens plays Lindy, the girl that Kyle falls for.  She wasn't bad either.<br /><br />I really appreciated her character's back story more than anything.  Her father is a druggie and kills a dealer to save her.  She goes into hiding at Kyle's house for protection and this is how she gets to know him, though she doesn't know its really Kyle from her school, a guy that she didn't really know very well outside is pompous showman attitude.<br /><br />The real surprise is Neal Patrick Harris, who plays Kyle's blind tutor.  He offers up quite a bit of humor and since he can't judge Kyle by his looks, he teaches Kyle that he shouldn't judge himself in that manner either.<br /><br />Kyle's father is a popular news anchor and just as stuck up as his son.  When Kyle becomes cursed, he tucks Kyle away in a penthouse in the city.  It becomes obvious that his father is ashamed of him since he keeps canceling plans with him.  The father quickly falls out of the storyline all together as Kyle concentrates instead on breaking the curse by getting Lindy to love him.  This father/son storyline was probably the weakest part of the movie, and I didn't really are that it didn't get wrapped up in the end.<br /><br />A touch of love.  A touch of whimsey.  Heart.

B002ZG99OK|3.0|It's hard to rate a movie like Zookeeper.  On the one hand, no one's going to say that it's a must-see comedy. But on the other hand, it's better than the average film of this sort, and while it's completely predictable, it does manage to keep you entertained and you still laugh even when you know what's coming. And some of the scenes are true comic gold, even if the film as a whole can't maintain that high level.<br /><br />The plot:  Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) is a zookeeper at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, a job which he loves but which gets him little respect. Particularly from his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), who dumps him at the beginning of the movie just as he's in the middle of his elaborately planned proposal of marriage, stating that she just can't see herself getting serious with a zookeeper. Crushed, Griffin briefly considers quitting his job and going to work for his brother, Dave (Nat Faxon), who has a high-end car dealership, but Kate (Rosario Dawson), the zoo's vet, talks him out of it. Five years later, when Dave is getting married, Stephanie suddenly reappears. Griffin is just as smitten with her as he was five years before. Now he's seriously considering quitting in order to win her, enough so that the zoo animals - who consider him the best keeper they've ever had - decide to take action. Starting with revealing to a very startled Griffin that they can in fact talk. Knowing that the only way to get Griffin to stay is to help him win Stephanie, they proceed to bombard him with all kinds of mating advice, varying according to the animal giving it. Griffin's attempts to follow their advice have, as one might expect, highly variable and sometimes disastrous results.<br /><br />Admittedly, high comedy or classic comedy, Zookeeper is not. It's one-hundred percent predictable but you still laugh, mainly because of the talented cast (live and voice actors), who manage to keep things lively enough that you still want to see things unfold in spite of knowing what will happen. Kevin James is perfect as the hapless Griffin (you know you're hapless when you're taking dating advice from talking animals). Leslie Bibb does a nice turn as the gorgeous but devastatingly shallow Stephanie.  And Joe Rogan is deliciously obnoxious as Stephanie's uber-testosteroned boyfriend Gale.<br /><br />But hey, Zookeeper is really about the talking animals and the film's technical and animal-handling crew did an excellent job, both in making it look like they're actually talking and in managing to give them a lot of physical expressiveness in their roles. The voice-actors behind the live animals were superbly cast and all did a great job of bringing their animal characters to life:  Nick Nolte's gorilla Bernie gives the film a lot of its best moments; Adam Sandler's cheeky monkey Donald, who's always lording his opposable thumbs over the other animals and whose fall-back advice for any situation is \\"throw poo at them\\"; the mated lions - Sylvester Stallone's Joe and Cher's Janet - have some of the best dialogue in the film, arguing like a real married couple over who's better suited to give advice; Judd Apatow's elephant Barry has a fear of confrontation and a hay-eating disorder; Jon Favreau (yeah, that Jon Favreau, director of Iron Man I & II) and Faizon Love are Jerome and Bruce, a couple of male bears constantly ranking on each other, are a riot; and Don Rickles gets in some particularly bad advice as a frog.<br /><br />There are a few let downs, largely I feel to weaknesses in the script. While some scenes are brilliantly funny, others don't quite hit the mark and a few simply go on too long. And while most of the characters are decently written, a few  were either poorly thought out or inadequately developed. Ken Jeong, who was brilliantly funny in films like Knocked Up, Role Models and The Hangover movies, never quite hits the mark as Venom, a co-worker of Griffin's whose social skills make everyone around him cringe. Donnie Wahlberg is wasted as Shane, a cardboard bad-guy who mistreats one of the animals at the zoo.  And the extremely talented Rosario Dawson, whose veteranarian Kate is key to the plot, isn't really fleshed out enough to make her relationship with Griffin really believeable.<br /><br />But all that said, Zookeeper remains a decent film that meets the expectations the trailers set up.  Recommended as a light comedy with a few memorable scenes, a pleasant enough way to pass a couple of hours., a cardboard bad-guy who mistreats one of the animals at the zoo.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|The bezel was so disfunctional that I had to return the unit the day I received it.  I couldn't even make it through the \\"bezel orientation\\" because it kept locking up.

It sounds like the unit I received was only an extreme example of the non-functioning bezel that so many users have reported with this device.

The third sister barely gets mentioned, as she is not old enough to fall madly in love with the wrong guy and then make a scene about it when he doesn't love her back.<br /><br />The brother and sister-in-law are greedy and care only about money, even though they have plenty and don't share it with the rest of the family. The cousins are only focused on parties and gaiety and fun.<br /><br />My impression of this book was that they spend the whole time having parties and looking for a husband. They fall in love with men who are unfaithful and they act quite silly about it upon realizing the man doesn`t love them. The men are all fickle and quite rude about it, pretty much ignoring the girls once they have had enough of them and never communicating with anyone.  I almost didn't like them until I recollected that this book was written roughly 200 years ago and times WERE different then. However, I find it hard to relate and also to distance these girls from our modern times. If they were here right now, they would be completely out of place. I would tell them to shut up or to stand up for themselves for God's sakes!<br /><br />This is an era where men and women still marry for money and class. An era where your mother can arrange your marriage to a \\"suitable\\" beau. An era where the women didn't work and then men were landlords as an occupation. It is an era that I do like to read about and would like to understand, but that I have a hard time relating to. Maybe it's Austen's style of writing. Maybe it's just the era.<br /><br />However, for such an old book, it is sometimes amazing how much things really haven't changed. I think this quote still holds true today.  \\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy\\".<br /><br />This one just cracks me up. \\"Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\".  So she didn't argue with him. She was snubbing him by not giving him the satisfaction of an argument. I love it. What an insult!<br /><br />But the best quote is this one at the end, which redeems Marianne. She finally turns around and realizes that she is not the only person in the world and the learns to respect and care about other people. She realizes that the man she loved when young was worthless and the one who has stood by and loved her for years is priceless.<br /><br />\\"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!\\"<br /><br />I cannot say I really liked this book as much as I thought I would. From hearing what other people have said, I thought it would be absolutely great. It was just okay. I have found that there are several classics that I feel about this way. Maybe the hype is just too much. My expectations are too high. Or maybe I am just not into this style of book. I will keep trying however.<br /><br />I give it a 3 out of 5. I liked this book but I did not love it.
0553582038|5.0|[This review contains no major spoilers for A Feast for Crows, but it does outline the basic premise of a few characters' storylines and mention the identity of new point-of-view characters.  There are major spoilers for earlier books in the series as well.]<br /><br />The contrast between A Feast for Crows and its immediate predecessor, A Storm of Swords, could scarcely be greater.  Narrowly the shortest book in the series (to date) as Storm is narrowly the longest, Feast is about the peace following the war that was so violently and definitively resolved in the earlier book.  And, because of unforeseen complications in the structure of the series, Feast only features about half the characters from earlier books.  This changed to a limited scope and a much less rapid pace has caused many fans to treat the book as a failure, easily the weakest in the series.  As I've said, I go against the grain a little by regarding Storm as the weakest.  I can now add that I go against the grain that much further, in thinking that A Feast for Crows is, given its inherent limitations, the best installment of A Song of Ice and Fire so far.<br /><br />One of the problems long-time fans have is the introduction of many new point of view characters, and the relative absence of familiar ones.  It's true that 27 of the book's 45 chapters feature new points of view, and an additional 12 feature characters only introduced in the most recent book.  Inevitably there's some adjustment to be made to the lack of well-known voices, but I find the new points of view so fascinating that it's well worth the effort.<br /><br />The most prominent character in the book, old or new, is Cersei, who is, after the deaths of her son Joffrey and her father Tywin, the unquestioned Queen Regent of the Seven Kingdoms.  The war seems to be over and her other son Tommen's throne secure, but Cersei is far from relieved.  She believes the Tyrells, whose support helped her family end the war, are now scheming against her, and the (incorrect) notion that her dwarf brother Tyrion murdered Joffrey has reawakened older, stranger fears.  Cersei has always been unstable, but her insanity reaches new heights in A Feast for Crows, and her reflections on previous events in the series expand the character and make her more dramatically credible without obscuring her cruelty.  This unreliable narration substantially heightens the novel's mood, of which more later.<br /><br />The other major new point of view character is Brienne of Tarth, whose quest to find Sansa Stark is essentially all she has to live for.  As readers we know where Sansa is, and therefore can recognize just how hopeless Brienne's search is.  This could make her chapters frustrating, but the milieu in which they occur is compelling enough that the seeming irrelevance of the plot becomes a minor annoyance.  Like Jaime and Arya's chapters in A Storm of Swords, Brienne's storyline shows us the effect of the war on the riverlands, and like those chapters it's plagued with unexpected, highly coincidental reappearance of familiar secondary characters.  But there are striking new characters as well, and the riverlands are now rebuilding in the aftermath of war, so the tragedy is tinged with hope.<br /><br />In addition to Cersei and Brienne, there are nine chapters featuring six new minor point of view characters, who provide a window into events on the Iron Islands and in Dorne.  These chapters have also been controversial, with some complaining that their relevance to the overall story is not, as of this book, particularly clear.  That's true enough, but in a transitional novel I can forgive the presence of a few dangling threads, especially when the characters and locations are as rich as in these chapters.  The scorched land of Dorne, its gout-ridden, cautious Prince Doran, and the daughters and nieces who urge him to throw himself into the game of thrones, are particular favorites, and the vicious lifestyle and Lovecraftian religion of the Iron Islands are, as ever, darkly compelling.<br /><br />Imagery of metaphorical crows feeding on carrion is prominent in the book, perhaps excessively so, and the Seven Kingdoms are indeed so exhausted by the recent war that only crows can be truly satisfied.  And amongst the tentative efforts at rebuilding are forewarnings of the horror to come, creating an atmosphere of prophecy, magic, mental decay, and encroaching doom.  A Feast for Crows may not have the scope and speed of A Storm of Swords, but it more than makes up for that loss with a vividly-evoked portrait of characters and a society perched on the edge of a knife, thinking safety is in reach, but actually about to be skewered.s ever, darkly compelling.

There are major spoilers for A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings as well.]<br /><br />More than 400,000 words long and over 1,000 pages in hardcover, A Storm of Swords is, albeit narrowly, the longest book to date in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire.  It's also regarded by many or most of the series' fans as the best book yet, full of the gritty detail, unexpected twists, and shocking deaths that set the series apart from other contemporary epic fantasy.  Full the book certainly is, and its most momentous scenes are every bit as wonderful as the fan reaction suggests.  But I must confess that to my mind A Storm of Swords is, not the best book in the series so far, but the worst.<br /><br />Part of the problem is simply its length.  There's often a desire among readers to see each book in a series become thicker than the last, and most of the time I share that desire.  But 400,000 words' worth of the level of detail Martin provides is something else altogether.  It's not that any particular storyline, historical detail, character, location, or miscellaneous piece of description is dull or extraneous; it's that, taken together, they cause the book to bog down a little, in spite of the rapid resolution of so many storylines.<br /><br />Another distracting element is a reliance on unlikely narrative coincidence.  Despite the vast size of Westeros and the scope of the story, point-of-view characters cross paths with each other and with minor supporting characters surprisingly often.  The issue here is that Martin has introduced some fascinating secondary protagonists and needs to keep them in the story even when they move away from the primary characters who previously provided our perspective on them.  So, out all of the people in all the kingdoms they could encounter, they walk into some of the other primary characters.  It's not a fatal flaw, and in a story of this size some contrivance is forgivable, but it is distracting, and runs counter to the realism for which the series is justly praised.<br /><br />Much of the coincidence and path-crossing involves events in the riverlands, where the bulk of the fighting in this War of the Five Kings has taken place.  Unlike some fantasy and historical novels, which treat war and conquest as a game for aristocrats and ignore the consequences for ordinary people, A Song of Ice and Fire is at pains to show the disease, destruction, and death that peasants suffer when the powerful cross swords.  This is a noble intention, but I can't help feeling that A Storm of Swords takes it too far, to a point where readers may be frustrated rather than inspired to thought or sympathy.  One character spends most of the novel bouncing helplessly between one miserable situation and another, his or her storyline advancing very little.<br /><br />There's another character who also provides a perspective on the riverlands, but his storyline is anything but static.  Jaime Lannister becomes a point of view character in A Storm of Swords, and in terms of psychological complexity he's perhaps Martin's richest creation to date.  In the aftermath of a long imprisonment the power and arrogance that have prevented Jaime from confronting the egregiousness of his own behavior are diminished, and his grudging respect for Brienne of Tarth, his captor as he crosses the riverlands, leads him to reexamine some of his infamous crimes.  It's nothing so cheap and straightforward as a redemptive arc-- he remains Jaime Lannister, proud, snide, and capable of viciousness-- but it does enrich his characterization, adding notes of tragedy and contemplation to what had previously been a monstrous villain.<br /><br />Regardless of which side they're on in the greatconflict, for many of the series' established characters the events of A Storm of Swords are dark ones.  Jaime's brother Tyrion remains a point of view character, and in addition to the disfigurement he suffered at the end of the previous book, he has to deal with his father's return to the city, displacing Tyrion from his powerful position as the Hand of the King.  Uglier than ever, and unappreciated for his contributions to the successful defense of the city, Tyrion finds his situation going from bad to worse as the novel progresses.<br /><br />Mother to one of the other contenders for the throne, Catelyn Stark has her own troubles as the novel opens: a dying father, worry over her son's fate in battle, and guilt over her secret release of Jaime Lannister in the hope of recovering her daughters.  When Robb returns, he brings news that makes the desperate situation of House Stark even worse.  The youthful King in the North has won every battle, and yet finds himself in danger of losing the war.<br /><br />Separated by distance from the intrigues of southern Westeros, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen continue their isolated storylines.  Jon is posing as one of the wildlings to bring information about their intentions back to his brothers on the Night's Watch, but he discovers that keeping to his vows while posing as a spy may not be as easy as he had believed.  The unusual ethics and (sometimes literally) larger-than-life behavior of the wildlings enriches the astonishingly deep milieu of the series yet further.  As does Slaver's Bay, the region in which Daenerys arrives early in the book.  In need of an army, she considers buying the fiercely loyal, viciously trained troops known as the Unsullied from the slave city Astapor.  But such a purchase demands a high price, and the young queen's way of paying it may bring her more trouble than triumph.<br /><br />All these storylines, and several others, evolve toward a major turning point, the end of the first movement in George R. R. Martin's very long story and the beginning of the second.  The last third of the novel is so loaded with vivid sequences and jaw-dropping developments that my other complaints come to seem like quibbling.  I do believe that A Storm of Swords is the least of the first five books in A Song of Ice and Fire, but that simply means it's the weakest length in a remarkably strong chain.haracters the events of A Storm of Swords are dark ones.

0143034901|5.0|This book was so much better than I thought it would be.  It was full of twists and turn, many that totally blew me out of the water.  Often, in books and in movies, you can kind of form your own idea of how its going to end.  Not with this book.  Everyone of my theories was wrong, but in a good way.  It was amazing how Ruiz Zafon tied so many of the characters together, without making it seem like it was a stretch.  Each character, no matter if their piece was large or small, had an impact on how the story came together.  I highly recommend this book! Excellent, excellent read.

( u could even hear the footsteps behind you ) but the bad thing was the qaility. today when i pulled them off my head the right ear peice broke!!!!!!!!  the only thing holdig it together was a wire and some glue. i was ticked. it is well worth the 75 bucks but if you get them take extreme care of them! so now im getting my money back and buying the good durable wireless stero headset for the ps3. they come out in october and they cost 30 dollars more, but it'll be well worth it. All in all i rate this headset a 3. even though it has good sound quality it has terrible construction. and the comfort isnt to great. i was playing black ops for about an hour and they started hurting my ears and the top of my head. I hope many of you found this review helpful

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I'm quite impressed with this 'little' light. Not too long ago, in order to have such a long throw one had to carry along a pretty heavy flashlight.  Since it uses AA batteries, it's a big plus. Maybe it's just me but I feel it complements those eneloop type batteries and custom chargers out there.    Feels very solid despite the use of a battery cartridge which I've tried to avoid in the past, too flimsy and easily broken after a while. On the TK41, the cartridge feels solid with quality plastic.  Switching modes is super easy, I love the two buttons method: one for power and one for the mode switch. All previous flashlights I've used had just one button that controlled all the functions and it felt a little awkward going through all the phases in order to achieve a desired output.

B001PPLIFU|2.0|2 1/2 stars, and a genuine disappointment when you consider both the promising start that Craig's tenure as Bond got off too in \\"Casino Royale\\" and that this film serves as direct sequel to that first film's storyline. Many of the pieces that could have made this a good film are in place here - Craig returns from Casino, as does Judi Dench, Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, and Jesper Christensen. Throw in the usually solid French actor Matthieu Amalric (who overacts terribly here), a big budget, the screenwriters of Royale, and a decent director in Marc Forster and you'd think things would go swimmingly. They don't. The editing in this film is terrible - splicing and dicing the action sequences into the kind of incoherent barrage you'd find in a Michael Bay film (not a compliment) - while the script commits two sins: it is simultaneously boring and witless, stripping Bond of any of his distinguishing personality traits, and it wastes the talents of a fine cast. And though Craig and Dench try mightily to save this movie, they cannot. In the end, the film is just a squandered chance to provide a satisfying continuation of \\"Casino Royale's\\" story.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|3 1/2 stars, really. This season was bound to split viewers and cause some consternation. David Tennant was one of the most popular doctors on record (only Tom Baker rivaled him), and so I wouldn't envy anyone the task of coming after. A few of the reviews here have, I think, been a bit unfair to Matt Smith in that regard: in their (justified) adoration for Tennant, they've made up their minds to hate Smith without ever really giving him a shot.<br /><br />In reality, Smith acquits himself relatively well - he's stronger in some episodes than in others, but that's to be expected in his first season out when he's just figuring his own take on the role. (And in retrospect, even the fondly remembered Tennant's first season was a wee bit rocky.) Smith is always watchable, and by the time the season's two-part finale comes along he's pretty well knocking it out of the park. His doctor is less showy than Tennant's, and less melancholic or physical than Eccleston's. And yet I think Smith is able to evoke one quality essential to the Doctors character better than either of his immediate precursors: his age. Which is odd, considering that he's the youngest doctor on record. But watch him in the finale, especially his scene with the young version of Amy toward the end. Well done.<br /><br />That said, there is a very important weak point to this season: the writing. The premier is solid stuff, as are the series' first and third 2-parters (the Weeping Angels storyline and the finale, respectively), but the others... Meh. Something is decidedly off here. The Dalek episode and the episode titled \\"The Lodger\\" are especially bad, but the others in between aren't so hot either. But the good news is that the writing seems to have gotten much stronger in the recently aired Season 6, and Smith's characterization of The Doctor has only grown deeper.
0553136321|5.0|John LeCarre's 1974 novel \\"Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy\\" is a stunningly good dramatization of a real incident of treason inside the British Secret Intelligence Service, and another in the author's series of excellent Cold War novels.<br /><br />As the novel begins, George Smiley, veteran British intelligence agent, is recalled from unhappy retirement to deal with new information concerning a possible mole inside the Secret Intelligence Service.  Smiley is commissioned by a senior civil servant to run his own investigation, off the grid, to identify and trap the traitor.<br /><br />The trail of clues will lead Smiley back through the circumstances that led to his own forced retirement, a botched mission in Czechoslovakia in which an agent was shot and the head of the Intelligence Service discredited.  It becomes clear that the mission was betrayed by an insider.<br /><br />The balance of the novel is Smiley's meticulous hunt for that insider, who is a traitor sent by Moscow to infiltrate the Service. LeCarre's prose allows the reader to take in the clues over Smiley's shoulder; the tension at the end is practically unbearable as Smiley springs a final trap that will reveal the surprising identity of the traitor.<br /><br />\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is very highly recommended to fans of LeCarre's excellent spy fiction.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|If I were judging this film solely on the merits of its fidelity to history, it would fail by a wide margin: it condenses many decades worth of events into a few brief years, plays fast and loose with several real characters fates, and occasionally creates an outright fabrication. Judged as pure drama, however, this flick is a resounding success. The set design and cinematography are very good, and ably convey the sense that the atmospheres of both England and the Tudor court at this time were dangerous. The supporting cast is reliably good (even Joseph Fiennes, whom I've always regarded as a bit of a weak link in any production he appears in, is watchable). And as for Blanchett... Shes extraordinarily good here, convincingly essaying Elizabeth's evolution from a naïve and inexperienced ruler into a ruthless pragmatist. Fine stuff indeed.<br /><br />*A brief digression (or observation): I have always been somewhat bemused by the movie poster for this film (it also graces the cover of the DVD), as it seems to try and emulate a glossy magazine's glamour spread. It's so not reflective of the actual tone of the movie...
0743442539|5.0|John LeCarre's 1963 novel, \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\", has had a long life as perhaps the definitive novel of the Cold War.  It features a twisting storyline, an unblinking look at the moral ambiguity of the espionage business, and a haunting ending.<br /><br />\\"The Spy\\" is British agent Alec Leamas, recalled to London from Berlin after the loss of a valued agent.  There, the ruthless head of the British Secret Service offers him a chance to square accounts with the East Germans, by pretending to defect.<br /><br />To build Leamas the proper bonafides, he is cashiered from the service with an inadequate pension.  An alcoholic burn-out case, he is fired from a series of menial jobs, and even falls in love with the young secretary of a London communist cell, before ending up in prison.  When he is released, he is approached by the East Germans and persuaded to defect.<br /><br />In East Berlin, Leamas comes face to face with the senior East German intelligence officer he was meant to find.  He also discovers that a much deeper game is being played, in which betrayal can have many faces...<br /><br />\\"Spy\\" features several characters who would have recurring roles in later LeCarre novels, most notably George Smiley, Leamas' handler, himself a troubled soldier of the Cold War.<br /><br />\\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" is very highly recommended to fans of spy fiction, who are likely to find it one of the best in the genre.
B000E41MS6|3.0|A solid start to the new series run. Not the best of the new seasons, by any stretch (a few of the episodes here are a bit too silly even for \\"Who,\\" and the writing in one or two episodes is rather weak - clearly the new writers feeling things out), but a respectable start.<br /><br />My biggest regret here is that Eccleston didn't sign up for another run. Mind you, we got enormously lucky and got Tennant for the second season (he was such fun), but I'd argue that Eccleston was actually the better man to restart the series in Season 1 - at least given the recent backstory that the writers gave him (the Time War, the death of the Doctor's people). Eccleston brings a gravity and melancholy to the part that really work, and that I'm not sure Tennant would have nailed as well (at least not that melancholy, anyway). Yet Eccleston is also delightfully and eccentrically funny, physical, and slightly dangerous (but never overly-so). He's the best part of season 1.

B000062XFG|3.0|3 1/2 stars, and much, much better than season one. Though the show wouldn't truly come into its own until Season 3, this year still managed to feature some truly good episodes (\\"Q Who,\\" \\"The Measure of a Man,\\" \\"The Emissary\\") and a number of really solid ones. And though there may still have been a few episodes that didn't quite cut the mustard (\\"The Outrageous Okona\\" and \\"Pen Pals,\\" for example), the scripts here were a decided improvement over those for Season One. The look of the series was also improving - the sets and camerawork seem more polished, and though the costuming for the leads remains essentially the same, at least this time around Riker is wearing his beard (which may seem like a strange and superficial thing to cite as an improvement, but there ya' go). True, viewers briefly got stuck with Dr. Pulaski instead of Dr. Crusher, but I think the ultimate mismanagement of this character had less to do with actress Diana Muldaur's ability than it did with the writers' apparent desire to recreate Doctor McCoy in female form. Pulaski never seemed to have a real spark of her own. Fortunately, the character didn't do much damage. This season is worth a look.
0765356139|5.0|This was a great follow up to the equally awesome first book in the series. I was definitely a skeptic of Brandon Sanderson (for my own reasons, like how can someone release so many large books so quickly and make them any good?!) I came into this series thinking I wouldn't like it at all but I'd read the first just to make sure... needless to say I'm a HUGE fan now and will definitely read all of Sanderson's books! I just started the 3rd book in the Mistborn series today and it starts off with lots and LOTS of action, I think it will be even better than this book! (I might need an extra star Amazon!)    Anyways, if you like or love fantasy books this is a MUST read. Great original magic system, plot, characters. This series has it all!!    PS another great series ( I think) is the Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks! Check it out after the Mistborn Trilogy!
B000Q66JXA|3.0|There are some visual shots and sequences in this film that are breathtakingly good: the wedding sequence, Arthur's initial introduction to Lancelot, and Perceval's spectacularly eerie quest for the grail to name a few. Plus, Wagner has seldom been better used in a movie. Great stuff here, with sequences that stick in my mind more than twenty years after I first saw the film. So why just the three stars?<br /><br />Two reasons, really. As visually striking as this film is, the script isn't especially solid or coherent. It may be relatively faithful to Malory's original text, but literal faithfulness to a literary source isn't always a good thing. This film presupposes knowledge of the source material that many viewers may not have, so that specific narrative events occasionally seem to unfold without any explanation or context. That kind of context-free thing may happen all the time in real life, but in narrative you need some sort of bridge between events.<br /><br />The second problem lies with the performances - which are inconsistent, to say the least, and too often veer toward egregious overacting. That overacting sort of works in actor Nicol Williamsons favor (Merlin is supposed to be odd, after all), but it works less well with Nigel Terry's Arthur and other supporting roles. In fact, Terry overacts so much that he just looks like he's trying too hard. And since he's playing the lead role... Well, you get the point. Helen Mirren is solid, though, and it's always fun to see a young Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, and a pre-Picard Patrick Stewart.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Pearl Jam's debut album, \\"Ten,\\" helped to upend the state of American Rock and Roll. Coming off the remnants of several other noteworthy bands (most of all, Mother Love Bone) and recruited San Diegian singer Eddie Vedder, \\"Ten\\" stripped the fluff and posturing away from late 80's hair-metal and scraped it down to primal guitar and deep angst. Vedder gave this perfect voice, and guitarist Mike McCready stayed more inside the classic rock manual when it came time for guitar leads.<br /><br />The result was an a album that resonated both the current rock lovers and the grunge crowd that was lusting for anything that gave of something that resembled Nirvana's grunge vibe. \\"Evenflow,\\" \\"Alive,\\" \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Black\\" soon became established on radio and MTV, and the rest,as is often said, is history. That established, the most exciting thing about this deluxe remaster is the obvious care the band, producer Rick Parashar, bonus disc remixer Brendan O'Brien and other contributors put into this edition. The original album sounds as blistering as it always did, and the second disc rethinks the original while losing none of the impact. O'Brien reins in the echo/reverb, pushes Vedder more to the fore and makes things a bit cleaner. Disc one is like getting caught in a ravaging sandstorm, the remix is like getting a sand blaster applied in a precise location. Either way, you're getting pounded and laid bare.<br /><br />The DVD is the MTV Unplugged performance of March 1992 (roughly when \\"Ten\\" was beginning to peak), and captures the band in all its anti-swagger glory. The DVD is also devoid of clutter and scraps, making it a more valuable watch. The scraps are in the main packaging, with articles about Mookie Blaylock (Pearl Jam's original name), lots of pictures, posters, passes, and plenty of Vedder's surprisingly good sketches. The deluxe version of \\"Ten\\" is exactly how a re-issue should be done; no waste and plenty of value, respectful to both fan and band.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|A really pleasant surprise. Not precisely a romantic comedy, the film mixes a genuine sweetness and humanity with just the right dose of unsentimental reality to prevent it from becoming formulaic or saccharine. The cast is uniformly strong: Hoult convinces as the sweet but not traditionally cute kid, and I have always liked Toni Collette. As for Grant... I generally prefer him whenever he's playing a bit of a cad, as he does here. (Grant has always seemed a bit liberated whenever he's not stuck as the `aw, shucks' romantic lead). By the end of the film, the characters haven't had sudden and conveniently scripted epiphanies as they might have in some lesser, more formulaic comedies, but they do seem to have evolved as human beings. Good stuff, and worth a watch.
B002ZG99OK|5.0|ZOOKEEPER    It is no secret that I am a Kevin James fan and I guarantee that I will enjoy any thing that the man is in. I LOVED his show \\"The King of Queens\\" and have loved all of his films including his first Happy Madison film \\"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\\". Would did I love it you may ask, well because of the cast but also because my little cuz loved it. When you go to see these family films with the kids you can't help but enjoy it when you know they are. Well that same thing can be said here with James's latest Happy Madison flick \\"Zookeeper\\".    Now before I go further I want people to really reread that first paragraph particularly about the kids. I have read many a review on other sites that have been negative towards this film, which is fine. People have the right to their opinion but when you say a film is unrealistic then be realistic in your review. This film is for kids and it is obvious, if you go to see a movie with talking animals then I really don't want to hear you say it is unrealistic. It wasn't made for you it is for the kids therefore the family friendly PG rating it has. Also I have read people talking about a super hot woman let alone two getting with Kevin James could not happen. That is funny because he is actually married to a super hot woman, who actually plays his brother's wife in this movie.    The film follows Griffin Keyes [James] who still yearns for his ex but still loves his job. The thing is his job is what broke them up in the first place since she wanted him to do more with his life. He though loves his job and loves the animals he cares for and they love him back. It is with that said they all decide to help out their favorite Zookeeper and help him get his girl back. Of course in doing so they break the code that says they can not speak to humans. Add in that one of Griffin's fellow workers at the Zoo Kate [Rosario Dawson] could be the actual girl for him and a crazy new boyfriend of his ex played by Joe Rogan is in the picture andyou have one entertaining flick.    Now like I said before this film will not be for everybody and any one wanting a serious film will be disappointed. This is indeed a comedy and a family friendly comedy at that aimed towards kids. Kevin James is perfect here in his role as the love struck bumbling type guy, he always is. James is a very funny guy because he is completely believable and likeable. I also like the fact that he likes making films geared towards kids so when they come out I can take my cuz and nieces and nephew to his films. \\"Paul Blart\\" was a PG film and now this one; add in the animated films like \\"Barn Yard\\" and it is obvious he likes to make these types of films.    I would also love to point out MMA legend Bas Rutten voices Sebastian the Wolf and legendary MMA trainer Mark DellaGrotte cameos in this film. With that said I would like to say that Bas did an excellent job as the Wolf and was hilarious. Also MMA commentator/comedian Joe Rogan was exactly the right person for the boyfriend of the ex. He is wonderful funny and evil in this, loved him here. Speaking of the ex Leslie Bibb is excellent here plays the perfect gold digger like character who wants to change him. Rosario Dawson as well is wonderful as always in this film and I have to admit that I love her; she is one of my favorite actresses.     Donnie Wahlberg and Ken Jeong are great as well even though they are not in it as much as I would have wanted, especially Wahlberg. From the entire live cast all the way to the voice actors like Adam Sandler, Stallone and them this was a fun flick. You know what, that is what this is all about, fun. For kids or not this is a fun movie, Kevin James and the cast that was put together and talking animals could be nothing but. Any film in which a gorilla voiced by Nick Nolte goes partying at a TGI Friday's has to be fun. That of course is one of many fun scenes in this film, yeah, a fun flick.    I honestly wish I could find the words to really say how much fun this was but I can't. All I can say is that not only was it entertaining but listening to the kids crack up the whole time was wonderful. Also I don't know if every theater with this did this but all the kids got \\"Zookeeper\\" posters with animal facts on the back. Of course my girl, brother and I got one each as well, got to add that to the movie poster collection. So I do recommend this flick because it is good, it may not be the best film ever depending your taste but it is good. Remember the target audience and go in with that mindset and you will like it. Take the kids as well because they will love it.
B004SIP9U6|4.0|An intelligent, charming, and witty bit of fluff. The Oscar seems to have been both a blessing and a curse for this flick: the nomination no doubt raised its visibility tenfold, but actually winning best picture seems to have damned the film to an eternity of people wagging their heads in frustration and saying it shouldn't have won against \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" And you know what? Those people may be right, but that really doesn't stop me from enjoying this one enormously. It's a well-made movie, with a script by Tom Stoppard that dares to intelligently engage with and respect the artistic process while simultaneously poking a little good-natured fun at the overwrought seriousness sometimes associated with it. The performances are all engaging - even Affleck manages to be watchable - and the sets and costumes are just stellar. This one may be a romantic lark, but it's a fun one.
0785151303|5.0|I own every art book of Marvel and I just had to add this to my collection. It just might be the best yet, the art is fantastic!
6304711891|4.0|The only Michael Bay directed movie that I can comfortably recommend. Some spectacular action can be found here, along with some solid one-liners and fun performances. Is the movie subtle? Not even remotely. Nothing about this flick - from the pumped up musical score to the hyper-kinetic action to the outsized performances by Cage, Connery, and Harris - suggests the phrases subtlety or low key. But you know what? That's okay. It works here. There's a time and a place for subtlety and it's not in this kind of big, sometimes ludicrous, but always fun summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, this kind of big summer fun seems to be in short supply of late. And Michael Bay, who showed some directorial promise here, went on to direct the mind-numbingly dumb and humanity free \\"Transformers\\" flicks. Yeesh.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I am very happy was bran new and came just as stated. In the amount of time that was said.
B004RE29WW|3.0|Not nearly as bad as you may have heard, but nowhere near as good as it could have (or should have) been, either. It has a solid cast (from Weaver, Dutton, and Dance to supporting British thesps like McGann), a director who's since become a great visual stylist and (usually) all-around solid filmmaker, and a fantastic look (except, of course, for the rather bad CGI alien). There are even some hints that the filmmakers were trying to say something interesting about issues like gender and the loss of faith. All of this makes me more sympathetic to and interested in the film than I suspect I should be.<br /><br />But in the end the film isn't that good. So what went wrong? The reason is simple. Yes, the film begins by eliminating three favorites from Aliens, but it is not these character deaths that are the films undoing. That choice took some guts, and had one other crucial component of the film been better the choice might have worked.<br /><br />Bottom line: the problem is the script. It is full of holes, and full of dispensable, disposable characters, bearing the marks of a legendarily rough off-screen gestation. Given what I've heard (and what the documentaries on the special editions reveal) about the making, I doubt that even a more experienced director could have made this movie work - and Fincher, as gifted as he has since proven to be, was in 1992 a very green first time feature director. Even the Directors Cut - which restores close to half an hour of footage and adds some much needed texture - can't really save the film. The great set design and cinematography help, as do the efforts of the cast, but the script just isn't there. This is a compromised movie. But it is also much better - and much more interesting - than its vacuous follow up (\\"Alien: Resurrection\\"). So all in all, worth a watch. Just don't expect the cohesion or mastery of the first two films.
B00122HT04|5.0|This to me is the epitome of the new millennium metal band.  Avenged Sevenfold never seems to disappoint when it comes to heavy metal and totally jammin' out heavy riffs.  This album has it all heavy riffs, screaming, and great production.  My favorite songs are brompton cocktail, afterlife, afterlife,  and critical acclaim.  If you are new to metal or the band this is a good first buy.  I would also recommend some of their other releases \\"City of Evil\\" and their new album \\"Nightmare\\".
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|A brilliant, darkly funny film, Ernst Lubitsch's comedy about a Polish theatre troop and its efforts to thwart the Nazis was not well received in its day. The film was released in 1942, and a public in the midst of World War II may not have been in the mood to watch a film that made fun of what was, at the time, a real threat.<br /><br />While its initial reception was unfortunate, the film has since been rightly recognized as a classic. 1942 audiences apparently felt that much of the humor was in bad taste. You could argue, however, that trying to be tasteful would have been the wrong approach. Nothing about the Nazis or what they did could be considered good taste. And Lubitsch's humor was grounded in a genuine recognition of the seriousness of the Nazi threat. He mocks the banality of the Nazis, but he never forgets that they are, in fact, genuinely dangerous. The theatre troop (led by Carol Lombard and Jack Benny, both wonderful here) and its antics are farcical and often hilarious, but the filmmakers never forget the real danger that they're in. \\"To Be or Not to Be\\" is a fabulous piece of work.
B00000JR29|5.0|Tears for Fears had had Top 40 chart hits earlier in the 1980s in several countries, including their native Britain, but the group was not heard widely on U.S. airwaves until they released \\"Songs from the Big Chair.\\"  \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Shout\\" both soared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in mid-1985, and \\"Head over Heels\\" nearly accomplished the same feat the following autumn.<br /><br />As great as those three hits were, the rest of the album does not disappoint either--the other five songs, including the brooding \\"I Believe\\" and the otherworldly \\"Listen,\\" are stellar as well.  \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" went platinum in the United States and was one of the best albums of the Eighties.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Not half bad - not half bad at all, though I'd also argue that it's not quite as fantastic as some critics have made it seem.<br /><br />I've been a fan of some incarnations of \\"Trek\\" for a long time, but if the last two films and the last two TV series proved anything, it was that the franchise badly needed fresh blood. This film essentially provides it, allowing younger actors to put a new spin on old characters. They don't disappoint. Quinto makes a solid Spock, Saldana and Pegg a fine Uhura and Scotty, while Urban and Pine excel as Bones and Kirk. The special effects are also top flight, and there is an intermittent but solid sense of humor here. The action also rarely flags.<br /><br />And yet... Yes, there is an \\"and yet.\\" The catch here is that none of this feels particularly fresh or original. Which makes a certain sense, I suppose - \\"Star Trek\\" long ago became a money making franchise for Paramount Pictures, which essentially prevents taking too many creative chances - but I'd be better able to deal with that if it didn't feel like the filmmakers here were constantly trying to pilfer ideas from earlier films in the series, like the revenge-driven \\"Wrath of Khan.\\" If producers can next time retain the good humor but somehow ditch the rehashed concepts and create a few bold new ideas, I'll be happy to get in line for the inevitable sequel.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this for my son and watched it with him.It was acually better than I thought it would be because of the lesson it teaches.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|The best Bond film in quite some time (we're talking years here - possibly decades). The production values are top notch - great locations, handsome cinematography, a solid score - in other words, the hefty budget is clearly displayed on the screen. But then that's not really the surprise (high production values have been pretty consistent ever since Pierce Brosnan's first picture), nor is it the primary reason that this film works.<br /><br />The real reasons are twofold: producers cast Daniel Craig, and they managed to produce a script that nailed the better elements of a traditional Bond film (plenty of action and wit) while stripping the series of any camp and injecting it with a level of genuine emotion usually absent from the series. In this one, I actually cared about Bond as a human being. But credit Craig, at least in part. He brings a physicality and magnetic charisma that have been long absent from the role. Look, I liked Brosnan, but when Craig goes after a bad guy, he makes it believable and unpredictable. And it's been a long time since I could say that about the franchise and its hero.<br /><br />Added bonuses: Judi Dench returns as M, and Eva Greene plays the smartest, most literate heroine outside of Diana Rigg forty years ago. Very good stuff.
B00425S1H8|5.0|This is an excellent product. I purchased it to use with a \\"singing flag\\" at our church for the Freedom Celebration that we do on the 4th. The flag uses dimmer packs that are RS-485, and a box to connect a computer's RS-232 port to them (RS-232 to RS-485 converter). This worked flawlessly. The software for the flag was written for DOS or WIN 3.1; so it's really old, this adapter allowed me to use my WIN 7 laptop. As with any USB device, you should make sure to install the drivers from the CD before you connect the device to the USB port - this is a standard thing with USB, but it did knock off one star on the Ease of use.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|My favorite season of the new series run (up to and including Matt Smith's first season as the Doctor). Things simply seem to gel here - the show is now a well-oiled machine (in the best sense of the term). The writers are firing on all thrusters - there's good humor, adventure, and intelligence present. Even the Sontaran episodes, possibly this season's weakest, are watchable.<br /><br />Tennant is still clearly enjoying the role, and he is now a seasoned pro at conveying the Doctor's wit, wisdom, and zest. And kudos to Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, who reprises her role from the previous year's 'Runaway Bride' and transforms her character from an annoying sidekick into a funny, smart, slightly insecure but honest to God full grown woman and equal partner to the Doctor. She and Tennant have real chemistry, making this (non-romantic) relationship a winner. (And just watch her performance in the finale's final fifteen minutes - nothing short of heart stopping.) An added bonus: this season's one-off episode 'Midnight' is one of the show's most effectively frightening, and possibly one of its best.
0634022296|4.0|Nice but missing one song I really hoped would be in this book. But overall I give it a A+.
B001HUHBAE|5.0|As of 2011, this film is David Fincher's best work as a director. He's always been a master of visual style and had made good films before this pic (I would argue that even his one outright failure - \\"Alien 3\\" - has one or two interesting qualities), but \\"Zodiac\\" marks the first time that he completely, and successfully, combined that serious visual pizzaz with serious material in a fully adult, thoughtful manner. \\"Panic Room\\" and \\"The Game\\" were fun, paranoid thrillers, but that was really all that they were. \\"Fight Club\\" tried to be a satire on the emptiness of modern materialism, but its approach often felt a little too flippant and nihilistic. Only \\"Seven\\" came close to being fully adult, but even it occasionally mistook nihilism for profundity. But then came \\"Zodiac.\\" Although it contains elements of the thriller and pot boiler genres (serial killers, cops, and hard drinking newsmen), Fincher slows the pace down and dares to observe the very real effects that one long-term criminal investigation had on its participants. It's a thoughtful film - morally complex and ambiguous without being ambivalent - with fine performances by the principles and the supporting cast. And though the film is more slowly paced than Fincher's earlier work it isn't even close to being glacial. Great stuff.
B001R88C6I|5.0|This movie is great. When I found out it was available on bluray I ordered it immediately and I couldn't be happier. If you like scifi this is a good story with a good surprise ending. I would highly recomend it.
B000063V8R|5.0|Season 3, or where everything starts to really work. While seasons one and two may have displayed some promise (though I've always felt that the 2nd season displayed much more promise than the woe begotten first), they frequently looked under-budgeted and often felt a bit undercooked. Enter season three: bigger budgets, better scripts, better acting, better costumes, better music - basically, better everything. The writers here have started to fuse the great adventure found in the best Trek episodes with some really solid character development. Picard is more nuanced, Data develops, Crusher makes a welcome return (I always liked her relationship with Picard), and Worf starts to get more of a backstory. Added bonuses: in this season you'll find the all-time Trek classics \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" and \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Pt. 1.\\" But then almost every episode here ranges from solid to stellar. Well worth a watch.
B004PR71JC|5.0|My 5 year-old son and I enjoyed the movie and the music was fantastic, I could not wait to order the soundtrack of the movie...it rocks!  If you have not seen the movie yet or had not yet the chance to listen to the music, do it! It's just positive energy that will help combat the daily stress.
B00337KMAA|3.0|Not a bad film at all, really, but one that I feel was somewhat overrated amidst all the hype and hoopla that it received during the 2010 Oscar push - a fact, I suspect, that was due more to the film's timely topic of unemployment and economic strife than anything else. And yet the script, for all of its timeliness, really doesn't break any new ground plot-wise (it's another middle-age man in crisis set-up) or pry much below the surface of its characters and scenario. But at least the direction is reasonably assured, and the acting is fairly solid. Clooney's performance, while not quite on par with his turn in \\"Michael Clayton,\\" is another in his increasingly solid body of work. Vera Farmiga is just fine, even if her character is a tad underdeveloped. The real scene-stealer here, however, is Anna Kendrick, who practically walks away with the show as Clooney's young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Despite my lukewarm reaction to the pic as a whole, there are a few very memorable scenes. The sequence in which a series of employees are fired is pretty dead-on in it awfulness; and another, more muted scene between Clooney and the sisters that he hasn't seen in years is quietly devastating.
B0058S0OMS|2.0|Despite the involvement of John Carpenter (who REFUSED to direct the film -- he probably knew even he couldn't save it), this film is yet another brainless, run of the mill slasher film. While the first film managed to create suspense, get you involved with the characters, and had an exciting climatic battle, the only thing that saves this sequel from being at the bottom of the barrel is Donald Pleasance.  Since this film takes place immediately after the first film, those with short attention spans won't have to worry about things like a script that tries to build up to the conflict.  But of course the same thing can be said about the dreadful Friday the 13th remake, and I doubt very many people (even those with no attention span) would recommend that turkey.  Instead you get Michael Meyers shambling around killing one stereotypical teen after another.  As Roger Ebert (a fan of the first film notes) this sequel begins the trend in this series of plots that require all the victims to be absolute morons.  With the exception of the original film, Halloween 3 (an underrated film which has nothing to do with Michael Meyers) or the Rob Zombie films (which are highly flawed -- particularly in their running time -- but at least show intelligence, creativity and have great visuals), it is best to avoid any film in the Halloween franchise.  John Carpenter meant for each film to be unique, and for Meyers to never return.  Instead we got stuck with ever increasing suckiness.  I recommend enjoying the original and experience Michael Meyers as the very human but very menacing character he was in the first film instead of the dull, uninteresting, shambling immortal dependent upon stupid, stupid victims the awful sequels turned him into.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Alas, this sequel to 1998's 'Elizabeth' does not match the dramatic heights of its predecessor. While it certainly looks marvelous - the sets, costumes, and cinematography are fine indeed - nothing can make up for a script that lacks real dramatic spark and that too often sidelines its title character. A note to the producers, the director, and to screenwriter Michael Hirst: if you've managed to get Cate Blanchett back in the game as Elizabeth, you'd darn well better make sure that you use her. And when she is on stage, don't reduce Elizabeth's character to that of an insipid, love struck fool. *Sigh.* Any movie that manages to make both the Spanish Armada and Elizabeth Tudor dull (and that defangs Clive Owen to boot) is doing something wrong.

It opened perfectly on the first try, second and third failed, 4th got it and the time I spend on it is worth it. Runs absolutely flawlessly on HTC EVO 3D running at (combined total) 3.4 Ghz.
B000P5FH3K|4.0|Surprisingly fresh and solid - in part because here Coppola finally snapped himself out of what felt like a decades long skid to produce a sharply written, crisply directed flick, and in part because where the other films based on Grisham's books have so often felt dishearteningly pedestrian, this one feels so pleasantly artful.<br /><br />The cinematography and editing, while not flashy, are handsome, and they contribute a welcome autumnal flavor to the film. And the dialogue crackles while the actors clearly seem to relish their roles. DeVito is a lot of fun as the slightly disreputable legal aid with a heart of gold while Voight is at his slimy best. Claire Daines is solid enough, and Damon - in one of his first big roles - displays the confidence and skill that have since made him so good. The rest of the cast is chock full of seasoned (and excellent) character actors and one or two larger names in small but important roles (welcome, Mickey Rourke and Danny Glover). All in all well worth a watch, and the best of the Grisham adaptations.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Once again, Breaking Bad transcends the boundaries of television, at times setting standards that bring it close to those of a feature film. With series 3, matters slowly escalate to take yet more mercurial, twisting turns, until roles are reversed, characters become cyphers and units (be it family, partners or cartels) are either riven apart or brought together as the drama unfolds. We are constantly left hanging on the edge, the tension slow burning its way to yet another unsuspected conclusion. Great acting all round (check out those subtle expressions of Bryan Cranston), beautifully shot, smart and intelligent writing, plus humour as black as pitch. This is platinum viewing, with each series going from strength to strength. An iconic programme that can be filed alongside other greats such as Mad Men, Six Feet Under, Twin Peaks, et al. If, as rumoured, Vince Gilligan is wrapping Breaking Bad at the end of series 5, we have been blessed with television that will remain in the mind's eye for many years to come.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Likely the best of the three Bourne films, \\"Supremacy\\" has as much (if not more) action than the excellent first film while adding layers of plot and (welcome) emotional complexity. Bourne's still suffering from amnesia here and, while recovering his past remains an objective, the writers have added in more than one emotional thread that make Damon's character a bit deeper. As a result, there is a scene toward the end that occurs between Bourne and a teenage girl that is unexpectedly moving.<br /><br />Other bonuses: Damon is strong as ever, taking a minimalist approach that somehow manages to convey both Bourne's emotional self and his taciturn nature. Also, the action itself never flags, and the plot details are nicely complex.<br /><br />There is one warning that I'd give new viewers: director Paul Greengrass utilizes the shaky, hand held camera technique. It's a stylistic choice usually meant to convey the frenetic, gritty nature of the action, and I think it works. But I know some folks can't stand it. So if this style isn't your thing, then you might have a problem getting through this one. But otherwise I'd advise giving this one a shot.
0553582038|2.0|SPOLER FILLED REVIEW**************    I have to say that I am not a fan of fantasy.  I read and enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy in high school but did not even remotely consider the genre again until I stumbled upon the HBO series.  About halfway through the GOT series I ordered all four books and proceeded to enjoy one of the richest and most rewarding tales in recent memory.  I devoured the first three novels in the series, staying up till the wee hours many a times, unable to put the books down.   In spite of the various calamities that befall the Stark clan, the first three books truly grabbed me and immersed me in Martin's world, to the point where I dutifully accepted the death and suffering of the main characters with the expectation and hope that this served the story.      That is until this bizarre fourth installment. Although the writing is consistent with the second and third books, the plotting goes off the King's Road so to speak. We are forced to follow, in excruciating detail, the lives of minor characters only to be rewarded, after finally caring about them, with these characters being killed, maimed and in the sad story of Arya, blinded.  Twice I  put the book down in frustration.  After Brianne's hanging and after Arya is blinded.  I thought I understood Arya's arch; she was to become the warrior/restorer of the house of Stark and Mr. Martin intended for the reader to experience her character's suffering and deconstruction in order to believe an  evolution from tomboyish maiden to cold killer/warrior princess. It is not a pleasant ride and one that I was hopeful would lead to satisfying conclusion. However, my hope for the character vanished with her being blinded.  Blinding  Arya leaves little hope for a character we have followed for thousand's of pages and makes me wonder why was so much time spent on building her up as the potential Daenyrys of the west!  To make matters worse, her chapters are plodding and boring.  Mr. Martin's overindulging and frankly superfluous (to the overall game of thrones) description of Braavos adds further to the drudgery of Arya's chapters.    Brianne's chapter's are even more infuriating.   Why are we brought in so deep into a character and her quest only to have that quest lead absolutely nowhere?  Her story line contributes NOTHING to the overall plot of what is the game of thrones and worst of all, could have easily been bundled and released as a novella (Like the Hedge Knight) it has so little to do with the story. The entire story arch serves no purpose other than to redeem Jaime Lannister, which it accomplished early, and her story should have ended before the whole Oathkeeper storyline begins.  To have to plod through Brianne's chapters only to endure the savage beating and subsequent hanging of this character is truly cruel and unusual punishment by Mr.Martin on his readers.     I am grateful that I didn't have to wait five years for Feast for Crowes.  I read, I endured, I'm confused and disappointed but also hopeful that DWD will set things right.     Why Mr. Martin decided to give us this meandering book instead of focusing on Jon Snow and Stannis, the red queen, Mance Rayder, Daenerys and Tyrion Lannister (and Varys) makes me think that he succumbed to the siren song of the almighty dollar.        This sadly reminds of the television series Lost and the precipitous decline in the story telling and aimless meandering of plot and characters as the producers tried to milk extra years out of a fantastic story.  They padded, profited,  and the series suffered greatly for it.      A Feast for Crows is padding of the Lost kind.

B002N8A14M|5.0|I love this! My sister got one and loved the versatility of it. I use it when I'm out running or at the gym or just the clip by itself to use when I'm doing things inside. The armband is light weight, not too bulky & comfortable to wear. The clear case keeps my iPod protected. It's not cheaply made which is why I think this is a GREAT product and better than other armbands I've purchased in the past. You're basically getting two products for the price of one. GREAT DEAL!! I would definitely recommend this product.
0345440927|5.0|I can not say enough positive things about this book.  I read it when my daughter was 6 weeks old and within days she was sleeping 6-8 hours at night. It was life changing!  This book is all about what is best for baby.  My daughter was happier and more well rested, which meant I was too! A few weeks after reading it, I bought Tracy's other book, which is even more helpful.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I'm absolutely addicted to this show and cannot wait for Season 2 to come out in October (Kirkman says that he thinks it might be better than Season 1), but I wish there were more special features on this DVD set. You'd think they would have packed more of them in this set considering the season was only six episodes long. Deleted scenes would have been nice. Oh well, this DVD set is well worth the money for anyone who is a fan of the show. I've watched each episode numerous times already and have definitely gotten my money's worth. Hopefully the Season 2 set will have more special features.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|This movie let me down.It seemed to drag on forever.Boring and I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died.They could have showed the aliens more than they did.A better alien movie would be skyline.It actually had some characters that you cared about and they showed the aliens alot more and it definitly was more entertaing.
B003UESJIS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Mike Leigh's work.  \\"Another Year\\" represents his third strong outing in a row, following up 2004's [[ASIN:B0007P0YKY Vera Drake]] and 2008's [[ASIN:B001N26GFC Happy-Go-Lucky]].  Like all Leigh films, these three feel so life-like...nothing artificial here.  This is life unfolding as most of us mortals know it.  A lot of that stems from Leigh's unlike way of working: there's no script; the actors get together and work out their characters, their back-stories and their relationships; then, they rehearse (and rehearse and rehearse).  The result: magic.<br /><br />Of the players in this latest piece: Jim Broadbent is great (as ever); Ruth Sheen winning and lovely as his wife; and Oliver Maltman charming and likable as their adult-aged son.  But you have to go to another level to express your admiration for what Lesley Manville does in this film.  How she didn't get an Academy Award nomination is beyond me.  Her performance as Tom and Gerri's friend Mary is astonishingly good.  First, you're put off by her neediness and endless chattering.  Slowly, you start to realize: wait, this is an *amazing* performance.  At times, it's so uncomfortable you want to look away...but you never do.  It just gets too compelling.<br /><br />And, oh, if I were a director, I would put Karina Fernandez in every single one of my movies.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|The way Rick Riordan brings Greek and Roman mythology into the modern world is absolutely brilliant.

He will forever be a favorite.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|I really like this game,  so retro and bad associated, I just love it. Anyone who thinks android doesn't have good games should play this!
B0058P7KUA|2.0|I have the HTC Thunderbolt and the game is not listed on the incompatible list. I even had the game working a couple of times and its awesome. I giving it 2 stars b/c it only worked 2 out of the 25 times I tried to play it.     Needs to be patched.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Like others said, this game might need a phone restart and several attempts at running it to get it to work; at least on an Evo 4G.<br /><br />Once the game runs it's actually amazing. So much fun with great graphics and smooth and responsive controls. Get it if it's compatible with your device. One of the best games out there for sure.
B000003NA4|5.0|I've had this CD for some time now and when I finally got around to thinking about submitting a review (my main focus, as my nick suggests, is \\"oldies\\" music) I was pleased to see so many (148 at this writing) 4- and 5-star reviews, as it underscores my opinion that this Jazz vocalist/pianist legend (she has easily reached that stage) is in a class by herself within that genre. The best comparison I can think of in terms of artists from the past is the inimitable Peggy Lee.<br /><br />But of course, as a reminder of the old adage that you can't possibly please everyone, 18 reviewers give it 3 stars or less, including 6 who feel her effort here is worth just 1 star. Clearly, they don't get Diana Krall. And that's fine, they're entitled to their opinions.<br /><br />In the liner notes, Diana explains in an opening paragraph how she and her producer Tommy LiPunna selected songs that, quite unintentionally, all turned out to be about love and romance, encompassing standards by the likes of the Gershwins, Peggy Lee and husband Dave Barbour, Percy Mayfield, Victor Young, Bing Crosby, Ned Washington, and Harry Warren, among others. That's followed by the lyrics to each selection, and one more page containing a message of thanks to the many people associated with the album.<br /><br />Also included are photographs of Diana, including one of her as a child and another with LiPuma, as well as guitarist Russel Malone and bass player Christian McBride who accompany her on each track. All this is contained in a classy fold-out cardboard jewel case. The sound quality is excellent.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|i wanted to like this game but it would not even get past a black screen. i do not like games that do this so thus i do not like this game. if u dont like it either tell people u dont like it till the dev realizes people dont like his game and fixes it so that we may all like it like i like the game fieldrunners. it is more better than this and so does my friend who has it likes it. common sence cause if he likes it and i like it maybe we should only play games we like and not like the games that dont work like age of zombies. all in all i wanted to like this game but sadly i do not like it. i do not like it so much i will give my g2 to anyone who says they do like it cause if u like it ur on drugs to like a game that only shows a black screen. so if i get an email seeing i like it in the title ill kno u like it and send u my g2 which i actually like more than the g2x. you cant like that phone cause lg made it so it doesnt work. smart guys bravo your a real home run hitter lg. no one likes that phone. we like the g2. anyways get this game if u like black screens. i dont like black screens. i like colorful graphics and good gameplay like the game fieldrunners. my friend says he likes it more than i know. whatever that means.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Cool graphics,  fun power ups.  bloody zombies.   works great on my incredible.  like a robotron smash TV type of game.  one thing i don't  like is that its easy to get stuck on zombies in the middle ofa fight
0446691437|1.0|Others reviewers (specifically, those who thought this book was poor) have already voiced many of my impressions. One point I wanted to make is that it appears to me this book is the embodiment of the very thing it claims to oppose, that is, reading this book is a great way to distract yourself from writing and working while making you feel and think you're being pro-active!<br /><br />Assuming \\"Resistance\\" as it's portrayed by the author is so, he's employed a beautifully ironic vehicle to sabotage you, because you'll read this and feel like you're getting somewhere, but because the meat of this book's matter is metaphor, subjective personal experience (as opposed to controlled and applied study), and button-pushing, manipulative rhetoric (like a New Age guru, sports coach, etc.) and is lacking in practical, clear methods in which to improve your writing, I cannot believe many of the people here who claim this book helped them were helped longer than maybe the week after they read it; I would be curious to know.<br /><br />One thing is for certain, the reviewers here who are engaged in heated back-and-forths in defense of this book strike me as proof that the book has failed them - after all, if it was as powerful and helpful as they claim, why are they spending so much time being distracted by the Amazon website and not writing on their projects? :D<br /><br />I bought this book for practical help on ways to navigate my way through occasional periods of writer's block, and for some good old fashioned inspiration. What I got was, for me, a lot of smoke and mirrors. A very typical New Age type of pomp and circumstance that many people respond to, but I personally find indulgent.<br /><br />If you're like me and looking for practical, specific methods with which to grow stronger as a writer, I do not recommend this book. If you watch a movie like \\"What the Bleep Do We Know?!\\" and feel like you've really seen something profound, buy this book today - it's perfect for you!
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|The 3D is fair, but there is much better 3D stuff out there.  The story was so horrible I was barely able to finish the movie and wanted to stop part way through hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  It has such a preachy, environmental water conservation message that is constantly bombarding you. I sold it to the local used video/dvd store for $4 and I was glad to get that much but feel sorry for the poor schmuck that ends up buying it next.  Now I want my time back.  Save your money for a real 3D flick.
B0012Q732O|5.0|Is there anything more tiresome that the jaded, know-it-all e-critic? Sure, one-star reviewers, you've seen it ALL before (or at least get all the references, homages and rip-off thanks to Google) and you could do so much better...    Give it a rest.    This is not intended to be Casablanca, the Godfather, or Schindler's List. This is a popcorn movie, and it should be reviewed as such. Perspective, people. If you want multidimensional characters and a deep meaty story, go read A Song of Fire and Ice. If you want a fun escape on a Friday night after a long working week, this is your movie.    As for my review, I'll keep it short and sweet. Beautiful vistas, unwilling heroes, GREAT action set pieces, some good CGI and some nasty villains. What more do you need from an A-class trash masterpiece like this?  And as a lover of trash movies, I use that word as a compliment.    Five stars, for this genre. If you enjoy silly trash like One Million Years BC or 1960's The Time Machine, you'll probably get a kick out of this. Just remember, it's only a story, it's not intended to be real.    And thank you, Roland Emmerich, for making such great escapist trash, from Stargate to 2012. All of Emmerich's movies are absurd, ridiculous junk, and all of them are as entertaining as hell. They make me feel like I'm 12 years old again and watching a great Saturday matinee - and that's quite a feat, because 12 years old was a long time ago.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|I have watched this movie a few times with my kids and I think it's hilarious! Some of these people who gave bad reviews should just lighten up!! It's a silly movie with no deep, dark themes, something you can relax to and laugh about. I thought Brendan Fraser was great as the dad. I would love to watch this again with my kids, any time!
B0058P7KUA|1.0|I finally got it to play after countless reboots and force closes. Would be fun if they ever fix it. Trash as it is. Do not waist your time.
1416596585|5.0|If you are working in/with technology, buy and read 'In the Plex'. It will show you 'natural evolution' of a single strong idea blooming into a techno-bazaar. Just like evolution of life went through some extinctions, often inexplicable with available knowledge - Google's journey from infancy to teenage has also been rocked every now and then. Steven Levy masterfully crafts an captivating narrative that goes through 4P's of Google - People, Processes, Products and Protests against it. Deep insights about each of the P's are interspersed within an objective tale. What differentiates 'In The Plex' from earlier books (Googled; Search etc) is Mr. Levy's intense focus on people and characters. Software, like other intellectual media, is ultimately a reflection of creators' personality. e.g., the fact Google home page has minimal artifacts could perhaps be traced back to the founders' engineering core that strips away all unnecessary details and focuses on the solution. Many executives, especially engineers behind various products were profiled to show the consistency and imbuement of engineering-driven culture that the founders weaved around.    Some highlights from the book -    1) Before Google, search was mostly about 'throwing massive silicon toward the problem and hope for the best'.    2) Relevance is not a machine language attribute. It lies in the eye of beholder. Levy masterfully narrates the fiasco in searching Chinese language. As users started entering less number of key-strokes, the algorithm that worked so well in US faltered. The results produced were mostly risque.    3) Larry Page himself Okays each new employee before an offer is extended. Levy's book ends when Google had 24,000 employees. Larry Page wanted Google to have 1M employees.     4) Google usually asks for SAT scores from job applicants.    5) OKR - Objectives and Key Results is a key management tool in Google. It leads employees to set measurable and optimum targets. A bad example is 'I willimprove search in next quarter'. A good example would be 'I will improve average search page performance by 100 ms next quarter'. OKRs are cascaded from individual to team to department levels. The sweet spot is 0.7 to 0.8 of OKR target. Exceeding OKR may mean one has 'sandbagged' it.     6) Larry Page cares about latency at his core. Rather, he hates latency and always consciously tries to remove it 'like Lady Macbeth washing guilt off her hands'.  'If your product could be measured in seconds, you'd already failed'. Performance is a feature. Page's law dictates software slows down 2x every 18 months. Google's war room like 'Code Yellow' to tackle product performance should be a mandatory case study for all technology leaders.     A OKR for performance was measured in human lives. e.g., A human life is measured in 2B seconds. If a product has 100M users and is 4 sec slower for everyone each day, it is equivalent to 100 people killed a year! Now, try to live with that in your conscience if you are a developer ;-) To save the situation, Google has introduced 'Cap and Trade' for wasted performance. You can 'trade' 10 'lives' from another team that may have lived well within its target latency.    8) In data centers you can save about 20% just by raising the thermostat from 68 to 80 degrees. No issue with life here, unlike we just saw with bad performance.    9) At one point, one of the founders (guess who?) argued there should be no landlines in the company. The other one gave an idea to the author to release a chapter of this book at a time.    10) As of August 2010, there were about 130M different books published in the world in all languages.
B00000ICD9|4.0|Ok I think my main point would be here is wake up people.  To all of those people who are angry because they feel the movie did not live up to their expectations of what they thought heaven to  be, hello this is one mans view of what heaven would be like for him, ok.  This movie is not saying to everyone this is heaven.  I like a lot of the parts of this movie. There were also parts I did not like.   I would like to believe that heaven for me is an environment I could create and spend eternity in peace and happiness.  That is what I and I mean I would like.  However if someones idea of heaven is living with God looking over your shoulder or angels all around them,  or ghosts flying around, etc you get my point, then I say great.  However that is not my view of what I want heaven to be for me.  Again people are not open minded enough to look and say hey it is okay your opinion is different than mind that is what makes this world interesting that we all are different and have different beliefs.  I love the idea of a person that is willing to risk their happiness just to be with the one they love because they do not want them to be alone.  Even if they do not remember them.  So very few people have what it takes to be self sacrifing. That is one of the thing I took away from the movie as well as the strong emotion of love.  Neverending loves that trancends time and space and nothing can stop it. That is one of the things that I took away from the movie.
015603252X|2.0|I love reading about all things Jewish and Israeli so when I picked this up at Barnes and Noble I was excited...until I opened it up.  I couldn't for the life of me get into it.  This book seriously won an award?  After several times of picking it up and getting bored, I sold it to a used book shop. Sad!
1594744769|5.0|Excellent fantasy read...<br />Take a world war, a home for orphans, a peculiar guardian, and a bent fantasy that will tweak your imagination and you have this book.  Not only will you not want to put it down, but you will keep thinking about it long after the last page is read.  The photos in this book will inspire you to look again at your own old stacks of photos.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is fantasy at its finest!  5* of 5*

B004478GN8|5.0|I bought this toy for my eight year old brother. He was amazed how cool the decals printing on each lego was. He said that this are hard to get for a low reasonable price because Jango Fett bounty guys were hard to get under 80$. He also said that the weapons and speeder that came with it were really cool he would've never thought of it. this toy was overall the best lego he got in his life.
142311339X|2.0|I read percy jackson and the olympians and I loved it. Then my friend recomended The Heroes of Olympis.   I don't like it. The first series was a really good series to read. But It should of just ended there, no spin-off series like this one.   I only got half way through this book then I just stopped. I cant read another word, I've lost interest. Mostly because, the characters are plain, the story line seems like a over-crazed fan wrote it, and the story is just a rip off of the first series.   Im sorry Rick Riordan... even though it pains me to say this (not really)...  but it sucks.
B000F1IQN2|1.0|the movie is an account of Israel's mission to assassinate those who masterminded the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics<br />the Palestinians were all authentic historical figures but the 5 Israeli agent squad was fictitious...<br /><br />the first part of the movie was really good with accurate representation of history...the terrorists broke into Olympic Village and killed unarmed Israeli athletes.<br /><br />in the second half of the movie, Spielberg went into his personal journey, asking whether Israel's counter terror effort is justifiable and lamented it did not stop terrorism...Spielberg could have done so much more with this material yet he chose to do a spin on his liberal moral code of conduct.  A lot of the material covered in this movie deserves great deal of exploration but this movie totally failed.<br /><br />i like the book by Fred Burton \\"Chasing Shadows\\" which covers this topic in more detailed and factually.

B0055FR5PS|5.0|A good movie about Marines that isn't filled with unfair or cheap shots.  Aliens are not depicted as American Indians fighting the noble fight.  No, this is just kill them before they kill us movie.  The kind of movie that is 5 years overdue about Iraq and fighting terrorists, but Hollywood cannot and will not make.  This will have to do and I enjoyed it.
B004XWMXX8|2.0|On this album's liner notes, Selena Gomez begins her \\"thanks!\\" with \\"My Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Your light is what keeps me on Your path.  Forever.\\"  And yet she seems to have lost the path, singing songs with sexual undertones and using profanity.  The purity which has always been part of her charm seems lost here.  In strictly aesthetic terms, this album is inferior to her first two, being less textured, less concrete and even more cliched (both lyrically and musically).  On the whole, it is only for the die-hard SG fan.
B004Q3RKH8|5.0|I hated this when it 1st came out. Now... I'm shocked by how good it really is. It has aged well
B004QSQMKE|1.0|This DVD is only the \\"director's cut\\" version of the film, so please don't be misled into thinking that this is the wonderful film you remember watching. This is that wonderful film re-edited and filled to the brim with awful music. If you can make it through Mia Sara's singing without hitting the fast forward button, you have a far stronger constitution than I do. It is cringe inducing. Save yourself the discomfort, and make sure you get the theatrical version instead. For the record, I like many of Ridley Scott's films but I just don't know what his \\"vision\\" was for this one. It's just bad.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|As an adult I don't generally make a habit of watching animated movies, but the Ice Age series is an exception. Well-written, lots of humor and action and not too syrupy. No inappropriate double-entendres, so great for the whole family without worrying about embarrasing questions from the little ones. The Blue-ray on my 47\\" screen is also awesome.
1936719118|5.0|This is by far the best book that I have read all year. I am a multiple business owner, have seen some success and some failure over the past 30 years. I am beginning a new project this month and look forward to applying the sense offered by Derek.<br /><br />What I appreciate so much about this book is that it is frank, practical, and useful.<br /><br />Derek offers a kind of compassionate rational capitalism / business sense that cuts through all of the double-speak, corporate BS and the \\"build to sell\\" mentality that has created vast wealth, empty lives, and has produced rotten thinking throughout the business world.<br /><br />Bravo to Derek and the Domino Project.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|You have to start by taking the Scandanavian split-brain seriously: they absolutely don't believe in trolls, unless they do. Once you wrap your mind around both sides of the dichotomy, this movie offers a drily humorous look at the logical result: a shadowy government agency for troll control, dedicated to letting the population continue in their disbelief.<br /><br />This has a [[ASIN:B00001QGUM Blair Witch]] feel about it, a college video project that somehow latches onto the coverup - and onto what it covers up. The earnest amateurishness of the video team comes through beautifully, right down to the microphone lady who's there to do her job even when she's scared out of her boots. The absurdity of the whole venture, hunting down and eliminating trolls who escape their reservations, gives plenty to work with. There's that vet, for example, who understands the need to put down these giant animals when they threaten people, but wishes it could be done more humanely. Then there's the ever-present pong of troll stench.<br /><br />The straight-faced humor in this amazing treat brings to mind Rare Exports, another droll troll flick from Northern Europe, but with a very different angle. Is this some kind of movie genre I never heard of before? If so, that genre has a new fan.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B004QL7K8O|5.0|Hillbillies have never been funnier than in \\"Tucker and Dale vs Evil\\". Ok...maybe they have been but you'd be hard pressed to find an instance.  This is an extremely cleverly written and well shot movie that shows how funny and out of control simple misunderstandings can become. High five to writers Morgan Jurgenson and Eli Craig (Craig also directed and makes a cameo as a news cameraman)<br /><br />  Best friends Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and Dale (Tyler Labine) finally realize their dream of buying a vacation cabin in the backwoods of West Virginia, so they head up to relax and do some fishing. On the way up they bump into a group of college kids at a gas station also heading up to the lake for some partying fun. Right from the get-go the hilarity starts as Dale tries to talk to one of the girls who gets frightened by his hillbilly appearance and the large sickle he carries over as a walking stick. As the movie progresses Tucker and Dale are fishing at night while nearby the college kids are skinny-dipping.  One of the girls Allison (Katrina Bowden) falls of a rock and nearly drowns if not for the heroic efforts of Tucker and Dale. Unfortunately the kids only see them dragging her onto their boat and believe they are kidnapping her. The movie kicks into high gear as a series of misunderstandings and accidental deaths keep you wondering what will happen next!<br /><br />  The special effects and gore were really well done on this one and the music score was spot on creating a wonderful feel to the movie. Great acting all around with some really memorable characters.  If you're looking for a well written, funny movie then I highly recommend \\"Tucker and Dale vs Evil\\"<br /><br />This review originally posted at scaredstiffreviews website
B003YBNREI|5.0|I've never written a review on things I've bought, so this is my first, I felt it was very justified.    I purchased the CD after I bought tickets to their concert. I was and still am amazed at the quality and volume this CD or should say music has. They have truly given their all and as the Bio says on their website, have been able to do it as they really wanted. It does do the music justice. If you like The Doobie Bros, this one is a must have, you won't be sorry.
030746363X|1.0|I went on this diet for a month, I was strict and kept to all the rules, only exception, I did not take the supplements. I did not lose any weight. In fact, after I went back to my regular diet, I put on even more weight.   This diet is not for everyone. The best diet I have ever been on is a yeast-free diet, which is essentially zero sugar and whole foods. I was able to consume large meals and I had a flat stomach, I also did pilates. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Let me start by saying that I had to run the game a second time. I hope they make an hd version with scalable graphics. It didn't bother me much as I'm immersed in the gameplay and witty, quirky dialog. Threw concept is simple. Run around and shoot zombies. You can also collect power ups to make your frag fest easier, the most devastating being the sentry gun. Set it and forget it. That thing can single-handedly destroy 200 zombies or cripple a boss if placed correctly. The sentry gun makes the game too easy sometimes since it can't be destroyed. The campaign type mode can be longer, and it would benefit from a wider array of zombies. Overall the game gets good marks for playability. It loses a bit for lack of replay value.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|\\"Super 8\\" has lots of great parts to it: nerdy kids pursuing their passion, budding young love, government conspiracies, and a pretty cool monster, left just shadowy enough to engage the viewer's imagination. Given the potential of these ingredients, I'm not sure why it didn't do more for me.<br /><br />Maybe part of it was the navel-gazing aspect of a movie made about tweenage movie-makers, as if someone was trying to write an autobiography the way it should have been. Maybe it was the triteness of anthropophagy - as if earthly proteins would do anything for a visitor from elsewhere. Maybe ... well it doesn't matter.

B004T0XYKK|5.0|Rio Lobo is a Classic John Wayne film set during the last days of the Civil War and beyond. A group of Confederate Soldiers hyjack a Union Gold Train that the Duke's group of Union Soldiers are guarding. The Duke knows this is an inside job, with information being provided by a Union Traitor. After capturing some of the Confederate Soldiers involved, he learns a small amount of information about the Traitor and upon helping the Soldiers after they are being released from a Union prision, they agree to keep in touch with the Duke after the war, and to notify him if they should happen to come across the Traitor again (they never knew his name only what he looked like). Chris Mitchum's character moves back to his home town or Rio Lobo, Texas and low and behold the Traitor turns up there trying to force everyone off their land and taking it over for his self. Mitchum gets word to the Duke and the fun begins. This movie has a great cast, including Chris Mitchum (Robert Michum's son), Victor French (Little House on the Parrie), and Jack Elam as Chris's crusty old father. It's the Duke at his best and it is well worth the watch. I highly recommend it.
B004EPZ084|4.0|There have been quite a few R-rated comedies this year, but they've all left something to be desired. Your Highness collapsed under being nothing but improvised toilet humor, The Hangover Part II was a complete rehash of the original, Hall Pass was just a disappointing attempt by the Farrelly brothers, and Bad Teacher was too tame to really be called \\"bad\\" at all. Paul and Bridesmaids were both pretty decent, but Paul wasn't nearly as good as the movies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost collaborated with Edgar Wright on and Bridesmaids pretty much played out like every other Judd Apatow movie out there. It was beginning to feel like every R-rated comedy from here on out would be so similar to everything before it that the laughs it tried to provide wouldn't be very funny at all. Thankfully, Horrible Bosses came along to prove that theory wrong.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Horrible Bosses kind of follows the same formula as The Hangover; three guys getting themselves into a really terrible situation but roofies are replaced with a crazy scheme to kill their bosses. The funniest aspect of the movie lies within three guys, Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day), and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), obviously having no idea what they're getting themselves into and dealing with the situation in the worst way imaginable. Things get really crazy really fast and only get more hectic as the movie jogs along. That's essentially the movie's charm. While the formulas to the two movies are similar, Horrible Bosses does seem to offer quite a bit more than The Hangover.<br /><br />The cast may be the strongest factor of the movie though as nearly everybody involved makes the most of their screen time and manages to get a laugh or two in no matter if they're a recognized name or a new face. Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, and Jennifer Aniston play the three bosses and they're all fantastic in their roles. Spacey just goes out of his way to be the most despicable person anyone could really come across while Farrell, despite being selfish and greedy, still manages to toss in a few pretty hysterical one-liners. Aniston will probably be the one that sticks out the most since she makes the biggest impact by being rather forward with her sexual desires for Dale. It's just such a different role from what Aniston has played in the past. The chemistry between Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis is really spot-on, as well. Their conversations, fighting amongst each other and interactions just make you really believe that these three have known each other for years. Even though his role is a little small, Jamie Foxx deserves a mention as well. Dean Jones turns out to just be a really entertaining character overall.<br /><br />It's difficult to point out any sort of problems this comedy really has, if there are any at all. The film is extremely vulgar, but doesn't really feel entirely too crude or include any gross out gags like many R-rated comedies seem to fall victim to. None of the cast drags the movie down as they all do their part to drive the movie forward. I feel like it won't be as successful as some would think though and will be overshadowed by other comedies that aren't nearly as solid or as funny as Horrible Bosses is. That's really the only complaint anyone could possibly have.<br /><br />Horrible Bosses is easily the most hilarious R-rated comedy of the summer. The strong cast, amusing dialogue, and entertaining banter between Nick, Dale, and Kurt is more than enough to sky rocket Horrible Bosses to the top of the list of comedies released this year. Charlie Day will have you laughing right from the start.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey delivered with this book. By the second or third page, I was laughing hysterically. It is well-written, thoughtful and full of her bone dry sense of humor. I've actually read it twice now and that is rare for me. I do hope she writes more in the future.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|This game just sent me to a black screen on evo 3d.  I redownloaded and cleared data and still nothing.  If the devs can't make the game run on popular new phones then they shouldn't release the game till they get it right!<br /><br />As for the person who said we shouldn't rate the game low...  I am rating based on my experiance with the game...  If it works fine for you rate accordingly!
B0058P7KUA|3.0|I am rating this app three stars because I don't know if it's good or bad. I now know that this app will not open on Evo Shift 4G. I know most people would rate it one star for the same reason, but it's not a terrible app... Tablet users, refer to other reviews.

0345529057|1.0|I would like to say first that I love this series of books.  In fact I love it so much that I wanted to re-read them before the 5th book came out so I ordered them from Amazon.  Unfortunately publishing companies have started using crappy glue the past few years.  While reading the second book it literally fell apart in my hands.  The book is now in several sections and I'm nervous to even read the next two.  I'm sure the same would have happened with the first one but I may have cheated and watched the series.  If you are interested in reading these books DO NOT order them in this pack.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Charles Ferguson has done a great public service by putting together this documentary that lays bare at least some of the truth behind the global financial crisis of 2008. Narrated by Matt Damon, it is seamlessly crafted, moving from the story of Iceland, through interviews and clips from politicians, academics, bankers, pundits and even a psychotherapist. Little Iceland is a sober and telling object lesson. Iceland was like a controlled laboratory experiment for what happens to a stable economy, where the only variable you introduce is financial deregulation. It had been a model of progressive social and environmental practice and internal harmony until the deregulation of the formerly state-controlled financial sector. The move unleashed an unprecedented credit boom and helped to create a business elite that went on a multi-billion dollar spending spree with borrowed money. It ended in the collapse of the banking sector, bringing the Icelandic economy to its knees.<br /><br />You don't know whether to be more outraged by: the callousness of the perpetrators and those who enabled them - including regulators, rating agencies, lobbyists, politicians, and academics; the undeserved billions in compensation they milked from the failing institutions and have not been asked to return; or the fact that they remain in power, Obama's campaign promises to change the system notwithstanding. The European Union, has passed regulations limiting the bonus culture, but the US refused to join. Virtually no one has been brought to trial, and hardly even brought to task. Sure we saw scenes from some of the senate hearings, but they were effectively just raps on the knuckle while business and bonuses continue as usual, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.<br /><br />The good news is that the events of this economic debacle could finally open the public's eyes to the truth and consequences of dualistic thinking where individuals, in this case those in the political-financial establishment, to see themselves as apart from (and more deserving than) the collective. These people could reasonably be considered psychopaths who feel no shame or responsibility for their actions unless they get caught, in which case they either lie or offer a few sacrificial lambs to appease public opinion. Unfortunately they are the product of a wider culture that sees nothing wrong with succeeding at the expense of others, and believing that the ends-justify-the-means, and the means - fair or unfair - don't matter...only winning matters.<br /><br />This film is a prime example of the growing new consciousness, and brave and intelligent people like Charles Ferguson are no longer prepared to remain silent and helpless. They are speaking out and calling for change - fundamental change in how we do business, how we set our priorities, and how we hold accountable those to whom we have entrusted our wellbeing and our future.<br />Today 1% of the population holds 90% of the wealth. Unless you think that's fine and the way it should be, watch \\"Inside Job.\\" It could be the spark that inflames enough people to take action. As Matt Damon says at the end of the film, \\"The financial industry turned its back on society, corrupted our political system and plunged the world economy into crisis... but the men and institutions that caused the crisis are still in power and that needs to change...It won't be easy, but some things are worth fighting for.\\"<br />Spread the word and let's use our collective power to change the tide.lves as apart from (and more deserving than) the collective.

0375842209|5.0|I LOVED this book I was soo bumbed when it ended . so brilliantly the author, markus kussak takes us into the life of liesel meminger from the moment her stuborn ways are revealed when she refuses to step into her new foster parents car untill she refuses to pull away from max ( the Jew that they hide) when soilders are taking him away. you will love this book and read it slowly so it will not end. I believe that it is a book to be passed around from friend to friend . it is a ww2 classic in literature. if you love ww2 you will fall in love with this markus kussak classic!
B0041KKYDI|3.0|This is an interesting movie to watch a person finding himself in a predicament of life or death.  For a person in his position, there are very few options available, but cutting your arm off?  Sounds far fetched, but the fact is that this indeed happened.  I remember the time that this was in the news.<br /><br />This brings me to the problem with this movie.  From the beginning, I knew what was to happen.  No surprises at all.<br /><br />Of course it would be super boring to make a movie about just one single person caught in a canyon.  That explains why there are so many flashbacks.  Just think how this movie would look like without any flashbacks.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Regardless of what others said, Liam Neeson did a great job of portraying a man on a mission suffering memory loss after an accident. Who am I was the question that formed the theme of this story. It left viewers wondering if he'd ever be able to tell who was on his side or not? Where was he going to get help from and was he able to trust them ? What constitutes a friend the amount of time you have known them or if they are there for you when you need them ? I enjoyed this film.
0141044179|5.0|One of the best novels I've read in years. Brilliant and touching and completely nails the human experience.     Also, as a bonus, an astonishing and slightly sly riff on a long-lived British genre of fiction: the \\"here's a life long story told by a male narrator.\\" Think DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME, by Anthony Powell, except a 20th century version written in the 21st century.     Brilliant. How does Boyd manage to pull this stuff off? Truly an amazingly talented writer. One of my favorites.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Playing it on my transformer.  Works well.  No crashes I've read about.  Super cheesy dialog.  Game play is good.  Thumbs are getting sore!  OK shooter, but gets boring fast and controls take a while to get used to.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Pride and prejudice is one of my favorite movies I watch it over and over again. I do the same with the soundtrack.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I've been blessed to miss war in my lifetime, but after watching this film you walk away praying for more peace.  That young gun ho kid, can't believe Marines were like that, trigger happy?, I mean many of the scenes showed GI's using their field knife to pull out Japanese teeth like it was some medieval prize, I don't see any honor in that. I was expecting a film, like many before it, about bravery, honor, and protecting the helpless. Instead, the film makers painted a picture of monsters.    The ending fit extremely well with someone who has a guilty conscious... PTSD?    The only reason I gave it 3 stars is due to the fact they had a great intro.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|I have been a Nike Pegasus fan for the past 8 years and didn't realize what I was missing until I switched to the Brooks Adrenaline.

0071762345|4.0|I met the author, Dave Kerpen, in 2007 at the first WOMMA Summit (Word of Mouth Marketing Association) that I attended. I knew from the start that Dave would be a key influencer of my education in social engagement and a valuable resource for \\"how to\\" information that is based on real life case studies and experiences. At the time, I didn't know that I would become the Board President of WOMMA or that he would become an author and thought leader on the effective use of Facebook (as well as Twitter, You Tube and more). Since that time, Dave and I have come to be good friends, colleagues, and benefactors of each others shared experiences.     In \\"Likeable Media\\" Dave gives freely of his experience and drives home the point that consumers are increasingly responsible for the success or failure of brands by what they like and what they say about our brands. Dave has filled his first book with entertaining and interesting case studies and anecdotes that make the 18 lessons easy to understand and apply. It's an ideal book for those that are just getting started, as well as semi-seasoned veterans who are looking for an edge to move them forward in ways that engage and leverage existing and new relationships. Dave is the master of \\"Likeability\\" and he shares his insights in a way that is both easy to understand and apply. I found myself noting several opportunities for our business, a northwest regional insurance company, to incorporate Dave's tips in several ways that will increase our fan base, our edge rank, and the number of \\"likes\\" that we generate.     I've already passed my copy (which still needs to be autographed by the way) along to a college student that I've helped to mentor over the past year. She'll learn more from this book in a few hours than she could possibly learn in her classes over the next year.     The only criticism that I have for the book is that there were numerous references to the agency that Dave owns and operates... so much so that I started feeling as if I was reading corporate collateral for Likeable Media (the agency). If you are able to look past those repetitive mentions and the reference to his clients, you will come away with a wealth of information that is actionable and very beneficial. Dave gives away in his book what many consultants try to sell at a premium.     Thanks Dave. And congratulations!     NOTE: The opinions offered in this review are my own and do not reflect the views of WOMMA or my employer.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|To begin, I will admit that I was never the biggest Limp Bizkit fan by any means but that said I also did like some of their music. The band's new album Gold Cobra has been receiving both praises and hate but that was to be expected since the band has always received very mixed reactions. But that's the good thing about Limp Bizkit, they couldn't care less if you hated them as long as you're talking about them it's all that counts. With Gold Cobra, some things remain familiar and some things have changed.  There's still as much anger and frustration as there is on any other Bizkit album and the sound is instantly familiar, the prime example here being \\"Douchebag\\". There are some songs that display the same youthful attitude and energy of older Bizkit albums but this one also shows certain maturity with songs like \\"Walking Away\\" that you would not expect from a band like Limp Bizkit. That's actually not a bad thing if you ask me. It's also great to have Wes Borland back in the band and I feel that he does a great job here, providing some killer riffs.<br /><br />\\"Bring It Back\\" really brings it back, the trademark Rap/Metal mixture sound, Fred Durst's vocal style and the feel of the song is very reminiscent of the Bizkit of old as if to say \\"We're back\\". \\"Gold Cobra\\" doesn't do it for me, the track doesn't really go anywhere and the chorus is just a bore. \\"Walking Away\\" was the most surprising track here for me; it's a slow and melodic song that has very passionate and heartfelt lyric. The breakdown with Fred screaming and all was everything that made the band a success in the first place. \\"Loser\\" is in the same vein, it's a slower paced song that shows a more personal side. \\"Douchebag\\" is one of the best tracks here as it captures the Bizkit of old. Durst even said they were pushing for \\"Douchebag\\" to be the first single. There are also moments on the album like \\"Autotunage\\" that don't have an impact and aren't anything special and prove to be less effective.<br /><br />Bizkit made a good effort to make an album that's true to their style and that picks up right where they left with their last album. You can sense that the band is trying to please the fans with this one and truly wants to make a comeback. This new album should please the fans of the band but the truth is that there are also plenty of Bizkit's original fanbase who have outgrown the band's music. Gold Cobra is a success in that it's a good album that's true to the band's sound and belongs next the other Limp Bizkit albums.If you don't enjoy Gold Gobra then you have to ask yourself what you really expected out of a Limp Bizkit album. I don't think Golden Cobra is spectacular or anything that's why I'm giving it 3/5 stars, because it' s a decent effort from the band and sets them on the right track, it's a comeback album done well.a good effort to make an album that's true to their style and that picks up right where they left with their last album.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This movie was romantic and captivating. as you enter the world of the bennet sisters you soon find yourself captivated by the adoring scenery. I love many BBC productions, but this version of pride and prejudice blows bbc version out of the water. the music to is so divine. i would strongly sugest the soundtrackto this film. you will surely love all of the characters unique traits that jane austen has so beautifully created. from mr.darcys pridefull ways to mrs. bennets poor nerves , no matter how many times you watch this movie you will continue to be entertained.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|Great knife. Nice size grip for my large hands. Sheath was good, great tension to hold the knife in but it does rattle a bit. The San Mai steel is incredibly strong and is really nice looking as well. I was surprised that it was not super sharp out of the box like my SOG NW Ranger 2. This knife is bigger, with a thick beefy blade compared to the SOG, but it is also heavier. If I was going out camping for more than a weekend I would choose this knife, but for short trips or for hiking it would definitely be my SOG NW Ranger 2. Both are superb knifes that perform a multitude of tasks flawlessly and can stand up to any practical task.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game for 10-15 spurts when I'm waiting in line or have to kill some time.  I like arcade mode the best.  The graphics are high quality, and the game control has a good mix between precision and difficulty.  Kids love this game too!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I adored this book. Yes, it's a little uneven (some characters are definitely more engaging than others), and yes, it does falter a little toward the end. But in a book of this scope I'm not sure you could expect any more. Seriously one of my favourite books of the last couple of years.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This is quite possibly my absolute most favorite game on Android so far! And I have a lot! This game is funny, has good graphics, runs seemlessly, and is an all around barrel of zombie-killing goodness. I am so happy this made it as the app of the day, though I would gladly pay $5 for it! Bravo, developer. Bravo.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|This certainly is not what you are use to with Eddie but he takes you on a unique journey of heartache in his new album Ukulele songs.  The first part of the album is his work and the last is him singing older songs.  Of coarse heartache is sad so the feeling is down and depressing but the sound is very different with the music and the use of the ukulele.  You could either like or hate, I think it is a hard one to peg especially since he did something so different before.  Certainly listen to samples before you purchase the cd so you don't get a surprise and expect something else when you press play!

B004132HZS|5.0|Was convinced I wasn't going to like this series - I mean, the idea of a modern-day Sherlock Holmes? Was so pleasantly surprised. Became the best short drama series on TV for me. Superbly written by Moffat and Gattis, wonderfully acted by Cumberbatch and Freeman, the whole piece feels like Conan Doyle wrote his books with this pair in mind - which, when you think about it, should be absurd as they are separated by almost a century!! How smart of Moffat and Gattis, therefore, to recognise that it isn't the fogs and the deer-stalker and other familiar props that make Holmes the most popular of all fictional icons, but the brilliant deductions of his logical mind in tandem with a remarkable trust and friendship with Watson despite their apposite personalities. Spot on. Can't wait for season 2 this Autumn - hints we will be taken to the Reichenbach Falls in the final episode of this season. As a footnote, I really like Andrew Scott as Moriaty - a young nemesis for Holmes instead of the more crusty, grey-haired examples that originated in the original illustrations and which became the norm for Hollywood productions and those that followed.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Forget the critics, Sucker Punch was amazing, great story though its surprisingly sad,tragic, and depressing, great characters as well as action, soundtrack for this movie and the film itself is one of my all time favorites, I guess the people that bash this film don't pay attention worth jack, expected an action film,  or are just plain dumb :/

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I watched this HBO series after watching Band of Brothers.  Most people I talked to said that Band of Brothers was better.  I couldn't disagree more.  I thought that the Pacific was written much better, the characters were much better and more fully developed, and there was less of a focus on the action scenes. If you're into the chaotic battle scenes, you'll probably like Band of Brothers more than the Pacific. If you're into good story telling and acting, this is the one for you.

B001K3ENEA|4.0|These headphones have good sound clarity for the price. As a woman, they are actually still a little tall for my head even with the plastic pieces that hold the elastic headband pushed all the way down on either side. I do like the fact that I can wear my glasses with them sometimes without having them mashed into the sides of my head. I definitely never forget I'm wearing these headphones though because they gently squeeze my head, but they're still pretty comfortable as far as closed back headphones go. I guess this is a problem with all headphones that cover your ears fully and are made of \\"leatherette,\\" but these sometimes make my head sweaty (especially when it's hot in the house). I just cut up an old t-shirt and made little covers for each earphone which works fine. These covers did not muffle the sound and in fact, I think they kind of soften the little hiss that you sometimes hear when listening to certain things at high volume (e.g. low quality concert recordings).     I have used these headphones with my computer, stereo, and to listen to DVDs. In order to have volume control while watching DVDs, I actually have these headphones run through an old Rolls mini-amp and an inexpensive headphone volume controller from RadioShack and they still sound pretty good. The sound is a little tinny on just voices hooked up this way, but the bass still sounds great with music. These headphones come with the 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter which is nice. Overall, I think these are a great value for the price and a little more comfortable than several closed back pairs I've tried of a similar price. I actually bought these at my local GuitarCenter where they were $50, so I wish I had purchased them off Amazon for $40, but overall I'm pleased with what I got for the price.
B003K1EYM6|2.0|Simplest of connectors, probably cost 25¢ to manufacture. Apple price? 35 bucks. That aside, the things you would think a USB connector should do often don't. No file transfer, no movie transfer except from apple-format files. Camera chip slot didn't work for my Sony cam at all.  And there's precious little info from Apple on how to address those shortcomings. Audio hookups worked fine for non-apple gear. Anything else is a bit of a crapshoot.
B002L5GQGY|1.0|Just to let you know I've always trusted products I receive from Amazon but this cd I just bought won't play in 3 different players. After looking at the cd's they appear to be blank, nothing is written to them at all. Oh well I really did want to listen to Joe Bonamassa.

0395925037|1.0|I have to say this book is so very bad. It's boring and Hitler is one of the most annoying people of all time. I still can't believe this clown ever made it into power. This book proves just how much of a bigotted loser this guy was. When people say that another Hitler could rise to power one day, I say \\"baloney.\\" That was a huge fluke in the history of mankind and I am quite certain that on this plant, another Hitler will never, even rise to power again. Oh, I know there are many evil people running around out there, but I know for a fact they won't ever rise to power in a country that can match the United States...can't happen ...won't happen and as soon as we hear that a country like WWII Germany is out there, we will smash it before it has a chance to do any damage...I promise this ancient evil as Roosevelt called it, will never take place on this planet unless it happens to come from outer space.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I really like this game but after downloading the summer update it contantly forecloses and I have a 4g phone always connected to the internet but it still crashes. Please fix it for us. I have a samsung galaxy 4g on t-mobile.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Smooth gameplay with good controls.  Graphics are a little on the cutesy side for a zombie shooter, but the style matches the tone by not taking it's self seriously.    Fun in short bursts, but the occasional \\"Force Close\\" ensures that marathon sessions don't happen often.
0684135051|5.0|Anything written by Elizabeth Zimmermann is a good addition to your knitter's library and this book is no exception.  Wise woman she was.      Knit on!
0307477479|5.0|I didn't think this book could live up to the hype but it really is superb. The fifth star is for the PowerPoint chapter - honestly one of the most amazing accomplishments in literature.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|The game crashes before I even get to a splash screen, on my Galaxy Tab 10.1.  I hope they fix it since the game looks like fun.
0596009208|4.0|There are a million books on every subject imaginable; some more difficult than others; some too vague; some too dense to understand; some written well; and many written poorly. This book was actually written well; and in a way that takes the abstract, and makes it easy to understand. It's not intended to give you mastery - but understanding.<br /><br />If you've never dabbled with a programming language before, then this is a book for you. It is most excellent for any beginner. It will help you get your head around basic concepts, and lay the ground-work for continued study.<br /><br />This isn't the best book - but it's one of those key books to give you an excellent introduction. Easy to read. Easy to learn. Easy to remember.<br /><br />If your interested in eventually becoming an Android app developer, and making web apps - then this is a good start for the dominate language used.

B003UD7JEE|5.0|I didn't expect much out of Nikita but I was wrong. Nikita is now the new 24, and Maggie Q the new Kiefer Sutherland. Expect intelligent plots, hairpin twists, and conveniently advanced technology, in a spy-v-spy drama that is light on the violence porn and heavy on characterization and humanity - all done while basically looking supermodel-esque fabulous.    My friends are -not- going to believe I just wrote that sentence. But Nikita deserves it.    I also appreciate the very international nature of the plot, with backdrops from Santiago to Tashkent, and spoken languages in the show from Cantonese (Maggie's is legit, Percy's is wince-inducing) to Russian (Maggie's sounds 100% legit, perhaps Russian-speakers can chime in on this). So good to see real EFFORT in TV these days.    Absolutely buy/rent/watch/whatever. Oh and once you have watched it you might appreciate the similarities this drama has with Harry Potter - Percy has 7 horcruxes which all must be destroyed before he can be killed, and the characters discuss how killing somebody takes away bits of your soul/stays with you. Funny, right?
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I couldn't ask for more, this edition, as are most Criterion copies, is more complete than anyone could have asked for. Image quality is also great.
140053271X|5.0|I love the device and everything its super wonderful. However ummm the price here on amazon is a bit high its cheaper on bn website or at bestbuy.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Wonderful series, but the Kindle version has a massive flaw, any page after #377 still shows that exact number. I've tried resetting the Kindle and have even deleted the book then re downloaded it from the Archived section to no success.
0143038419|5.0|I have not seen the movie and just finished reading the book and overall I loved it.  While some of the criticism below are valid, I was not affronted so much by the self indulgent author.  As I am already open to the idea of self exploration, travel, spirituality and adventure, this memoir delivered big for me.  The author strikes a chord with many of us because what a treat it must be to leave stress behind to find inner peace and/or love in exotic places.  I finished reading Eat, Pray, Love and now I feel uplifted.  I enjoyed reading the memoir and would definitely recommend it.
1400063515|3.0|In my opinion Mr.Taleb has written a book that is interesting for the masses/ common people. It encourages people to think about the some statistics and the likelihood of extreme event.   The 3 star rating is due to some imprecision concerning a passage about volatility in the first chapters and also because of his repetition speech about the dangers of analysing probabilities by using the Normal Distribution. Gauss Normal Distribution is a major breakthrough in science and is a very interesting and simple model.   I didn't like his feelings of scorn and disdain of people that use ties and working in the financial system. He doesn't like academic people as well. That's is not a problem, everyone has the right to have their opinion and critic but I didn't buy your book to know your opinion about those persons. Actually I think the book tries implicitely to give the reader some guidelines about life and all I wanted was a book that at the end told me how to correctly spot a Black Swan. Several times I felt tired of reading the book.  Less repetition, less brainwash and more interesting (not trivial) stuff.  Should I was given the chance to meet Mr. Taleb, I would not be interested.

B004WOS7LO|5.0|Almost every song of this album touches my heart. The melody is so David-Cook-incredible! It even brought me to tears when I was listening to several songs for the first time. This is exactly what I want from a musician. And I just cannot believe that this album is better than the last. All the waiting is so worth it!
B0058P7KUA|4.0|The gameplay is well described in other reviews and I'm addicted. The problem lies in its inability to load most of the time due to open feint.  Very annoying considering I run a well maintained evo 4g. Once I finally get a decent launch its smooth sailing though.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I won't repeat the plot summary because you can read that for yourself on these posts.  I enjoyed this story very much, and encourage M. Night to purchase it and make it into his most successful screenplay since Sixth Sense.
B002ZG97RE|3.0|.....I really like Matt Damon.<br />.....I really did NOT like him in this movie.<br />Here's why.<br />While the film gives us lots of fire fighting and explosions and helicopters flying about the film cannot escape from a script that is a little too unrealistic.<br />Great acting from Damon and co.<br />The direction was fine.<br />Pacing, score, everything was good.<br />It just wasn't a very interesting movie.<br />I honestly found myself incredible bored.<br />There are better films out there.<br />Hurt Lock, while faulty on it's own was better than this.<br />So was Brother's.<br />It's worth a rental but don't expect anything better than the two films I already mentioned.<br />Nor does it introduce any new concepts into the Iraq war or why we were there.<br />I'll recommend a rental to war movie buffs but for anyone else...pass it.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for my old and worn out sheath. It is a great quality and I hope it will last me an other 5 years.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Fun game. Installed and worked with no problems on HTC Thunderbolt. Runs flawlessly with no lag. Don't agree with 1 star reviews if App doesn't work with other user's phone.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|First off, the album has no stand out hit song like previous albums had. There's no \\"Single Ladies\\" or \\"Dangerously in Love\\" song in this album. I won't count \\"Girls Who Run the World\\" because that song might be faster than the rest of the songs on the album but its not catchy in a good way. Also, is it me or all these songs about Jay-Z and how in love she is getting a little old?     Some of the songs that I liked were \\"Party\\" (because of Kanye West and Andre 3000) and \\"Start Over.\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|people have said that this is simply a port and five stars is foolish for a rating.  I must disagree this is a perfect port no problem except for my big hands hitting the wrong plants. its the same as  my pc version
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It was a good series.  I found it at Episode 8 and was really disappointed when FOX cancelled it.  Made phone calls and wrote letters.  Enjoy it when the Science Channel airs it.    I liked the characters.  I liked the dialogue - especially the turns of phrases and the interspersed Mandarin (who doesn't think it will all come down to English and Mandarin) reminiscent of Bladerunner.    I especially like it when a show is consistent.  Nothing drives me out of the room faster than even an inconsistency that breaks the illusion.  Firefly managed to maintain perfect consistency and maintain the illusion.    COMPLAINT * COMPLAINT * COMPLAINT    How hard would it be to give me a checkbox saying \\"I don't want TV Series in my list of titles\\"?  When I'm hunting for new titles for MOVIES I want movies, not television.  It just can't be that hard to filter these mostly-pieces-of-crap out of the lists...
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I did not have high expectations going in as the last couple of comedies I've seen were full of bathroom and vulgar humor combined with hysterical outbursts which seems to be the trend in comedies these days. But I found \\"Bad Teacher\\" to be quite refreshing in that respect. I'm surprised at how many people find this movie to be degrading to women and teachers - as a woman and a former teacher myself I really enjoyed it and did not find it offensive one bit. I would highly recommend this movie!
B000QRIGLC|3.0|I thought it was interesting reading about the punishing training that the Navy Seals have to go through and the determination of the author to get through it. I was turned off by the political rhedoric that the author injected into his story. The author blamed the politicions in Washington for drafting the Rules of Engagement for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This is not true. Those rules are drafted by the generals and approved by Secretary of Defense.    I don't understand why the author's superiors sent 4 men on a mission into a beehive of Taliban fighters to kill one important Taliban leader. The superiors admitted that Taliban fighters were at least 80 strong in that area. Then when the team encountered the goat herders they had a hard time deciding whether they should kill them or let them go. The Rules of Engagement would clearly apply in that case but they were more concerned about what the liberal media would do if the story were to leak to the press that they killed unarmed civilians. The team was concerned that the goat herders would inform the Taliban about their existance in the area which they probably did. If the team decided to execute them the Taliban would have surly heard the shots and the outcome would have been the same.     There didn't seem to be an exit plan for the team after the mission was accomplished. It seems to me that the superiors unintentionally sent the team on a suicide mission.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Anyone who calls them self an American should watch this.  Very powerful and very disturbing on many levels.  Our country is in a bad place and we, as a people, need to rise up and work together.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My  first Zusak and my first Kindle read. Both proved a must experience. Zusak is an incredible story teller and obvious lover of words. The Book Thief will be with you long after you have turned its last page. The Kindle lives up to its CEO's promise that you will get lost in the wonderful world of reading.
1603420398|5.0|Oh my....beautiful, well written, well illustrated, LOVE the spiral bound notebook.    I've been crocheting for nearly 40 years (has it really been that long? YIKES!) and have lots of books on the subject. Seldom do I get excited and keep referring to one as a resource.    Something about finally knowing how to make so many shapes has inspired me to create my own projects, one after another.    I HIGHLY recommend this book. I've learned from it, and find myself learning more from it almost everytime I return to it.     I first checked it out of  my public library, and paid plenty in overdue fines. Rather than going thru that again, I decided to put it in my own library. Get it! No need to think twice.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|evo 4g- played it for awhile when I first downloaded it. no probs. now I can't get it to start. fix it for a full 5 stars.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|As one reviewer remarked, this was the Stones at their peak. This is also about the time I \\"discovered\\" them, being finally old and mature enough to be impressed with quality work. I got \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" at about the same time, still the best live album by anyone anywhere, with the possible exception of the Stooges \\"Metallic KO.\\"  Some where at about the same time \\"Sticky Fingers\\" came out and I was a FAN. A real fan-I bought all the magazines with articles about the Stones I could find, I started collecting trivia about the band, I immersed myself in the band. This is and will always be the album I'll measure other rock bands by. That was the great news. The bad news was that I'd fallen in love and become obsessed with a band that was falling into a major decline. Keith Richards' heroin addiction wasn't gossip, it was a well known fact. Mick Taylor was getting sick of playing with him-how could anyone blame him? Mick  Jagger's greatest strength has been his ability to listen to current music and work with it, but he needed Keith's restraining hand to keep authentic-without that, Jagger would grab any passing fad and try to create an album around it. And Keith couldn't even tune his guitar. I'd fallen in love with a band in sharp decline, and they followed these masterpieces up with work that went from mediocre (\\"Only Rock and Roll\\" to not bad (\\"Some Girls\\") to the awful \\"Black and Blue\\"-an album with a DISCO song on it! It began to occur to me that I was simply financing someone else's drug habit-it was a painful, bitter realization. The geniuses I'd idolized were marking time and when Mick Taylor finally quit in disgust, they replaced him with Ron Wood-a great guy to shoot dope with Keith, but what other talents did he have? The relationship between Jagger and Richards got worse and worse-as did their albums-and I quit listening to them years ago. It amazes me now to watch kids fighting for tickets to what amounts to an oldies band-in what way is this different from the Monkees or Herman's Hermits? But in site of the bitterness I feel towards this band, there is no denying the work they did in the early 1970s. Nobody before or since has recorded anything to match this album and music this thrilling makes up for a lot of crap-Emotional Rescue, duh. This is one of the two or three best rock albums ever made. But with the Stones, buyer beware!
B004XQO90O|5.0|SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity.  Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished.  Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens  onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago.  It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky.<br /><br />*In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth.  That is what a superb cast can do with any material, but with this particular strange tale it works perfectly.  Grady Harp, July 11
0060987464|4.0|i bought the book after reading reviews and i am a fan of Manson so i decided to order it. i was really surprised at how he views sexuality. and how important sex and girls where to him growing up. its not what i expected.  my mom saw the book and i got really embarrassed! but its an interesting read. im only half way through.
1416550550|3.0|I read this book over a  month ago, so it isn't as clear in my mind as if I read it yesterday. That being said, I want to share that there were things that I liked about the book, and things I did not.  The story is interesting enough, however, it flips back and forth to/from different time periods, and this flipping was sometimes cumbersome for me.  I also think the story line is a bit weak at times.....  All in all it was a good enough read, and since I do like reading about Cornwall, it was overall satisfying enough.  Not one of my favorite books however.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|this game was way more fun than I thought it'd be. the controls are surprisingly great. didn't need to restart my phone or anything. installed and played immediately. works great. HTC incredible.
B0033AGPF8|5.0|At first I picked up the CD's of Axis and Ladyland and the vinyl of Experienced. After hearing how much better the vinyl sounds I returned the CDs for the vinyl copies. Really, these are the best sounding vinyl albums I own! A tremendous pressing.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|This book was very engaging. I kept reading because I had heard it was amazing. I kept waiting for parents to help their children or some \\"amazing\\" thing to happen. I thought the premise was pathetic, although Collins is a talent to behold. Characters were well developled, but the story was repulsive!
B004EPYZPI|4.0|Limitless and Source Code are the two best films I've seen this year. The latter being better. Anyway, talking about The Lincoln Lawyer,  I think the film is utterly intriguing. It also has many layers, the central character is interesting and reasonably likable. The court room drama was fascinating, the acting is tight and the direction keeps you interested. The film doesn't hold back at any stage. A very good performance and it's good to see MM do a good job because he's not my favourite actor usually. Ryan Philippe isn't the best brat and the casting on him could have been different but I don't want to give anything away so sorry. Fans of court room dramas have to watch it.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!
0393324818|5.0|The best way I can succinctly describe it is that it reads like a stellar Planet Money/This American Life collaboration. Statistical discussions are easy to follow, but not dumbed down, and there's enough human interest bits sprinkled throughout to stimulate some emotional investment.<br /><br />A quick read you can feel like you take a lot away from. I procrastinated on reading this, despite multiple recommendations, because I have little interest in baseball. After reading, I still don't particularly enjoy baseball but I loved the book.
0345529057|5.0|$20 for 4 printed books, $30 for the kindle. Is there ANYONE at Amazon that knows how to price their products intelligently?

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|In other words, it doesn't get much better! A GREAT paranormal plot, a smolderingly hot hero and a smart, kick ass heroine who can take care of herself when she needs to but enjoys watching her man in action. I loved, loved, loved this book. I am afraid Thea Harrison has bumped Nalini Singh and Larissa Ione from the top of my fave authors list. I can't wait for August and the next book in the series.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Lots of fun! You just depth charge a bunch of sea animals and shoot birds. I recommend it to everyone.
1250004349|3.0|Sarah's key was about the Jewish people and the Holocaust. Even though I have read many books and seen many movies about the Holocaust, I was still moved by this book. I did feel very sad about the content. I do think that Tatiana De Rosnay did a good job, though I feel the last part was kind of unnecessary.   I did like how the author went back and forth between two periods of time.  I liked the story of Sarah and thought of it as more substantial but was bored with the part about Julia and thought of it as weak/.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Some of these simpler games' sequels are just a rip off. This isn't the case. I loved the first one, which was free, and enjoy this one even more. If you liked the first one then buy this one as a Thank You. You won't be disappointed.
0307454541|5.0|When I started reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. This was the start of a wonderful adventure into a dark world of Lizbeth Salander who is a computer hacker and a very bright girl with a unconventional lifestyle. I could not put it down. The author Stieg Larsson did a wonderful job of capturing her personality so well.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much and have also seen the three movies.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Do you remember the excitement you felt when you discovered a new favorite author?  That's what happened to me when a friend recommended this book.  I read it cover to cover - okay, not really because it's on my Kindle. But I didn't put it down.  I had Kindle thumb before I finished.  (Avid Kindle readers, you know what I mean, right?)    I would like to see Jack Reacher get more of the girl, but then again, she might be more baggage than he wants.  After all, the man travels light.    Highly recommended.
1615234144|5.0|Bought this for my Dad, then 93, who loves to read & likes John Grisham. I often buy him Large Print books here and if he doesn't need to hang on to them, I donate them to our Library for their Large Print collection.  The stories are great. Most of them a little dark but if you're a John Grisham fan, you'll like this collection.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I love this album! She made a record for herself. It was time for Beyonce: The Person to step forward.  The result is a shape-shifting piece of musical work for Beyonce. It also sets out its vision as a radical sidestep from the era-defining club and pop hits of Destiny's Child. It is filled with 3 platinum-plated ballads to mid-tempos. She toured the world and it opened her up to the possibiilities of new genres and the magnitude of the festival experience. She had started looking beyond stadiums, watching Linkin Park and Muse and Rage Against the Machine whip up their adoring fans in different ways than Pop music intuits. She then started thinking about the possibility of re-writing her place in musical history. Her musical maturation is almost complete. Her personal ethics and work methodology stretch even further. This album is going to be successful like her previous albums.
B0058P7KUA|2.0|controls on this game are horrible. I know it.isn't my phone. sometimes the game doesn't.register any presses hence you can't fire.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She's a big Castle fan and loves to watch episodes over and over...she loved it.
1575666286|4.0|The price for this book is very fair.  It is written in a manner that it is easy to understand even though there is some medical terminology.  The main asset is that it teaches the reader about proper nutrition and what our bodies need in order to stay healthy, or to become healthy after devastating diseases.<br /><br />However, to follow the plan will take a great amount of will power, and very few will be willing to submit themselves to such rigidity unless they are near death's door.  I am taking about six eight-ounce glasses of fresh-squeezed apple-carrot and carrot juice at the present.  They are very tasty.  I have tried the green juice, which is not bad when taken with half apple juice.  I hope to increase the amount of green juice in the future.  I do eat some organic beef and chicken with a lot of vegetables, which is no problem.  If my health situation gets worse, I will probably try to get closer and closer to the complete Gerson Therapy.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Resolution is a little low, but the game plays just great. Loads and Exits smoothly and sounds awesome! Controls work well on the big screen. Fun Too!
