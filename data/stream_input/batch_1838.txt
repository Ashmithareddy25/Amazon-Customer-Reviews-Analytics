B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great game, but I can't believe I have to pay more to access the other levels. Why not just put it out there for a higher, complete price. Other than, lot's of fun.
1250006341|5.0|This is another book that gives a reader further insight into the lives of the characters that make up the series Downton Abbey.  I love anything connected to the series and I will continue to read the books and watch the videos about Downton Abbey.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This story was mostly well written.  I enjoyed the early years in India.  However, it was a bit disjointed with the flash backs.  The discription of the tiger charactor was the best.  I did not understand the Japanese charactors and their role in the book.  Other than some of the narrative iI enjoyed reading the story and found great empathy with Pi.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|funny,irreverent quick witted and sly. Definitely centered in Boston  humor. if you are not from New England at least you might not get some of the one liners.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|funny, i thought some of the humor was too base, too crass and juvenille at times. but it was ok
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|this was good although anne hathaway was not convincing as cat woman. great action and fair storyline.would watch again for sure.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|If I only had to have a few apps, Dropbox would be the first I'd keep. It flawlessly keeps my stuff accessible from any PC and all of my electronic gizmos (HTC Desire, Kindle Fire, and some nameless android tablet) and synchronizes them without any work on my part. I can upload and download without any problems - and many other useful apps have Dropbox as an option for uploading and/or downloading. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who needs to access documents, music, photos, etc. in multiple locales and on multiple devices.
B000W4KT64|5.0|my family and i love this musical movie way better than the original! :D we were shocked how John Travolta acts like a woman! he could pass for a girl!! :O
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I couldn't wait to see the next episode.  I've watched the entire series to date and can't wait until this season starts.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book!!! I read this book back to back three times in a weeks time!! I am on another series right now but I am constantly thinking about this book and will be reading it when I am finished with current book.  I have recommended it to everyone to read and looking forward to reading his side of the story!!  Enjoy reading it!!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This should be required reading in high school.  Freedom isn't a given and it would do you well to read this book and understand that.  What this person endured shouldn't happen in the world we live in.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|this movie got so much so much hype, its really not funny and the plot is scattered. Just over rated.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was hooked as soon as I got to the third episode.  Couldn't wait to see the other episodes and seasons.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in one afternoon. It is that good! I would highly recommend Ender's Game. A must read.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I thought it would be good to accompany the series on television.  It was okay, but then again I'm not a big comic fan.
B008EZVNFE|4.0|I love her voice, lyrics, and musicality. Someone posted a link to her YouTube video &#34;No Room for Doubt&#34; and I think I watched it 25 times in a row. I was a little disappointed with the rest of the album. My favorite tracks are the title track, &#34;Lost and Found,&#34; and &#34;No Room for Doubt&#34;. Please support this amazing artist.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Season 4 is the tipping point for Walter.  He becomes what he tried so hard to avoid.  Watch this excellent drama
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I didn't think I would like it at first because I was so attached to the First Season. But it is just as good, if not better. I really like that member of the old cast have roles in this one. It is an amazing series! MUST SEE!!!
B0049VZ222|5.0|Not a fan of zombie shows, but I'm a diehard fan of this series.  Great effects, good storyline.  Don't let the idea of zombies keep you from watching this great series.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|So good and I love they way the movie ended.  Can't wait for the next movie to come out, hopefully soon.
B003YV0A02|5.0|Ahhhh Bruce at his finest! Really enjoyed this and so did Hubby---will now join our list of &#34;holiday viewing musts&#34;!!
1574214276|5.0|Of all the books I have on this subject this book stands out from all of them.  Fun, easy to read and so much information.  Compared to other books I found this a relaxing and yet inspiring book to read.  Other books can seem a bit intimidating at first as if the writer is looking down at you.  But this book is completely the opposite.  You immediately become part of a learning class even though there is just you and the book.  This book has the ability to motivate you to try new and different ideas.  I know that I won't be searching for anymore books on Zentangle for sometime as everything is here in this one great book.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I did not love it.  The acting and directing make for a great production.  I believe it depicts events that may be true.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I read a lot of romances and this is one of the best I've read this year. Courtney MIlan is a master at her craft and it shows in this carefully woven tail of love and intrigue. The characters are rich and complex, the dialogue excellent and the setting right on. I really enjoyed the somewhat later time period of this book, after the inventions of steamer ships and locomotives. A must read!
B004VD3YIM|4.0|I love this App. I use it often. I highly recommend it. After the camera is programed the interface is just so easy to use.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Really enjoyed, written well, and the plot stayed suspenseful throughout, I know when I read them quick it was a winner....hope to see more from this author!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Mark Owen is not Tom Clancy but it is an interesting read.  Zero Dark Thirty will be the best telling of this story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|best app it's like the new temple run so addicting big time waster it's my new favorite game so much fun
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book starts a little slowly but quickly picks up steam as the pages are turned. It is the best suspense book I have read in quite a while.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The premise was a bit odd, and there were a few brief moments that made us laugh, but overall I would not recommend this movie.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|The standing case you sent me did not fit the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch.  I had thrown away the packing materials so I did not return it.  I have not been able to use it.  Very disappointing.
B004EKCNMA|2.0|This makes &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; at once more frightening and serious than any other rendering and also at times unnecessarily comical. Easily the worst version of this story I have ever experienced.
0061906220|4.0|The lesson and music keeps ringing in my heart. Every child should get to know Pete the Cat. He has heart lessons to teach.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|If you like action, this is a great movie for that.  Jeremy Renner kicks butt and has no problem in the action role.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Are we coming to this?  Anything to entertain the viewing audience, not matter how it hurts those who participate?  I am reminded of &#34;the Bachelor&#34; and &#34;Bachelorette&#34; shows, the &#34;Survivor&#34; series, etc.  Is the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; scenerio so far off the mark?
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Anything Rod Stewart does has got to be great!  Rod's personal interpretations are delightful.  Great addition to my Christmas favorites!
B000URWYTS|5.0|This book was very fascinating in the development of such intellectual and complex characters striving toward revealing a true storyline.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter cause you can even tweet your face celebrities and sometimes they may even tweet back. I love using this app on my kindle fire!!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|really good app for minecraft pe you can change to survival or creative without deleteing any thing.make a nether portal awesome
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for every one. a great time killer and it has good visual. me and my son play it all the time.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Changed how I study without the snake oil sensibility of other memory books. Engaging journalism with productive perspective. Very good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|An Easy to navigate around<br />an Easy way to keep track of items being sold and purchases I have bought.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|This movie was bad all around. Watched it with my wife and she fell asleep during it at left. At thispoint I felt safe turning it off.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|While it may start off a bit slow to explain the setting a bit, it quickly builds steam.  Very enjoyable.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I like Johnny Depp to to begin with and he is excellent in this movie. It's just a fun and exciting movie that follows the original &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; TV series, but transforms it into a comedy. Very entertaining!
098555780X|5.0|This book is full of interesting and creative patterns. It has plenty of pictures and simple instructions which make it easy to understand.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to make paracord bracelets/keychains/etc.<br /><br />P.S.Make sure you buy enough paracord to actually make stuff. Most of the patterns take up to 6 feet per paracord to make (There are even a few that require 10 or 12 feet of paracord).
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I've liked all the previous movies in this series but this one while having great action scenes is simply a letdown. The story line does not go any where, there isn't any explantion for why the characters do what they do, the bad guys are not taken care of in the end, the are numerous loose ends that are not addressed. It almost looks like a prequel.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Who doesn't love a great band from their local town? I am from Provo, and I love that they started here. That, and their sound is great and unique. This album is the best $2 I ever spent.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Probably one of the best movies I have seen,<br /> better than Bourne,<br />but not for the little ones. Worth the watch.
B0060D123K|5.0|I have always loved the Muppets, and this is no exception. Christmas just isn't the same without viewing this classic, and it is made better as the most depressing song seems to have been removed. It is all happy good fun with a great message.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I understand the negative reviews on this movie now that I have watched it. This movie felt like it was pieced together to capitalize off of the successful Bourne franchise. The story felt rushed and the ending was terrible. Right in the middle of an action sequence that seemed to be leading somewhere, it cuts to the star and the girl on a boat out in the middle of the ocean. And then rolls to the credits.<br />Sadly that is a metaphor for the movie. It is like a boat floating out in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Just as amazing as the show! Have the whole album on repeat! Might have to buy more for gifts. Even the husband enjoys it :)
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Riddle me this Ridley - why sully an otherwise rather sterling reputation with this half-baked Alien prequel?<br /><br />You know you're in trouble when the android gives one of the least wooden performances in the ensemble.<br /><br />The story was lacking, the characters caricatures and the ideas underdeveloped.<br /><br />What can I say? I was disappointed. This movie could have been epic - a 2001 for a new era - but failed to deliver.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|The Overlook (A Harry Bosch Novel)<br /><br />Almost like watching a movie. Could not put it down, well written with a very good plot.
B00A992W9Y|4.0|If you are a fan of the first album, then this one will not disappoint.  I find the first half of the album to be pretty solid, but am not as excited about the second half of the album (although it grows on you).  Overall, I think she did a great job for being her second album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good old fashion game that most people still in their free time still love to play. Kinda like checkers, we still play the game. Whether it is to exercise our mind or waste time.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The Walking Dead is an awesome series (both the comic and t.v. show).  Although the second season is a bit slower than the first, it is still an amazing series, and I am happy to have it as part of my collection.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game.<br />Brain, mind, all have to be in play to figure out how to win in this game. Very well thought of game,  I think.
B007IK44CK|5.0|GREAT MOVIE GOT IT FROM WALMART....BUT DOWNLOADED DIGITAL COPY TO AMAZON INSTANT VIDEOS.......I FIND THEIR STREAM IS THE BEST ON MY PS3
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Anyone who needs that extra uhump :-)  Anyone who likes games. Anyone who likes using their mind and brain power.
B000I9WWAY|4.0|I chose this rating because the movie was a little long. I also felt the movie did not have a ending for all story lines.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm a great big fan of hidden object and adventure game's, this one does not disappoint, it has great graphics;interesting story line;easy hint button a little monkey that also gives you a hand. You can zoom in &amp; out to find objects also can choose what mode you want to play in!  Haven't played but about 30 minute's so far having fun, no problems downloading ; everything seems to be working just fine. Keep them comming G5Entertainment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great book that keeps you guessing at every turn. I would definetly recommend this book to anyone, very well written.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I purchased this book after seeing Shin interviewed on television.  It is a horrific accounting of a world I never knew existed - the slave camps of North Korea.  Although Shin managed to escape and now lives in freedom, I doubt whether he can ever escape the scars such a loveless and cruel environment left on him.<br /><br />The author intersperses Shin's story with some history of North Korea.  At times, that transition is not smooth and even a little confusing.  While it is a story that needed to be told, I think it could have been told a little better.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Epic movie of its time. Still watch it on a regular basis. Now its become one of my teenage sons favorite movies. Michelle in her prime beauty.
B009LROCJI|4.0|One of, if not the best I have listened too.<br />Max Richter brings out the best of these movements, trying hard to have one imagine they were sitting in the original setting.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Being able to purchase the latest season of the Walking Dead was pretty cool...since I missed the whole season, this made it so easy to catch up.
0307346617|5.0|This book is awesome! I love zombies and this books delivers just that. I love the fact that this book has stories from people all over the world: North Korea, India, Europe, Japan, China, The U.S., and many more. This a good weekend read for those who love zombies.
0316228532|5.0|Die hard J.K Rowling fans (myself included) should get their hands on it as soon as possible.<br /><br />Packaging was great, came in perfect state and the jacket art is catching.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel that deals with a tough subject (dying of cancer) in a touching, snarky, funny, and irreverent manner. Each character is marvelously developed, and it makes a great read for anyone.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|Everything was awesome.  Ordering to receiving...very impressed with the timing.  Already wrapped and under the tree.  Only concern is that the cover of the DVD case is different than what is pictured.  Ai big deal?  Not really, in the scheme of things.  Just hoping everything is alright with the actual dvd.  I haven't tested it yet because it is currently a wrapped gift.  Wished the picture matched what is pictured for consistency sake...thats it.  It cost a star in the rating.  Thanks for the timely delivery.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Sweet Tooth: A Novel is another page turner from Ian McEwan.  It has the same mystique and allure of Atonement.  It also gives an interesting inside view of MI5 and MI6 and the issues of sex discrimination that have slowly diminished.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|entertaining - Salma Hayek and Benicio are the main reason to watch this. Overall, fun to watch and some cool shots.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Lot's of twists and turns but too many unsaid loose ends. People appear and they are not defined. How did they get in the picture, what happens with his son, how did he get the information and why? Being a jailhouse lawyer is not explanation enough. Almost leaves you thinking it needs a sequel but you don't know if you're ready for that. Still a good enough story to be recommended but not his best effort.
B00A7CI82I|2.0|I just received the Blu-ray 2 disk set yesterday and these are the first Blu-ray disks that  will not play on either one of my PC's Blu-ray players.  A copy protection notice comes up in my PC's Blu-ray players (Nero Blu-ray player and Cyberlink powerdvd11) and nether disk will play.  I finally got it to work on my Panasonic Blu-ray downstairs, I haven't tired the Vizio player yet.<br /><br />I do not plan on purchasing any Sony Blu-ray's in the future!  I bought the movie and I should be able to watch it where ever I want.  I wasn't aware that Blu-rays can be copied on a PC yet?<br /><br />In any case the movie was different enough to be entertaining but should have been in 3D.
B009GX69RK|5.0|At first, thought the Zooey character would be too cutesy and annoying, but by the second episode, I was hooked. Really funny show with great cast chemistry.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app has everything I need and it is very easy to navigate! I use it at least once a week. It's great!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book plays on every woman's fantasy. The handsome, powerful stranger that is unattainable but wants you. How can you stop reading it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This isn't a literary master piece, but it is fun to read. It's a love story at heart, easy to read and a definite page turner. Every womans fantasy. Sugar and spice.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a must have on an Android smart phone or tablet. It is feature rich and allows copy/move/delete of any file on your Android device. I use it more than the file explorer that comes with any of my devices.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Kind of a letdown after the joker. Definitely wasnt a film for kids and the villain could not live up to what the joker brought.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Not exactly what I was expecting from the trailers but it was pretty damn good. A true Oliver Stone flick.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love the theme song.Oh my God we could wait for it to come out, my six year old counted his days down so we can order it. I believe angry bird is the highest rating game for kids and adults who are fans of Star Wars.Wonderful game to play.The amazing part is episode 5  he is so excited.My six year old is a great fan of both Star Wars and Angry Birds.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this as a series on HBO and grabbed at the chance to get it at a great price.  It is a well done, superb acting and historically correct being based on the extensive writings and papers of one of our founding fathers but gives excellent insight as to the other founding fathers and history makers as well.  Great drama based on a great book, both long but both so rich in history.  If you are interested in the history of our great United States than you need this DVD set and/or the Book.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's okay. I know my son enjoy playing this game. When he noticed it I downloaded it.We like the music, how he flys in the air and  perform. Alex says it's a cool game.
0811879542|5.0|this is one of the best new books I have seen for children.  It is unexpected and clever and a great way to teach counting and colors.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm not even close to a vegan or an ultra runner but it definitely gave me perspective on how I can make small changes and improve my running and overall health.  It is very well written and I like the recipes throughout.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great collection of hit songs.  Kelly is in fine form and you will not be disappointed.  There are plenty of songs too.  Do your self a favor and snap it  up.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pretty good app, I wish it had more card games like spider though, and the ads can get really annoying but not a bad app.
B00355L2TU|4.0|Its a great workout.  I got it electornically on amazon and when I move my computer it freezes for just a moment.  Other than that small annoyance, its a great workout!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Any one who like historical novels will love this one.  It really sheds a different light on Richard III.Phillippa Gregory does her homework doing her research.
157421327X|4.0|The book arrived bent up and in some sad looking shape. I'm sure this probably took place during the shipping and delivery process. Perhaps a stiff cardboard shipping envelope instead of a flimsy plastic one would've helped this? Still wonderful as far as the info in the book goes. I just have problems buying a book that i receive damaged.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My grandson enjoyed this movie.  He liked the Bear the best.<br />He found it to be exciting and it kept his interest.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This version of Angry birds made it impossible to beat certain levels without the ads being removed.  There have since been much better versions of the game and they are free.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a timeless move.  My granddaughter had this on her Christmas list.<br />This is an oldie but a must have.
B001NLCBJI|4.0|This movie is cute, but the end leaves you hanging.  If you're like me and need closure, this movie may not be for you.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|This movie was fun for the kids to watch and for us as parents. It has great story telling and animation.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|My grandchildren love this book and it is one of the most requested ones that I own.  The app is amazing as well and well worth the price.  My 15 month old granddaughter can make it do everything.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is season is completely disturbing and fantastic!  We look forward to it being on our prime account each week.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|It wasn't really what I expected. A little hard for my little girl. It is too easy to click on the purchase for cash button.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I are loving the third season.  We can't wait to see what happens next. We use the tv season pass so it is always waiting for us each week.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I love it. The build-in quality. The phantom, the materials used, the box. Everything is amazing. One of the best USB accessories you can buy certainly.
B007QXU0ZO|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from EDWARD SHARPE AND THE MAGNETIC ZEROS.  The recording quality is simply OK. The music, the lyrics fall short of my expectations. I heard a live performance, and interview session on an FM radio show. That spot was excellent. That's why I bought this CD.
B008035H16|5.0|It's simply an amazing book. The idea of being illustrated and so well summarized allows you to comprehend the deep meaning of the movement and book in less than an hour. Which is shocking when you end.
B005DZMP00|5.0|I'm glad that I cruised the Amazon music website looking for GRATEFUL DEAD CDs.  I have VOLUME 1, and now VOLUME 2.  Prep yourself for about 4 hours of DEAD LIVE IN EUROPE 1972.  You catch my drift ?  VOLUME 2 has some real gems on it---not to be missed. I've been a DEADHEAD for so many years now. The Jerry Garcia years are the best. I attended many DEAD shows on the U.S. east coast, in the midwest, and on the west coast.<br />Yeah, there are bands that sound like the DEAD, but nothing beats the originals.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Not nearly as good as some of McEwan's other books.  Definitely not an attention grabber.  The convoluted plot is tiresome.
B00003CXTG|5.0|There have been quite a few movies about THE DAY OF INFAMY, but I like this one best of all. DVD quality is excellent. The second disc special features adds a lot to enjoying this movie. This movie has a great cast, great fictional story about a true event in our history. Great filmcraft, great sound track, too.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A real winner, combining my favorite game with my favorite movie... the difficulty level is pretty high and I like the challenge.
B00006AW2F|2.0|This has to be the worst recording by the STONES.  TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  Too much trouble to return it for credit, not that AMAZON EVER gives you a problem with returns, they DON'T.  This CD is parked in a storage container along with a lot of other STINKERS by other bands.  I hit a foul ball once in a while.
B000JY8F22|1.0|If you like hanging around train tracks hoping to see a train wreck you should love this movie. Only watched it because my girlfriend  &#34;had&#34; to see it. The worst kind of chick flick. It almost broke us up!
B000EXZI0A|5.0|This greatest hits CD delivers all the punk rock you'd ever want from the RAMONES. I was fortunate to see them perform live in NYC many times, many years ago.  WILD NIGHTS !  EVERYTHING about this CD is excellent : song selection, remastering, producing, liner notes. Buy it.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Season seven of Supernatural, is just as awesome as all the other seasons. I am absolutely in love with this show. The actors have an amazing chemistry and the script can still keep me enthralled. I can't wait until season eight comes out.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|All band members are gifted musicians, lyricists, producers.<br />The sound quality of this recording is exellent, thanks to CALEXICO producers, and the recording / mixing engineers.<br />CALEXICO draws music style influences from a variety of genres : Traditional American Folk Music, Jazz, West coast sound, Rock, American &#34;TEX-MEX&#34;.<br />I never thought that I'd hear a band that I enjoy, a band  equals THE GRATEFUL DEAD, and THE ROLLING STONES, but CALEXICO IS THAT VERY SPECIAL BAND.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I will never get those two hours back...this was terrible and had so much potential to be good given the plot and actors.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I love a good action flick. This one had some good action but the story line looks like a rewrite of the Bourne films and to a Bourne fan, this did not say to me...WOW on the story line. The acting was good. Renner and Weiss work together well but like I said, they failed in my eye to get me to accept the story line as a Bourne movie.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Like many series of movies, some gain strength and some lose the momentum...in my opinion the Bourne series has been fading and this last installment is at the bottom...I hope this was the last.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Great depth of characters. As you read you just can't wait to see what's going to happen next. It has it all: mystery, suspense, history and romance all entertwined to make it my favorite King novel yet!
B00005V7CT|1.0|This dvd came from Germany, I think, would not play in player, said was the wrong region,  This was not specified in description before ordering.  Very disappointed, costs more to ship back than I paid for it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|First time publishing can be very scary. This book did much to calm my fears and give me easily understood direction. Helpful, VERY helpful!
B006MW3V6U|2.0|Downton Abbey is a great series, but the version supplied by Amazon was useless to me asit did not provide for subtitles. I am hard of hearing and require subtitles for assistance, especially with the English accents.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Wonderful game, and I'm so glad it's free, but it'd be really nice if eventually the Ads faded out or were removable.  I realize they need to be there to make the game free, but it'd be a better experience if they were removable, eventually.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Program Great Price and Great Service.  What more can I ask for. If you're tired of thge junk on TV' try Downton Abbey. Very Entertaining.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and took something away from it. However, it's big failing is that it does not go into enough depth at all!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|His music is so refreshing and different, his voice is so clear love his sound, puts me in a good mood
B009K72RRS|5.0|This is, IMO, the best season yet.... Great story lines and the plot / characters really expand and darken... I love it my kids love it my wife goes shopping!
B007HO392S|5.0|One of my favorite albums!!  Carrie is a class act, she is amazing in concert and her albums never disappoint.  Buy it!
B002PJN59M|2.0|I tried watching it about 3x - but kept falling asleep. I'm not sure if it was the production (audio and video) or the storyline. I would have really like to have watched again but with others. I was watching alone and they have been part of the problem.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|El producto llego a tiempo y en buenas condiciones y el embalaje estuvo correcto, espero comprar mas cosas a futuro.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Another epic battle of good versus evil. Mc Steamy plays the bad guy and does it well.<br />Our hero is left to fend for himself after saving the world twice but is unable to disclose that classified info. The job hunt is brutal for our unsung hero. His new GF is whole-heartedly behind her her man as hat in hand he braves the tough job market. He stumbles into a deceptacon plot to enslave mankind and is once again tasked with selflessly defending humanity as well as saving the girl. Bravo for making part three every bit as compelling as it's precursors!
0061452068|5.0|As an individual tired of hearing how the world is terrible this book is uplifting. Matt Ridley brings light to the other half of the worlds half empty glass. I would recommend this book to anyone, it just might change your opinion of the future.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|This is an interesting story.  Its well written and gives you ideas of things you might not have thought of before.  It is thoughtful and charming in its own way.  I would tell friends to read this one.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I loved it, I would certainly watch it again. Great actors, great message, I had a great time indeed yeah
B009ME47H2|3.0|Fast and simple to use. Does not show off any problems (so far!) I'd recommend it as a general purpose recorder.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I loved the selection of songs! Wonderful CD. Look forward to the next one! It was all that I expected.
B004JK61K0|1.0|On the Kindle Fire HD that I bought and have since returned; the k-9 mail was terrible.  It was a very poor replacement since the Kindle is not compatible with Comcast.  Wish I had been advised of this problem before I spent hours trying to connect and the 4 Kindle techs didn't have a clue why it wouldn't connect until the 5th tech admitted the problem in connecting with Comcast.
B0086700CM|1.0|I downloaded this because everyone said it was so much fun, but I was so completely bored after 5 minutes that I gave up. I don't know if you are running somewhere special or if there's something great at the end, but just running and jumping on and on and on was so completely pointless that I stopped. Boring as all get out.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Updated this app a couple of days ago.  Now I cannot view my email.  It just keeps showing that it is trying to load my messages.  I just removed the app from my kindle fire.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love this movie........<br /><br />This is a new holiday classic.<br /><br />Short, sweet, and funny.<br /><br />I especially love seeing Bob Newhart play one of the elves.<br />He is always hilarious.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|What more can be said about this masterpiece by Tom Wolfe that hasn't already been said.  Since Mr. Wolfe has a new book out, I decided to re-read this novel since I first read it in 1988.  Its impact has not lessened.  I still live in New York City and things here change but in many ways still remain the same.  There are still many who live here in the underside of the New York City &#34;Renaissance&#34; and the economic divide is still steep.  Who can forget his Social X-Rays?  Bravo!
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love Pink.............<br /><br />Not only does she have a powerful voice, her beats are always catchy, and her lyrics thoughtful.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read the books first so I had to watch the movie.  I thought the movie lived up to the book. I really enjoyed it and I usually don't having read the book first.  Definitely worth watching.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|too offensive to watch.. love mark walhberg and expected a classier movie - with a stuffed animal as a star you would think it to be child friendly - DON NOT let you kids watch!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I think this has moved to the top of my favorites list.  You won't be disappointed.  Now I have to find something to read until the next release in 2013.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Fast paced and interesting! I figured out the twist fairly early in the book but still wasn't disappointed.<br />Well worth the read.
034580404X|5.0|I'm 71 and can't believe these books actually made me blush a couple of times.  I did enjoy the story part of the book and let's face it...the rest I could have done without, altho it was interesting to learn some of the things I didn't know about S&M.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I really like Seth MacFarlane and generally love his sense of humor (Family Guy & American Dad are favorites). I also like Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis. Unfortunately, Ted missed the mark in lots of different ways. The thing that struck me the most was the similarity to the animated shows that Seth MacFarlane is famous for developing. There are certain things (situations/jokes) that work very well in cartoons, but they just don't come across the same way when using human beings. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just didn't do anything for me.
B00000JNNY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite songs and no one sings it like Etta James...altho Beyonce' came close.  I can play this one over and over...if I'm in that mood.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The story seemed to take a new angle with every few chapters. The reading was easy and the characters were well flushed out. There were lots of people, but Grisham always gave enough information to be sure you remembered who was who. Lots and lots of fin and almost impossible to put down.
140004281X|3.0|These stories are mostly rather bleak.  The prose is skillfully written, but a bit slow and descriptive for my tastes.<br /><br />I also found myself unsatisfied with the endings.  They were all anti-climactic, and not in literary, make-you-think sort of way.  Just in an unfinished, reached-my-word count sort of way.  Some reviews say that this is to reflect real life, and the unfinishedness of real stories.  There's probably truth to this.  I just don't enjoy the style.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the collection well enough, especially the unusual settings.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I did not initially think I would be into it, but I was hooked from the first episode... It is a lot like I Am Legend.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|I found this book fascinating and informative, and I think the subject matter is very important to everyone - we all need to evaluate evidence in our daily lives, but in general we're not very good at it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for everyone - my prediction is that most people will enjoy it and benefit from it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was strange! I was puzzled and never seemed to connect  it to real life and kept trying to, I would not recomend it.
B005HHSYMW|5.0|This is a long book, and not always an easy read - Pinker draws on a huge amount of evidence in making a complex and controversial argument, so the text does get a bit heavy at times.<br /><br />However, I highly recommend this book to everyone. This is a life-changing book - it will change your basic conception of how the human world changes over time, and how our lives today compare to living conditions in earlier times. Pinker makes some rather large claims, and some academics do disagree with him, but his claims are all carefully considered and thoroughly supported with evidence (the reference list occupies the final quarter of the pagecount).<br /><br />In short: Read this book. You won't regret it.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I have this thing about finishing a book whether I really like it or not, this series is just not my cup of tea, I always seem to need to make  some sense of a story and I have not figured this one out yet!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The human antomaton should have been a real robot.  The special effects were good, the plot was good, but it didn't blow me away.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Still cannot add an appointment and have it sync TO MS Office. It syncs FROM Office just fine. I have to use the stock calendar to add &amp; sync on DROID 3. Fix this and it's 5 stars all day!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is a great book. I found it to be very inspirational. Not just for artists I highly recommend it to everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't mind paying 1.99 an episode. I don't have cable or satilight so this the only way i can keep up with one of the best series on TV
B001IWUZYK|5.0|Having read the book, it took a bit for the daughts to absorb that there are honorable differences between versions without attributing an insincerity to the film version.<br /><br />Oliver, The Artful Dodger, Fagen are Dickens characters that have sat atop the popular conscious and culture for more than 170 years, proving their adaptability and universality, something that most westerners can relate to on some level and either cheer for them or to jeer their protags.<br /><br />This '68 film puts music, sing-song and comic touch to destitute lives and desperate characters and will have one walking into the sunrise with songs in your head and your heart, and they'll last your lifetime - ....&#34;Food! Glorious Food!.....&#34;
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|It had many of the components of the original series - fun to watch, great special effects and dry humor
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The author wrote a thrilling and exciting Book One and could have stopped there.  I give the the second book two stars since the characters do not evolve but continue in the same circunstances, a disappointment to the reader.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Funny movie. I love it. Had me cracking up the entire movie.  It would be cool if they come up with a Ted 2, when ted meets an actual girl teddy bear.
B005TF24GO|5.0|I love that this two pack was so affordable and will be lots of laughs for my three busy sons!
B000Q9ISSQ|3.0|Excellent fun in the realm of Robert Hughes but more like Bruce Chatwin. An anecdotal trip across the country with genuine charm and love for the people and places he finds.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie!  And I was surprised this package included both color version and black and white version.  Good job.
0385535147|5.0|I love John Grisham as an author & have read all of his books. Can't wait until his next one appears
B004DMTCNM|5.0|I love all the actors in this and the storyline is interesting, it is action packed, happy, and sad... These prisoners have such great roles individually which gives it comedy as well one of my favorite movies....
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Love this show and I can't wait to get the next season.  Glad this will be continued for a third season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead season three has a great start. The second season was a little slow til the end, but season three has been really fast..
B00866H7SS|3.0|Lately most books have take a direction similar to fifty shades of grey, this one try to stay far like opossing ideas, but it is not different, i iexpected a little more.  it is well writen and i will follow the story to know the end
B007REV4T8|5.0|For me, this was the best Daniel Craig 007 movie.  I thoght the second was lame.  This one was action from beginning to end.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent streaming quality as long as there is no other internet being accessed at the same time! Fun
B00009R86L|5.0|The nice thing about this strap is the comfort AND the fact that the rubberized material minimizes slippage off the shoulder.  It could be improved if the rubber were black or brown, but that's just a cosmetic issue.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|While this book was definitely better than the dreadful \\"Matter\\", it didn't live up to the narrative, philosophical or humourous heights of Surface Detail.  A competent and whole Culture novel, with plenty of Mind banter, and that sheen of smugness that only Banks can deliver.  Definitely worth a read!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have to give kudo's to Amazon for this.  They could have stayed proprietary, as Apple has done throughout it's history in it's lust for making the quick buck.  Amazon has made it possible to read nearly a well on a pad (Motorola Xoom here) as you can on one of their Kindles.  You can easily send your books to the pad, your wife's pad, and your PC.  I have no complaints, and the text is so clear that I have read a couple of thousand pages without eye problems.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is not White Christmas. But I dont want it to be!! Cannot get much better than this. Ferrell..Caan..Zooey. Ed Asner as Santa. Bobby Newhart..wow!!
B009SMW9IW|1.0|Lovely album, but the MP3 download was FULL of distortion, most notable on tracks 3 and 4.  Thought it might be the speakers I was using, but this problem occurs on all three systems tested.  Furthermore, there is no method by which to obtain a refund for this type of purchase.  Mistake.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I DOWN LOADED THIS ITEM AND IT WOULD NOT INSTALL ON TO MY SYSTEM AND I UNISTALLED IT AND IT WOULD NOT DOWN LOAD ON MY SYSTEM. I KNOW IT WAS NOT MY TABLET BECAUSE ALL MY OTHER STUFF DOWN LOAD WITH NO PROBLEM.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|it is a good app and I hope that gameloft starts to make more and have a empire Gen.Jabari<br />7
1401937519|4.0|I only gave this book 4 stars because despite the fact that the author describes her experience well, I had a problem with her generalization that her experiences are true for everyone.<br /><br />We are all unique people at different stages of awareness and wake-fullnes and My personal experiences are that each one of us experience a NDR in somewhat different ways.<br /><br />That does NOT negate her experience and I feel that sharing her personal life can and actually has benefitted people.  The book changed the life of a dear friend who has been battling cancer off and on for almost 20 years.  When the cancer returned this year I bought the book for her.  She is now living her life to the fullest.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful, historically accurate novel with rich detail of characters and the intertwining of families and political conflict. I learned much more about the two great wars then I did in high school history class.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I like this movie.  Great for kids and adults alike.  I certainly enjoyed myself watching it as did my daughter and my 5 year old grandson
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Funny but not hilarious...had moments though. Worth renting, glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater. Made for an ok evening of entertainment.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie a lot.  Cher can still sing and Christina (who I had never heard of before) impressed me with both her voice and her acting.
B0087JTAKW|1.0|I though this book was very dull and confusing. It seemed that the author just wanted to end the story and hurriedly wrote an ending. Mitch Albom is an excellent writer and I am not sure what his thought processing was when he wrote this book. It was very depressing and I would not recommend this to read. It was a waste of money.
0061784788|4.0|I like J Rollins' writings  He does his research well and I find it interesting to learn something new when I take time to read a novel.<br />I enjoyed the book and recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. my brother has it on his ipod. but one question: where's the free version? he uses the demo. it runs exactly like the full version but you cant get some items.
B0001I562I|4.0|2 for acting and 3 for story  Still an enjoyable family movie which may seem a little outdated when watched today.
B009ZE27US|3.0|I'm 20years old and guest what it said I was 80 years old I that's why I said it was horrible so do not ever download this horrible game
B00003CXDD|5.0|I always loved this movie and finally was able to get a reasonably priced copy.  It was fun to watch it again
B007QA3AH2|4.0|It's a rock, it doesn't have any vulnerable spots! Great movie to pass a boring Saturday night. Love this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It was nice to see our hero have some difficulty during the story.  Bringing back old adversaries and dealing with them  in a different manner was also appreciated.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Mesmerizing story with constant surprises. The characters are real and g2rm's willingness to let any of them be killed off makes for stunning twists and turns. I really feel like I have no idea what's going to happen next with characters and a story that I am able to closely connect with.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I enjoy watching the adventures of these two young man.  They provide hope in a hopeless time!!  We are able to see Cass again and who knows, maybe we will see Bobby one day.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I have read in a while and very insightful into the inner workings of relationships.  This one kept me guessing.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Very simple, but keeps the brain working. Not much more to say on this topic of this game so there
B0076DELIG|3.0|A very uninspired story. Michael Connelly's Bosch books are usually real page turners but not totally improbable. Unfortunately, this exceeded the normal suspension of disbelief requirement.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Great! Nice graphics in which I enjoy walking through. No violence, knock them down and eliminate the enemy.  Fun app!
B000HKW7E0|2.0|Movie quality was fine. Played well. Arrived within a few days.<br /><br />I saw this years ago when I was a teen. Maybe I watched the TV edited version or something like that cause I didn't remember half the stuff in this movie. Yes it's very funny, but you ought to watch it first before you decide if you'd like your kids to. There's a lot of language and content that not so great for kids. By today's ratings I think this would be an R based on the language alone.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I love this singer, he has a great voice and this cd has the best of him. good quality cd.
B000FC11A6|1.0|Neal Stephenson's writing may appeal to some readers, but not this one. I review a lot of books and rarely if ever do I find one I just can't finish! Enter Crytonomicon. This was just a terribly uninteresting, intellectually vacuous piece of literature. It seemed to flop all over with disconnected rambling and boring episodes; although initially the beginning of the novel seemed okay, it progressively got worse as I read on.<br />I don't know whether the novel ever recovers as the end approaches, I couldn't get there. As a consequence of the extreme difficulty I had with the book, I really couldn't recommend it to anyone. You will have to decide for yourself whether you will take the leap and read it. Good Luck!
B000GOU4M4|5.0|What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  It is a must have around Christmas time.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great characters and plenty of them.  Plot takes on a wide track that keeps the reader active and coming back.Hard to put the book down.
B000OVLINI|5.0|It's a slow start but hang in there.............it's a great read! My sister suggested it and I'm glad she did.
B00866JL96|5.0|Great movie. Tear jerker, one of the best i have seen in a very long time. The cast and storyline is perfect.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The best dialogue. Demille is the best writer in America keeps you laughing while people are getting slaughtered. What a skill
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Connelly.  His books are special and a very enjoyable read.  I put him at the top of my read list always!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer  The ending was tantalizingly obvious. As usual a well spun yarn. An enjoyable read, not too much heavy thinking
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really like it though I wish there was more levels but worth the $0.99 you should get it if you have a dollar
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett once again works his magic on an era of untold change. He places his characters on the stage of impending war and continues thru the war and the birth of The League of Nations. He makes history come alive for his readers.A great read!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like the sounds and graphics. It is just a pleasant game to play, easy to understand and fun. The only complaint is that you need to buy more coins to keep playing.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|First time and might be the last time. Poor HD quality, chappy had to restart several times. I think i'll stick with my crappy netflix serivce. At least I get to watch my movies complete,
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is a page turner from page one. Well written, believable, developed characters, suspenseful plot, surprise ending,  Loved it!!
B002UDFNNO|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this peek into another side of Orwell.  His style just keeps you reading!  I also have spent time in both cities and that makes it all the more fun to read.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very different reading for me, which made it interesting. I liked it because there are happy endings. Also wanted to find out what the hype was about
B009ZE27US|2.0|Maybe someone just made this app so they could find out peoples ages when they post negative things about how of it is.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Rather formulaic, but it's got enough Family Guy-style humor (and fighting!) to set it apart from other comedies.  I'd recommend it.
B00AG4NSY0|4.0|I always look forward to a new Glee Christmas album because I have really enjoyed the first two so I went right out and bought this one. It has some good songs on it. &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34; is one of my favorite Christmas songs, and the cast did a nice job with it. I especially liked &#34;Noel&#34; sung by Marley (sp?) the new cast member it was beautiful. I didn't care for a couple of the more religious songs because I felt they were long, slow, and dragged a bit like &#34;Joy to the World&#34; and I just personally don't care for &#34;The Hanukkah Song&#34; in any context. So while I did enjoy more than half of the album, there were several songs I just didn't care for, whereas with the previous Glee Christmas albums I liked nearly all the songs.
B008MIMWOO|3.0|Usually when you buy blue-ray you get a digital copy to put on your phone or ipad etc. My one disappointment with this was the lack of any sort of digital copy.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Some funny moments but wouldn't say I was rolling on the ground laughing.  If your looking for a movie to take up a couple hours on a flight, this would be worth the rent.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is a good game if you have time to burn. I like it because you don't have to think a lot.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Excellent I highly rate this for the metal heads out there.  It's Lady Gaga mixed with screamo.  Can't wait for the next album
B0071XO8RA|4.0|i was told this was very good so i decided to try it. so far so great!!!<br />can't wait to finish it ;0)
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I admit, I was skeptical of a cyborg Cinderella...but this book is a lot of fun!  I really enjoyed Cinder's character and Prince Kai, and the whole development of the...futuristic mythology, if I can call it that.  Some of the side characters felt a little thin, but the world was fresh and the story was familiar but unique enough not to feel recycled.  I know some people didn't like Prince Kai.  I can't really understand why.  Personally I thought he was one of the more interesting male characters I've read about in a while, and I liked how the romance developed.  It all felt very real.  I'm excited to see what happens next in this series!
B005LAII1C|4.0|If you love family guy, you will enjoy. It has the crude humor as well as the random scenes they put in like the show. A must have.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|This is a fairly good poppy album from Taylor Swift. Seems like she's getting away from her country roots, especially with I Knew You Were Trouble.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you are a Batman fan. You need this. I love this series of movies. Lots of cool special features.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a very good book! It made you think a lot. It had an outstanding ending and is in my top 10 favorite stories.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use facebook to keep up with everybody so it's another tool in my arsonal. So if you are a facebook user, get it. Plus, it's free.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I had read the reviews of this story and the crying and thought 'yeah, sure'.  Don't get me wrong, I have cried whilst reading books before but this was different.  This was full on sobbing!! Be prepared for that.<br /><br />Love this book and would recommend it to EVERYONE!!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I'm glad I found this series of books. It's hard to find good books and this one was entertaining for sure. Looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was superb entertainment.  Great story, relevant dark undercurrents, on and on.  It was beautiful to watch.  I highly recommend the entire series
B0024F08UG|5.0|Saw this in the theater years ago and I'm happy to see that it is available on blu-ray finally! Yes, some of the special effects are abit dated, but you have to remember that they did all of these without the help of CGI- it's all REAL! Most of the characters are stock characters that we see in all 'disaster' type films, but you can't go wrong with a cast that includes Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Keep in mind that the building is the 'star' of this movie. Definately well worth the price (which was surprisingly low) for the blu-ray!! I really enjoyed the 'extra's that have been included on the disc, lots of cool information on the 'making of' this movie!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We really enjoyed this show! Great acting and plot, true to the spirit of Sherlock Holmes. If you are a Holmes fan give it a try.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Everything about this blu-ray film is spectacular!! The cast is excellant, the direction is outstanding, the sets are fantastic! Everything comes full circle in this film. Most film trilogies leave alot to be desired when the final film comes around, but this one just leaves me wanting more! I wish Chris Nolan and Christian Bale would continue making Batman films every three years- I would be happy with that, but all good things must come to an end. Here's hoping that Robin's tale will be told sometime soon......
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the books!  Couldn't put them down. Read the whole trilogy in a long weekend!  Would love to read more of what happened next!
B009DT98RK|5.0|Saw FCA 35 live, so I've been waiting for this blu-ray to be released.  Peter is an incredible musician and in an age where musicians love to entertain us with pyrotechnics and other special effects, Peter chooses to thoroughly and completely entertain us with .... music!  Me comes alive 35, as he calls it, doesn't have a bad track in the entire show.  LOVED it that he added Black Hole Sun instrumental and he brought tears to my eyes with While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  Anyone that is a casual or better fan of Peter MUST get this, 2 1/2 hours of music...so worth the money!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a great movie especially in conjunction with the book. Every time my little boy watches it his face lights up with wonder.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|One of the best fight scenes , I laughed hard at the scene . Some slow parts but overall I really enjoyed it , and have recommended it to many
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Shia LaBeouf stepped out of his comfort zone in this one and Tom Hardy was pretty awesome in his role.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|A gripping and very powerful movie -- one that is truly worthy of carrying on the &#34;Bourne&#34; tradition.  Highly recommended!
B008BM9L72|3.0|First book was fantastic - it should have ended there. Became too repetitive and felt like I was reading mills and boons classics at 16 all over again.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Was a over all deicent movie... I read the book and well things weren't exactly the same but the choice of actors and wardrobe was on par.. Kept me entertained and I will likely buy the movie in 3d.
B0094KF4WG|2.0|I hoped the book would focus immediately on the raid - it does not and drags us through lots of legacy training and missions etc to get there
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|The album title says it all.  What could be better than ear paradise.  Lana Del Rey has an amazing voice and the album is great.  If I could complain about anything its that there isn't more of it.  Quality does beat out quantity when it comes to music though.  If you liked her previous release Born to Die then you will love Paradise.  Paradise doesn't seem as dark to me but it is different and amazing all the same.
B000053RZD|5.0|This product was a 1973 pressing of a 72 lp and arrived half way around the world (south korea) without a blemish due to good packaging extra sleeve and honest sales description. great work
1402540957|5.0|I love Jeeves and Bertie Wooster.  Everybody should have a Jeeves to rely on.  Bertie not as lame as Aunt Agatha claims.
B007DVF5CC|4.0|If you are looking for a real story line and like romance novels and movies, this one is for you!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This is the first author I have read that I still get excited when he releases another book. I am five books in and am still enjoying them. I love where he is comeing from and the realilty he has created for his hero.. I enjoy learning and thinking about all the ways that people thru the ages have connected with their world and what they think is worship worthy at any given place and time. Thank you Kevin!!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This movie makes you feel like you are right there.  What is real and what is not?  This was great!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great feel good story for senior citizens and adults of all ages.  Life is what you make it.  It just does not happen.  Movie is not only funny and entertaining, but it contains many deep lessons for life.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love Casket and the direction this series is going. Stana and Nathan are wonderful together, can't wait for season six.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to read it twice because it was so good. Love their love story but also love the sex. A +
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|All the funny scenes are in the previews...and they're not that funny!  I'd save your money, and try a smaller, less-publicized film.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best season by far, and it gets better by the episode. There's a lot of ins, lot of outs, lot of what have you's.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My 8-year-old son races to this every morning, right after he wakes up! It hasn't disappointed him yet. Yeah...its expensive. That's the only reason i didn't give it five stars.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|This movie is hysterical and funny! it will make you belly laugh and make you cry.  The stars of this movie have a home run and run the gambit of emotions by portraying high school teenagers.  This movie is a must see for teens and parents alike!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|very disappointed. after 30 minutes I give up no clear directions on navigating through this game. probly wont be buying any others since cant afford to waste money even only if was .99 cents.
0811879542|5.0|Marvelously simple and a truly interactive experience. In concept and execution, one of the best children's books of all time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The season started off strong and is continuing to put out quality episodes each week and the downloads have been smooth.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book due to its controversial topic of nature vs nurture and how far one would go to protect their child. Intriguing characters, courtroom drama and a murder makes for a perfect page turning read.
1423140605|5.0|Our kids love this book.  They &#34;fought over&#34; on who gets to read it first when the book arrived.  Recommended.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I've read in a while. I love how he gets in depth on training.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My son likes the story so much.  He has read the book many times. When we went to Disney World, he spent almost one hour on Tom Sawyer Island.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett at his best.  I can't wait to read the sequel, Winter of the World.  Great insight into WWI
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game but I wish there were more instructions. I had to figure out for myself what to use certain items for, and when I figured it out I finally got some Bingos. my biggest complaint is that you don't get many cards per day.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Don't expect much of a plot.  Can the good guys overcome the bad guys from space with the tools at hand on an old battleship?!  You know you want this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I saw a kid playing this at church and really downloaded it for my own children but I've become strangely addicted to it. Fun timekiller.
B008602KQI|4.0|I love post-apocalyptic alternate universe fare.  If you're a fantasy/sci-fi buff, you'll like this film. A good add to anyone's collection.
1400067820|5.0|We all know what \\"fragile\\" means.  But what is the opposite of fragile?<br /><br />If you are like me, your instinctive response would be \\"robust\\" or perhaps \\"durable.\\"  But you would be wrong.<br /><br />Something that is fragile is damaged by an unexpected shock, whereas something that is robust or durable is able to withstand it.  To be robust is to be neutral to shocks.<br /><br />But what do you call the true opposite of fragile--something that actually benefits from shocks?<br /><br />As Nassim Taleb points out, there is no word in English (or in any other language, ancient or modern) that conveys this idea.  So he invented one--antifragile--and wrote an entertaining and enlightening book around the concept.<br /><br />Taleb is at times playful and even self-effacing in his writing and at other times insufferably arrogant and abrasive (\\"non-meek\\" in his words).  But he is always--and I mean always--thought provoking.<br /><br />Years ago, before Taleb become something of a celebrity, I picked up his original Fooled by Randomness and had something of a \\"eureka\\" moment.  Taleb put into words (and numbers) many of the abstract ideas about risk and randomness that I instinctively felt yet couldn't articulate (he had that effect on a lot of people, it would turn out).  In particular, I had always mistrusted the Value-at-Risk metric and its offshoots that had been crammed down my throat as an undergraduate finance student.  It registered on my \\"bulls_t detector\\", to borrow one of Taleb's earthy phrases, and history would vindicate this gut reflex with implosion of the financial system in 2008.<br /><br />I still consider Fooled to be his best book, and if you have never read Taleb's work that is where I would recommend you start.  But Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder expands on the concepts in Fooled and its follow-up The Black Swan and goes far beyond financial markets into a more general theory of randomness and volatility and their importance in life and nature.  \\"Living things are long volatility,\\" he emphasizes often.<br /><br />Perhaps Taleb's greatest gift as a writer is his ability to speak in metaphors, the best of which is his analogy of the Procrustean Bed.<br /><br />Procrustes was a nasty little fellow from Greek mythology who would invite guests into his home and then either stretch or amputate parts of their legs to make them fit just right in his guest bed.  In Taleb's analogy, much of the modern world is a Procrustean bed of sorts.  People, markets, and economic systems are contorted to fit tidy theories.<br /><br />But in Antifragile, Taleb goes beyond this \\"square peg in a round hole\\" argument to a larger critique of \\"soccer moms\\" (both figurative and literal) who naively attempt to make the world safer by \\"sucking randomness out to the last drop.\\"  Doing this provides the illusion of safety while actually making us less resilient and more fragile.  In other words, not only are scraped knees and bruises ok, they are an essential part of growth.<br /><br />Many readers misunderstand Taleb's core message.  They assume that because Taleb writes about unseen and improperly calculated risks, his objective must be to reduce or eliminate risk.  Nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />If anything, Antifragile is a celebration of risk and randomness and a call to arms to recognize and embrace antifragility.  Rather than reduce risk, organize your life, your business or your society in such a way that it benefits from randomness and the occasional Black Swan event.<br /><br />Taleb's own life is a case in point.  He had the free time to write Fooled, The Black Swan and Antifragile because--in his own words--he made \\"F___ you money\\" during the greatest Black Swan event of our lifetimes, the 1987 stock market crash.  And to demonstrate that Taleb's trading style is antifragile, had the 1987 crash never happened, Taleb would not have been materially hurt.  His trading style puts little at risk butallows for outsized returns.<br /><br />In what may seem somewhat disturbing to some readers (and Taleb himself is disturbed by it as well), what makes a system antifragile is that its individual pieces are perishable.  Natural selection--the survival of the fittest--requires that the unfit are allowed to fail.<br /><br />Using the example of restaurants, the restaurant sector is robust because the failure of any one restaurant does not affect the others.  And the restaurant sector is antifragile because the remaining players actually learn and grow from witnessing the mistakes made by the failed restaurant.<br /><br />Now, compare this to the banking system.  The world banking system is inherently fragile because the failure of one bank leads to contagion that can cause the failure of other banks and of the system itself.<br /><br />The importance of failure to an antifragile system is a recurring theme to the book.  As individuals and as a collective, we learn more from mistakes than from successes.  In a capitalist system, you need a replenishable  supply of entrepreneurs willing to take risks.  For every failed business idea, our knowledge base expands.<br /><br />Taleb goes so far as to advocate we treat ruined entrepreneurs in the same way we honor dead soldiers, \\"perhaps not with as much honor, but using the same logic.\\"<br /><br />As Taleb explains, just as \\"there is no such thing as a failed soldier, dead or alive (unless he acted in a cowardly manner), likewise there is no such thing as a failed entrepreneur  or failed scientific researcher.\\"  Their sacrifice makes the system stronger.<br /><br />I commend Taleb on another book well written, and I recommend Antifragile along with Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan.<br /><br />This review first appeared on [...]is disturbed by it as well), what makes a system antifragile is that its individual pieces are perishable.

1451695187|5.0|This book is written in easy to understand terms. It will keep you spellbound and wanting more. At this point I am only half way through it, but I had my wife read it first and she was enthralled with it as I am.<br />His view of life after death takes a very different course than I have ever thought of and gives you something to think about.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book<br /><br />. As I said I thought Dr. Alexander being a neurosurgeon  would be hard to read, using medical terms not known to everyday people, but he puts it into easy to read terms and makes it very hard to put down.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Hysteria was the first CD i ever owned, so it's great that this is back in a collector's edition.  The remastered music sounds great and the bonus material rounds out the package nicely.  It's a great find.
0316228532|1.0|I bought this book thinking that J.K. Rowling did such a wonderful and captivating series as Harry Potter, this book would be a wonderful read..How wrong I was.<br />It feels as though Ms. Rowling put nothing into this book, there is no heart and soul in it. It is a mish mash of characters that is hard to keep together.<br />IF this is the true writing skills of Ms. Rowling I hope she kept her day job.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|I personally met with the author to discuss some macroeconomics. Great book, but a bit dry to be honest. Jim Robinson is a cool guy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I never thought I would enjoy this type of story but it was Very Interesting when Christine's shell started to brake under Ana's soothing love.  This was a good story.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is very cute and well done. Polished comicy graphics are very good, and the touch interface is very responsive and good for timing your jumps between flowers. Other than that it is a simple physics puzzle game that rewards thinking about how to get stars and the grub at the end.
1401937519|5.0|I would highly recommend Anita's book to anyone who has questions about their life's purpose or the experience of &#34;making our transition&#34;. She is articulate and focused in sharing her near death experience as well as applying the insights she gained from her entire life and &#34;death&#34; journey.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This is a very good movie. The storyline keeps you guessing throughout. Good entertainment. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. do a wonderful job and work well together.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I got this for 10 bucks and thats a good deal for an okay movie. The extras make the movie better and honestly I have NO idea why they left them out, it made the movie BETTER.<br /><br />If you didnt really hate this movie but you liked a little, 10 bucks is a good deal. The extras on are youtube so you dont have to buy this if all you want is the edited parts.<br /><br />I like this movie when I saw it but I like it to 4 stars having the extras with it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very addicting. Great outfit ideas, home improvement idea, and food ideas. Easy to use! And it links to Facebook friends...so you can see what they are into too.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I liked this movie it was really funny the only part is if your not aware and might be sensitive to mentally handicap jokes, there is a less than funny moment Ben Stiller does. Its not cruel but its a pretty over the top mimic of the mentally handicap. I wasnt totally offended and its comedy so youre supposed to lighten up, but that scene is a bit harsh.<br /><br />The story is funny, Robert Downey was great in it, and Jack Black was minor in this movie but really cool. The REAL show stopper was Tom Cruise as the agent, holy cow! Give me a movie with just that guy, totally awful so bad its funny.
B000FA5STS|5.0|The twists and turns of the storyline keep you engaged and the characters are so well defined I hated to see the story end
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Heartfelt, beautiful songs from a truly classic and unique voice. Can't wait to hear what's next... Hopefully with the new baby it will be a bit happier!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great Christmas movie. We watch it every year around the holidays. The movie loaded quickly and had great quality. Recommend watching it!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I am retired and went to see this at the theaters with friends, also retired. It was heartwarming, humorous, and very entertaining.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books leave you wanting more. I delved right into Wool Six and then Wool Seven and found that I have done more reading in the past few weeks than I have in years being hooked like Velcro in Wool. Every time I put the book down, I could  almost hear the tearing that drove Morty Seinfeld crazy. Hugh writes with a smooth style that encapsulates you in the skin of the characters and their plight. Keep working Hugh. You have people counting on you.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I purchased this title because part 2 was in the theatre. All my co-workers were saying how good part was so I wanted see part 1 first. I really liked it. Good movie!!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Now this man can make beautiful music! This album is a good example and well worth listening to. I would recommend it even if you are not a fan of Hawaiian music.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Tom Hardy delivers again with a great performance. He is the older brother to Shia Labeouf's character and his acting and demeanor makes you truly believe that he is just that.  Shia Labeouf actually comes through. Even though its a slow character development for him it well worth the wait.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Loved it! Straight to the point. Read it every time I need motivation--good way to slap you into reality! The key to this book working, is believing. I found this book when I was having trouble settling into my career--I will be re-reading this book over and over I feel, until every word sinks through!
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Loved the dancing and choreography. Good family movie. Cute love story thrown into story line. My youngest child is 7 and the oldest 14.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|a little too difficult for my six year old son, and I thought it was challenging. too.  he's actually even better than me
B000002LRX|5.0|Probally FNM best album to date, but thats just my opinion. You get everything you want and more from this album. Well worth the money you spend.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Loved the free game, all the extra content made buying Elite a no-brainer. Can't stop trying new characters. Must.. crush.. Steel Song Clan.
0930289528|5.0|If you've seen the movie, but not read this, your wrong. OH and all you little occupy doche bags should take off that damn mask. I'm willing to bet 99% of you don't even know what its all about...Wankers.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|.I do not know why this film did not do better, but my family and I quite enjoy this film a lot.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love to watch this with my friends every year, no matter which friends! It makes for good quotes to get everyone laughing and happy!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game for everyone. I took the Kindle from my mother and played it and did not want to put it down.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|I really liked this fighter/flight sim when my buddy had it on his phone & now that I have it on my Kindle Fire HD....well, it's even better! Decent graphics, sound & realism.
B007Z9QS5K|3.0|Not the greatest movie in the world. Definitely a one time watcher for anyone besides kids. Definitely have to close your eyes on some parts (for the kids I mean).
B003H4RDZQ|5.0|I'd never read anything by Sedaris prior to reading Holidays on Ice for a book club, and it was by far one of the most hilarious things I've ever read. I would suggest not reading it around others because you will laugh uncontrollably and inappropriately.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|My family and I were hoping the first one of the Journey movies would come out on 3D, and low and behold it has. We are so excited that as soon as we got it, we sat down and watched it. It was fantastic. Very excited about the Journey movies, and hope they come out with more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing this game but find it hard to see.  Could be a little larger for us senior girls.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|They go around singing, &#34;Everybody wants to be a cat.&#34; It is hilarious. An excellent family film that everyone should watch and enjoy.
B000001ESF|3.0|This CD doesn't sound as clear as my older (original release) CD.  It sound/seems washed out IMHO. It doesn't matter how I tune my player.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|This is such an incredible family fun film. My kids have already seen it over 3 times. They go nuts over it. We love the Ice Age series.
B000001ESP|3.0|This CD doesn't sound as clear as my older (original release) CD.  It sound/seems washed out IMHO. It doesn't matter how I tune my player.
B008KEQM3W|5.0|This is  a great movie to show how many things can happen and that you are never prepared no matter which situation you are in. The lamaze classes are just a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY and time.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Still just as good as it was when I listened to them on my records. (Ok so I am old)
B005LAIIQC|5.0|My family and I loved this continuation of the Bourne films. We hope that the next one they will have Bourne and Cross meet. :) THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!  I know a lot of people did not like it, but once you realize that this happened at the same time as the other movies, towards the end, etc than things make sense. GREAT FILM!! Sorry the critics are so harsh on this film.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have to say this is my all time favorite love story. I have a quote from the movie on the wall of my bedroom.
B007RTAR64|5.0|LOVE THE LOOK, the barbie is a great likeness to Katniss. So glad I got two of them, as I plan on getting other outfits for her, and posing her. :)
B000065KNV|5.0|I am a horror/thriller/ghost movie freak!!  I absolutely love this movie!! I've seen it at least 20 times! I always catch something that i missed the last time I watched it!<br />Would recommend to everybody who loves these kinds of movies!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I liked this film, although very dark of all the Snow White flims, this is a good one, and definitely change of pace.
B007N6ZH5M|4.0|Captivating and very well researched.  Recommended for university students,laymen, finance people and economists alike. I am sure to use this as a reference
B007URCTOG|3.0|I was expecting more, but it did not live up to my expectations. I thought this was okay, a great one time watcher, nothing else.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Great game to keep in touch with friends and family. Not compatible with Kindle fire. Too bad. Hope Kindle picks it up
B006P0FIB0|5.0|Love this version of the musketeers. I hope they do another one, since they left it at the end, open ended for another one. Great film, love it on 3D.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|i really enjoyed looking at this. there's even a whole section for professionals, but i didnt feel i needed that, since im just a teen. it gives brief info on teen makeup and says she has a book specifically for that so i think i might try that
B008602KQI|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. Everyone should read the books first then watch the movie. It will make it 10 times better.
0451232577|5.0|This is an excellent book. Another masterpiece by the author.  I look forward to the remaining books in this series.
B00466HNHM|5.0|Love this film. Whitney Houston had one of the best voices in history. She reached notes effortlessly and her songs touched so many. Great film that helped show her incredible talent.
B00000I0XW|5.0|The woman I love also loves it.  I made a lot of points with her with this CD given as a gift.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|The only downside is that you CANNOT play all the episodes without the credits, which completely stinks. Love the definition though. Absolutely one of my most favoritest films ever.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Small and convenient. Charge super fast. I Had bought several car charger but this is super good. I highly recommend it.
B002Q9VP3O|5.0|I love Jane Austen movies and Emma is definitely one of the greats. It finally being on blu ray is awesome!! Recommend it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This must be one of the most boring books ever written. The &#34;plot&#34; moves on through mind-numbing sameness, with the limited vocabulary of the characters its only redeeming feature...  At leat this aspect raises a laugh.
B0015F1VY8|5.0|Love the films on Amazon, I just wish I could get subtitles, as that is the only downside to any of the Amazon films. Great movie and very accurate to what really happened.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|The &#34;good stuff&#34; is in the pro Version, with which I am happy.  I found lite no use because there was no way to search for an address.  I usually know where i am, it's where I WANT to go for which I need a map.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love the fact that this movie is on 3D, the kids and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Everyone should get this film as this is one of the best films ever made.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|the original robin hood with Errol Flynn is still the best version of this classic tale.  Basil Rathbone is excellent in this movie, his best non-sherlock homes role.  if you want to watch a fun family movie this is a classic
B007X15GRQ|3.0|I had no idea what to expect, but I did like it, definitely not for kids of any nature. Try it out you might like it.
1469984202|5.0|I ordered this for my Son, but I hear there is another book in the series that should be read first.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I recommend this TV show for everyone. This is the best TV Show ever put on TV. Everything about it is great, love the twists to the original stories and the embellishments. Absolutely phenomenal.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|People describe Barbara Streisand's voice as 'like butter'.  Susan' Boyle's voice should be described as 'molten gold&#34;.  What a voice!!  She was made to sing this kind of music.  There are many good singers out there but none with a voice more beautiful than this great lady  I believe this is her best album so far and that is saying something!  Just magnificent!!!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|OH MY GOODNESS!!! Seriously, all the good reviews about this movie, have got to be kidding me. The movie was basically about how wimpy batman is, and does not show Batman of who he truly is. The villains voice is ridiculous and annoyed me the ENTIRE TIME, not to mention he was this super being that knew EVERYTHING there is to know about EVERYTHING, and how he could take a punch no matter what. Just horrible film all around, thank goodness we only rented it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|I was hooked by the first episode's premise and great writing. The story is really good, with twists and turns and well-developed characters. But as someone who finds even soft porn disgusting,  the first 4 or 5 episodes were over the top. Too bad Showtime feels the same need as HBO and others to exploit their freedom in that area.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We were very fortunate to wait for Avatar on 3D, instead of paying over $100 for this movie like a lot of other people who could not wait for this to come out. My Husband saw it in theaters, and recommended it. It is definitely one of the best 3D films of all time.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This latest Lee Child &#34;Reacher&#34; action thriller does not disappoint. Thank goodness Child is a prolific writer. The next book can't come soon enough.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great family film on 3D, and cannot wait to see it again. I am so glad we own this movie. Everyone should no matter if you have kids or not.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love this movie!! Always brightens my day!!! Instant holiday classic!!! Elf always helps me get in the holiday spirit by singing loud for all to hear!
0545265355|5.0|This is a great set. Love hardcovers for books. They are better than paperback, and the Hunger Games trilogy is awesome. Everyone should read them.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I kept waiting for retribution....and didn't get it.  The beginning and middle of book held my attention but at the end, I was totally pissed!
B007UXT6T6|5.0|We watched this on Amazon before actually buying it, and it was awesome. Hate the fact that there are no subtitles, but overall awesome movie, the best out of all of them.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|At 54, she reminds me how joyous life and love was, is, and can be.  I am young again through her music.
B000HF6XPY|5.0|This is a little old school, but love this movie even though it is old fashioned. ;)  Everyone should watch it.
0756655307|5.0|This was an amazing buy. You can read and learn so much about all of your favorite super heros & Marvel classic characters, and characters you never knew even existed.  This encyclopedia will keep my family busy for hours! It's got everybody alphabetized as well and the pictures inside are fun to look at as much as the descriptive stories.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of the best family and just best films of all time. Recommend this for everyone and anyone. JUST AWESOME!!!
0740748475|5.0|My four sons grew up with Calvin & Hobbs. This collection is on display at each one of their homes. When visiting, we can pull a volume out and relive some great times together.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|Bought for my 5 year old son (who loves puzzles and board games) and it was NOT a hit.<br /><br />There is no real goal (except to keep a ball from falling) and it was difficult to see where the ball even was at times because of so much crammed into the sphere.<br /><br />I thought, hey, maybe I'll send this to another family member but after playing with it for a few minutes I decided it was about as fun as balancing a mable along the length of a pencil.<br />I am in process of returning it.
B0086449YA|5.0|A great 2 disc from Mr.Knopfler.All of the songs are on his softer side.If you liked the ragpickers dream you'll love privateering.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I bought this movie for my 18 year old daughter as a Christmas gift and when it arrived it was better than I expected. Not only did she live the movie but all of the extras that came with the collector's edition.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Always looking for something new to read. This book was romantic , entertaining , fun ...<br />It was a great
B001NLKXK2|5.0|this book was so moving, so real, so beautifully written.  i could imagine myself as alice.<br />i love how lisa genova manages to take a horrible situation and teach us a lesson - show hope and reconciliation and so much laughter and love.<br />please don't make me wait too long for another!  i read all three books in two weeks.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love all of Michael Connelys books and especially Harry Bosch. The Black Box is a great book. I believe that I have read most of the Harry Bosch books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I must start by saying that I cannot bring myself to write in my Bible. I know that lots of people do and that is great for them.  My handwriting is awful and this lets me type notes like bookmarks.  I also like to have different translations to compare.  This app gives you numerous translations (all of the popular ones and some I didn't know about).  This app also gives you access to over a hundred devotional studies.  Do you want a 2 week study on forgiveness?  You can find that.  Do you want a read the Bible in a year plan?  There are several of those.  Are you a teen living with depression?  Devotionals for all these situations and more.  This is the best app I have found for the Bible and it is the most valuable addition I've ever added to my smartphone and kindle.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I am not too sure what the hype was all about with this movie. It started off quite funny but it went down south afterwards. I am glad I rented it instead of wasiting my $$ in the theaters.
B00633W614|4.0|A rousing family saga, with unforgettable, finely drawn characters--almost Dickensian.  The plot and subplots move fast and only occasionally seem contrived.  All in all, a terrific read.  I'm waiting for the next installment!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Couldn't resist the title.<br />Fun and easy read with some twists and turns. Reminded me of Hitchhiker's guide- don't know why!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Some people complain this is no BBC Sherlock- and they are correct- it is completely different take (sans the modern day aspect) -and while it could be considered weaker in comparison to it's BBC cousin (after all each BBC episode is for all intents a feature) ,  if taken on it's own merits, it is a great show, giving us an interesting look at a familiar character, without taking away the thing that made him interesting in the first place.  I enjoy the differences that are brought in by Watson being a female, and really appreciate the fact that we have a promise from the producers that romance will never play into Holmes and Watson's relationship.  Great show, takes the procedural formula up quite a few notches in my opinion.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|Couldn't really use it without hitting JOIN HULU  for free that was in the way....deleted at once then had to get rid of HULU spam  ...Unless you want Hulu don't bother
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|it started to get boring near the end of the movie -but left it open for sequel which was expected
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|An excellent movie.  It is so moving, made me cry.  I would recommend it to everyone.  You have to see it.
0316069884|5.0|I've been a vegetarian/sometimes vegan since I was 5 (25 years now) and lately, I've been starting to question why I don't eat meat. I originally became a vegetarian for moral reasons, but am sometimes jealous of my friends who can eat anything anywhere. This book not only infuriated me, but solidified and reminded me why I am a vegetarian (and proud of it!). Thank you for this informative and inspiring book. I think the information is presented in a way that makes you question, without trying to make people feel guilty or telling them what to do.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I finally got to see this movie.  It is a great true story.  Love this movie so much.  Made me cry.  I recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|But overall the writing was not good.  Story was oddly told and disjointed to me.  Wife read two chapters and put it down.
1400052181|5.0|Well written, well researched, a fascinating topic to those in the Life Sciences and those who are not. An important, and entertaining book.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book has lots of good information and examples for economists and forecasters as well as the general reader. Highly recommended.
0307878937|5.0|Enjoyed the book and have now engaged in the study of floriography.  I have turned others on to this delightful art.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Read this after Girl Gone. I reallt enjoy Flynn's unique writing style. This was a very dark subject but very well laid out. Hard book to put down.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Usually I really enjoy Grisham's stories.  But this one took me quite awhile to read.  I had difficulty following it.  The ending was surprising and after all was said and done it was a crafty piece of work!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book keeps you on your yours the entire time. just when you think you've got it figured out... you don't. I will be reading this series again ... Asap!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I read before going to sleep; one night I couldn't go to sleep thinking about the story so had to continue reading. I couldn't figure out the ending either....something I like.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|For a first time director this was a great showing.  It's not one of those movies that you have to think about the story line.  The laughs keep coming and jokes are well crafted.  If yoy need to tune out the world around you and like some potty humor mixed in then Ted is a good pick.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|Manipulated plot, no life in the characters, P.D. James wrote the book to make hey with popular figures and instead she made mud.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Collecting the items is exciting.  Highly recommend.  Enjoy it while watching tv.  Fun fun fun
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Great Product!! works perfectly and seamlessly with compatible products...<br />Can be oriented in any direction and still works great, unlike other after market products that work well only in one oreintation mode.<br /><br />Leo.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Look anywhere online and you will see accolades for this British reboot of the classic Sherlock Holmes series. Great acting, intriguing stories, and that British humor! Can't wait for season 3
B000A2RRF4|5.0|if u love michael buy this. thats really all there is to it. this is an amazing concert and u would b lucky to have it
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Don't ask me why, but I love this movie, even though I don't like war movies in general. Maybe it's the aliens, maybe it's the characters, maybe it's the odd touch of humor, but this movie stands out in my mind as one of the best of a mixed genre. This may be a sci-fi war flick, but it plays as a realistic account of how things would go down if we were attacked by aliens who wanted our planetary resources. No ninjas, no ridiculous gymnastics, no long expositions about the hows and whys of the aliens, just a story about a bunch of everyday soldiers who are given an assignment to save civilians who end up having greatness thrust upon them. I watch it whenever it comes on TV, but have the option of putting it on the player anytime.
B0000029LF|5.0|haven opened it yet but im sure its amazing. i think im gonna keep it unopened and keep it as collectible. all the best hits!
B004132HZS|5.0|This initial outing of the new Sherlock Holmes is superior to other attempts to modernize Holmes in so many ways. Casting is brilliant, although it can take a few minutes to adapt to a curly-headed Holmes and a bowler-free  Watson, but one moves past that quickly. One of the few times when the fans and critics seem to agree--Brilliant!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great adventure with many long time film stars, but the newcomers hold up their end of the story as well.  Not being British, we had to watch the film twice to pick up all the nuances of the dialogue, but it is a film that is easy to watch more than once.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I was a Marvel reader for many years when I was younger so this is a real treat. Many of the characters were launched in other movies so you didn't have to wait around for their origin stories. This movie launches right in to the action and doesn't stop. The plot is good, the characters and effects are great, and the humor really shines through. Can't wait for the next one!
B001AXOFS4|5.0|A unique talent with a soulful voice and meaningful lyrics, no fluff.  Great album.  A wonderful addition to my collection. Not to be missed.
B00005MP58|5.0|Brillliantly acted and true to the books, the chemistry between the actors is palpable. And who wouldn't love this Mr. Darcy?
B005ERWYH6|5.0|One of the best follow-up albums of all time. Hard to believe she could top 19, but she did.  Another wonderful additiion to my collection and an album not to be missed.
B000T433CO|5.0|I like all the characters and the actors who play them. It has something that everyone can relate to and takes you from La to England and back.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Siege Hero is my favorite mobile game and it makes me very happy that it's now available for Android devices.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Great cd by Ke$ha....can't ever get enough of her!!!  Wish there were more upbeat songs but it is still a great cd.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is a page turner. I thought that it was dark and it kept me wanting to know more. I found the whole book pretty depressing, but overall it kept me engaged.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|This is every kids dream .could not have picked a better cast.wahlburg is awesomely funny and sincere in character. Who doesnt want a talking bear? Lol
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Serial show that keeps the suspense and horror going.  Great characters and acting.  Great evolving story line.  I love it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very well written, well researched that brought back memories of historic times I lived through. Almost seamless in following the first book of the series.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|For those that love Angry Birds and Star Wars, this one couldn't get any better.  Love it.  But I love defeating the Bad Piggies.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I like the method of his writing/story telling but the actual story was screwed up. Awful book. I am disgusted that someone even thought this up! What a way to give people bad ideas about how to handle marital discord. The author needs some serious therapy.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Fabulous series --- riveting. When will season 2 be ready for viewing? The acting is incredible. No matter it received so many Emmy nominations.  Can't wait to see the next group.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|wicked additive and fun to play. keeps you busy when you are bored. I so would recommend. this to anyone.
B008458O3S|5.0|several challenges presented and the kid ate it up as fun.  its a good game, i played with it.  in order, mash up, equal length/time, rr crossing, switches.  outstanding for free.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|A great follow on program on WB to fill the gap left by Smallville.  A recommended hit for DC fans.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I had my doubts about this show but I was hooked during the very first episode!  So many good twists and turns!  Great characters.  The girls wear the coolest clothes I'm always waiting to see what cute things they will wear next!<br />And just when you think the girls figure things out, the mystery and suspense starts all over again!  Sometimes it's even just the right amount of down right scary!!  Not for under 13 year olds for sure.  That's my opinion.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I loved this game! it had a great selection of puzzles.  I didn't want it to end. I reccomend it to any puzzle lover!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|i love this series! i cant wait for the movie to come out. itll be amazing. now onto book three
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A five star rating would mean it was one of the best books I've ever read - it wawsn't but it was the usual great Grisham read. He always keeps you guessing.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|The quality was great. The action was great. However movies have to be more than that now especially if your going to continue a saga like this one. I was super excited to see this and then I ended up falling asleep in the middle of it because there was no suspence. The marketing was awesome on this one however because they managed to get me to watch it just because of the previous movies. To some it up...Go watch Nikita its way better!!!!
0143119419|5.0|I purchased this book for my son.  He said it is a good book, personally it is not my cup of tea, but he enjoyed it.  Based on his comments, I recommend it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|No one can beat Flynn, with the possible exception of Jack Higgins.  I can't wait to get the next book by either of them.  So what if Higgins' has the same characters and plot.  I still can't put either of their books down.
B009QD0MYQ|5.0|Nothing more to be said. It is a good cd with good music. I enjoy listening to it.  Thank you very much.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Breaking Bad is by far the best show on TV. The last two episodes of season three are thrilling to say the least.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|As you progress through this book, it gets better and intensifies with the turn of each page.  I would definitely recommend this!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham knows the formula for a great story.  This totally fictional tale is a deviation from the norm for Grisham, who usually bases his fiction on either actual characters, or situations.  However, he doesn't miss a beat as he delivers an intriguing yarn which will hold your attention and keep your fingers at the corner of the page, to save time turning to the next one.  Grisham's fans have something to read this Holiday Season, that will both provide a 'Grisham fix', make the time fly.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This version works great and did not require a Ph.D. set up and operate. It only has basic options, but there are more advanced options available in another version.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|After two amazing albums credited to their short and, so far, promising career, I wouldn't expect another \\"five star\\" album from B.C.C., but the guys were able to deliver another great album. I missed more vocal participation from Joe Bonamassa and also more guitar solos from him, but the ones presented in this album are very good. Derek Sherinian is good as always, but this time his performances are more audible. Jason Bonham is perfect, a huge contribution for the \\"heaviness\\" of the B.C.C. sound. Glenn is my perfect singer in the rock world, so my oppinion is always the same: he is the \\"Voice Of Rock\\". Buy it, you won't regret it.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|A lot of work put into this movie and it shows. Songs are catchy. Excellent and highly recommended. Would watch it again in a heartbeat.
B0071R43MG|3.0|One star for the final quality of the Blu-Ray DVD. Excellent production. Another one for the performances of all the members in the band. And, finally, another star for the \\"never released\\" songs from Joe's new album. But, unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the reviewers; we don't need another live version of \\"Always with Me, Always with You\\" as well as some other songs too! Joe has a vast repertoire and his new band is amazing, so I don't understand why he has to repeat some songs, which have been included in all of his live DVD's. For fans and JS's guitar playing style followers.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Excellent story, really well done. We're looking forward to the next one! As far as family friendliness, we think it's appropriate for our 9 year-old boy and older. The scary parts aren't too scary, the violence isn't gory, and the lewdness is almost non-existent. Language is mild, with most of it coming from Robert Downy Jr.<br /><br />Some things that stick out in my mind for clarification:<br />- There is an obvious relationship between Pepper and Tony Stark. They exchange flirtatious remarks, looks, and contact.<br />- There is one scene (not giving away spoilers!) where Loki does something pretty violent and gross- a part I would consider to be the most gruesome part of the movie. A parent should be able to anticipate this scene since it's set up pretty clearly.<br />-There are some pretty ugly aliens.<br />-Profanity (that I can recall): d**n, s.o.b. (again, mostly by Tony Stark)
B009FZFONO|5.0|So far the best TV series our there.  I can't wait to see the rest of the series.  I never would have thought that it could be this good.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The book gets better as you move through it. There are some dead spots, but mostly it is hard to put down.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  The character and plot development kept your interest from start to finish.  Kate Morton is a truly a magnificent story teller.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always like Mitch Rapp stories and this outdid all of them combined.  Supposed to write 8 more words and am not!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this easy and quick to read.  th medical or technical sections were presented in layman's terms.  comforting and interesting
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Great American classic war movie about Vietnam. So many great quotes from the drill instructor that will last through the ages.
B009PAETCG|5.0|So much fun.  Really addicting.  A must get app.  I play it all the time.  I just keep on playing.
0525478817|5.0|I randomly picked this book off Amazon reviews, didn't know the author (although I guess he is a reasonably big name). It didn't seem like a plot line I would enjoy but it had good reviews, and I can see why! There is some really profound and amazing dialog, much more mature than you would expect from the teenage characters. I've recommended it several times and bought a copy for Christmas!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Not really a great end to the franchise. It feels like the whole middle of the movie could have been removed and you wouldn't have missed much.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  I'm pre-ordering the second season and I can't wait to get it.  Claire Danes amazes me as does all the cast.  Terrific!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Didn't download this one. Have no Idea what it is. Will have to try and find out about it I guess
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Pretty much this book could have been condensed with the girl who played with fire, which of the two I did prefer this book better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game taxes your brain at times.  Its fun and it gets to where you don't want to quite playing it
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Jude Law is wonderful and Rachel McAdams. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as ever in this hit.
B008SLAXGO|4.0|This book shows some fantastic images of GaGa and was a great buy for this price. There were some markings on the cover, looks a bit work, but the interior pages are in perfect condition. All in all a great buy. Shipping was also very fast.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Nice story about the nice girl taming the wild boy.  Had some good twist and enjoyed when he realized he was in love, but couldn't handle it.
B007KB15BA|5.0|I am a long time Metal fan and most albums have at least 3 bad songs and some overlong boring intro.<br />Not this album, every song rocks and it has really good replay.<br />Unless you only listen to modern faux metal pop music I can't see why any metal fan would not get every song on Stalingrad stuck in his/her head.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Love Love Love Love love love love love love love love love love love love luv this trilogy!! Must reads!!
B009FZFONO|4.0|Just pretty good. Can't complain. Plot has a couple of things that are a little goofy, but other than that, looking forward to the rest of season 3!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|We rec'd this after having Kindle issues and once we rec'd new cable, still had issues, but then we rec'd new Kindle without issues, returned the old one and have not had any problems since. Good job Amazon.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|As all movies with tense,psychological,and added suspense,the movie will be great and a let down at the same time..Don't get me wrong,I loved it,I just know I'll have to wait on pins and needles for the sequel!!  Way to go,5 stars to all.....
B003L77G06|5.0|I SURE LIKED THE PRICE AND THEY ARRIVED PROMPTLY. FOUND THEM FOR A MUCH HIGHER PRICE ELSEWHERE, SO ALL IS GOOD! UNOPENED AS YET
B008SVS0K0|5.0|Our boys from Streetsville continue to do us proud holding their own on the global stage of rock. This album is solid as the more I listen to it, the more depth, innovation, and talented writing and production are revealed. Powerful and energizing guitar chord progressions and amazing vocal harmonies drive Billy Talent to a new high.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|JUST WHAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTS AND AT A TERRIFIC PRICE, VERY PROMPT ARRIVAL. A GIFT, UNOPENED YET. AM SURE SHE WILL LIKE IT.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Too much info being shared...too many hurt feelings. I have had too many friends get hurt and others who post useless photos showing every minute of their day...but I can't unfriend them or they get hurt. It sucks!
B008EK91XU|5.0|I love to read about real people Ian Thorpe is inspiring and never gives up on the challenge.<br />His experience in life so far has been amazing.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I'm sure that all of this worked well for him but for someone who has a job and stays busy and has a budget, this is just not that easy to do.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Somehow, the writing in this novel did not come up to the level I expected.  Maybe it was me, but the writing seemed perfunctory.
0802473156|5.0|Just brilliant.  I looked for this book in Arabic for some of my students who expressed an interest in it.  My copies, warn and dog-eared and some of them long lost or &#34;forever borrowed&#34;, I find must be consistently replaced.  The search continues, but the book really is just that good.  Though written by a Christian, he's not writing just for Christians.  Chapman includes this information in his book, but it's worth restating here: this book is for any and all faiths, or none at all, because it's all about people and their relationships.  The book, and all it has to say, is uniquely, wholly unifying.  This one is for humanity.
1419705849|5.0|\\"A time to weep, And a time to laugh; A time to mourn, And a time to dance;\\" -- Ecclesiastes 3:4 (NKJV)<br /><br />With a series like Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I'm always skeptical when a new book comes out. That's because the humor is based on satires of some of the most painful and vivid school experiences. Whenever the series runs out of such experiences to write about, the stories become pale imitations of the best early books. In this regard, Jeff Kinney continues to surprise me for the good. He keeps focusing on new aspects of middle school that anyone can relate to. This time the story contains a long series of events leading up to the Valentine's Day dance at Greg's school.<br /><br />As you can imagine, Greg isn't exactly any girl's idea of a dream date. He also doesn't quite understand how to go about attracting the right kind of attention. It's great awkward fun, of the sort that will make anyone reading the story feel like a social butterfly at that age compared to Greg.<br /><br />There are also good episodes involving Manny, Roderick, and Uncle Gary.<br /><br />Although this isn't the best book in the series, it's an excellent one.
B00632HWOG|2.0|before the recent update, it was working fine with occasional delays. a few days ago it auto updated. I have yet to be able to load or read any emails. not sure what the bug is or how to fix it.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Excellent quality, terrific acting!<br /><br />This show blends the supernatural with the natural in a believable manner.  Truly captures the imagination.<br /><br />Whole-heartedly recommend!
B0060D196K|2.0|I was very disappointed with the volume recording on this movie. I purchased this through the Instant Video portion of Amazon. I have ordered a few other items using this feature, and have been throughly impressed. However, this time, the volume was recorded so low that my students could hardly hear the movie, even through the surround speakers. We read the play, and I was so excited to show this to my students. For ten dollars, I felt very cheated. The movie, itself, is great. Jim Carrey always adds extra flavor to whatever he is in!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan does a great job on this album.  The duets with Donny Osmond are very well done.  She is wonderful.
B001BLRPCS|5.0|Great album, great band. Who doesn't like the Black Keys? Get all of their albums, you won't regret it! 5 star, no doubt!
B003D513TQ|5.0|I could watch it over and over again. This is definitely a feel good movie. The casting, costumes and ever detail was perfect.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It's crude and kind of cute all at once. Not for kids! It's a typical stoner flick, not much of a plot, but a few laughs.
B00338QENI|4.0|The book shows just how scary some medical procedures and testing can be.  The most disturbing thing about the book is that the individuals-Henrietta and her family, were not properly advised nor was proper consent requested to allow the family a realistic view of how the cnacer cells would be tested, used, and sold all over the world.
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|Great album, great band. Who doesn't like the Black Keys? Get all of their albums, you won't regret it! 5 star, no doubt!
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Very weird movie.  At times it was confusing but if you like psychological dramas this is a movie to watch
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Great album, great band. Who doesn't like the Black Keys? Get all of their albums, you won't regret it! 5 star, no doubt!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I had high hopes for this film, perhaps too high. My first issue was the story. Alfred made Bruce Wayne into batman. Then he decides to bounce? The first half hour of the film could honestly be chopped off. Next we have the unacceptable altering of characters. Selina Kyle was not just some jewel thief. She was a victim of attempted murder. Oh and Robin was a circus performer, not a Gotham city cop. I could say more and more bad things about this, but frankly I have things to do. One thing I did like was the villain. Baine was funny. Especially his voice. But you never see what's under his mask. One more thing. Spoiler alert. He's not the villain... Zing!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|and much more useful. might enjoy more if i were incarcerated at Guantanamo seven more words are required to submit
B004YRSBTW|4.0|Events unfold completely out of order.  However, there are enough evidence left to connect all the parts together.  Great movie
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I get it that in the Literary world it is hard to come up with something that has not already been said a million times. This book rehashes the over explored themes of big government equals evil and individual power equals evil. Wow, ground breaking news. That is the sum total of the 'novel'.  It is written in an incredibly gimmicky fashion. Credit is due to Mr. Mitchell for his deft handling of time appropriate writing style (or his speculation on what future writing styles will be) but that is the only nod I can give the book. I cannot tell you how disgusted I am that I wasted my time reading what in essence is a collection of short stories that the author clearly could not develop into individual novels so jammed them into a form that loosely connects them. My husband started to read this book just as I was finishing it, I strongly advised him to stop, as I do anyone that is considering buying or who has begun reading it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game was so fun i cant put it down if you like challenges this game is right for you
B000YHG72E|4.0|Lots of references to classic Christmas shows. Plus - awesome set decoration at Gimbel's,  We spent the rest of the week making paper snowflakes.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Entertaining, well narrated without being vulgar sex story. The sexual exploits are approaching superhuman but that's ok because it is fiction. A Cinderella story where the female loses more than her slipper. Don't expect a strong plot in book one. Other than that it's sex, sex, and more sex.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Item was received in great condition.<br />Used to own this on VHS. I love this movie! Would recommend for most ages.
B004NELBPC|5.0|If you want to get what's really going on in the world, especially politics. Huffington Post is the place to go.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I thought it was entertaining.  I think Kristin Stewart is a terrible actress, and I would have chosen someone else.  The evil queen made the show, and some great special effects.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I enjoyed it at the start, and then it just got old...  I have heard so many good things about it, but just didn't see it myself.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Actually my wife is the one that uses Pinterst but she loves it.  She enjoys finding images that she's never seen before and finding out that other people is interested in the same things she is.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Escape from Camp 14 was a difficult book to read because situations described are so unbelievable, but they are real and made me understand what it is like for us to live in civilized communities.  The book really does not end, because Shin Dong-hyuk is still trying to figure out what love means and how to adjust to his new freedom.  It is like he is an real-life alien suddenly dropped into civilization.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|great item just what I wanted shipping was fast and service was promt and just what I expected. Will use in the futrue
B000QE1U9K|4.0|I liked it.<br />The atmosphere is a little bit different, more focus on people and their relations in face of the danger.<br />Ripley is a more developed character than in the previous movies, and other characters besides her are more developed too.<br />We also learn more about the alien species.  Especially if you had already watched the whole series<br />and you've came back to watch it again more carefully.<br />First movie is the great classic, second... needed to be made, third trails after first one in my opinion.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|best play ever,best actors and singer best songs by garou.<br />amazing songs and acting<br />anyone who loves french music and the story of quasimodo
B008383GE8|5.0|Aristotle argued that there must be something which originates motion; and this something must itself be unmoved and must be eternal substance. This argument has been at the heart of our thinking for two thousand years and it is only since the time of Isaac Newton that science has brought verifiable facts and clear scientific theory to aid our contemplation of the nature of matter. Lawrence Krauss builds on these scientific principles and stretches your mind to examine the question of why there is something rather than nothing. In so doing he changes your own thoughts and perceptions. It is strong stuff and must be read with care and attention but it will give you a new perspective. It is thinking of this caliber that we need to lead scientific development in the twenty first century.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|The sooner I stopped thinking I had a idea of where the author was going, the better. It's so enjoyable being hit with all the unexpected laughs.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have always found life after death stories interesting.  It is an interesting account of a doctor and scientist who comes out of a coma and does not look at life quite the same.  An honest examination of his beliefs about life and science.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|Naomi Klein has done a masterwork in this volume.  It is well argued, thoroughly documented, and written in a forward but engaging style. What she has done is to document dynamics of international relations and American foreign policy that I have been hearing from senior officials of other countries for decades.  I encourage readers interested in public affairs not just to read it, but to pay it close attention.  You will not be disappointed.  One very minor negative...I could have done without the initial chapter on electroshock therapy, which becomes the dominant metaphor of the volume.  She could have done this in much less space.
B0060AY85C|4.0|My book club reviews books for other book clubs in the network on a scale of 1-6, and we gave it a 5. We agreed it wasn't Toni Morrison's best, but it was an interesting book to discuss. Some of us liked it and others didn't, but after discussion and the deeper understanding that results, we all agreed it was worth reading and we enjoyed talking about it.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|With all the action hero's from the past in one big movie you cant go wrong. I gave it 3 stars because the story line was corny but the action was great.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|love it  they was very good movies. they need to make more movies like the expendables and expendables 2 i told people on face book they needed to watch.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I thought the movie was entertainlng! I'm not a professional movie critic, so I won't delve into a professional critique of the film. Easy to watch, funny & poignant moments, I like actors the along with the Indian backdrop.
B002ZG999U|5.0|love the movies very good movies i have watch over 3 times now and i will watch them i don't know how many more times.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Vince Flynn has a nack for telling a story that grabs you right from the start. I would recommend this to any one whom enjoys a good adventure
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Still have much to learn.  But am enjoying the features I have mastered.  Not doing too bad for a senior citizen.
B005UD1D62|4.0|This book is only for those who enjoy an easy read which sometimes I do.  It was predictable but these kinds of books are.  It was full of the same old fluff that Lauren Conrad writes but sometimes, that is exactly what I am looking for.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|did not care for this game<br /> I had to use the help guide through most of the game<br /> I used on kindle fire.
1609611543|5.0|What an eye opener!  Wow.  Wheat is the enemy.  Who knew?  Weight positively drops from my body.  Energy up.  All is good.  Well written.  An easy read.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I'll keep this short, simply a fantastic addition to the Batman mythology, also an excellent way to continue the story of the tragic Jason Todd. A must see for any Batman fan.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Die Trying, Great book, I love all the Jack Reacher books, couldn't put it down, can't wait to buy more.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|Gave to wife for Christmas (early) she loved it liked that he sang and danced even more so. two more word required.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Although I love this character, I didn't think this was one of Flynn's best books.  I didn't like that Rapp was out of so much of the action.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Show just keeps getting better with each Episode, gotta watch this if you are a fan of the zombie genre.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|The singers of Celtic Woman posses the purest voices I have ever heard, and the best fiddler I have ever seen bar none.  The backing orchestra, too, is unparalleled.  Their choice of songs range from uplifting and dynamic to soft and soothing.  Celtic Woman &#34;Believe Live&#34; is a must have for anyone that enjoys mainly traditional Irish music.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Excellent movie! Funny and moving with great performances; with Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, et al, what else would one expect?
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Really handy app when one is on the go.  I even found the instuction on how to install on my Android N7.
0143038583|5.0|If there's one take-away here it's this: think before you eat. The omnivore's dilemma is as simple as that. Unlike some species who don't think, or whose diets are based on a single plant, say, we humans can, and do, eat anything. So it's a two-edge sword. The good news is we can eat ANYTHING - yay! The bad news is that we shouldn't. We need to become more aware of our desires and the impact they have on the flora and fauna we consume. Big mainstream agri-biz is not a pleasant concept. Big organic agri-biz isn't either.<br /><br />What I like about Pollan is that he's not a raging fanatic. He has leanings and, yes, they're quite clear, but he doesn't beat you over the head. Vegan? That's a bit extreme. Carnivore? You might want to rethink that. Except for the extremes, you, I, and Pollan are somewhere on the omnivore curve. Our dilemma is examining our place on that curve and deciding if that's really where we want to be.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addicting... Great for those times where you're catching the bus or waiting at the doctors or bored. One of my new favorites!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I love Mad Men!  It' the era I grew up in but I didn't realize how backward the times were as a child...  The characters on this show are so well developed.  Can't wait to see Season 6!
B0033QC0WE|5.0|We usually  bring this CD to our Friends' special day(60th, 70th B-day, etc) as a gift.<br />I don't have to waste time to find out proper gift each time.They love it.Thank you.<br /><br />Sung k. Moon
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The all over story works but every sex scene gets the same description.  I realize with that many it would be hard to do them all differently
B006LR0XLM|4.0|Makes file transfer among 3 computers & a tablet a snap. Started with desktop & added a laptop & notebook. Most recently installed on a tablet.
0061733199|4.0|This book is a good read for those interested in survival, or really preparation for possible disaster (plane crash, vehicle stuck and isolated). This book tries very hard to cover a multitude of areas, climates and skills is a small book and for the most part it succeeds in this tasks; however, there are times when it seems edited or rushed and the reader is left guessing the outcome.<br />The Pros: Mr. Wiseman experience really shows in areas of edible plants and animals. He goes as so far as to explain taste and texture. There were moments when I was reading about eating for survival that it sounded better than what I was eating for dinner. The book is well separated in topics. The author goes out of his way stating that just reading his book will not make you a survivalist. He suggests you go out and try these skills…practice makes perfect.<br />The Cons: There are several times I had to Google a word because what British call something is not what Americans call it or I was too stupid to know what it was. Also there are sections that are rushed and leaves the reader wonder what else to do from there. Although the sections of the poisonous animals are well illustrated, I feel they are not needed but this is my own personal opinion. I would have liked the Camp Craft and Traps and Knots section (especially) to be more in depth. I would have like to see multiple angles of the traps set and what each are best for. Again this is just my personal preference. The Case studies weren’t really helpful. They did not add the value of the book.<br />Overall it is a great book to get started in for the being a survivalist, a camper, a naturalist, etc. It’s an easy read so young teens would enjoy it too. There is a lot of good information in this book. It’s definitely one to add to your collection.
B005R32L66|1.0|Haven't been able to install Skype for android on my tablet. Get notice that no device is available. What's wrong?
0307957837|5.0|I read this series some years ago and was captivated by it. The details and imagery captured my imagination like few other books have. I was very excited to purchase the series for my 9 yr old grandson, who has read and retread the Harry Potter series. I know that he is going to be equally entranced by the Golden Compass!
1452101248|5.0|I have tried three recipes so far and they all were very good. Some of these recipes require many ingredients so be prepared.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Really liked this movie. A joy to watch. Hope to see more in the future. Side note: Will Smith got into trouble during filming for parking his studio trailer on the street and blocking traffic. Google the story its funny.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I had heard that wheat is bad for us. This book goes into detail of exactly what happens in our bodies when we ingest wheat.It's a pretty ugly story. I will never be able to look at food the same again. It helped inspire me to go cold turkey on wheat and high carbs. I have dropped 20lbs in a month. I'm looking forward to an improved healthier wheat-free life.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Not close to a Lit. Nobel prize. It's fun to read, though. No overthinking, no epiphanies, just pop culture and some fun.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my very elderly parents (mid-80's) and I hope they will enjoy the movie as much as we did when we saw it in the theater.  I'm very impressed with Amazon's great service!
B000P0J09W|4.0|The movie is one of the original great adventure movies!  Pirates, booby traps, villains, etc.  Gotta love the kid from Indiana Jones too!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Found it a delightful movie, good insights into India and to people in general. It had good views of India, too. I know people like each of those depicted in this movie - one could be my aunt, another could be a colleague, one could be me. A great story.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|For the first 2/3 of this book I just wanted to tell all the characters to stop whining. It was extremely annoying. The last 1/3 is much better and quite enjoyable. If you've read the other 3 in the series, you should read this one too so you know how the story ends, but it's not nearly as good as the others.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Speaking as a fan of Led Zeppelin since they formed I have to say that if you truly understand, appreciate and enjoyed what they did, this is a must have.  Jason does an amazing job behind the drums filling in for his Dad.  John Paul's precision on base and work on keyboards is like background magic.  Robert's voice is so crisp and clean, it's almost hard to believe.  One of the greatest rock and blues voices of all time and this event proves it.  Jimmy's artistry shows why he will always be one of the best that has ever become one with a guitar.  I've heard these songs live since live was available and these recordings amazingly bring new life to songs that were classics to begin with.  The recordings are extremely high quality thanks to today's recording equipment but, the presentation has a raw and heavy edge as if those days and the history they created had never passed.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie was good since I wasn't expecting the story line to be that way. Always good to be surprised.
B000HKW7E0|1.0|The father is a buffoon in picture.  There are many lustful scenes and lots of sexual innuendo.  The F-bomb is used as well as many other explicative.  Not a family picture.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have always enjoyed Grisham books, but there was a time in the last few years, I felt like he was just cranking books out. - all pretty much the same with little thought or investigation. The Racketeer broke this string. I felt it was well written and back to his original enjoyable reading.
B000ICXQII|3.0|Interesting ideas marred by depictions of gratuitous violence as well as a confusing, disjointed presentation. I find it difficult to recommend this to anyone.
B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a fun family movie that we go back to time and time again. It makes us laugh out loud no matter how many times we've seen it! A gem, right up there with &#34;What About Bob&#34;.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Lots of action plus twists and turns...especially the chase scene at the end! Photography of outdoor scenes was exceptional! Jeremy Renner was top notch!!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am still reading the book so can't give full review...so far it's good, as I expected it to be.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Thought Mark Wahlberg was great. Not a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane, but overall the movie provided some good laughs.<br /><br />More importantly... I'm unimpressed with the quality of the HD stream provided by Amazon.  I've got my Panasonic TV connected directly to my router, comcast xfinity internet (not as good as it gets... but definitely should be enough to stream HD over a hard connection), and half of the time the movie is streaming choppy and blurry.  If Amazon is going to charge extra for an HD rental... you would think they could provide a slightly better streaming/buffering system to keep a quality stream throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />I thought Amazon's video service would be a better option than Comcast OnDemand... I guess I thought wrong.
B0060D123K|5.0|One of my childhood favorites and my kids loved it.  Fantastic movie that will remain one of my favorites.  Great.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Just plain silly fun for all of your family!  Happy film to experience the fun for everyone during the Holidays.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|Loved it, and very pleased ..packaging was excellent. Always happy with<br />My movies from Anazon. Great customer service and excellent turn around.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I gave this game 5 stars because it is a blast to play, very addictive, and requires no continued investment in money. For a free game its one of the best out there.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app is very limited. No way to share content. Also, very limited in the content you can view. I hope they update it soon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good book... happy to have been able to download it on Amazon for cheap cheap cheap.  If you're looking for an interesting over your holiday break, this should be a serious contender.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|good depiction of federal prosecutions. totally on target. but story line a bit farfetched.  overall held my interest ,worth reading.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I really like his books or ave up to this one. There was WAY too much cute John Cory and it got in the way of what story was there.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a very exciting drama with strong female characters. I am sucked in!! I will definitely get the whole series
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|Better as I learn to use it. Its easy to use and enjoy to share with friends and<br /> family! O I prefer to be brief. Thanks for the opportunity to give my opinion.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Not many full length movies can keep the attention of my 2 and half year old, but this one does!  The story is done so well, and done like no one else but Pixar could do.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book and had errors downloading it. Finally resolved those and found the font was difficult to read and I could not scale the images to make them larger.  I really love this author and his work, but viewing his genius on my iPad Kindle app was NOT a good experience.  Also, you don't get the free poster in the Kindle version. Therefore, I returned the Kindle version and ordered the print version.<br /><br />I really dislike that Amazon is forcing me to choose Stars for the book, when its the reading experience I am having issues with.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another page turner by Flynn.  What I most enjoy is how the writer allowed the characters to mature.  I can't wait for the next installment!!!
0375842209|2.0|I read around 50 pages and gave up!<br />I've recently read quite a few novels about Nazi Germany, really good books, I may add, and this one I found SILLY!<br />Maybe it's intended for young adults which I'm definitely not, and I found Zusak's approach to serious matters almost ridiculing and quite ridiculous!<br />Sorry Markus!
B009OA57MI|1.0|I thought this would be fun so I got it.  Never got to play it, every time I opened it and tried to play the first mission, or the first tutorial it crashed my Kindle.  Hopefully it gets fixed, then I'll try and reinstall it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I haven't had a chance to play this game myself, but my teenage daughter was totally engrossed in this game.  Watching her have so much fun with it, tempts me to give it a try.  I will have to say the graphics on the Kindle Fire HD were superb.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Life of Pi took a while for me to get into but after about half way through, it got interesting and I couldn't put it down. The descriptions made me feel like I was living the story. I'm glad I read it but wouldn't call it a must read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It was awesome, left me wanting more!!!!! I highly recommend spending the $$ on these especially if you can't wait for Netflix!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The intrigue began at page one and continued throughout the book.  It was the typical good but not great Grisham fare.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Love this set.  They did an awesome job.  My son who is 5 has watched these movies over and over and over.  I saw a lot of complaints about the storage, I like the book with the cd's in them but I don't know about the scratching yet.  My son has been watching these a lot and going in and out but thus far no problems.  I like them all together and I am not a big fan of the plastic holders.  Most do not like the 4th movie but my 5 year old does.  It is growing on me now that I have seen it at least 12 times!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run - What a fun game.  More fun than a bunch of vultures at lunch time.  Make me laugh.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love watching Walking Dead... I'm not a TV person but I love this series. I've watched each episode multiple times.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Love Harry's tenacity.  Great read.  Michael Connelly continues to develop great stories for Harry.  Please continue with more and more mysteries.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've heard of Charles Sickens being an amazing writer & of course I've seen every version of this movie but the book surpasses them all.
1416972250|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES!! cassandra claire is one of the most brilliant authors I have ever read.  i recommend this series to everyone!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband and I both loved this book. It gets a little over a layperson's head in medical terms, but that's a necessary ingredient for the validity of the subject matter.
B002RI9YCI|4.0|The author manages to convince us that he really has been inside the &#34;reader&#34; - the Queen. Well, written, plot and characters sustained right through to the end. Short, sharp and challenges our perception of the Queen - in particular, we realise that being a Queen has major restrictions on life enjoyment as well as the obvious privileges.<br /><br />Master writer.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I love watching Walking Dead... I'm not a TV person but I love this series. I've watched each episode multiple times.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Truly &#34;must watch&#34; - &#34;can't miss&#34; dramedy. Horrifically bizarre.<br />Each episode is more frightening.  Characters you expect to hate become sympathetic.<br />Can't imagine how this is going to end.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This movie is amazing. Absolutely love the franchise and recommend to everyone that they see it. It was a great price as well.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I love this movie so much.  I first saw it on HBO and I just love Penelope character and the way she develops throughout the whole film
B009K0P10K|5.0|great show - my tivo missed this episode so i had to download it from amazon. download was very fast, no interruptions, and great quality
B009ZE27US|1.0|if there was a -5 stars i would pick it boo boo it said I waz 49 and I'm 13 I mean serrisly also when u put your thumb up to it its always the same thumb print!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I had never seen this game and I think I got a recommendation for it.  I got it and mastered the early puzzles quickly but when I got to the intermediate puzzles, I needed help. Went to YouTube and the solutions are there.  I am a gamest purest so don't hate me for that.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|Annie Hall is my all time favorite Woody Allen movie. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys witty, charming, and deeply intellectual comedies.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie is amazing. Absolutely love the franchise and recommend to everyone that they see it. It was a great price as well.
1416972242|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES!! cassandra claire is one of the most brilliant authors I have ever read.  i recommend this series to everyone!
B005OP7162|5.0|great show - my tivo missed this episode so i had to download it from amazon. download was very fast, no interruptions, and great quality
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is a very good read, one of those that is very hard to put down! Has you from beginning to end.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|John Kennedy Toole committed suicide so I'm sure if he live to see his story gain such success but if you haven't read it, it's a laugh out loud joy.  I highly recommend it.  Set in New Orleans, the main character is an adult still living at home with some major personal challenges - many of which are his own creation.
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|I love the whole cast individually  and together they are dynamite. Stallone knows how to make a kick ass movie
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I actually like sophomoric humor, so when I heard this movie was dumb - funny I figured it would an evening of mindless entertainment.  It wasn't even funny.  We turned it off about 45 minutes into it and didn't even watch the whole thing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator one evening, my had gone bad. I thought perhaps I can get an app for my fire. it is was easy, free, and fast. Great.
B00A993UWM|4.0|Kesha has made another great album.  I really like that she writes her own lyrics and you can tell that the songs are very personal to her.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|A good alarmclock if that is all you want with customizable alarms. Also tells you the local weather. I really like it.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|A beautiful movie,I heard about it but just watched it after buying it on Amazon. It is a really beautiful movie. If I could really recommend watching only 5 movies in your lifetime this would definitely be 1 of them!!!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Great cast of stars, good to see them all again.  Movie is filled with action, humor and delivered so well.  A must see for everyone!
0761169431|5.0|How was it that I went my entire life without knowing that two incredibly nerdy, yet incredibly awesome, things could be combined to become so incredinerdsome?! This book is def incredinerdsome. It comes with incredinerdsome paper and the instructions are very clear, also incredinerdsome.<br /><br />Too much fun, man. You don't even know.
B007SXB498|4.0|Miss Austin's well read and well loved novel deserves the perusal of generations of the \\" hopeful romantic\\".  In this novel we are assured that no matter how difficult lives may be, there is always hope of a happy ending.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|I got the movie for my boyfriend for christmas but I had to watch it before I gave it to him to make sure it wasn't a used movie, and it wasn't. Brand new, no skipping, no scratches. Perfect condition.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|My kids play this game everyday and love it! They really like the Christmas one with the sleigh and reindeer.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just like any other tablet version run smooth and quick. I really don't see why it's a lower score, people are just picky I guesx
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very cute movie.......Mark Wahlberg is excellent in this.  Great movie for the young or young at heart.  Ted is so cute!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was def &#34;darker&#34;! Still had the &#34;kinkiness&#34; with the plot! Love the chemistry with Ana and &#34;Mr. Grey&#34;!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The title of this review says it all! If you enjoy idiotic prepubescent male humor \\"Ted\\" will be right up your alley! !
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very adicting and so much fun. I think that everyone.should have it on there tablet or phone. soon as you play it u want to keep on playing until u concor it.I want u to get it.u will love it.it is free and fun. I think that is a pakage.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|I LOVE that this carries so many wipes. I don't have to remember to refill it after every outing. BUT!!!! the red button falls off or slides open A.L.L the time. Drives me BSC! I've never had my wipes dry out like some reviewers but my wipes does get little ickies from my diaper bag on them since the red button is always sliding around. I WISH I loved this. The concept is great - they need to make the button with a gasket or something to keep it from moving and popping out so easily
B000YHG72E|5.0|great holiday film to watch with the family.<br />funny to kids as well as their parents.<br />will be a new annual tradition for us!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great acting, great lines.  Every couple that is drifting should definitely watch this one.  Lessons of life are depicted in this movie and the lines are great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is def a very, very &#34;kinky&#34; book! Loved it from beginning to end! Be prepared to get &#34;hot&#34; in a few sections hahaha!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I love this show.  It is funny and I love the references to movies and things from when I grew up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'd never heard of this book before, and picked it up for my Kindle based entirely on the recommendation of a friend...and what a book it is!  I have already spread the love, and recommended it myself to several friends.  'Wool' is destined to become a classic of the sci-fi genre...equal to the works of Asimov, Bradbury, Vonnegut, Herbert, and others.  Books like this are one of the reasons that I bought a Kindle...I wanted to have access to free/low-cost, self-published ebooks by unknown authors and Hugh Howey does not disappoint.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Well since it's a conversion don't expect AVENGER quality<br />but still pretty great quality<br />Nice Extras too<br />nothing to complain really...<br />I love the movie so I bought it...get it?
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|not really good at all..really slow moving and boring.<br />i thought it was going to be much better. very disappointing.
B007ZTN07O|1.0|Do not buy this app. It took me to this shady looking page where I was told to make some kind of account worst 5 dollars I ever spent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would def recommend this book! Not quite as &#34;kinky' good as the first one, but still a very enjoyable book!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I put informative in quotes because though this story and history of a war seems so real, it's not. But Max Brooks has skillfully brought to life a complete and complex volume of individual narratives that each tell a different story of the zombie war from their own perpsective and corner of the world. Brooks has thought of everything: from disturbing military action plans to the long term psychological effects.<br /><br />Some parts became wordy and, I'll say it, a little boring, but overall it is extremely interesting, entertaining, and thought-provoking. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The coming movie looks nothing like the book, however, I hope they'll incorporate all of the well thought out details to make the story vivid and believeable.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I purchased this for my 5 year old Nephew for a Christmas stocking stuffer.  He has seen the movie before and loves it - enough to ask auntie for this movie for Christmas.  .
B009FZFONO|5.0|Not just about killing zombies, thats a bonus ! This is a powerful human drama, charecter conflicts abound ! Show always ends with you wanting more.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love everything that Rick Riordan writes.  I try and read the books my kids read and once I started with the Percy Jackson series I could not get enough.  We all anticipate each new book in all his different series with release dates marked.  Suggest this book to any parent.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|runs along the same lines of the others but with a little more in depth. If you liked the others you will like this one.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Would have given this a tenth of a star if there was an option.  Way too complicated...for me, anyway. Okay?
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a case of the second book in a trilogy being even better than the first.  Might be because I was familiar with many of the characters already.  Am looking forward to Book Three.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|This movie was supposedly about three brothers, but it was clear from the beginning that that the Tom Hardy character was the star and that the rest were window dressing. The only problem with that was they kept giving the window dressing too much speaking roles. Take away everyone else except Tom Hardy and replace them with better actors and presto you have a better movie. Oh, it would help if you had a somewhat more developed plot as well.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Love Ted! Watched because I love Mark Walberg, but I fell in Love with Ted. May not be watching material for 14 and under. But would like another Ted movie for me!
0784011710|5.0|\\"Sophie's Choice\\" was released on December 8th, 1982 and quickly became both a commercial and critical hit earning over $30,000,000 at the box office and many critics hailing Meryl Streep's performance as Sophie as one of the greatest in American Film.<br /><br /> The story deals with a Polish immigrant living in Brooklyn with her lover who share a boarding home with a young writer. The supporting cast includes Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep desevedly won her second Academy Award for Best Actress for this part (her first being in the Supporting Actress category in 1979 for \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\") and her latest in 2012 as Best Actress for her role as Margaret Thatcher in \\"The Iron Lady\\"
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|Steamy and Strong sexual scenes, but overall good movie with good plot. A good mix of  action, adventure and thriller.
B00A993UWM|5.0|I don't understand the lack of public interest. I'm not a big Ke$ha fan, but this is a solid pop record that makes me think of Pink. Her vocal power here is much more in the forefront. She really is a great singer underneath it all. Musically it's similar to Cannibal but it's a bit more 80's rock pop. This album should have been a big power moment for her. Definitely worth the buy. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Go for it.
0525478817|5.0|My son enjoys this author and the book is a good read. The product shipped on time with no issues.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|this was fun for me and my son we liked to try to be able to keep up with the moving instructions we like playing this
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Fantastic!  I really needed reassurance  at this time of my life...Now and then, we get low in our lives and need a big boost...THIS IS IT !
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Its ok , I bought because I heard about the movie , I think too much of a word is a loss of message same happened during middle pages.  I felt like quitting the book but I read it anyway.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|pretty good app. nice to break up the time. pretty good app again. I like how you can go after different prizes
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Pretty good book, little much of repeating some things! Ive always loved Arnold!~ If your looking more about the maid. not much there, but still pretty good.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my son-in-law.  I received them very quickly and in great shape.  Thank you very much.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game made me think and even react when I got the puzzle all put together. It was a great game
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'm addicted to Angry Birds and this version is the reason why. I have to say that ANY of the Angry Birds is worth buying the ad-free version (although in between screens, there are ad!)  But, if you had to choose just 3 to get started, get this Rio and Seasons--then move on to Star Wars.  You can skip the space theme.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book has been everything and more than I had expected. I can't put it down. I am thrilled that I will be reading his books for years to come.
B001JRB16U|2.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\" is a movie that I'm just going to say I never enjoyed, even as a kid. Yeah yeah, I have no soul or heart, but I just don't like this film one bit. I can't stand it when musicals come up with a musical number every five minutes. Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example. There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation. but that's only for what--ten to fifteen minutes? There's no adventure, no heartwarming, it''s just people singing pointlessly. I remember getting bored with this utterly ridiculous movie. I'm not much a fan of the Sherman Brothers, or at least not in THIS movie.  Mary Poppins herself is not an interesting character, correcting poor Michael when he's not perfect, just acting firm most of the time. I am definetly never going to buy this movie.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|While this is somewhat common sense, its overlooked in most business situations. I strongly recommend this book.<br /><br />What I liked the most is it helps you clarify what you want to achieve, and the little tasks that are often missed. I have already deployed this model in my business.
B0060D123K|4.0|Great movie to introduce children to the timeless Charles Dickens classic. Did not give 5 stars because Amazon doesn't allow instant rental just the instant buy option for $10. Decided to buy anyways as it will be watched every Christmas at my house.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Movie was a modern fairy tail on a classic storyline. Special effects were amazing at theatre and wanted it for home viewing.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|AB Star Wars is a great comeback from the Space game from a few months ago.<br /><br />The music and integrating the pigs with the dark side was ingenious.<br /><br />If you have a tablet, I think you'll need the HD version.<br /><br />Great game.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|An old artist who is new to me, bought it for a friend and he loves it now I want one
B00335EQ0E|2.0|This movie is totally mediocre and insane! The story choices are just mind boggling! The story choices are like the Mad Libs of disney movies! Alice comes across butterflies with...bread! There is a game of croquet using...flamingos and moles! None of the characters or wierdos in Wonderland help Alice at all, Oliver Wallace's music in this movie is just crappy, it's just makes me want to throw up! That \\"Painting the Roses Red\\" song is just stupid, especially when the painters' cards are dragged away, they are singing stupidly about being beheaded! And speaking of which, that Queen of Hearts is one of the dumbest Disney Villains I have ever seen! I always liked it better when Prince John from \\"Robin Hood said \\"Off with His/her head!\\" There's no mediocre song in that! Unless customers want a Disney film that spirals into insanity, I suggest they skip this one.
0425263908|1.0|The book cover says this was written by a New York Time writer.if so she must be a friend of a stringer. Highly derivative of Grey,  (i think the category is called knockoffs) . Anyway, it is slower  than slow and the hero and heroine are duller than dirt.
B0014J8D9Q|4.0|Great old movie.  Sex and violence may be offensive to some.  Not for younger children, would not understand and may find it disturbing.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|love it was nice to be able to watch the entire season without interuptions recommend to anyone who likes supernatural
B004SBX112|5.0|I love all of the Angry Bird franchise games EXCEPT the outerspace version.<br /><br />This one's a bit looney but a nice change from Rio and the original.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was hooked within the first few minutes.  I cannot seem to put down the game.  I am having fun playing.
B001HN6918|5.0|I love this film! This is one of my all time favorites! I love how like most computer animated sequels like \\"Toy Story 2\\" or \\"Shrek 2\\", the main characters are seen enjoying their new lives that have changed since the events of the first film, and I think the CGI details are great! The music is also awesome, heck I've listened to its soundtrack a million times! I'm also glad that they didn't use the same story arc \\"Shrek 2\\" and \\"Madagascar 2\\" did with meeting the real parents, so I am glad they twisted this one up a bit. The kung fu comedy is also great, Po and Tigress's new relationship is great, I could go on. At first, I wasn't excited about a peacock being the villain as much as I liked a snow leopard being the villain, but once I watched Lord Shen, I thought he was a much more sinister villain than someone like Tai Lung. I also thought the Wolf Leader guy with the hammer was pretty cool too. He reminds me a lot of Fidget the bat from \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\". What else can I say? The characters are great, the music is great, the CGI is great, the list goes on. I enjoyed watching it and I'll definetly be watching this DVD so much more.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Love this app!!! Works great. I've been using on my iPhone for years! Works great for kindle too. Highly recommended!!!!!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Perfect set for the zombie lover. I gave this as a present and the recipient almost ate me alive :)
B002H6ZQRM|5.0|Best of both worlds, zombies mixed with British humor, perfect.  If you watch it, you will love it, again and again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have this on all of my devices and this was the one I came back to after being disappointed with the \\"Space\\" version.<br /><br />Going through all of the screens and the theme of the bird being kidnapped and taken to Rio is hysterical.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Girl On Fire  is one of Alicia Keys best albums.I really admire her talent and style. Alicia Keys is at the top of todays R&B artists.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I look forward to the release of the soundtrack almost as much as i look forward to the release of the film.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is pretty easy to understand and you do mot have to commit a lot of time to it.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Hathaway as catwoman? Terrible. There seems to be a level of intensity that is missing from all three of these batman movies. Maybe it's the lack of color from the sets or from the acting. Lackluster.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural is one of my favorite TV shows, and I was super happy to find that it was much cheaper here than it was anywhere else. It, like most of my Amazon purchases, arrive before the estimated arrival date, which I absolutely love. The discs were in perfect condition and played flawlessly. This was most definitely a good buy at a great price.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Amazon gives you 5 GB of space but they have lowered the space for your music.  The good thing is that because if you have a mobile device or a tablet, this gives you access to the collection that you can't do without.  And, it's free.  Just wished that Amazon upgraded it to have some kind of built-in EQ/Amp.
B009ZE27US|1.0|it wont download on my kindle fire and the first time it did it caused a viruses thank you viruses protecter!!!!!!!!!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This is a very impressive series.  While I was watching the first episode, I kept thinking of the line from Jurassic Park &#34;I spared no expense&#34;.  It grips you from the first scene and doesn't let go.  Looking forward to the rest.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great Album, I would recommend this to anyone who loves classical music. She should have gone further on America's Got Talent.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed The Last Man! Good, quick reading. Didn't want to put it down as I had to find out what happens next. Writing was crisp and fast paced and much more nuanced than Kill Shot. A good reminder why I love the Mitch Rapp series so much. Also nice to bring our hero and the story back to the modern day. Its quite timely. Loved the interaction between Rapp, Dr Kennedy and Stan here.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|the book is great<br />came on time<br />andthe price was right<br />i would recomend this to friends with no problem
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I usually read books quickly and then re-read to enjoy how the details support the end.  In this one, the plot's OK but it didn't hold my interest enough to re-read.
140053271X|5.0|I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.  I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.  This Nook is great.  It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.  I find that I use it a lot.
B004AQR24W|2.0|Seeing the preview to the movie, I thought I would have seen Arnold S., among others. Arnold was only had a cameo. The story could have been much better as it was somewhat weak. If you took away all the explosions and try to stand on the story alone, I would have only given it one star.
B0001I562I|5.0|the movie was so exciting to watch i love sify stuff it was a little broke on the case it probly happend in shiping
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Story line was much too difficult to follow. Graphics, voices, etc. were good, however, as a story the title was better than the show.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If you're a big reader please read, Martel takes your mind on a crazy adventure across the Pacific and along for the ride are some amazing metaphors and animals
B008BM9L72|3.0|The book is a good read but it is too sexually explicit. It dwells too much on sexual encounters between the characters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book begins with a missing wife and the husband is, of course, suspected of foul play.  However, this book produces quite a twist on this all-too-familiar story and makes the reader think about the psychological aspects of our deepest character traits.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like puzzles but don't like the missing pieces, There are  a lot of games and they are fairly easy. There are some hard ones.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this is a grate lesson on the difficolty of being a peace officer in the missed up world of drugs and family issues
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games will leave you hanging in this science fiction thriller. Suzanne Collins has written another great book. This chronological book is filled with death and survival. This book didn't let me stop reading. \\"You never forget the face of your last hope,\\" says Suzanne Collins. Collins has written an eye-popping, suspenseful book. She will have you asking for more. The Hunger Games sold more than 36.5 million copies in the U.S.<br /><br />  The Hunger Games takes place in an exciting future in North America. This is exciting because the author describes it so beautifully that I feel like I am actually in the story. The plot is very exciting because Collins describes it very well that I couldn't put the book down. The tributes get picked in a lottery by the Capitol to see who competes in The Hunger Games. 24 kids go into war as a punishment for their ancestors rebelling against the Capitol's government. They have to fight and survive on their own in a playing field that takes place in the wilderness. Collins keeps you on the edge of your seat as you read along. The tributes are a huge part of the story. I can really relate to some of them because of their feelings and attitudes. The main character is a 16 year old girl named Katniss and she volunteers as tribute for her younger sister Primrose after she got picked in the lottery. The other main character is Peeta. He is the male tribute to fight in District 12. I feel I can relate to Katniss because I would be scared if any of my younger sisters got picked to fight in a war.<br /><br /> Suzanne Collins uses vivid words about where the tributes are. An example is \\"I ran through the shady parts of the woods.\\" She gives each character a different look and personality. For example, \\"He is disgusting, but I am grateful.\\" She uses great language to strengthen the text by using similes. An example is \\"She was as calm as a river.\\" I think this author was successful because the story was so beautifully written that Icouldn't put the book down. \\"I couldn't stop reading,\\" says Stephan King. \\"Engaging, brutal but engaging,\\" says anonymous. This book made me feel sad because all of the kids were fighting and killing each other. I also felt amazed because of the courage Katniss and Peeta showed when they got picked to fight in The Hunger Games.<br /><br /> If you liked The Hunger Games then you might like Gregor the Overlander. You will like this because it is by the same author. You will also like this because it is a fantasy page turner. You will also like this because it is an adventurist nail bitter. Also it will pull at your heart strings as you keep reading. You will love all Suzanne Collins books. You will like The Hunger Games because it was very well written. You will really like this book because it is science-fiction and takes place in a breathtaking future. You will very much like this book because it is filled with death, survival, and romance.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|From the writer and creator of Family Guy, I was expecting a few more laughs and punches at celebs but whatever you saw in the trailer...that was the movie..not much else there
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This is not the super funny movie that it was thought to be. All the funny parts are in the commercials. Wait til it hit Netflix.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|First of all, I love Ridley's Blade Runner and Alien so I was anxiously anticipating his follow up to Alien, Prometheus. When I saw in in the movie theatre, I was disappointed. But the DVD is actually better on a smaller screen and worth adding to my collection of fine science fiction films. You can't see the the artificial quality of the space &#34;cars&#34; driving to and from the Alien bubble on the distant landing site for example. Four stars because it doesn't match the above mentioned films but I finally thought it was worth being in my collection. Film sets up a sequel which might be interesting if he goes that direction.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This is a more advance brain games. If you like to be challenged this is the game for you. Buy it now while it is free because soon it will be charged.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was extremely well written, absorbing and had a great ending! I would recommend it to anyone but particularly women. I bought the book for my sister and my niece for Christmas after reading it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Ok so my favorite my little pony is fluttershy and the theme song NEVER gets annoying. Plz tell me if its like. the littlest pet shop app.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|He's very logical and clear with his writing. Really opened up my mind.I will definately recommend this book to others
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fantastic game and great to keep the mind occupied. Would be five stars if skips didn't coount as a loss.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season 1 was definitely my favorite, ghost stories are my thing, but season 2 is great. Love the asylum setting.  Love Lily Rabe, so glad she is back.  Great entire cast.  Not a fan of aliens, but am curious enough to keep watching and see how it ends up.  The writers of this series are incredible.  Unique stories each week, and for the most part, completely believable.
B008DL466C|3.0|Simply: its an average album. Wiz does repeat the same states about money and cars.He does have a few hits but also many misses. Needs to return to basics.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love it!!!  Weather where you are and where you are going!!  Highly recommend to everyone!!  Get it today and enjoy great weather reports!
B008OTTSX4|4.0|I enjoyed all of this disc, and there is nothing on it I couldn't listen to again and again. It may take the average listener a couple of listens to fully appreciate it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This was the most boring app! I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if you could win every I once  in a while! I played for almost a week several times a day and only bingoed once...it was deleted and I found a better bingo app!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Great movie! Salma heyak is an amazing actress. Great twists in this film, a lot of good actors and a lot of Action
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read the first half of the book itself that I borrowed but then had to return before I finished. I then bought the Kindle version for my iPad and so I got the immediate comparison between the two methods of reading a book.  This is way better.  The price is so much less too.<br />I love technology.
B008F9E306|4.0|Over all this is a great, hard hitting album. Great lyrics and great beats. The calabos are amazing. This is definitely a must have album. T.I. does not disappoint.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|I love the movie, and I have most Johnny Depp films so I needed this to add to my collection, but the copy I got was used and still had the stickers from the library that it came from. The movie plays great, though, no scratches. This movie has quite a bit of adult humor in it, but nothing that I would mind my kids seeing. It's great that a western has been done for kids; I haven't seen something like this since the days of Looney Tunes.
B000007U5G|5.0|Glenn can sign, plain and simple, great material to work with, and really good band backing him up on this set. Worth every cent I paid for it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|really enjoyed latest in the bourne series, even with new main character...action packed, great story line.  would recommend to older teens and adults
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|What a waste of time and money.  I felt like I was watching the family guy....this was such a waste and it is ridiculously vulgur and repulsive.  One of Mark Wahlberg's worst works...ever!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its always wonderful having access to God's word from anywhere especially when cellphones are so popular now.  Thanks for everthing and keep bring the word.
0345803507|5.0|I've heard somewhere that you must be living under a rock if you haven't read these books, and that must be true as my local library has 40+ copies of this but I was put on hold at #426 to check it out. So, I went ahead and purchased it. Great book, a must read, and it certainly gives you new ideas for the bedroom!
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|The late great guitarist, doing a very good set of Hendrix covers. R.I.P. Gary. You will be missed here on earth.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Life is all about the struggle.  This series captures human struggle and incorporates ingenuity for survival.  It keeps you guessing what the next exploit will entail.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|There are only a few good (not great) songs on this album. The other songs are barely even palatable. Disappointing.
B008Y6W5SM|4.0|This is the first movie I got through Amazon instant video thru my new smarttv :) I love it, the music and the acting (especially chris sarandon) it's perfect to watch when you have had a long day at work and need to chillax. I couldn't watch it as a kid and now that i'm in my 20s so glad I could remember to see this movie
0812993292|5.0|This is such a great book. This is the story of a man who goes out to mail a letter and keeps on walking. His plan is to walk across England from the South to the North. The distance was almost 600 miles.<br />Recently retired Harold Fry gets a letter one morning from a friend that he has lost touch with. Queenie informs him that she has cancer and the doctors have said there is no hope. Harold seems to think if he walks to see her she will be healed.<br />The journey is a journey of self-discovery for Harold. It explores the relationship between Harold and his wife and Harold and his son.<br />You will enjoy this story.
0788832182|5.0|I bought this for daughter #2 :) because when I first watched this when it came out, I LOVED it!! So cute & funny & great music!! & a great story :)<br />The 1 I had used to be in VHS, so I had to get it in DVD this time ;)
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I am enjoying this series as I don't have Showtime, the Amazon streaming is great, I'm really loving Amazon video!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|As a lover of India having been there twice to do mission work, I love the way this author tells his story. He brings back to life all the magnificent colors and I can almost smell India with his words.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am officially addicted! I hate blood and gore and gruesome violence and yet somehow I love this series! Go figure.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It had it's moments, but overall it was pretty much family guy. go figure. still funny to watch at least once though
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I have read most of McEwan's books, while this is an okay read, it surely isn't up to some of his others.  It had an interesting ending, that was unexpected which was good.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|The movie's good the book is better. Great read. Uplifting and honest. Makes me wish I could travel more! :)
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|It was much more my expectation...quality, fast shipment, super condition! And most important songs which I didn't  hear and now they are my most interesting what I have about Eric Clapton .
B004EK926K|3.0|The quality was pretty good but not the highest quality like blue-ray disks<br /><br />Please improve the quality of your streeming to blue-ray
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am not a pro but with this I am learning how to play mahjong.  I just need more time!
B008H5J510|5.0|I'm a big Katy Perry fan so I love this movie! I would recommend anyone who loves Katy Perry to get a copy of this limited edition.
B008NW67E0|3.0|From AltRockLive.com - I'll be honest. I've never worshiped at the feet of Mumford & Sons. While everyone else got their fix of Sigh No More, I instead dove deeper and listened to other bands from the same tradition including Nathaniel Rateliff, Cory Branan, and Chuck Ragan. Their debut was pleasant enough to generate a few repeated spins on my iPod, but not enough to compel me to hail them as folk rock's brightest new sons.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because of my lack of knowledge about the band that I can say that, while I'm thoroughly charmed by their new album Babel, I'm still not ready to throw flowers at their feet. British by nationality but American by soul, Babel doesn't speak in tongues unlike the tower of its namesake? its singular voice resonates the sound of banjos, acoustic guitars, fireside drums, and vocals so earnest that you could swear they're pleading for their lives. While it may be an understatement to call this a beautiful-sounding record (it has more pastoral expansiveness than a John Williams film score, more heart than a Crowded House record, and more spirit than a Yankees game on opening night), Babel's beauty seems to be anchored more on the golly-gee neo-folk novelty shimmer rather than an honest-to-goodness sense of deep woods elation.<br /><br />From the finger pickings and rabid tambourine pounding of the opening title track, it's clear they mean business. Like a manic sea shanty fueled by a punk heart, Babel comes across like the UK's version of a jamboree with members of Fairport Convention and Hothouse Flowers backed by The Pogues. \\"Whispers In The Dark\\" increases the intensity and ups the ante, reinforcing their oh-so-earnestness at a breakneck speed (well, as fast as a banjo can go), with Marcus Mumford's vocals emoting pure heart when he's singing, \\"know my weakness, know my voice.\\"<br /><br />Not short on emotions and propulsiveness, the first half of Babel is an exhausting listen? \\"Holland Road\\" plays with tempo, sprinting you through the verses till you get slammed to an almost full-stop with the ebb of the chorus with just enough time to catch your breath. By the time the tender \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\" offers a sweet change of pace, there's a real need to decompress, adrenaline be damned. Surprisingly, the latter half of the record powers down the engine and, in effect, loses much of its steam. While the first half ushers you at Mach 5, the home stretch feels protracted and extended? languid even. It's a shame really, since the anticipation for a final cathartic banjo-led climax to bring it all home goes unfulfilled, leaving a frustrating case of musical blueballs.<br /><br />Babel is a really good record? But what prevents it from being a great record is that missing final clincher. It's the musical equivalent of really great foreplay that never really makes it past second base.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|Not Santana's best, but very worth the purchase.  Lots of instrumentals.  I've listened to the CD 10-15 times already to memorize it and, each time I hear them, I pick up new parts of tracks that I enjoy.  His guitar and percussion are the best.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|this was the beginning of Jeremy renner besides from the town..like the cameo of his wife at the end soo cute!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Thank goodness that we got hooked on this show after the fourth season and we could watch the previous seasons all at once.  It made for a lot of couch potato time though!
B001EN71CW|1.0|All three DVD's in this package have major defects.  Amazon won't allow access to return procedure even tho<br />it's been less than 30 days and return window ends Jan 30.  I have received too many DVD's from Amazon with defects in the past and I have usually let it ride.  In one case I went local and replaced a DVD from a set.  I have pulled all DVD's from my wish list and in the future will buy elsewhere.
B007THA4FI|5.0|An eye-opening look at issues of race, class, social services and dysfunctional relationships in the UK. I found it thoroughly enjoyable if at times uncomfortable.
030758836X|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book all the way up until the last page!<br />The author was very creative in wearing two hats...going back and forth in writing in diary form,<br />The male and female perspective.<br /><br />The last page, however, was a disappointment.
B000OBYLVO|4.0|While I wasn't expecting it for some reason, I really enjoyed this movie. Good acting and Jack Black did a good job in more of romantic comedy than I expected. A nice holiday movie :).
B006LSZECO|5.0|This author is adept at new ideas and moves you from the first sentence.  Great plots and well worth reading .
B001TODCII|5.0|One of my favorite movies with Liam Neeson in it! Of course batman tops it, but it is a close second!
B007P4OTHO|4.0|The new LP master sounds absolutely perfect. It's Ziggy at it's best, and with so many different remasters of this out there...that's saying something. On the other hand, the included DVD-A is a bit frustrating. There's a ton of content from various masters there, but the bonus tracks were not remastered (they're the 2003 master). It's also extremely protected DRM wise. I simply could not find a way to get the 24/96 files off of it. Some may say this is not the point, but I simply won't get use out of the DVD-A because of this.<br /><br />Anyway, in short, buy this for the new LPs. They're so worth it, even if the DVD-A isn't.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was great but it's for people 18 years and older I just wish I would have saw the uncut one first
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|I didn't expect DKR to be very good, based on the previous two Chris Nolan entries, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was. Pretentious, self-important, and downright laughable at times. It's a shame, because I've long thought that the Batman series needed to take a darker and more violent approach to its story telling. But this is not the right formula. Skip it.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Never tire of Holiday Inn and White Christmas. A true tradition at Christmas.  It's sad that movies like this are a thing of the past.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie reminded me of a not so funny, super long version of a family guy episode. I had a couple of chuckles throughout the movie, but it seemed to drag on and overall wasn't really that funny :(
B009JBWOU0|5.0|For this price to get all three of what I believe to be one of the best super hero movies ever made is nothing short of astonishing! On top of that you also get a rather cool booklet to go with it!
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet but this box is fantastic. The entire package screams quality and while I get that people might be frustrated about the lack of B Sides that have been previously released it's still a great box. The new master is pretty good CD wise, but it sounds extremely good on vinyl.<br /><br />I'm now using Sledgehammer from these LPs as a bass test when auditioning new speakers or headphones. The bass line is legendary and has never sounded better.<br /><br />It might not be for some, but (at the price I picked it up at) it was more than worth it. One of the most legendary albums ever.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|best app ever i love it so much cant put it down. only problem is it closes sometimes and not enough ways to get gems
0060523808|4.0|I asked a friend for business book recommendations and this was one of them. Even though it doesn't go into painstaking detail, Lou Gerstner gives you a pretty good idea what the function and role of a CEO is.<br /><br />It gives you a broad overview of how he managed to change IBM's culture and strategy and the rationale for doing so. Some of the company restructuring he discusses are: changing and implementing strategy, image and brand revival, strengthening customer relationships, the buying and selling of key business segments, how to change a company's culture, operational changes and managing top level executives.<br /><br />From reading the 1-star reviews on Amazon it is my understanding that he is unpopular with some former IBMers because he laid off a good chunk of its employees which he only gives terse recognition towards the beginning of the book. And when he does mention it he uses the clever euphemism \\"right-sizing\\" possibly as a defense mechanism to absolve himself of guilt from initiating mass layoffs. But as painful as they may be, layoffs are needed for struggling companies otherwise the entire company will be wiped-out.<br /><br />So if you're looking for an introductory overview of a CEO's duties and responsibilities I would recommend this book. But don't expect any detailed explanation beyond that.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After reading and being disappointed in the Mockingjay, I was apprehensive about reading another trilogy or more book.<br />Stumbled across this book while waiting for others to become available to check out and download. The story seemed intriguing enough for me to at least read. And I did... in less than 24 hours. Hated putting it down and am ecstatic that I was able to download all three to my kindle.<br />I hated that there were so many references about what Christian and Anastasia said to each other earlier in the book it was extremely annoying.<br />Next question: hope there is more of Mr. Fifty Shades in the next book. Does he exist anywhere in this world and if so, give him my number!!
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Was great at first.  Then got too politically predictable.  US bad, Islam good.  Terrorists have a&#34;good&#34; reason to hate us and blow us up.  Really?
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I picked this up along with the alien anthology and watched them all in order. Makes for a rather entertaining weekend! Great series!
B008LAO7C8|5.0|Swans absolutely blew away the bar with this album. If you're into dark or drone music you'll absolutely love this. The first song sets the tone for the rest of the album, but it's also the weakest, I think. Once you get through it you'll be dumped into the rest of this amazing work.<br /><br />I'd suggest not listening to this with the lights off at night though. It had me turning around and making sure nothing was behind constantly for about 2 hours. Bad move on my part.
B004QL7K70|5.0|saw this movie on HBO and after I saw it I knew I had to buy it. it was perfect plotted, had the right music at the party and all the crazy events tied it together. perfect acting. thomas mann is so yummy and he is the main character. that makes the move 3 times better. this is something I'll never regret buying. :) it ships fast too. I got it 3 days before the expected delivery date!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|One of the best sequels I have ever read. Ken Follett really nailed it. I cant wait for the 3rd!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Okay to good bubble game. Fun to just play while you're waiting for something, etc. Like the fact that the ball number is limited. Adds to the challenge. However, why does it have to shake the phone EVERY SINGLE bubble shot...? Annoying, and as little time as I spent looking for it, I could not find a turn off option.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|It is basically a brief introduction of HTML5. Other than that nothing is in there. I got the free copy from my prime - maybe there is a different version sold elsewhere. Anyway, I don't have much to complain since it is free.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is an excellent science fiction series! I recommend it to all of my friends! Follow it up with watching serenity!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|The game is a good game, not great but good. The controls are easy to use and graphics are decent.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great characters, top-notch acting and fun storylines. Perfect holiday TV watching. I would've given Season 1 3-stars.  Watch this show.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Great DVD for a real fan. This DVD is great and a must-have. I'm a huge fan and let me tell you: this production is amazing and will really be a good addition to your collection. Highly recommended.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|. . . . I didn't see that coming! That is what best describes it for me. It wraps the trilogy together nicely.
B003JXUXPW|5.0|Gregory Porter is a fresh, vibrant singer!  His sound is clear, captivating and I love his delivery!  It was love at first hearing!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Much needed insight for the times!<br />Watch the picture carefully; closely examine the character of Chris Cringle and emulate him!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book was recommended by a woman doing a presentation about Alzheimer's disease.  She said the descriptions were some of the most accurate that she had read - even though this is a fiction book.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and feel like I have learned something through reading this fictional story.  There are study/discussion questions in the back.  I wish I would have known that before I finished the book.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Just taking up space in my Kindle Fire.  It's supposed to be for the Kindle, but as of yet, it does nothing.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Great CD for a real fan. This CD is great and a must-have. I'm a huge fan and let me tell you: this production is amazing and will really be a good addition to your collection. Great way of telling a bit more of the history of this recently-added Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Famers. Highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|... Bought app for my 9 year old grandson when he is borrowing my Kindle Fire. It's a great bonding time for us!
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Greg Porter is a newcomer for me, but I am very happy to have been introduced to his music.  His sound is pure, fresh and amazing!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is a classic to the entire Christmas movie collection that no one should be without!  It brings back memories when my husband and I were children as well as now establishing traditions with our grandchildren!  George and Mary Bailey display what not only what family is all about but the true meaning of Christmas as many get caught up in the commercialization of Christmas losing it's true meaning.  Merry Christmas everyone!  GMomma D
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I just didn't think it was all that funny...it had it's moments but it wasn't all that special.  Family Guy is a 1/2 hour show for reason...that kind of comedy can't sustain a 2 hour movie
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I have seen the movie and gave it as a gift.  A great group of actors in a delightful movie.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Great CD for a real fan. This CD is great and a must-have. I'm a huge fan and let me tell you: this production is amazing and will really be a good addition to your collection. Highly recommended.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Probably the best QOTSA.  I could have done without the radios show set up to each song but they usually come at the end of the previous song so you can just skip to the next.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Hilarious and the best teddy bear movie by far also the cast is great and mix well each other, yeah.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is a classic to the entire Christmas movie collection that no one should be without!  It brings back memories when my husband and I were children as well as now establishing traditions with our grandchildren!  If Kris Kringle can change the hardened Macy's executive Doris Walker to believe in Christmas, he will make you into a believe in Christmas too!  Merry Christmas everyone!  GMomma D
1423140605|5.0|I love this book. I would recommend to children of all ages. I strongly recommend reading the percy jackson series before reading this series.
B008WOULPK|5.0|she is so witty. i love reading about where she came from and how she got to where she is now.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it would be the most awesome game if I had more time to make more things and do more things
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the complete trilogy. It's a little misleading when you buy the first book. The story is actually ONE book divided into 3 parts because you can't stop at just one.
1455527475|3.0|No real earth shattering revelations here.  Smith tells a great story of his ascent with GS, and the deterioration of the culture before, and especially after, the subprime meltdown.  Its interesting. But anyone who regularly sees the articles in the Wall Street Journal of the multimillion dollar fines, suspensions, jail time, and other penalties being meted out for unethical or criminal business practices by the securities regulators on its members won't be surprised that GS is motivated by profit first, image second--and client interests, somewhere down the list.
1451662432|5.0|Arnie's book is a good read. I read the book upon sleeping and I actually had trouble falling to sleep after reading in it. That is because Arnie is super energetic, and the book conveyed his energy and my systems went into overload and I couldn't sleep. Arnie is also fun, and I laughed from time to time. The man has got an amazing memory and it's facinating to be taken through, first the bodybuilder world, then the movie world, and lastly the political world. Arnie conquers it all. So Arnie, what's next? I would love Arnie as president of the US, I not sure I would agree with all his views, but I think he is cool and clever. It's a shame that Arnie can't run for president because he is not born in the US. In fact the US legislation, in this instance, is saying that citizen born in the US have more rights than citizen not born in the US (Citizens who have gained citizenship). So as it is now, an immigrant can never gain the same civil and political rights as a native American! Anyway, I wonder what will be on Arnie's to-do list for 2013? I was actually surprised about the high quality of Arnie's writing, it could perhaps be interesting if he moved into fiction writing? Also Arnie, there exists great things in the world which are not widely known, in that respect this man can proberly be an eyeopener [[ASIN:1847991173 THE WISDOM PROCESS Safely into the unknown]]<br /><br />Merry X-mas and a Happy New Year Arnie!
B007THA4FI|3.0|A very raw story that portays the social and political structure and lives of British suburbs. No happy ending. The characters were all unhappy and lacking love in their lives.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|In spots it's too wordy.  Otherwise I enjoyed it.  The Racketeer is different<br />from the other books I've read by John Grisham.  In a good way.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|One of the best christmas (with a small c on purpose) movies of all times. It ranks up there with Die Hard and Christmas Vacation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the complete trilogy. It's a little misleading when you buy the first book. The story is actually ONE book divided into 3 parts because you can't stop at just one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i love this game but I wish there was continuous play. I do not like to have to wait for energy to accrue.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I thought it was a pretty good movie, definitely had a lot of action. I'm interested to see how the Part II plays out.
B0085YNML2|1.0|Absolutely boring. Not worth the money. Good thing I got it when it was free. Uninstalled after 5 minutes of playing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Want some good music to listen to while cooking, cleaning, goofing off, chasing kids, working on code?  This fits the bill!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked it, and It was worth watching.  Special effects were very good, and I liked the story line too.  A little deep, but not too much.
0345529057|5.0|If you even just like Game Of Thrones, you gotta read this series. It will broaden your understanding of and fascination with the show. George R.R. Martin is as good as any fantasy writer and better than a medieval historian at telling a story.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Awesome movie!  The best of the trilogy in my opinion.  If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I thought this movie was great, definitely kept me on my toes, kinda like Incognito did. I want to watch this movie again and the ending was great, I like endings like that.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|i absolutely loved this book. it was epic .but i hav to admit son of neptune was better. but im just weird like that because i prefer percy over jason
B009VB7P6G|4.0|This was a cute continuation of the Tinkerbell story line.  My daughters laughed throughout the movie and earned a high rating from me for that.  It has a decent story with the predicability (for better or worse) of the usual Disney faire.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|It's not what you think it is at first but it is a beautiful movie about life, adventure, and what is important.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of those authors that can take you and put you in a moment that is relevant to the times we live in. Great stories!
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy was a very good read.  It was so addicting that I couldn't put it down.  I read all 3 books in under a week.  I liked how Ana was able to get Christian to learn how to love and trust someone.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|Although the story is not rich as the original, it is still an action-packed movie which I found very entertaining
B00021HBGS|5.0|Perfect for a little boy who loves bath time and cars!  Comes in a mesh bag to hang on the bathtub to store the wet foam shapes!!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|As reviewed by my 11year old daughter:<br />This is a really good movie.  Its isn't quite as good as the book though. The special effects were really cool, and I liked the hydra especially!
B00A0SMTXS|3.0|I am tired of seeing classics being destroyed. Name them something else and change the plot a bit. This would save those classics and give new ones for this generation to remember later.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I should have just kept what I had and not upgraded. it wouldn't even load my emails after a half hour of waiting! so frustrated! !
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The first half of the movie had alot of funny parts and it is one of the few movies that both me and my wife laughed at.  On the other hand the second half of the movie seemed to kind of drag and didn't move quick enough.  It also go a little too sappy for me probably why my wife liked it so much.
B0064BWDRW|2.0|I was disappointed that the Harry Hole character , who is, physically, fast becoming a shadow of his former self, is engulfed by other characters who are so unpalatable, as to make the whole story at best unappealing and at worst pointless.  The language and actions of the characters are increasingly gratuitous.  I had, in previous Jo Nesbo books, enjoyed the richness of plot, text and characters, but these have sadly, in Phantom, taken second place to modern day cultural violence and general disregard for humanity.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I would like this game more if it didn't run out of energy so fast and have to wait to play it again.  I know that you can buy jewels but don't feel that should be part of the game.  Can't afford to do that all of the time.
B006LG7GIQ|3.0|Winslet was great once again and I believe if it were not for her acting, this movie may have been a total flop. The story line is somewhat difficult to follow as far as getting into the depth of these to main characters which lead to an ultimate stunning ending. I did see that they tried to inject a litttle humor in it but it just lacked something. In whole, the film was entertainly odd.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Love the fight scene. Do not let the kids watch it though it is Rated R for a reason. Lol
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Just like lots of other people, I saw this game on Tabletop.  It's pretty easy to explain to new people (elderly & kids alike figured it out within the first round) and it's a great 5-15 minute game.  Really creative idea and great for a zombie enthusiast like me.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|But getting the the minimum jumps is next to impossible for me. Other than that I think it is fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow up to Fall of Giants.  An incredible mix of gripping twists, family and international politics laced on top of historical events we all thought we knew so well.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Can't share, can't change cover photo and it freezes up and is way too complicated to exit out of a picture&middot; Fix it
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This movie was good. I'm not sure we recommend it for the youngest in our household (3 years), but the adults in our house liikeed it.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|For me It didn't come close to the previous Batman movie. Bane came across as mundane relative to the evil of the Joker. Even great acting can't overcome a relatively poor script
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie is so good, that it was a breath of fresh air. The story line is awesome, and the director did a great job capturing it. I believe the message is to not be afraid of living or dying.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|So far I'm barely halfway through the second book, but I've enjoyed every word of this amazing story. I mostly recommend this product because of the excellent price for the 4-book bundle. The only detail I didn't like so much is that the books appear as a single item on the kindle library, instead of being individual books.
0425263916|5.0|Superb! Fantastic! Well written. Very well done can't wait for May to get here. I couldn't put it down.  A+
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am fascinated with the information about Jobs.  I am also delighted that it is written so that I can generally understand what is happening with the products he helped develop.  I also enjoy the information concerning his  personal life.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|We have 3 girls, ages 10, 8 and 3. They all liked this movie, and it even kept the adults attention. Would surely recommend.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|classic Linkin Park. only one or two songs on the album that weren't my style. I love the opening to &#34;Papercut&#34; especially. sick beats!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed the story. It opened my eyes to the sadness of children who have such little nurturing. The characters were believable.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I ordered this book because it was on the best seller list, and after reading it, I can't imagine how it made the list!  The writing is average at best, the plot line is too contrived and the ending feels forced and unrealistic.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The story line is compelling and the acting phenomenal. Who wouldn't love an old dowager who responds to, &#34;I'll take that as a compliment.&#34; with &#34;Oh, I must not have said it right.&#34; (or similar) Downton Abbey's characters are well-developed and just enough intrigue to keep everyone watching.
1401307787|4.0|I ordered this book when I ordered Full Catastrophe Living, they seem to go together.<br />It will be a long time before I'm through with it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Like i said at the top, it's AMAZIN!!!! I love this app because it notifies me when im mentioned or when someone dm's me. Much love for this app &lt;3
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|A little disappointing the way the style was changed from the original versions, although I am a Susan Boyle fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Gave it 5 stars because I thought it was exciting and suspenseful- never sure who the enemy really was.  Can't wait for the third book.
B0052REQLK|5.0|Most of the lessons you already know, but haven't given them much thought. This book brings it home and reminds you to take action before it's all over!
1401923119|5.0|By relating research to the way our body and mind work, the author prompts the reader to look at what we believe, and why we believe, in new and creative ways. I love this book.<br /><br />I've heard him speak on this topic and it's a real treat.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Didn't laugh much and thought the bear was just OK. I wouldn't recommend it for the price. The last 10 minutes was the best part of the movie.
1400067820|1.0|The author was trading puts and calls when sophisticated models and complex derivatives were introduced to Wall Street.  He left trading and devoted his life to criticizing the people who built models and traded derivatives.  This book represents one more stage in his Quixotic adventure.<br /><br />The book is filled with contradictions.  For example, he holds an academic position, yet he criticizes academics and research.<br /><br />He sees himself as an expert, but he offers opinions on everything including medicine, luggage, architecture, finance, technology, and politics without evidence.<br /><br />The book is nothing more than angry opinion.  Save your money and time.  Don't buy it.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this for my 12 yr old niece that had read the books  - she's a fan of the series and wanted this for Christmas; I of course bought her a copy because the film/story is about a strong empowered young girl that rises above the challenges against her and helps her family and others, which is soemthing I want my niece to look up to.  The film can be a bit violent at times, but its message is uplifting and it is a good story.  Recommended.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this. With Zeppelin essentially not playing together for so many years, I thought this would be a waste of money. It's not often I write reviews, but I felt there were probably many others who felt like I did about buying this. I'm here to tell you to lay aside your apprehension. If you are or ever were a big fan of Zeppelin, you should get this. The bonus DVD is ok, but if want to save a few dollars, go ahead and skip it. I do highly suggest you get the DVD to watch the concert. The audio only disc packs wouldn't be worth it in my opinion.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The poor girl suffered so much and I enjoyed her writings.  I feel that she is healing very well.  I wonder how she is doing at the present time.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|Does exactly what was expected, and perfectly.  I especially like the appearance of the &#34;mouse&#34; when needed.  It comes in very handy.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|My grandson told me I had to read this book.  He is 16 years old and he ranted and raved about the book all the time.  I finally decided to read it and it literally took me 2 days to finish it!  It was fantastic!!!  The book held me in the palm of its hand and gave me an insight on the horrors in Afghanistan...but also a new appreciation for the people and what they have endured for so many years.  This is truly a love story in the face of insurmountable odds.  It proves that LOVE CONQUERS ALL!!!!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is without doubt one of the very best thriller writers of our era. In Mitch Rapp, the CIA operative he has created, all patriotic Americans can enter a fantasy world where our government is tries to preserve our nation under the Constitution, while fighting the nation's enemies without reservation. Instead, we live in a United States where the Constitution is being subverted on a daily basis and the very people who try to protect our freedoms are labeled \\"terrorists\\".<br /><br /> Rapp is called to Afghanistan when  top CIA operative, a secretive and eccentric agent whose brain is crammed with secrets goes missing, leaving behind four dead bodyguards. When Rapp is around, the body count can be expected to mount quickly and Flynn doesn't disappointment here.<br /><br /> Flynn rules the roost when it comes to building complex and often convoluted plots and this one is a doozy.<br /><br /> Very quickly we are immersed in Washington bureaucratic in-fighting, CIA crisis management, treacherous self-serving politicians, evil foreigners, torture, killing and . . . well, this is a Mitch Rapp novel. It is not about a quiet day at the office.<br /><br /> The plot twists come quickly here and Rapp faces more obstacles than usual. CIA Director Irene Kennedy gets more play than usual. Grizzled veteran Stan Hurley plays a role as well, but you can see Flynn is setting the stage for future stories.<br /><br /> I don't like to get into plot details for fear of spoiling the fun for others - and \\"The Last Man\\" is a great deal of fun for Mitch Rapp fans. There's lots of action, lots of blood, lots of gore and moral righteousness. I am still not sure if I like the ending, but it certainly doesn't take away from story.<br /><br /> Overall, this is just about vintage Flynn. It kept me up late two nights in a row because I simply couldn't put it down - and if you appreciate good old-fashioned American heroism, neither will you.<br /><br />Jerry
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Basically, a story that was interesting but it was hidden beneath boring, trite, poorly written fantasy. Out of curiousity, I skimmed the predictable pages which were most of the writing.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've been a Flynn fan for a long time and have especially liked his series with CIA operative Mitch Rapp doing battle against the nation's enemies in the counter-intelligence and special operations arena. His latest offering doesn't have the same force and intense escalation as some of the previous books, but is still a very good read in the genre.<br /><br />Rapp and his crew are tasked with finding a CIA operative who has disappeared from his safe house in Afghanistan under mysterious and violent circumstances. An operative who has a lot of top-level secret information the bosses in Langley don't want their enemies, or friends, to learn about. Enough characters and other elements are introduced to keep the reader guessing who is behind the scheme, including the usual political intrigue in Washington D.C. that Flynn is so good at using to enhance his plot.<br /><br />For the most part, the supporting characters are sufficiently developed to maintain the reader's interest. I thought the wrap up with the primary villians at the end was somewhat anti-climatic. I've read better written scenes of shootouts and violent confrontations in other books, but Flynn does an adequate job delivering final justice to those who deserve it.<br /><br />The Last Man is a well-written, action-packed story that keeps the reader moving along from scene to scene. The tension buildup may not be as powerful as in some of his prior novels, but Flynn's writing certainly keeps your interest until the end.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very helpful for anyone self-publishing.  It helped me tremendously when I was preparing my formats before downloading.  I would recommend this to anyone just starting out.
1439102813|3.0|Even though Alzheimers is all around us, we who are beyond 50 years of age, seem to prefer ignoring it rather than embracing it. Everyone should take advantage of reading this carefully researched novel which gently guides one through the life changes in Alice.  It is a sad, but sweet book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo and this game is pretty fun. I love to be able to take a little time to just play a game or have a brain teaser.
0316069434|5.0|Harry Bosch has never been a by-the-numbers detective. In fact, much to the irritation of his superiors, Bosch marches to the sound of a different drummer, but he clears cases. He has a checkered history with the Los Angeles Police Department and is now working on a contract with cold case files.<br /><br /> The 20th anniversary of the Rodney King riots is coming up and the LAPD wants to show the many unsolved murders from that time are still under investigation. Harry gets the still unsolved case of Anneke Jespersen, a Danish photojournalist whose body had been found by National Guardsman on a burned out street, shot once in the head. Back then, Bosch worked the case - for fifteen minutes before being pulled off to investigate one of the many murders of those violent few days.<br /><br /> Bosch is one of most dogged - and clever - investigators in police procedurals. Harry believes that every case has a \\"black box\\" - \\"a piece of evidence, a person, a positioning of facts that brought a certain understanding  and helped explain what had happened and why\\". Right now, all Harry has is a pair of cardboard boxes containing the files and evidence of the case.<br /><br /> Harry is always at odds with the bosses from the Chief on down. The new head of the Open-Unsolved Unit, an imperious Lieutenant is forever on Harry's case.<br /><br /> Harry begins to track a new possible lead - and the story takes off like a slow-moving rocket. Harry Bosch typically moves deliberately and not necessarily quickly. We join him as he visits gang banger in prison and starts putting together the history of the murder gun. Bit-by-bit Harry begins to unravel the mystery, while fighting off the LAPD.<br /><br /> I'm not going to get into a lot of details for fear of spoiling the story. The pace is a bit slow, so this book will keep you company over several evenings, a welcome relief hopefully from the real world. Harry is a single-parent with a precocious sharp-shooting teenage daughter at home. He has a sort of girlfriend (for the time being) who is a psychologist. Sometimes Harry gets into situations where people try to kill them and he (unsurprisingly) kills them first. All in all, Harry is a very believable character.<br /><br /> \\"The Black Box\\" is an excellent police procedural and a very satisfying read. Harry Bosch has been around for a long time and author  Michael Connelly has been aging him bit by bit. Harry is older, wiser and still one of the smartest cops out there.<br /><br />Jerry<br /><br />Jerry. He has a sort of girlfriend (for the time being) who is a psychologist.

0399160450|5.0|Timely and believable in today's world.  This book follows in the steps of his past works and the characters fit into his world.  A very good read.
0486438600|4.0|This is going to be a wonderful gift for my daughter.  They have had local classes teaching the art of Henna Tattoos and we haven't been able to make it to any of them.  She is going to be so suprised and excited!  Thank you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I like this approach to history. His use of the  same or connected characters is useful to following the story.
B007YJS7G4|3.0|It was okay but wasn't at all worth the hype.  Wasn't really about the Tuskegee Airmen.  More on one fictional mans personal life that had nothing to do with history.  I think it was an attempt to be like Titanic and failed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Makes it easier to keep up with my inspiration boards without having to log in to a computer.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|They took a big leap to go from Bourne ultimatum to supremacy and an even bigger one to get to this one. The first half of the movie lays the story, however unplausable, and descends into one big chase scene. So worth the rent if a fan but feel sorry for those that paid theater prices.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|if you got three hours to kill and don't know what to do, this is a great way to kick back and enjoy yourself.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It's was just ok.<br />Even though I read the other reviews, I still wanted to see it b/c of Channing Tatum.
1608871088|5.0|I want to get this book because one of my friends had this and I only could look at it for a few seconds and it was STUNNING! All of the scenery, like Bunnymund's warren, are unbelievable. I think this book is beautiful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|That is soooooo addictive........I play each one so I get a star.... and if I get stuck, I shut down for awhile, then go back to it and it seems it just comes to me..
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very good app. It gives a good breakdown of of battery consumption as well as charge capacity and recharge rate.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I would never have selected this movie myself, but my girlfriend wanted to watch it. I really enjoyed it. Nice to have a partner who forces me to watch movies I never would on my own (I tend toward zombie movies) that I actually end up enjoying.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoyed the scenery of India and liked the actors.  It was a nice story and especially older people will enjoy it.
B000T433CO|4.0|This is a light-hearted romantic movie that is fun to watch. Jude Law and Cameron Duaz have a nice on-screen chemistry. She is gorgeous as ever and although I typically don't care for his movies, I very much liked him in this one. Kate Winslet is fabulous, as usual. Jack Black plays his part well. The script has some weak moments, but overall it's a cute film. Definitely not for kids, even with the PG-13 rating. Worth watching just to see Eli Wallach and the cameo by Dustin Hoffman.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Entertaining yet informational. Easy and interesting. Must read for baseball fans. Michael Lewis does a fantastic job of telling a story that is still being written.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places has disturbing characters and a disturbing plotline, but it will certainly keep you reading we'll into the night.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun game with good graphics. Good for free, but can be finished in few hours or less. Good app for free app of day.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|Amazing historical account and written as only Follett can.  Though I lived through the events, I had no idea the real drama that was playing out.  A must read.
B007EE564U|5.0|I just loved the book. Lots of twists and turns with loads of action. The secret I suspect is that justice prevails which in real life is becoming less frequent.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Overall the book was well written. It got a little slow towards the end. But I loved it! Very educational and a page turner. <3
B000W8HC8I|3.0|This is an interesting book in the way stories about rich, famous or powerful people captivate us.  This guy was making a million dollars a week and flew a helicopter to meetings at age 30, but he was the lowest of scum in terms of how he treated other people, to say nothing of how he cheated the stock-trading and tax systems.  After each reading session I always felt like I needed a shower.  Of course now Scorcese and diCaprio are making a big movie about it.  I'll probably be forced to check it out.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|This film deviates greatly from the original but is still well done with interesting choices with the cinematography, but I did like it and Charlize Theron is brilliant in her adaptation on her part
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Just another on the &#34;hit&#34; parade. I am a grandmother and I love some of the sounds. There are a few songs that I do not like, but the first 6, I plkay over and over.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|There were few funny moments. The film would have benefited from greater editing. It dragged on and, at times, lost my attention.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I really really enjoyed the music in the movie.  The soundtrack mostly met my expectations but some of the songs were changed.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies ever! Will Ferrell plays the part so well, you just want to watch the movie over and over. &#34;Elf&#34; was made for Will Ferrell.
B009329Y30|5.0|I loved the book and the movie was just as good! Def recommend for a girls night or date night. Right up there with the notebook and a walk to rememeber
0790733226|5.0|This movie helps us expand our ideas of what is possible, and might even be. I liked the openness of the possibilities this film showed and then we have the government officials who try to restrict and control possibilities, so this movie has many elements and I think its a must have if you like to stretch yourself and I super highly recommend it
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|kids loved it. they have been waiting for this movie to come out on amazon for awhile, and was worth the wait.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|The Kindle Fire is barely too large to fit in the sleeve. Amazon makes both products! How does that happen? Should be shipped with a rubber band to hold it closed because the zipper won't work.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|This app allows any amatuer to star gaze and know what they are looking at. Great for teaching astronomy. I use it for guiding my photography of the solar system.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Seth Macfarlane knows how to use shock value very well, and in this case he chose to do it with a talking teddy bear that swears, drinks and all sorts of things. If you like Seth's sense of humor, you'll like this.
B0011EU0NG|1.0|After watching Mary poplins, thought this would be similar. It wasn't.  It was more like they threw songs together and made the movie fit around it, which is why the story was so boring.  I thought, ok, I don't like it but maybe my 3 year old daughter will... But she gets bored of it too. Don't buy it... Just keep watching Mary popins for a good classic.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|The best Star Trek I have ever seen and stands alone. It is well done and fast paced, and I recommend it
B002V79VJ6|5.0|Was hard to find this movie in stores. Shipped fast. Thanks.  Loved the little calendar that came with it as well just for collection purpoaes
B009VB7QQA|3.0|It's okay. It's not bad. Some really good action scenes and awesome cinematography. Can actually make you shed a tear in some parts. Not bad.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Title says it all.  Buy this book now and you will not regret it!  This is the real deal for sure.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love everything about this series. Acting is superb. Story has many twists that you don't expect. Very suspenseful. Everything you want in a show.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I chose this book because it was written by an accuale Seal who was there during this raid<br />I always like to know the truth about everything of importance. The personal accounts of what it takes to become a Navy Seal .
B00005K3OT|5.0|This is a wonderful film and I recommend it to everyone, it has the north wind the blows and is to be followed but some time there is a place to stay and this is a film about coming to stay and creating friends and roots, its really good and I highly recommend it, I loved it.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show, so I thoroughly enjoyed the selections on this CD. It's a nice mix of contemporary and show-tune music, giving fairly equal time to both female leads. I hope the network releases the entire &#34;Marilyn&#34; score next year...some of the best tunes weren't included in this collection.
B009GEEMLY|2.0|I didn't go gaga over this movie. You know you don't like a movie too much if you begin multi-tasking as you watch it. My best friends love it and have seen it a bunch a times. I guess it depends on personal taste. Didn't much enjoy the Iron Man 2 either; prefer the first one. I prefer Ghost Rider, The Punisher, and others.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. I'ts the kind of movie that you come to expect from 'Sly'. When is Expendables #4 comming out ?  The action just keeps getting better. Critic hate it, but I love it. Feed me more.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|You just can't go wrong with this wonderful Christmas classic of wonder and hope.  I BELIEVE! I prefer the black and white version, but having the color version is a great addition to our collection.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The writing style was refreshing and fun to read. I just didn't understand the ending very well. Now I can watch the movie with no regrets.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Its action packed and fun, but not enough background for me but if you like nonstop action this is the film
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is a powerful, spare, and beautifully acted film.  It's rich in humanity and historically accurate; a great film for all ages.
B000WCDI64|5.0|After her death I bought some CDs  as I was not familiar with her music before.  What a talented woman. I have since bought whatever I could find which sadly isn't much. Rest in Peace
1594135851|4.0|Great quality. I like it. It is a good book, Catching fire. However the text was too big. Catching fire (Hunger game 2)
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 wasn't quite as good as past seasons, but even at that it still beats most shows out there! Rip-roaring fun!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|we love this movie. Great price and recieved it fast. would but from again for sure. :) ;) :) ..
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Do see this as it has myth and magic and humor and as with most myths has some very good lessons, a fun and good film
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Riveting, visually stunning, and every detail is spot on.  This is more than entertainment--much richer and more nuanced, and very thought provoking.  Season three can't start soon enough for me and a few other fans...
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Great movie.  I love raunchy comedies and this fits the bill.  The jokes and gags are awesome.  Not for everyone.  This is an adult comedy or the teenager in all of us.  Blows away the Hangover which is a chick flick trying to appeal to men.  The is a classic 80's style comedy that will offend.  Don't watch if you can't handle a joke.  This movie is politically incorrect, which makes it a classic for all time. Minor spoiler, if you are a fan of the 80's Flash movie,which I am, then get ready to be pleasantly surprised.
159413586X|3.0|It is an OK book. There is nothing much to say. Most people said it was not the best compare to other 2 books, but I think it is OK.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|While I am a Jeremy Renner fan, this one fell a little short. It seemed a little light on the plotline. His character lacked depth.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|Just got this game and love it! But gets old fast with only 4 characters :( maybe add 4-5 more characters? And some more things to do with their hair etc? Hope there's an update soon :)
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I loved this film, it has great action and a story line that follows the book pretty well. The special effects were well done without losing the story line, I recommend it if you like this type of film
B002P79KAC|5.0|it was great and funny. it is a good show, it make you laugh a lot and the people can enjoy this very much
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Anyone who has ever asked \\"why are we here? \\" , this is a great book for you. Unique insight into the hereafter by a scientist/surgeon. Great reading, wonderful message!
B009LRE040|5.0|It was really great to see what can be overcome and how they played out the strengths and weaknesses of Batman
0547564651|2.0|Wow.  How dissappointing.  I expected substantive techniques for how to teach my kids to become more resilient.  I feel like a disadvantaged city kid who worked hard expecting to be rewarded for my efforts, only to reach the end of the journey wondering \\"is this all there is?\\"
0743496728|4.0|Jodi has really outdone herself with this. It is original, yet still relatable. I don't want to give away too much, but you have to read this!
B0001I55OC|4.0|A wormhole to the past to find history and to rescue friends? Its well done and I enjoyed it very much, I read the book and loved it and viewed the movie and loved it too, so get it and enjoy the ride, I certainly did
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|It's an essential tool for those that do calcs all the time. That's why I rated 5 stars. I recommend it.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I bought this game and when I go to download it it gives me an error try again. idk anybody else having this problem?
B001I189MQ|5.0|Batman is really put to the test with his nemesis the Joker, it is played exceptionally well and is really well done
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love both the show and the quality of the video.  Love being able to watch what I want when I want :)
B003MC5N28|5.0|I've read this book multiple times and it never fails to evoke emotion. It covers such a wide range of experiences in so few pages; and the ending leaves you stunned and shocked.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I downloaded to read with my 6th grade students.  They all have a copy and each student recieved an opportunity to use the Kindle.  I need more Kindles....the students love it!!!
B005JABU82|5.0|This is an excellent product i would reccommend to 15 years or older. It is very detailed and has a solid feel, highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|thu s game is absolutley amazing. I played block story for a while, but that game isn't even close to being as good a minecraft. totally worth $6.99
B00942V1J4|4.0|I wasn't &#34;over the moon&#34; with it but did enjoy it nonetheless.  I didn't have to pause and do something else and come back to it.  Plus i wanted to catch up so I can see the latest one out now.  Overall, good movie, nice continuation of previous movies.  For those that desire lots of action then you won't see that here - it's much more centered around character driven stories, love story and where that leads them.  Great ending!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A psychological love story with fun scenarios, magical characters and an ending I assumed, but did not welcome. Mr. James shame on you.
B0053HJ1FK|1.0|Package had no protection!! So when I got my steelbook it had gotten all damaged! I've been waiting for a chance to get this steelbook for a while and I finally found one I got it with dents because the sender did not offer any protection!
1574214276|5.0|Nice details to help in zentangle design.  The book is straightforward and easy to read.  The designs are very well explained and easy to follow. I love it!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|There's some pretty raw stuff here, some funny and some not. If 5% of the jokes were toned down, it would be an enjoyable children's movie. As it stands, it's not suitable for children, and it's too predictable (and sophmoric) for adults.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|there were some funny jokes and situations stuck inside the shell of a cliched hollywood movie. It's probably exactly what you expect it will be (if you like Seth Macfarlane's humor). But you don't have to sit through a boring love story with Family Guy, like you do with this movie.
B001F6TXME|4.0|Unfortunately it does not fit the Nikon D40, which is why I bought it - this one's connector is smaller.
B00005Y7AW|4.0|If you like Nilson, then you will Love Rufus. Melodic and Harmonic is the best way to simply explain his music. His lyrics are  insightful.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I was expecting this movie to be WAY funnier. Anna Kendrick & Skylar Astin are GREAT in it though. This is a very different role than those you are used to seeing Anna Kendrick play & I thought she did an awesome job at it. I expected a lot more from Rebel Wilson but she is still fun. Overall, it fell a little flat but still was a good rental.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are aaaaamazing. Read all 3 in one week. You Will not be able to put them down. #teamPeeta
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Channing Tatum... No shirt... I'm there!  It is one of your typical chick flick, girls night type of movies. I'd recommend it for that reason alone.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My son and I enjoyed watching this movie. It was funny with a goord storyline to keep it interesting.  I recommend this movie.
0060594896|5.0|Jack Canfield wrote this book for executives.  It is nothing like his Chicken Soup books.  It compilation of the author's life time of study on success principles.  Each chapter stands on it's own.  One can read the book in sequence or skip from one chapter to the next.  The reviewer has read and reread this book, underlining and highlighting significant passages.  I have given copies of this book to other business owners and it is mandatory reading for all of my employees.  Canfield shares the  techniques he has used and how they changed his life. The reader can use these techniques and will often get the results similar to what  Canfield describes. Good luck.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is incredible, all three seasons. Watch it please. The way that all of the characters interact while still surviving is nothing short beautiful. If you like psychologically challenging tv, actiony tv, dramatic tv, or tv in general, or don't even like tv at all, you will love this. (watch seasons 1 and 2).
B008OOYALE|5.0|What a great game! The only thing I don't like is the constant reminders about new dragons available for purchase. Tell me once, and that's enough! The only reason I'm writing this review is because it keeps asking for it. Maybe now ot will quit...
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|When I bought this yesterday, there were no reviews yet, this morning there was one.  After reading THAT review, I felt it necessary to add my own.  As the other reviewer correctly observes, there is profanity (not a deterrant to me, but I understand it MAY be to some) and the mix/actual recording is not the best.  In this day and age, it seems strange they couldn't get this right. Having been to Legends many years ago, perhaps they have a house system they record through but the engineering/mix is just not what it should/could be.<br /><br />One GLARING omission to that review is that it's only HALF a live cd with some studio tracks tossed in at the end.  So buyer beware, the title is a little misleading, not sure what the title SHOULD'VE been (Partially Alive at Legends?).  But in all fairness to \\"The Legend Himself\\", it's a pretty decent live performance.  I'm a HUGE live music fanatic, but confess to normally getting a little bummed when an established artist leans too heavily on either cover tunes OR what I call pep rally stage banter.  My feeling is that if the artist/entertainer is doing his job right (and not going through the motions) the audience doesn't NEED to be told to interact,they are sufficiently moved by the performance to do so.  That having been said Buddy's banter was humble, salty, funny and engaging and did not detract from the performance which was hot, but a little short for my liking.  The studio tracks are decent and his playing is solid throughout.  Personally, I would've preferred a longer performance.<br /><br />I wouldn't say I have buyer's remorse, it was sort of an impulse buy based on it's sale price and being his most recent release.  While I liked it, I'm not sure that I would recommend this to others who weren't already fans.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Like the sound effects. It is really fun to play with and pretend that you are the doctor. Fun for any doctor who fan.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I read Atonement by Ian Mcewan, and was looking forward to reading Sweet Tooth. Now let me say I loved Atonement, but I only liked Sweet Tooth. It was good, but I'm not raving about it.
140053271X|5.0|I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!
B00633W614|5.0|He is a wonderful writer.  He leaves you hanging on the last page.  What will happen next? hurry up please Mr Archer
B003JJA59K|4.0|the movie was great, but the sound was sopoor i could hardly hear without having my ear to the speaker
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I read recently that this series was one of the most popular TV shows on today, and being a senior citizen - it never occurred to me that I might like it.  So I tried one episode and was hooked.  The humor is intelligent, the personal interactions of the cast are probably more of what you would find in the real world than some of the so-called reality shows.  I find it engaging, addictive and just plain funny.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The ending of this movie really left you hanging. I realize that there will be a sequel to this one but the plot didn't really end in a good spot. This movie does tie into the Bourne Ultimatum story line using the same exact clips from that movie. These were okay to develop the plot but stood out too much. I my opinion, wait for it to watch on tv/netflix but not to purchase.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The fact that the book was written by a Dr., in my opinion, really added some &#34;creds&#34; to his experience. I wish my brother, who is an athesist, and dying of pancreatic cancer was able to read this book. Too bad it's too late in the day for him, but I highly recommend this book for all those questioning souls.
B007KWD7BK|5.0|Just amazing. The best metal album that is not a metal album ever. I've had this for a month and listen to it at least once a day, and get something new every time. Just buy it.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|movie was actually  pretty a a a a a a a a a aa a a aa darn good g
B004ZN9RWK|2.0|For $12 you'd think they could swing a hard jewel case like any CD you buy in a store....instead a soft sleeve..Really??/
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm glad I can get this through Amazon. I work every other Sunday, so I don't miss the shows.<br />I generaly don't watch zombie shows, but like this because of the survival aspect.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I was delighted to learn that Ian Rankin was bringing out a new John Rebus book and my anticipation was rewarded. Rebus is back, scruffy, flawed, anarchic, intuitive and intelligent as ever. Malcolm Fox gets a walk on part and that is perhaps all he should ever get. I was disappointed with The Complaints in part because of the dull character of its hero, who I don't think is compelling enough to sustain a sequel in his own right. Rebus in contrast is larger-than-life and believable: I welcomed him back like a lost friend. Despite his boozy and wayward ways -- or perhaps because of them -- Rebus has a pronounced streak of warmth, decency and empathy that is lacking in Fox, who is a self-righteous prig. As I say, keep Fox as a secondary character, subordinate to Siobhan Clarke and Ger Cafferty etc. Rebus is tops!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome!!I love it so much and you should too.Remember this is my option.You may may not like it.But you should totally love it.Thanks.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|It was a great movie. It left me thinking about it for days later. Of all the Batman movies, this one was a favorite.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|You can't get on without a calendar account. The only reason I didn't use the calendar that came with the kindle fire hd was because of this account. Amazon has to take this feature off. after that I won't hesitate to rate it much higher.
0375413405|5.0|I have been cooking my way through Julia's cookbook for a few years and every recipe is delicious! I won't cook vegetables any other way now.  Julia has made it easy for me to cook extraordinary!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good way to exercise your memory powers.  Very addictive, want to keep going and to finish the game.  Very good game.
1451695195|3.0|Not quite there - too technical - wanted more about heaven.  A bit disappointing wanted more about what he saw in heaven
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I am a mystery/legal thriller fan and I enjoyed this book very much.  I would recommend and the price was great! I plan to find more of this author's books.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love it...and I love the show (regardless of what the critics say). I'm not even a country music person, but I do like some bluegrass. This music has a bluegrass &#34;twang&#34; and a little rock.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great story, love the way History is mixed into the Fiction. Its very easy to fall in love with the characters.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Toy Story earns it's massive acclaim---mesmerizing, humorous, and humanizing. A great story delivered by a snappy screenplay, solid acting voices and superb directing.
0385535147|5.0|Saving it for a winter read.  Can't say much mor because I have yet to read the book, but I know it will be great
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was intertaining,like all his writing is.Liked the twist at the end. Would recamend it to other people. No more
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book had me up longer than usual because I counldn't put it down. I am frantically waiting for the next book which I am having a hard time locating. But other then that It was a really really good story
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved, Loved, Loved it.  I am eagerly anticipating the next book ( hoping for an early release date).<br />You will not be disappointed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never disappoints, nor does Mitch Rapp.  Mitch talks to and does to terrorists as we would like to if given the chance.  Excellent read Fom start to finish.
0316228532|5.0|From the opening sentence to the final word, _The Casual Vacancy_, had my full attention.  If there was any doubt about JKR's skill as a writer before picking up this book, it's been dispelled and is one of the best reads I've come across in a while.  From intricately developed characters to an expertly woven storyline there's no want of content to hold the reader's attention.  I only hope I don't have to wait very long for her next book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1619695944 The Casual Vacancy]]
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Great Movie. Great effects. Great story, Awesome acting. The ending was a bit saddening, but I can't offer up a better ending other than everybody rides off into the sunset alive and well.
B004I744AS|3.0|It's better then the dictionary that is an the kindle fire.  I would like to just type in a few letters and the dictionary will bring up a list of words like the old kindle does.
B007P6VM04|4.0|and also like several of the songs that keep poping up--<br />especially History is Made at Night.<br />Need to listen to it a couple of more times to really rate the album but so far, so good.
034580404X|5.0|The product arrived just as promised, it is shrink wrapped in an attractive card slip and holder. The price is quite a bit less than the retail cost at all locations I shopped at. The present is a gift so i can't verify the quality of the novel but with a name like 50 shades of grey I'm guessing its an art book with very boring subject matter...
B0080K3G4O|4.0|I have always been a little uncomfortable with positive thinking and the people who push it. I have read some blogs from Burkeman and was looking forward to this book. Simply put the book explores the use of positive thinking and the problems it can create for those who rely on it. But instead of simply leaving the book at that, Burkeman gives some interesting alternatives to positive thinking. The book does go into some incredible detail and at times a little hard to read. Also after reading all the detail it seems the book wraps up a bit abruptly. Still I found it an interesting and amusing read.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I don't know, maybe I missed the point of the movie. I caught the referrals to past movies for all of the guys (whatever). The movie just didn't have the oomph that all of these guys have given in other movies. Maybe I'm expecting to much. I know they still have it. I am going to blame it on the plot and the story line. Because they are all awesome actors.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very hot and deliciously written. Some of the scenes are cheesy and overdone however, they are still pretty erotic. I do recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You'll be transported to a different world and be lost in it for hours. I watched 2 seasons over three days. A fantastic Stay-cation.
B0085YNML2|4.0|My son loves this game - plays it for hours at a time.  It goes from simple, but gets pretty challenging.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have become quite addicted to this game.  The graphics are great and you can cycle through the levels with challenge but fun.  There is even a more advanced level you can continue on with, if you choose, although I like just starting over and trying to do it faster and faster.  A word of caution - I did click on one of the links to see other games from this Developer and it crashed my Kindle Fire.  Other than that, a great game.
0843189673|5.0|I got these to give out as goody bag gifts for my son's school party.  I grew up with them and see that kids still love them.  Brings back memories.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I do like the second book better, however you do need to read the first to get the second book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|No problems with the game - love it!<br />Very entertaining  - I don't see why I have to add addition info if I summarize everything just a few words - I don't like this mandatory number of words I am supposed to write.
B00371XIJE|5.0|My 12 year old Staffordshire Terrier died not too long ago and this movie allowed me to memorialize him once again and to remember how he was the essence of loyalty and unconditional love. This story is a great family film and more than that it speaks of living in the now.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Several chapters are spent on describing the surroundings.Hence it takes quite a while to know what the story is about .. I like the Scarpetta series but this is not her best novel
B004T32SOK|5.0|very simple and intuitive, which is all I ask in an app. I use it with my Kindle Fire. Nice
B008KE3960|4.0|It's a fun new twist on tower defense games - there are lots of planes, levels, upgrades and specials to use.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the fact that this author is a physician working in neuroscience. He tries very hard to take a scientific approach to a subject that has always been considered off-limits to scientist. Everyone who has any doubts about the afterlife and &#34;near-death experience&#34; needs to read this. I found this book to be very uplifting. His observations about the universe are quite similar to my own, but I have always felt left out of religious thinking.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|the streaming was not too fast, I had to wait several times for the show to catch up with the loading ..... I'm also upset that this was not able to view on the FX website....just another way to make a buck for these companies. I had to see it so I paid the 1.99 . . . I should have gotten the Prime account, I'll have to reconsider the benefits that come with Amazon Prime,.... it's looking better to me.
B002NZTZ8S|2.0|Poor animation.<br />Annoying characters.<br />My 6 year old even lost interest in it after about 10 minutes.<br />There are so many good Christmas movies out there... Don't waste your time with this one.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm a TV watcher, I love my shows - and I had heard about this show and dismissed it. I was wrong - this is THE best show on television right now. The actors are good, the subject is done in a believable way, and bloody scenes are not as bad as you would think. I have passed these DVDs on to several co-workers and we are all hooked now.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Raw and lots of 80's puns very funny and would urge you to see it just make sure your little ones are out of the room and ear shot..
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I give it 4stars ... love love love the storyline n suspense behind Connor next move!  The two main characters life is not ordinary yet they make the perfect couple
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Seven year old grandson  enjoyed watching this movie with his grandparents. It was funny with an inter generational twist. I highly recommend it.
B003GYEGNO|3.0|Not the world's best writer. Tends to beat things to death. But it's amazing how he interweaves all the characters.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I was really impressed with this app. So many varieties of instruments and self play keys for childhood songs.<br />It is so much fun.
1883217040|5.0|I played piano for 6 years as a kid and off-and-on through high school and university.  Now in my mid twenties, I've come full circle to playing again.  This book is making it easy.  Formatted beautifully and laid out in a common sense fashion, The Jazz Theory Book is one of the best, written by one of the best!  Thank you Mark.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I am not a fan of musicals, but a friend wanted to watch this and I am glad that we did.  It was awesome.  If you lived in the 80s and enjoyed rock and roll, this movie will make you laugh and smile the whole way through.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is truly one of the best series shows I have ever watched...better than HBO series.  If you like drama, must see!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|There are days when you just can't sleep. Today is not one if those days. Quell reflect isn't boring but it's so soothing and relaxing that I can't and won't uninstall. The puzzles are neat too! Mostly awesome with a tad sissy puzzle game... Still, there are spikes, there are endless loops, and Doctor Who might even be lurking in there someplace. In short: they don't let you write short reviews for apps. So in long, this app is fun and might even be worth a Crispy Chicken Sandwich at Wendy's. (i.e. A dollar)
030758836X|5.0|I ordered this book as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it! It came in great shape, hardback book, nice size and weight to it. Overall great!
B007HACDLK|3.0|one of the few things that I admired about this series is the action packed Mitch Rapp who likes to get his hands dirty. This book has a lot of bravado and not enough action for a die hard Rapp fan - I must say I would have like Rapp stalking his prey rather than being amped up as if he is Superman!!! Disappointed, but still in for Mitch Rapp and his adventures.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|the child acting is strange and feels goofy, but fits right in with the awkwardness of the whole situation and makes for an entertaining film.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|The cap was a perfect fit after I lost the one that came with my Olympus Pen Epi-1 Camera. The product arrived on time and was much cheaper than in the store
B002ZG98LO|4.0|The nine most dangerous killers on the planet are now in a jungle, and can't remember what<br />happen, but for a bright light and then falling out of the sky. Little do they know that something is<br />hunting them; the deadliest hunter in the galaxy...the Predator. And this time they're not on Earth and<br />he's not hunting them alone. Among the killers are mercenary (Adrien Brody), Mexican assassin (Danny<br />Trejo), a doctor (Topher Grace) who team up with a black ops sniper, a ninja assassin, a Russian soldier,<br />and one of  F.B.I's most wanted. They soon meet a scavenger (Laurence Fishburne) who had been left<br />on this planet for some time. Now the hunt is on between the two deadliest species in the galaxy.<br /><br /> This is the third movie in the Predator series the first one was Predator starring Arnold<br />Schwarzenegger and the second one was Predator 2 starring Danny Glover. This movie has more action<br />and more Predators. It also has a new species called the Predator Hounds. These Predators are armed<br />with an array of weapons both new and classic. The Predators wear new masks with bone designs.<br />In this movie Brody and the others are trapped on a hunting planet with no help and no way off. They<br />soon discover that the only way to beat a Predator is to become one.<br /><br />This movie is action, science fiction, and a horror story all in one with one of the most famous<br />alien monsters in history. The great part about the Predator series is that they always begin with plenty<br />of action.  This new Predator movie doesn't hold back on action like when they face the hounds.<br />Director Nimrod Antal and movie's producer, Robert Rodriguez did a great job on making a new<br />Predator movie with all the same elements of action, suspense, and horror found in the previous<br />movies. This has to be the best Predator movie ever made so far.<br /><br />This movie is rated R due to language and some disturbing scenes. Large amounts of blood and<br />gore are shown when skulls and spines are ripped out of one of the bodies. There are numerous scary<br />moments in this movie like when the Predators surprise them and you don't see it coming. All these<br />things are just what you would expect to happen in a Predator movie.<br /><br /> If you're a fan of the Predator series like me you should watch this movie and a joy it. Everything<br />you love about the Predators are back and better than ever. This movie shows you more about the<br />Predator culture than the A.V.P. series (Alien vs. Predator). It also shows you that the Predators are<br />fighting something far deadlier than the Aliens. So if you want to see this movie and see what they are<br />fighting than you need to see this movie. Fear is reborn.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|I love this movie!  The little girl is so adorable, like an adult in 6-yr-old body.  Only scene the 1st did better is the courtroom scene.  (I miss all the mail being dumped out.)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game it's crazy.  It's a great distraction for short waiting periods when it's not really long enough to read much.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|another great bond film.  Daniel Craig does a great job and this is a worthwhile installment in the franchise.  I recommend it.
B001QVFDA4|2.0|As much as I 'm a Gerard Butler fan, I still can without bias say that this film is second rate.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The plot was convoluted, the dialogue was poorly written, and the acting was wooden, except for Anne Hathaway, who was fluid and feline without devolving to camp. And what is up with that ridiculous mask on the bad guy? And the forced, old-man-sounding voice that dubs in his speech? WTF? With a gimmick like the mask, there needs to be a pay-off; I kept waiting for an &#34;unmasking&#34; to reveal all the hideous deformities it was purported to hide. The final big, over-the-top confrontation between Batman and the bad guy looked promising for just such a reveal, but, alas, it never materialized. I found my mind wandering constantly in boredom, despite the explosions meant to entertain. Sophomoric, adolescent tripe is my ultimate rating of this waste of time and resources. Can we be done with the Batman theme now?
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Just love Mr. deMilles humor mixed in with serious world events. I tried waiting for Christmas but couldn't.I had to see what Mr. and Mrs Corey were up to.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a very interesting book to read.<br />At first I was a little nervous about reading an autobiography because they are usually so dry and hard to read.<br />But I can tell you this book was awesome to read and flowed easily throughout the whole book.<br />If you are interested in being a sniper, or just interested in learning more about it I would seriously recommend this book.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This film would work for a family movie night.  The kids will love it and if you enjoyed the previous films and were waiting to see if they'd make another... well... maybe it's not the best of the three, but it was fun to see the world of the MIB again.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|It was a splendid film when it first came out, and it is still today. The quality of the film seems better.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this collection, 5 other individual dvd's, and a curling iron. Everything shipped together, which I liked. (I don't know if this is a normal Amazon.com arrangement because I'm still fairly new to this..) But anyway, I love it. I received an e-mail yesterday that this set would be delayed but everything else would be sent. The package came today and EVERYTHING was in it! So a nice surprise, the order was very fast and thorough.
B009439E7O|5.0|Awesome. Really heavy. One of there best albums in my opinion.  Also one of the best metal albums of the year.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Wow best Jack Ryan Junior book yet.<br />It's so cool how they have combined both President Jack Ryan and Jack Ryan junior in the same storyline.<br />I cannot wait for the next book of this series to come out.
B009LRE040|5.0|What a great ending to the excellent series of the last few movies.  It's a must-see movie and one of the best superhero films ever.
B001NLKS16|1.0|If you have nothing better to read at the time, get this for your Kindle. It is not worth paying anymore than 99 cents. It's dry and boring with little support to the tv series
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She did it again. Suzanne Collins pulls you in and makes you walk beside Katniss and see and feel all that she does. I couldn't put it down, except to wipe my tears at times.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Very cool. I loved it. We watch the other two all the time. I would highly recommend it and will watch it again.
6305428042|5.0|I seen it when it first came out at the theater and I thought it was great. So I was shopping for halloween movies and came across this and had to have it.
B0037WP83M|5.0|This movie is incredibly good.  It's a must-see film for fantasy fans and people who just want to see a great film.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the book thus far, I can't wait to see the movie!!  So much that I bought tickets for an early screening..  I think the chemistry between Josh Duhamel & Julianne Hough will be amazing.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I would have been disappointed if I saw this in the theatres, but it's worth goving a couple of hours to on a weekend in the comfort of your own living room.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am also very troubled by all the permissions that Big Bro needs to run this app.I like it's functionality but I continue to get a &quot; New Update is available&quot; only thing is it never gives me an Update option - It just brings me to the app page and where Update should be - it only gives me the option to &quot;Open&quot;. I have uninstalled/reinstalled it but that makes no difference. When I check for updates from within the app itself - is says a new update is available but gives me no option to update. With those 2 problems,I still use it daily...but frustratedly.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I just love Disney movies so I had to have this one. It is one of the best movies Disney has put out since The Little Mermaid. Even my 17 year old son liked it.
B00AH8U4OW|4.0|I think the series may be slowing down.  There are a lot of great points in this season, but overall it's not as great as the previous ones.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I love to listen to classical music on occasion to relax, and this did the trick. And being huge fan of the Fifty Shades books was an added plus!! I reccommend this to any fan of the book series who loves great soothing music!!
0399160450|5.0|Very detailed book so have plenty of time to absorb all the action.  This is a thick book so not for the faint of heart.  Totally respect the author for continuing to write these amazing stories. Can't wait for the next one.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|I ordered it.  It never arrived.<br />No explanation was given.  I needed the book for a discussion group.  It would be useful if the delivery was more timely.  Still don't have it.
032147404X|5.0|In The Digital Photography Book, Scott Kelby lays things out in a manner that amateurs like my self can easily understand.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The premise is too goofy.  Not the mind-changing stuff, but the hole through the planet for travel.  The failure to understand physics and the realities of the heat and pressure of the majority of the interior of the planet kind of leaves me stuck.  The rest of the movie is fun, the action is great, the cg is nice.
0345803507|5.0|I love all the books of this series!! This last book of the series had some excitment, sex of course, but Christian really becomes an even better person though his love for Ana, and the ending was sweet. Love it!!
0307592731|5.0|If you are an avid reader, this book is for you.  I would highly recommend in a heartbeat.  Takes you where you haven't been before in your mind.  Great book.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very suspenseful.  Didn't know where it was headed and was surprised at the ending.<br />I was confused a few times but Blake Crouch brought it all together.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The reader just seems to be used and/or required by lots of applications.  Use it mostly for articles and forms.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|This movie is decent entertainment for a few hours.  It's not groundbreaking and the way they use the narration is a little cheesy, as is the ending, but it was worth the rental price.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man<br />This was one of the best he has written. I had difficulty putting it down. I have read most of his books and this one was great.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Grisham has produced another very entertaining opus with quirky characters and plots taken from contemporary legal concerns.  Put it on your list.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I first have to say that this book was wonderful. Slammed and Point of Retreat were two of my favorite books of the year and this one is now on that list as well. This was a real departure from Slammed but every bit as wonderful. Let me just say that their first kiss scene was the most intense and romantic scenes I have ever read. I was so invested in Sky and Holder. I felt everything they felt and just yearned for them to have a happy ending. Some parts of the book were hard to read but only because I was so invested in them. This was without a doubt a 5 star read. Colleen Hoover is able to write in such an honest and true manner. Nothing she writes feels forced but instead it just flows from the page.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I love Jane Austin books... this movie stays true to the story line and even makes it more lively.  The cast is perfect for these characters.  Even my husband loves this movie although it is a chick-flick.  Watch it at least twice a year.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I guess I am still not 100% sure what is going on in the Aliens universe.  This movie I thought would clarify, but it definitely leaves things more cloudy.  I did find the tie ins to the previous films to be great fun to notice.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Well written but bleak and cheerless. No character seems to have any positive character traits. This applies to adults and children alike.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A good game which I use on my Kindle Fire.  It works well and helps pass the time when I am just waiting and don't want to read a book
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|commercials in the middle of game play is ridiculous.  had to stop playing.  good game when I can actually play it. I understand ads but interrupting your game to play a video commercial you can't exit every 30 seconds. to a minute is just plain dumb. too bad.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is a mental challenge in that you have to build a vehicle for accomplishing the task.  A good bit more difficult that just slinging a bird at a target.  May actually be of some educational value to a budding engineer.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This movie was fun to watch.  The way they set up their stills might have been a little less than accurate, but that isn't important to the story.  The story itself was great.  This could almost have been a two-parter with the buildup of the business and then the crumbling and aftermath.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|All women should read this book now! Feminism is quite misunderstood. Women need to grow up and claim their own sovereignty. A real wakeup call. Excellent.
1419702238|5.0|My kid loves ALL of the series. What can I say? He has read them all and wishes for more.
