B00003CXXJ|5.0|I thought this dvd was excellent.  The movie itself is a classic.<BR>Though it did rank on Disney through the movie, it is a classic fantsy tale.  Mike Myers was great as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as the donkey took him back to the days when he did Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop. I laughed through the whole thing.  This is a must see.
B000000M4M|5.0|This is a really great album, down to the last track.  Dinosaur Jr, Pavement, Archers Of Loaf, Sonic Youth, Texas Is The Reason one thing all those artists have in common is that you can't tell a good song from the first 5 seconds of it cause all these artists are great at pinning a precise mood over a precise segment of the song, you have to listen to the whole thing and it'll take you damn near any where.  J Mascis i think is the god father of that unexplainable phenemanen (or how ever you spell it) of a technique
0899668380|5.0|I picked this book up because I had nothing else to read, and it was within my favorite genre.  I had no idea of what it was about.  The only thing I knew about it was that it was one of the books that made Stephen King want to write novels.  So, either it's good, or it's great.<br />It turns out it's neither.  This book captured me for the whole three hours it took for me to read it.  I couldn't put it down.  It is now my favorite book.<br />The book is about a man's dealings with vampires.  For some reason, and I don't know why, even though vampires have been over-written in the past couple of decades, the story in &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is engrossing.<br />If you like the genre, do not miss this book.  This is a must read.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Before watching this film, I read a lot of the reviews posted on this site.  I quickly came to the conclusion that people either loved this movie or hated it.<BR> So, I took a chance and ended up liking the movie.  The subject matter was facinating, the special effects were wonderful, and darn it, I want a Teddy!
B00003CXXP|5.0|If you are looking for a movie that is fun and entertaining and requires no thought process, then this move IS NOT for you. Yes, it does have phenomenal special effects and a lot of &quot;eye-candy&quot; which add to pleasure of the remarkable story, but, there are so many other elements going on in the movie, and if you look and think about what is going on in the movie it becomes an absolute joy to watch. Yes, it is a &quot;think movie&quot; and does not come across to me as a kiddie film, at all. <BR>It deals with morals, ethics, and of course unconditional love.  &quot;A.I.&quot; is like Pinocchio, except with a much more mature twist and entangling story. It does run around 2 and half hours, so if you want to absorb the film I would do it when you could really sit down and watch it without interruption.<BR>Another element I enjoyed about &quot;A.I.&quot; is the mixture of Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick. I don't know how to explain it, but the movie plays as if they both were in the directing chair. As if they compromised with every scene. You can definitely feel the Kubrick-essence of the film. Steven Speilberg stayed true to Stanley's vision and came through with an extraordinary movie.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This has to be one of the greatest stories I have ever seen on the screen!! I have never witnessed a movie with such magic. The boy that plays David should have won an award for his magnificent role. How can somebody get attatched to a robot in a movie and actually feel as if you love this robot? Well, I did!! Women, make sure you have a box of kleenex with you because you will need it. Maybe even most men! lol.

630463949X|3.0|I was disappointed.  I love Fleetwood Mac.....but they sounded pretty rusty together.  After seeing the Eagles &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; concert, I expected a more &quot;polished&quot; concert from Fleetwood Mac.<br />IF you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, you'll enjoy the songs.  But they aren't flawless in their performance.<br />The video and sound quality of this dvd are very good.  Camera shots are excellent.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a total bust.  It's one I wouldn't watch over and over again though.<br />Mick Fleetwood on drums is fun to watch, he's so animated in his facial expressions.

0140277447|4.0|The book gives the reader a \\"Path to Nanking\\" (chapter one) - a history of Japanese/Chinese conflicts.  Then enters into what happen in Nanking during late 1937 and early 1938. There is also a chronicle of what happen afterwards to the main characters and how the countries remember Nanking. It took me more than a month to read this book as the subject matter was so unsettling. I would recommend this book but advise against reading before bedtime. I lost much sleep because of it. It s impossible to believe that such horrors could take place unfortunately they did and still do.  We study history so that we will not repeat the mistakes of our past. I hope everyone reads this book so that these crimes are not repeated.
0446310786|4.0|Wonderful classic that i  well never forget. The reading was slow but for the story it was all worth it.
0446525537|5.0|This book was an easy read because the author is writing his words from the mind of a teenage boy in the 50's. However, that just makes the book all the more enjoyable.  I really enjoyed reading the book because it is a very sweet, and touching book about an unsuspecting young love. The characters were all so colorful, and in depth. i ecspecially enjoyed reading about the rituals of Jamie Sullivan, and the changes of Landon Carter. I could also relate this to my own life. I know what it means to be different, and unique in your beleifs whether religous or not. I was astounded at how Landon grew from this wonderful girl. I would greatly recommend that you read this utterly touching tale. It will kindle and warm your heart, and it will make your spirit feel content. Enjoy this book, and don't rush through it!
B000002LCI|4.0|As a longtime DM fan, I liked this album quite a lot--if I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  I think my big problem with this album is that I own the cassette version, which has a ridiculously long remix side on the B side as filler.  Best for those already familiar with the band's work.  If you grew up in the 80's at all you probably know all the lyrics by heart anyway from the local radio station.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This is definitly my favorite movie! It is action packed and has a little humor in it as well. If you are into cars, then this movie is like heaven for you.<br />This movie is basically based on trust and illegal street-racing. The technology in these cars are unbelieveable, and the stunts that are performed are mind-boggling.<br />I have never seen so much &quot;interesting&quot; action in one scene in my life. I saw this movie twice in the theaters, and I bought the DVD the first day.<br />Some of these cars would be anyone's dream car, but each car gets better than the previous. Whether it's the Green Eclipse or the Honda Civics.<br />This movie is about an undercover cop who joins a racing team in order to find out who has been robbing tractor-trailers for their electronics...<br />Overall, the plot is a 3 but the action/special effects are a 5+. The cars in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen in my life. I think that this movie is more for the younger crowd, it appeals to us more than adults.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I looked forward to this movie like a little kid waiting for Christmas, but, it turned out to be one of the worse movies I've ever seen.  Spielberg should go back to the beach or just try to get the home movies he did when he was a kid, in the theaters.<BR>A.I. Left you waiting for the end, and 2 hours after you watch it your still wondering why did I waste my time, when there was a nice re-run of MASH on the FOX network.  The movie A.I. is a poor excuse for a movie.  Spielberg should have walked away from this one.  The guy died, that's fine, but, Steven, it was his idea, not your's.  You should have run the other way.  You wasted my time, money, and a few brain cells in watching this thing called intertainment. You just can't believe you watched it. There was a stop botton on my DVD, I wish I would have pushed it after about a half an hour.  It's not what you'd call a feel good movie, it's a CAN'T believe I bought it movie.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR SELF AND PASS ON THIS ONE!!!!!!!
B000002NHN|5.0|I've never heard anything like this before, and if you've never listened to McKennitt, you'll be glad you did.  She's completely different from anything you've heard on the radio, blending heavenly vocals with rustic and enchanting Celtic tunes.  But even more than that, I enjoy her deep and intelligent lyrics.<br />Far from bubble-gum pop, McKennitt's songs set famous poems to music, speak of travels to distant places, or sing of famous people and works of art. If Voltaire from the Enlightenment, Leonardo Da Vinci from the Renaissance, or Plato from Greece were to time-travel to the 21st century, they'd might listen to Madonna or the Beatles to learn about us, but I bet they'd listen to McKennitt for enjoyment. Go buy it! They would.
B00005QATY|2.0|When you find a movie like brother where art thou you excpect a twisted comedy thats fiction.  Well it is fiction and it is certainly twisted.<br />Oh brother where art thou is an absolutely terrible movie.  If your gonna get a comedy about the early 1900's with actors that dont fit the plot your takin a huge risk.  And if you took the risk on this movie, well all i have to say is sorry because it doesn't have any dialogue nor nutin.  But what makes you hate the movie the most is just that it isnt funny at all.  They try to make you laugh even smile but THIS MOVIE JUST stinks...Sorry I had to dis this movie so much its just that watching it on a plan without being allowed to turn it off really gets on your nerves.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think this movie its just the best musical I've ever seen. It's ammazing. I really recommend it
B00005QZWI|5.0|In the world of movie soundtracks, Howard Shore is akin to the great film director Robert Wise: that is, he always writes a score that matches the film and without a personal signature, as Robert Wise always filmed a screenplay not to promote a personal vision other than plain good workmanship. But in both cases you get a great product. Like Wise (no pun intended), Shore is diverse but always imaginative and never bombastic, as some of his peers are (like, for example, John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, who occasionally inserts materials from one film score into another). Who would believe this marvellous score was created by the same composer who scored &quot;Ed Wood&quot; or &quot;The Fly&quot;? Each score is different, but superbly matched to its subject. So it is with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;--never bombastic, but dramatic when it needs to be, lyrical when scenes calls for sentiment. And the best test of any score: is it worth listening to without reference to the film? This soundtrack certainly is, as is the orchestral performance, and the added bonus of the ethereal Enya. A wonderful score, and I look forward to seeing his work on the remaining parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;
B00000064G|5.0|I picked this album up in Sydney last August, along with Jeff Buckley - Grace, and Radiohead - Kid A.  After listening to Pink Moon twice over, I didn't unwrap Kid A for a month!<br />I think you would be doing a serious disservice to yourself, if you never listen to an album.  On Pink Moon, Nick's music is almost entirely acoustic guitar driven - which lends the listener to assume his music is simple, but to the critical listener the complexity of his finger picking arrangements, non-standard tunings, and lyrical poetry leave you in a state of disbelief.  It almost makes you think music has regressed since 1972!  Although this album maintains a very somber tone, there are moments of optimism hidden in his words.  Songs like 'From the Morning' and 'Road' have a certain positive feel to them.  In From the Morning Nick Says:<br />&quot;So look see the sights<br />The endless summer nights<br />And go play the game that you learnt<br />From the morning&quot;<br />I can't properly express in words how cleverly Nick assembled these ballads, and how beautiful his guitar work is; but if you ever want to try something new, I'd say Nick Drake is money well spent.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City needs no introduction.  It's one of those few shows that's funny enough, and the episodes are short enough that you could watch it over and over again.  It's nice to see the 30 minute episodes put one after another, as there were some I'd missed, or maybe even some scenes I missed.  There really isn't any special extra footage or anything.  Just lots and lots of Sex in the City.  I do find the price to be a bit much, though.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I have to say that this CD has revived my already super-passion for NIN's music again!!!  Trent IS a genius.  His music is amazing.  And this CD shows this superbly!!!  Tracks like March of the Pigs, The Day The World Went Away, Piggy and Hurt (to name just a few) have been created in a live version to the maximum performance.  Even the tracks that appeared originally on the Pretty Hate Machine release (Head Like A Hole, Terrible Lie, Sin) have been masterfully produced to sound better than they ever have before.  This CD, even though being just a greatest hits live CD, is an absolute must for all die hard NIN fans!!!  I used to rank the Broken and Fixed CD's as my faves...they just got a new partner up at the top!!!!  This CD is great!!!!!!!!!  5 stars is actually too low...it gets a full 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|i have never heard an album with such a diverse range of music. this album literally captivates you from start to end, with it's highly original and interesting lyrics and enjoyable music, It keeps you listening. One thing i noticed about this album is that the more you listen the more you seem to enjoy the amazing songs on offer. though on first listen this album will not have the effect that the 3rd or 4th listen will, as this music demands repeated listening. i loved this album so much that i have since then bought two copies of it. By far better than jagged little pill and Alanis's latest effort, under Rug Swept.<br />Highlights(and there are many): Front row, baba. thank u, the couch, sympathetic character, Ur, can't not, joining you, i was hoping. All the remaining tracks are also good.<br />if you are an alanis fan or just a fan of highly original music, then you shouldn't hesitate to buying this. but remeber give it a chance as it requires repeated listens to catch on.
B00003CY0V|1.0|As the title of my review suggests, this movie is responsible for destroying a considerable percentage of my intellect. Here's a tip for all english majors who aspire to write techno-thrillers: Proper grammar is no substitute for content. Apparently, Hollywood writers don't agree. I call this syndrome, \\"The fact that you can say something without breaking grammatical rules doesn't mean that you know what you are talking about.\\" Depending on my mood, I might also call it, \\"I dropped in a logic bomb and pushed it through the trap door,\\" or even, \\"Stick to love stories, you technically incompetent ninnies.\\"
0807282375|1.0|I am a great reader of fantasy books and had heard so much about this series... it was a huge disappointment and I hope parents will read the series before they let their kids read it. (Yes, I am a parent, but NO I do not believe in censorship - just common sense.) Then the parents can decide if it is appropriate. I thought it was garbled, depressing, with a poor story line and plot. Then the end... well that is another story in itself! This author was trying to teach his readers his own belief on death, -and that the judeo-christian belief in the afterlife is one big conspiracy and lie and that the truth is the merging of all things into one at the end of ones life. That is fine, but parents should be forewarned.<br />On a literary scale, however, the book is part of the worst of the fantasy genre - one of those books that does not have a clear story line or plot, and just seems to jump all over the place. Again, that is fine if you like those kinds of books. I prefer well written sagas like Lord of the Rings, Amber Chronicles, Harry Potter, etc... Those are nice and tight with clear story lines. The only good thing I can say is that the author does create characters with whom you can empathize. Anyway, good luck. I am sure many people disagree with me on this. But I would highly recommend that adults read these before turning kids loose with them, especially anyone under the age of 13.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd by far is one of the best cd ever made.  There really is no bad song.  I first hear &quot;Crawling&quot; and thought it was pretty good, but then they follow that up with &quot;In the End&quot; which by far the best song. I ran out the next day and bought the CD and was not disappointed because the Intro &quot;Papercut&quot; blew me away and the song never lets you rest right after that moment.  Highly recommended! By it NOW!
B00005RYLE|5.0|This has to be the best version, edition, whatever, of the BEST horror movie EVER made.  Period.  If you don't own it, buy it!  If you have a VHS or an older DVD of this movie, burn them and buy this one!  End of story.  Get it now!  Or else I'll swallow your soul!
B00003CXXP|2.0|A truely horrible attempt.  These two directors have nothing in common, and I have no doubt that Kubric is spinning in his grave over this one.  Some of the special effects were SO cheesy - like the wolf-head motorcycles and the baloon shaped like the moon. Nice cinematography, beautifully shot, but a rambling, incoherent, overly-sentimental piece of dogy doo.  One of the few movies to cause me to audibly groan in a movie theatre.  (\\"And then...2000 years passed\\"...argh!)  <br />To the reviewer who compared those who didn't like this movie to their parents who didn't like \\"2001\\"...huh?  100's of years from now 2001 will still be a classic while AI will be collecting dust along side Ishtar and Howard the Duck.<br />Again, to review, a very bad film.
B0000033P0|5.0|If you are considering this CD, and you are new to ELP, or a novice, I am going to give you the straight scoop, after listening to almost all of their work for the last 20 years.<br />Tarkus is a brilliant album. But you either love it or you will hate it. The Tarkus suite is mind-bending. Let's first face the facts: Keith Emerson was having to CREATE his own sounds in 1971. They were not programmed into his synthesizer as they are today. Every sound had to be tweaked through twenty or thirty knobs just to get the right sound. If you have seen the Pictures at an Exhibition movie, you will notice him missing the sound he wanted on many of the intros because it was an art. Given this, what ELP produced was incredible for their day. <br />Tarkus is an album where ELP seemed to have left their short history for a period. Nothing else sounds like it. Toccata might be close, but this was their work, not something they borrowed as in the case of Toccata. It also showcases Carl Palmer's amazing drumming, and Greg lake's voice almost sounds childlike. I highly recommend this album because it exposes early 70s prog music at its best, which was experimental in nature. Listen to it. Force yourself to play it in your car for a week. It will suddenly hit you, that you really will appreciate ELP on this album. BTW: &quot;Are You Ready, Eddy&quot; is a comical song dedicated to Eddy Offord, who produced many of ELP's albums and many of Yes'es. <br />After you have listened to this album, go out and buy &quot;Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends.&quot; It is the best album ELP ever did, bar none. And Tarkus live is incredible.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Apparently I was too hasty when I first reviewed Morning View, I saw a lot in it I liked but some of it just seemed tacked on.  But after about 5 months of listening I can honestly say this album is one of their best...It's hard to choose Incubus' best album though.<br />The more I listen to Morning View the more I find, it's not just another pop rock album, but very textured and deep.  Acoustic songs like Mexico and Just A Phase balance out the rockers like Under Your Umbrella and Circles.  The album also contains a few experimental Incubus songs, not like their funk on earlier albums, songs like Aqueous Transmission and Are You In? are experimental in a completely different way.  Brandon's vocals are even better than they were on Make Yourself, his range has ind once again.<br />Still why haven't they released 11AM as a single yet?  It's obviously the song that could reach Drive success on this album.
0804106304|4.0|This was a great book.  Although at times it may seem kind of random and challenging to follow, if you stick with it, it will all come together in the end.  Amy Tan does a wonderful job of narration for all of the different characters in the book.  From this book you learn many things about the Chinese culture that you cannot learn anywhere else.  You also see how mothers from one country raising children in another cope with all of the changes.  Overall this was a fantastic book.
0140434151|5.0|Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:<br />\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"<br />At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reason<br />Ronald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.<br />The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.<br />Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on thesocial conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.<br />Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.<br />Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.<br />When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)
B00005JKJA|5.0|Having seen a few other David Lynch films prior to this one I really didn't know what to expect having loved his greats like Elephant Man or Blue Velvet and hating his downfalls like Lost Highway or Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me. However putting that aside I steped into the theater and didn't so much as get up to go to the bathroom this movie was amazing. With it's eventfull plot and amazing acting (especially Naomi Watts and Laura Harring) there wasn't a dull moment in this spectacular piece of art. With a emnesia suffering girl only known as Rita she accidently walks into the home of Diane a girl dreaming of stardom and fame. As their two paths collide they are brought on an amazing adventure together and theirs a difference between your common adventure and your David Lynch adventure.

0385335482|3.0|This book reminded me of the song that never ends. It's fun for the first three or four verses and then it's just the same thing over and over again. I found it to be light, entertaining and fluffy (I mean that in a good way), if not highly predictable and a little inane. The main character was easy to relate to at first, but by the end I found her to be stretched and exaggerated. I have friends who LOVED this book more than anything, but for me, it was just so-so. For my money, I would recommend 'Devine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood' for a more enjoyable read.

6305546789|5.0|One of the movies that cemented John Carpenter as a visionary director, the original, and still the best, Halloween is a landmark in horror.  We all know the storyline by now so I won't go into that, but what I will say is this is what a real horror movie is, able to be scary without blood and gore flying everywhere, its the atmosphere and Carpenter's patented creepy as hell musical score that makes this movie truly horrifying.  It was followed by six sequels, none of which can hold a candle to this original classic, and this movie also started the slasher movie craze of the 80's.  Extremely recommended if you want a real horror movie.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Session 9 is a wonderfully atmospheric horror film spiked with fantastic performances.<BR> While the plot is a simple variation on the haunted house tale, in this case a haunted asylum, the intense and disturbing mood of the piece makes all the difference.<BR>  By using Hazmat workers(those who know and work with decay and death) the director/writer offers us a refreshing look at things that go bump in the night and day.<BR>   The cast is superb , as is the lensing and screenplay. The only gripe one could have is with the sudden shift of events at the end, but we are more then rewarded with the final fade out.<BR>  In total, an engrossing chiller for those looking for an intelligent substitute to the nonsense of Scream and Blair Witch.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|An absolutely awful awful film.<br />Take an event in history, and corrupt it so almost nothing of the truth remains.<br />As a nation are we really so insecure we have to steal the history of other countries to bolster our own national pride and identity?!<br />In short, this film takes an event of amazing heroism done by the BRITISH during World War 2, and makes out it was done by AMERICANS.  Frankly I'm embarassed my nation feels it's necessary to go down this low.<br />What next?!  How the USA won the Battle of Britain?!  How America beat Napolean?!  How we were responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire?!<br />Anyone with the slightest sense of nation or even the remotest knowledge of history will feel the same.
B00005QATY|2.0|No the people who hate this movie are not stupid we just all do not like the same things.... O Brother Where art thou is an average film with a average soundtrack nothing too special. I was suprised with the rave reviews that this movie was getting I truly did not see the magic at all. My advice is this O brother stuff is not for everybody. If you like Old 1930's style america then O brother is probably is for you and good for you if you like it. The same is for the soundtrack I do not really care for the music but since I am 19 years old maybe that is only normal. O brother is O.K but not a memorable hit....
0930289528|5.0|Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta is exactly the kind of work that you think it really won't be. If you've never heard anything about V for vendetta, then you are really in for a ride. I had never heard of V (or Lloyd, for that matter) so this tale was really a suprise to me. If I had had more than a vague idea (from the introduction by Moore) of what this comic was about, than quite frankly this might not have been such a page turning thriller. Than again...maybe it would be. The thing about this book is, is that you really can't tell WHERE it's going, until it's already there. I know that i'm being vague, but i'm trying to avoid ranting about just how impressive that this comic becomes by the end. I say by the end, because like any film worth it's salt, it builds up, adding newer and harsher twists as time progresses. <BR>Before I forget, Dave Lloyd is a madman. From what Moore says in the afterword Lloyd came up with the basic premise of what V would be, both character and storytelling technique. On top of that, he's an impressive noir-style artist who really knows how to use both heavy blacks and open spaces to set the mood of each scene. It really is an almost cinematic read, and creates an atmosphere that I felt sitting in detention, in a crowded room in the middle of a bright day.<BR>Really, do yourself a favor,read this book and see exactly where Moore was BEFORE writing Watchmen.
0833575112|2.0|The Twits (a British pop culture term from the 50's) are really a disgustingly nasty couple who deserve each other.  When not playing gross and cruel practical jokes on each other--which escalate into unadulterated viciousness--they plot to catch our feathered friends for their weekly Bird Pie.  Complete with tiny birdie feet sticking out from the crust like so many skimpy crosses.  Ugh...<br /> Well, anyway, their caged monekys increasingly resent being tortured in their topsy-turvy world, so with the aid of an exotic bird from their native Africa, the simian family seeks freedom and jungle justice for these pitiful excuses for human beings.  The silly tale reads quickly--enhanced by the ridiculously skuzzy illustrations by Quentin Blake, who packs 75 sketches into 76 pages.  It's such a revolting burlesque that it's almost funny. Offering no social redemption or character development, THE TWITS is a light read down the road of literary lunacy--cute withall.
B000002JS0|4.0|Yes, you heard me correctly, Bon Scott plays the bagpipes on this album and you can't help but think what other things he could do! This is one of the greats of the AC/DC collection because it was their first. Great songs include: T.N.T., It's a Long Way to the Top, and Rock 'n' Roll Singer. Inside the cover are letters about each member of the band and they're very entertaining, if you can read the fine print. Great rocking album and if you are an avid AC/DC fanatic like me, for sure you should get this one!
B000003S2O|1.0|What a pity the impulse to review CDs stems from a personal drive to let others know how good we think things are - so very different from the political motives that forge the expression of ideas.  But, that's capitalism for you.  As for this CD, it isn't even half as good as those previous reviewers claim, but the record companies won't mind that a jot, now will they.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I'm A Slave 4 U is the first track, probably one of the most intruiging pieces of ear candy of the year, with no chorus, truly, and a very different approach to her music. It's fresh and new, written by the Neptunes, and guess what? Britney does all the vocals!<br />Overprotected is track two, and Dark Child gets to remix this for Britney as single #3...sounds like Crazy all over again, if you ask me, not that that is a bad thing. Dark Child is making sure Brit's hip hop community love isn't a fluke. The song is great, another Max Martin-Rami pop masterpiece.<br />Lonely is track three and all I can say is \\"WOW.\\" Britney's doing a rock esque piece, and she adds in that Dark Child, again, flavor to it. Britney helped write this, and two up and coming song writers, Josh and Brian...ummm, they've done stuff with Aaron Carter as well as Brit, and that means they can do good or bad songs *ahem* But this would top the charts as a single. Buy it for this if nothing else.<br />Next comes our girl-woman song that goes deeply into the manners and ups and downs of womanhood and it's transitions. NOT. Britney isn't too deep, but she can still manage to make another Max Martin song good.<br />Can you say Neptunes? Boys is a Slave esque track that's nothing more than a hip hop dance track...wait, slow down, did I say a hip hop dance track? There's something new.<br />Here comes the Kylie. Get ready to face the music. It's Anticipating. Britney tries to imitate the sucess of Kylie Minogue on a track she helped write, Anticipating. I think I've said enough.<br />I Love Rock N Roll, the Joan Jett cover as featured in Britney Spears' first major motion picture release coming February 15th from Paramount and MTV Pictures. Yeah. That's about it.<br />Cinderella, a Max Martin song...good tune...decent lyrics...Britney helped write this, one of the best songs on the album...Pretty good! It's not very deep though, like most of Brit's songs aren't.<br />Get ready to explode when BombasticLove's corny lyrics and Nelly Furtado (guess what) esque vocals (at least at the start of verse 2...) come at you! It could have been SUCH A GREAT SONG with the melody, but the lyrics aren't so hot! Bombastic Love, to put it bluntly is: A Good Song Gone Bad.<br />That's Where You Take Me...Aaah...La la la, another Kylie approach. However, she comes nowhere near the Can't Get You Out Of My Head greatness, or, that's one way to put it, right...anyway, this is probably one of the weakest tracks on the album, coming in with mixed reviews.<br />What It's Like To Be Me: Oh, not Justin! The pop-doers come at Britney with a song with a pathetic climax, good lyrics, and *guess what* a POP MELODY! (No, not NSYNC's \\"Pop\\" melody, sorry ladies...)<br />Guess I'll review the import tracks:<br />Before The Goodbye: Well, let's think for a minute. This is the BT track cut from the US album. Why? This is such a strong, hot dance track. Take out Anticipating, put in this.<br />I Run Away: A beautiful, beautiful ballad with pretty good vocals, excellent lyrics that fit the melody, written by two star song writers! Take out That's Where You Take Me, put in this.<br />When I Found You: Fair vocals, pretty good lyrics, what flavor bubblegum do you want? Don't change a thing on the album with this song.<br />There's my review of Britney Spears' new hit smash album arriving November 6 with the super smashes SLAVE 4 U which only made it to #27 on the charts and I'M NOT A GIRL which never charted THANK YOU FOR READING! I'm out!
B000002BPS|2.0|This record sounds as though The Offspring had just signed to a major and been given a one year deadline for their next album.  After celebrating for fifty weeks, they quickly rushed and wrote simple, generic songs for their mainstream debut.<br />The opening disclaimer is a cute little rant by Jello, who was obviously kept on a short leash because, for the first time since leaving DK, he isn't ultra annoying.  (For everyone who really likes this album, Jello Biafra was the lead singer of the Dead Kennedys.  He now is a has-been who tries to live off the existence of corporations by criticising them for creating jobs and improving quality of life).<br />I'm not going to waste time by describing each song because they all pretty much sound the same.  The best listen is the first spin of the record and after that, diminishing marginal utility kicks in, hardcore.  <br />The only song with any kind of longevity is All I Want.  Gone Away sounds as though they thought the major label would really appreciate a ... alternarock hit so they scripted this weak song.  <br />If you're used to listening to mainstream rock this album must sound pretty good.  If you're used to listening to punk rock, this is a poor effort, especially following Smash.  <br />For a better entry into punk, check out punkrockacademyfightsong by Down By Law or Boogadaboogadaboogada by Screeching Weasel.  <br />For the best punk, check out anything by Rancid, Pennywise, Operation Ivy, Minor Threat, Street Art Gallery by Bombshell Rocks, We're Not Laughing With You by Heckle, and Permanent Stains by Showcase Showdown.
B000003C2U|5.0|This cd is a masterpeice that melds technical songwriting with sheer brutality.  There is even some twisted melodies thrown in the mix.  One of the best things of this cd is the drumming by Sean Reinert of Cynic fame.  His double bass chops are truly amazing.  Reinert even manages to throw in some jazzy percussion. <BR>The dual guitar attack complete with harmonies is outstanding.  The riffs are all masterpieces.  Schuldiner's vocals are powerful without being too undecipherable.  Too bad this band is no longer  around due to Chuck passing away.  He will be missed.  R.I.P.
B00000J7SO|5.0|I'm a big Bob Dylan fan, liking even a lot of stuff that went nowhere with a lot of people.  As some say, even when he's bad, he's interesting, and I guess I fall into this category.  I remember getting this album in college, and I remember the original Rolling Stone review trashing it.  While it was obvious that it wasn't on a lot of peoples' &quot;10 best Dylan&quot; lists, I've just listened to it over and over throughout the years, continuing to love it.  By the way, I also listen to a lot of other stuff by him, and love that also.  <br />I guess one of the reasons why people don't like the album is the somewhat overproduced, too many instruments, to many backup singers complaints.  So what?  The Talking Heads overproduced every album, and they sounded great.  I've seen two major acts both solo and with bands:  Neil Young and Warren Zevon.  While one sits and appreciates the solo shows, one has a lot more fun when there's a rocking band behind them.  So bring on all the instruments you want.  <br />While people also don't like Bob Dylan's voice, I also like it because of it's uniqueness.  And he sings as passionately here as anywhere.  &quot;Is Your Love in Vain?&quot; is a good example.  But there's also the sublety of &quot;Senor'&quot;, where he's reserved for most of the song, but then spits out his feelings at exactly the right time.  <br />Of course a big reason to have it as a favorite is when your favorite Dylan song is on the album. In my case,  &quot;Where Are You Tonight?&quot;.  There are dozens and dozens of great Dylan songs.  He can be a great storyteller if you get through the cryptic lyrics.  While he takes you through the hellish nightmare of his search, he literally cries out in pain.  But take a step back, and you also see it's a love song.  <br />You have your favorites, I have mine.
B000002JST|5.0|AC/DC really kicks in this album. Bon Scott always performed in away Brian Johnson could come even close. LET THERE BE ROCK is raw, energetic and ferocious.<BR>Repair in the fact that AMAZON.COM scanned the wrong cover for this album. The cover here is from the lbum LET THERE BE ROCK: THE MOVIE - LIVE IN PARIS\\", which is part of the BONFIRE box set!!
B00005RJ1U|4.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this scary.  Most of the &quot;horror&quot; movies of the last 20 years or so have been the teen slasher films, which turned into the jokes of the scream series.  John Carpenter had the masterpiece in Halloween, but I would classify what he's done since as more science fiction.  And then there are the psycological thrillers, like &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;, which have their moments but hold back on the gore.<br />&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; has it all.  There is no holding back on the gore.  When the creature starts eating a victim's tongue, while still attached to the head, it doesn't get any better than that.  We get close-ups of victim's stiched-up bodies.  And the final scene would make Buffalo Bill proud.  <br />Where it excels, though, is atmosphere and tension.  I remember that the plot of &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; was not that great, but the setting of the house in that movie was as creepy as it got.  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; goes beyond this.  We see that something awful is probably at the monster's hangout.  We spend time debating whether to enter it's confines.  When we finally get to see it, the buildup pays off big-time.  It would be hard to design a scarier environment than what Justin Long falls into.<br />The only reason that I don't give it five stars is explained in the movie itself.  Most people, after seeing the setup, would high-tail it out as fast as possible, and let the authorities take over.  But our hero has to not only go back to the scene, but literally stick his nose into it.  His more logical sister tells him that this is the typical stupid thing that people do in horror movies, and she's right.  <br />But then, we wouldn't be treated with what follows.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I know you all think that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is just a [cheesy] Baz Lurman flick, but let me you- it is one of my favorite movies! It is told hauntingly and romantically. It features both great dance and musical sequences, and great, heart-wrenching performances by both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman as Christain and Satine, the Sparkling Diamond. A must for any DVD junkie.
B00000GAIW|5.0|While it was the next album, &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, that made them megastars, &quot;Aqualung&quot;, the fourth album by the band, established the Jethro Tull sound.  Not that the first three albums were bad, they weren't.  But the band would never have sold the amount of albums they did, nor fill the arenas they did with their old sound.  To some, this change may have been as sacreligous as Bob Dylan going from acoustic to electric, but who would have even remembered Jethro Tull if not for the change that started with this record?  <br />It still may still be their best, and as a big fan of their &quot;classic&quot; era, that's saying a lot. From the signature guitar riff that opens the title song, to the ending message of &quot;Wind Up&quot;, it's loaded with juicy stuff that I've never grown tired of.  OK, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; was played forever on FM radio, but that's because it was a great song. <br />It's loaded with other good stuff, both hard and soft.  &quot;Hymn 43&quot; shows him at his angriest.  But he also writes a tender love song with &quot;Wond'ring Aloud&quot;  &quot;Windup&quot; starts slow, really rocks, and then softly ends to get it's message out one more time. <br />Who knows what kind of message about religion Ian Anderson was trying to convey in those days?  It's probably changed over the years, but back then, it did ask some serious questions about how humans view God.  Chances are he was a young artist rebelling about everything, and religion is always a nice target.  My own interpretation is that there is a bit of God in everything, including bums like the title character.  And the phrase &quot;He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays&quot; speaks volumes.  <br />So those of you who want to hear music these days instead of watching it, buy this classic.  If you own it, dust it off and make contact with an old friend.
B00005QG9J|5.0|One thing I have noticed lately is that rock and alternative bands are becoming more mellow.  An example of this is Stone Temple Pilot's &quot;Shangri La-de-da&quot;.  Many people are angry because of bands changing.  People have got to realize that it's completely natural for a band to change.  As time goes by, the music they make becomes more mature.  It's just something different. &quot;Morning View&quot; is Incubus's change into a more mellow, mature stage.  It is an excellent change.  The experimentation with sounds in the last track is very creative and unique.  It's a different Incubus, yes, but give the music a chance before you judge them.
B00003CXXP|3.0|STEVEN SPIELBURG FOLLOWING UP ON AN ORIGINAL IDEA WHICH CAME FORTH FROM THE GENIOUS OF STANLEY KUBRICK, CREATED AI, A BIZZARE FAIRY TALE OF SORTS SET IN THE DISTANT AND NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE.  HALEY JOEL OSMENT PLAYS DAVID!  AN ARTIFICIAL BOY WHO HAS BEEN PROGRAMED TO LOVE AND FEEL PAIN LIKE A HUMAN CHILD, AND SOON REALIZES THAT HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN BETTER OFF HAD BE NOT BEEN PROGRAMED TO FEEL EMOTION.  MANY REVIEWERS FEEL THAT THE FUTURISTIC RE-TELLING OF PINOCHHIO HAS MABEY WENT JUST A LITTLE TO FAR.  WELL!  IT DOES AND IT DOSEN'T.  FIRST LETS BREAK THE FILM DOWN.  THE STORY IS ABSOLUTE GENIUS.  A LITTLE ROBOT BOY WHO WAS MADE TO FEEL EMOTION AND PAIN, FINDS THAT HOSTILE PEOPLE INCLUDEING HIS ADOPTING MOTHER AND FATHER FEEL MORE HATE THAN LOVE.  WHY WOULD HIS MOTHER AND FATHER BE HOSTILE?  WELL THEIR NATURAL SON RETURNS HOME FROM CRYO-SLEEP, AND SIMPLY PUT, THEIR NATURAL SON, DOSEN'T TAKE TO DAVID (OSMENT) AS THEY HAD HOPED.  SECOND HAVEN'T WE BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH \\"BLADE RUNNER\\".  ROBOTS WHO JUST WANT TO LIVE, AND LOVE!  ALSO, THE MOVIE LEAVES A FEELING OF UTTER DEPRESSION.  WHY?  I DON'T KNOW!  PERHAPS BECAUSE WE FEEL PITY AND SYMPOTHY FOR DAVID.  A ROBOT!  WHY?  MABEY BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT HE IS A ROBOT AND JUST AN INNOCENT IN A EVIL WORLD.  A INNOCENT WHO WANTS TO BE LOVED AND INTURN LOVE AS WELL.  THE CARACTERS THAT DAVID MEETS ARE TRUELY THE REAL STARS THOUGH.  JUDE LAW PLAYING A ROBOT WHO PLEASES THE LADIES.  WILLIAM HURT PLAYING THE CREATOR, \\"A THROUGH BACK TO MR.  GHEPPTO\\", AND TEDDY WHO IS \\"A THROUGH BACK TO JIMMNEY CRICKETS\\" THE REAL STAR.   BUT ALL THAT ASIDE, AS I MENTIONED THE FILM LEAVES THE VIEWER WITH A FEELING OF UTTER DEPRESSION.  AND I THINK IT INTENDS TO DO JUST THAT!  THE TRUE DESPERATION (WHICH TURNS TO AN OBSESSION) BY DAVID TO BECOME HUMAN IS, REALLY HEARTSINKING.  THE FILM WHICH IS SET IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND PROPELLS ITSELF TO THE FAR FUTURE TAKES US ON A JOURNEY THAT NO LIVING HUMAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO ENDURE.  AI FORCES US TO ENDURE A MECHA'S (SLANG FOR ROBOT) HELL'ISH JOURNEY WHICH SPANS OVER 2,000 YEARS.  PERSONIFIED BY A CHILD.  DISTURBING TO SAY THE LEAST.  WHAT MAY BE FAIRY TALE TO SOME IS NIGHTMAREISH TO OTHERS.  AND I FEEL THAT THE MOVIE WAS VERY NIGHTMAREISH TO SAY THE LEAST.  AND DEF. NOT FOR THE CHILDREN!  NOW LETS PROBE THE ENDING OF THE FILM (NOT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY).  MANY HAVE CRITIZIED THE ENDING, SAYING THE END OF AI RUINED THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  WHY?  THE ENDING DOSEN'T REALLY HAVE A SAD ENDING NOR DOES IT REALLY HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.  IT JUST HAS AN END.  AND I FEEL THE STANLEY KUBRICK AND SPIELBURG INTEDED TO DO JUST THAT BRING THE ENDING TO A FILM.  MABEY YOU COULD INTERPRET THE END IN OTHER WAYS BUT I FEEL THAT THE END IS JUST THAT.  THE END!!! AND MANY WHO WATCH THE FILM WILL UNDERSTAND WHY.  OVERALL 3 STARS, COULD HAVE GOTTEN 5 BUT AS I SAY ITS DO DEPRESSING AND LEAVES MEMORIES OF OSMENT WAITING FOR 2,000 YEARS TO BECOME HUMAN.  FAIRY TALES ACORDING TO AI COME TRUE, BUT DEAR LORD DO THEY....
B00004TBWR|5.0|In an era when artists will take two or three years (and more) before releasing an album of new material, it is nothing short of astonishing that Willy and the Poor Boys was CCR's third album released in 1969!  And more importantly, the songs are just as strong as on Bayou Country and Green River.<br />There were a couple of covers--both of them folk songs, Leadbelly's &quot;Cotton Fields&quot; and the traditional &quot;Midnight Special.&quot;  The rest were John Fogerty originals.  While the two folk-blues instrumentals (&quot;Poorboy Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Side O' the Road&quot;) are little more than enjoyable filler, the rest of the songs are all top notch, including the double A-side &quot;Down On the Corner&quot;/&quot;Fortunate Son.&quot;  The latter, a stinging attack on the disproportionate number of poor and working class serving combat duty in Vietnam, was chosen by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the all-time top 100 singles in 1988.  It was to be the only single released from the album, however, since &quot;Travelin' Band&quot; would be released as CCR's new single three months later from their soon-to-be-released Cosmos Factory album.  But I'm convinced that &quot;It Came Out of the Sky&quot; could have been a huge hit. [It's one of my favorite CCR tracks with its goofy UFO lyrics and razor-sharp guitar driving the song.]<br />CCR was one of those rare bands whose albums were every bit as good as their singles.  As such, both volumes of Chronicles are excellent choices for the casual listener, but true fans will want to have the albums, and this one is a classic.  ESSENTIAL
B000002LIR|3.0|Once upon a time, Rod Stewart rocked. Unfortunately as he got later into his career, especially in the late 1980s, he slipped into cheesy commercial pop-rock.  This storyteller box set definitely documents Rod's career arc.  Witness the rockin' songs in the early days of his career such as Every Picture Tells a Story and Mandolin Wind. Even into the early 80s he was still rockin' with Tonight I'm Yours and Young Turks. Then, suddenly by the middle of disc 4, the music Rod was making just flat out stinks...songs like Love Touch and Some Guys Have All the Luck are just 80s garbage.  It's too bad that sometime in the 80s Rod stopped being a &quot;bad boy&quot; rocker and just turned into another old fart making pop music to keep his career going. I did discover a few gems on here that I had never heard before from the early days with the Faces.
B00000K19E|2.0|I had heard so much about this movie, that it was so cool.  So I watched it.  I have rarely been so disapointed.  I will start with the good.  The sound and special effects are great.  The martial arts scenes are decent, but are used to replace the story.  The bad.  Can you say PLOT HOLES!  An example.  Neo and company are out to save the world and the imprisoned humans.  If this is true, then why does Mouse, when he is trapped, pull out 2 machine guns and start blasting away at deceived people, instead of giving up, and dieing as a martyr.  The same is true when Neo and Trinity storm the building.  Well, gee, we are out to save these people, so lets blow them all away with a variety of guns.  I am sorry, but that doesn't work for me.  These are supposed to be martial arts masters.  They could just knock the guys out, or disable them. Then there is the bad language.  Awful.  Way too much.  The agents.  These are computer programs, and sentient ones at that.  Then how, could they miss Neo, when he is hovering in a helicopter and they are standing still, but, as they fly away, Agent Smith blows wholes in the gas tank, or whatever it was, with pinpoint accuracy.  Afraid overall, the makers should have concentrated a little more on the plot, and less on the action.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This CD is a good example of why Pearl Jam is so great. Ten is a great CD, one of the best of the 90's, but if Pearl Jam didn't break away from the \\"Seattle Sound\\" and experiment with new sounds, they would get old and repetitive after a while. All of the greatest musical artists throughout history sound very different towards the end of their carears than at the beginning, Pearl Jam is no different. Listen to Yield, ... and then listen to Ten. Both are great albums, but both sound completely different. Yield sounds like more of an alternative release than grunge, but I think it's excellent. The reason Vitalogy is such a key album for Pearl Jam is because it's when they started sounding truley different. V.S. was not a refabricaiton of Ten in anyway, but I think that about half of it's songs could be put on Ten and make sense. Vitalogy is completely different. Also, up until Binaural, which is really not very good at all, Pearl Jam seems to get steadily more musically creative, experimental, and complex on each of their albums. If you play guitar, I think you'll find that Vitalogy's songs are much harder to play and use a greater variety of riffs and chords than V.S. and certainly Ten. I think that Vitalogy is probably the most important album for Pearl jam because it puts them on the next level. It shows that they can play all kinds of different sounds with their music, and do them well. Lyrically and Vocally this album is very good as well, with many dark, crackling vocals from Vedder, and very deep lyrics that really talk about important things. Also, I think Betterman and Nothingman are 2 of the greatest songs of Pearl Jam's, the 90's, or even ever. They are both so beautiful and melodic, that they are truely songs for the ages. If you're going to buy just one Pearl Jam album, I would not suggest this one. I would suggest V.S. as it gives you a good idea of what the band sounds like, and is an awsome album all the way through. However, I think if you're going toreally get into Pearl Jam like me, this is a definate must-have. I think Pearl Jam is arguabley the best band of the 90's that sounds like a 90's band (U2 is more of an 80's band, and Widespread Panic sounds like a 70's Classic Rock band...
B00000AFGM|5.0|While another of Manson's operatically themed albums, this album takes a step forward in that its full of great rock songs.  Its rare today that you get original sounding songs that tie back into rock history.  In a landscape full of knock-offs and boybands, this album shines.<br />If you're new to Marilyn Manson, go buy this album.  Go buy it now.  Your friends won't believe their ears.  Its full of emotion, lyrics, melodies.  At times it sounds just like David Bowie, but then at times Manson goes back and uses heavier guitars juxtaposed with soulful backup singers.  Much better than Holy Wood and different than American Family or AntiChrist.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie is terrible.  I hope that I can save one person from seeing this movie with this review.  The plot makes no sense.  The movie drags on forever.  Everytime you think the pain will end, it continues.  I do not want to give anything away, but the ending is one of the stupdiest endings of all time.  Please save yourself the money and skip this one.  E.T. and 2001 were never supposed to be morphed into one film.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is one of the rare cd's on which every track sounds really great. It will definitely keep you rocking. Buy this one.
B00005QK3W|2.0|First, I will say that I was impressed with the production quality.  The instrumentation is clear and powerful.  Beyond that, there is really nothing to recommend.  And who are these people who actually like this stuff?  Have they ever heard of The Beatles or listened to classic Paul albums like Band on the Run? How can anybody not hear the distinction between songs like Good Day Sunshine, I've Just Seen A Face, and Maybe I'm Amazed and the stuff on this album?  There is not a single memorable song to be heard.  Obviously, Paul is trying hard to be relevant.  At his age and in light of his past glories, what is he still trying to prove?  Also, what a pity that Paul doesn't use his natural and beautiful singing voice anymore.  Instead, we get a ridiculously contrived pseudo-rock yelp on every song. Paul should listen to &quot;Revolver&quot; for inspiration or maybe consider retirement.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Not too many folks would think that Sade has a commanding presence in concert, but this pretty good live disc shows that she can hold her own in front of the mike.  The track listing is rather similar to the show I attended in Chicago last year, and the bulk of the songs are from her last CD, &quot;Lover's Rock.&quot;  The most compelling of these songs is her rendition of &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart,&quot; in which she warns a new partner not to mistreat her the way her prior lovers did.  Of course, there are also the requisite singles: &quot;Smooth Operator,&quot; &quot;Your Love is King,&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Taboo.&quot;  Live discs don't always appeal to me, but &quot;Lovers Live&quot; is a solid release that comes with my recommendation.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I watched this movie expecting disappointment.  I had read the marginal reviews and, coupled with a fact that this was a movie that paralleled Pinnochio, was really expecting something very hoaky that was geared for mass market appeal.  In addition, I am skeptical of any movie with a child actor lead ... which all to frequently translates into a precocious kid being given adult lines with the idea being that the audience will find it cute.  I was wrong on all accounts.  This is an amazing movie.  I was mesmerized by it.  Those that speak negatively of this film are doing it a severe disservice.  I can say that it is not a movie for everyone, and that I understand why many people would not be captiveatd by it.  But more importantly, I can say that many will decide that this is one of their all time favorite pictures.  To unilaterally label it as a marginal movie is totally inappropriate.  It was excellent.  On this one, you have to view it and make your own call.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's game is as much psychological and political as it is a science fiction novel.  It is a gripping story with memorable, if somewhat fantastic characters; despite their superhuman brilliance, their struggles are easy to identify with.  This is a book I have read over and over again, and enjoyed each time.
B00005UEAR|5.0|...<BR>This album is one of the best so for, considering that M2:SFAM was one of the best albums ever.  The second disc was great; the overture was authentic to the writing skills of this group...
630438551X|4.0|It would be a lot easier to understand if you read the play in it's original text first. <br />The Bad-There are times when the actors seem to have troubles with their lines. Which, is understandable because the scene is modern day Verona with Shakesperean launguage. The Capulet Boys were odd (Tybalt and crew). They were mexican or something...I have nothing against mexicans, but why were they in Verona? I honestly didn't see too many horrible faults in this movie though. <br />The Good-Where do I start? The swords updated to guns was a nice touch (example-Rapier 8mm). The ending was a little different from the book. Generally, it was the same, there was only a slight difference. But I liked this ending a lot more. Leonardo DiCaprio was spectacular throughout the film. Mercuitio was also amazing. But the one change I thought was both bizarre and cool, was when Romeo took the ecstacy from Mercuitio and semi-freaked ar the Capulet party. <br />The Ugly-The Capulet boys clothes. What the hell was that?<br />But overall a great movie with a great soundtrack.
B000021YQV|4.0|After listening to their first heavily Nu-metal laced album, I wasn't exactly blown away as I can only take the whole \\"distorted growl into the mic\\" thing for so long. However, when I finally got around to getting this album, the first thing I noticed how different it was. Within a few short listens, I soon realized that this album was absolutely brilliant. It doesn't take long for it to grow on you either (as did Tool's last release ;o). The production is suberb (Rick Rueben is a class-act producer) and from a musicians standpoint, its obvious the band has matured musically with more emphasis on melody and complex structures and counterpoint. While the lead singer's (Serj) lyrics are a bit absurd at times and don't exactly hit the nail on the head, his amazing voice more than makes up for the fact. One of the reasons the he sounds so unique is his genius use of micro-tones in his vocals. As most of us know, this band has an Middle-eastern influence being from Lebanon and/or Armenia. One of the coolest thing about Middle-Eastern music is that they use the \\"note between the note\\" in their musical scale. While Western music uses only 12 notes in an octave (the range before the note \\"repeats itself\\"), Middle Eastern music uses 24 (at least). Having twice as many possibilites, opens up the musical spectrum in a way that simply has not been done with music of this genre. It breathes a great amount of fresh air into an otherwise rather mundane and passe metal scene. Very few albums get my 5 star rating (not even Tool's amazing last effort) so I have to go with the 4 star. However, if Amazon had a 4.5 star option, this is what I would give this excellent CD.
0553106635|1.0|My favorite aspect of Ice and Fire is the complexity of its characters.  You are allowed to see the humanity of the most dastardly villan, while at the same time, even the most virtuous of characters have elements which, at best could be called weaknesses.  <BR>While there is a solid core of the supernateral within the series, obvious in the opening, do not look for it within the first book, it is a captivating political story of a disintegrating kingdom with some of the best battle scenes in literature.<BR>I am EAGERLY awaiting the continuation.  I will enjoy the first three again, before reading the forth.  My only question is why the hard cover version of the first book was pulled by the publisher.
B00003CWNR|5.0|I suppose since I am pro-choice all the stuff on abortion in this movie really does not bother me at all.  This movie is definitely not for pro-lifers.  I agree with some of the other reviewers, Hollywood definitely has a political agenda that it puts forth in its movies, but I really don't see how that detracts from the movies all that much because I really liked this film very much.  I really like Tobey Maguire; I think he is a very good actor and his character, Homer Wells, is a very likeable young man that we want to see succeed in life as more than an apple picker, which makes the ending very satisfying for me in some regards.  The best part of the movie is definitely the beginning, which takes place in the orphanage, but I do think that it was really important for Homer to leave the orphanage and experience more of life.  The ending of the movie is bittersweet and kind of unrealistic, but this does not detract from the overall quality of this film.  Lasse Hallstrom is a wonderful director and I am a devoted fan of his movies.   Personally, I liked the movie because it raised some issues and made some arguments that pro-lifer's needed to hear.  Obviously, Hollywood's political agenda is going to make people mad when it disagrees with their political agenda.
0451191153|5.0|I recently read this book, having picked it up at a friend's house, reading a page, and heading straight to the store to buy a copy.  An excellent book, introducing a truly unique, empowering philosophy.  Whether you agree or disagree with Ayn Rand's objectivism, I believe this book makes a point about the importance of self-reliance.
B00005UEAR|5.0|In 1989 I was in Brazil and it was there that I've got DT's first album, &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;. Back in US, I've been buying all DT albuns for years now. <br />If you have been listening to their releases since then, you understand that those guys are completely above all bands out there today, maybe sharing the first place with RUSH. I use Rush as an example because like them, Dream Theater keeps renovating itself over the years and always trying new things. They're very careful and smart at keeping their roots and their fans as well. <br />Here you have a band that doesn't follow trends, but SETS trends. When Judas Priest tried the American market back in the 80's they had to wear stupid outfits and perm their hair. <br />Dream Theater uses the listener ears and brains to send the message so it only gathers the smartest listeneres. If you think you're smart, stop wasting your time and get the album. Soon you won't stand listening to the radio anymore - you'll become musically educated. <br />P.S.: Hey drummers, lots of Terry Bozzio influence on this one.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Finally, a real rolemodel steps to the plate. In the disturbed, unfeeling world of New York, 1987, a world not too unlike our own, a hero rises up to show the way to true hilarity and non stop comedy, American Pyscho Patrick Bateman! Marvel as Christian Bale's portrayal of this wall street yuppie gone mad attempts to feed a cat to an ATM machine. Witness the glory as our protagonist films his own brand of adult entertainment. See the triumph as Bateman runs naked through apartment after apartment wielding his trusted chainsaw. Yes, all this and he even eats their brains...and cooks just a little.But really, this satire on america's &quot;upper class&quot; is an engaging commentary on the absurdness of not only Bateman's behavior, but how the world he lives in helps create it. Its depiction of violence is actually quite tasteful, and dramatically more reserved than the book. Fascinating and fantastic, this horror/satire really delivers. And as Christian Bale admits on his DVD version exclusive interview, don't be ashamed the laugh!
6302824613|5.0|purrs Miss Goodthighs, played by Jacky (yeah, it's her)Bisset as she tries to drug inept aspiring spy Evelyn Tremble (aka James Bond) Peter Sellers in this wacky spy spoof from the 1960s.<br />You know, I TRIED to watch \\"Austin Powers\\", but in no way is it as good as \\"Casino Royale\\" can be in some places. I have to say, \\"some places\\", because much though I love this movie, I know it drags here and there or gets a bit too corny, but even that can't make me mark it lower than 5 stars. <br />Basically, it's a who's who of Hollywood in the 1960s, all jammed into the mystery of who is killing off all of M's secret agents, and why? Thus John Houston (M) must journey along with Charles Boyer, William Holden, and Kurt Kaznar to visit \\"the original James Bond\\" David Niven, now in retirement playing Debussy and tending a black rose. He literally has to be blasted out of his complacence, bringing the remains of M--his toupee--to the ancestral home in Scotland. Ah, but the evil agents of SMERCH have already infiltrated the castle and replaced whoever with Deborah Kerr and a bevy of French-speaking Scottish babes, all out to be-smirch Bond's clean image of himself, i.e., sleep with him! But he proves too much even for their nefarious scheme. In fact, Sir James is too much for just about anyone trying to overpower him, which is part of the great joke. Joining along at various junctures are Joanna Petit, Orson Welles, Ursula Andress, Woody Allen, and the aforementioned Peter Sellers. And the venues! An East German school for spies shot in abstract expressionist style, a Mata Hari dance knockoff in India, a circular revolving bed supporting Ursula Andress and Peter Sellers' romp, a baccharat table complete with Orson Welles doing cheap magic tricks, and the groovy spy chambers below Casino Royale itself (check out that fingerprinted rotating room). It's not supposed to make sense, really, and that's okay with me. And that score by Burt Bacharach, with \\"The Look of Love\\" and Herb Alpert trumpetting away is a real winner. One question we've never been able to answer at home: Who on earth is singing the title song? A masterpiece of adenoidal camp, here remembered in fragments: \\"Hey look at Double 0 7, he's got a redhead in his arms.... Look who's here JAAAMES BOOOND! We've got him on the run, with guns and knives, We're fighting for our lives, at Casino Royale.... Have no fear, Bond is here, He's going to save the world, at Casino Royale. \\" Yep, pure poetry. Who can really explain a joke and do it justice? You're just going to have to trust me on this one. \\"Casino Royale\\" wins hands down.
B00005QDW1|5.0|When No Doubt first came out I was not too impressed...but then I bought Return of Saturn and was blown away!  Really hard heavy rock, yet very catchy!  This album is more funky then their last one, and they do it well.  The songs are catchy with great beats and lyrics, Gwen and the boys did a great job!  Head bobbin, dancing, singing along, backround music, blaring out of your car windows...this album can do all that and more!
B00005QB42|3.0|This CD is delicate and pleasing.  The instrumentation is light.  Deva Premal's voice is pure, fluid, and joyful, though not as &quot;passionate&quot; as the cover art might suggest.<br />Track 6 is a standout.  It is mostly instrumental, with a light, jazzy texture, and for Deva it is evocative of a rainforest retreat she and her partner attended.  It is one of the sunniest pieces of music I've heard in a long time; just try not smiling while you're listening to it.  Track 7 is also delightful, a lovely African folk song celebrating the mother of all Goddesses.  Track 7 highlights the positive feminine energy which Deva projects throughout the CD.<br />For me, this CD has an eclectic, New Age flavor, the kind of CD Enya might record if she were a Brazilian living in Denmark.  Even though some of the lyrics are sacred chants, the music does not seem to be deeply rooted in the yogic traditions -- in contrast, say, to the music of Krishna Das and Jai Uttal.  (I mention those two artists in many reviews; I'm sorry if that's tedious to anyone!)  I was a little disappointed by what I perceived to be a lack of spiritual passion, but nevertheless, this CD is definitely pleasant music which will lower your blood pressure and put a smile on your face.
B000002VEP|4.0|I recently ordered this CD and must say that overall, I am pleased with it. This album is one of the last to ever have the Wolfson touch - a magic touch that Alan Parsons needs in my opinion. Later albums, while they don't stink, do suffer greatly from the Wolfson departure.<br />My particular favorites on this album are \\"Standing On Higher Ground\\" which I interperet as an examination of honesty via self-imposed ignorance. There is a moral question here that the listener is left to puzzle on.<br />La Sagrada Familia is exactly what you would expect from the Alan Parsons touch. It is a \\"tightly produced\\" tune with mild voice-overs in places and a slow introduction... quite reminiscent of both Parsons prior work and indeed a foreshadowing of Time Machine which he will produce later.<br />Money Talks is probably where this album stubs its toe. Its a brash sounding tune that is really not fit to be in the album.<br />The album feels a bit short. 38 minutes and 52 seconds worth of music leaves the listener feeling a bit unfulfilled... but all in all for Project fans this is a worthy album.<br />Charles<BR>
1563890119|5.0|Neil Gaiman's Sandman series is clearly one of the outstanding works of literature in English in the 20th century.  The range of topics and concerns and motifs he covers throughout the series is astounding, yet he links his stories together with the mysterious, moody, proud, Byronic, ultra-responsible, and self-absorbed figure of Dream, aka Lord Morpheus, the Lord of the Dreamworld.  Gaiman effortlessly rewrites mythology, inserting his Immortal characters ingeniously into a variety of myths, particularly the story of Orpheus.  His topics range from the helplessness of captivity to the guilt of performing a necessary act of mercy, to the sibling rivalry of a set of seven Immortal siblings, to cycles of renewal and change, and the desirability or undesirablity of immortality.<br />Gaiman's characters are simultaneously larger-than-life represenations of such ideas as Death and Desire *and* quarrelsome cantankerous eccentrics who as siblings often don't get along.  His supreme achievement besides Dream, is Dream's sister Death, and the story \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" is a true tour de force.<br />Gaiman's most thoughtful and moving subplot, IMO, involves Shakespeare and the price he has paid for his creative power.  The dialog between Dream and Shakespeare in \\"The Wake\\" is one of the most stunningly insightful examinations of the dilemma of being an artist.  Dream reminds us \\"Things need not have happened to be true.  Tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot.\\"  Amen.  Ultimately that's what the Sandman series is about.
6303471714|5.0|...  I got this tape shortly after it came out.  Granted, when I first started using it, I was an active sixteen-year-old, so I wasn't as affected by possible injuries.  But I took a long time off from this tape, and just started working out again about three weeks ago.<BR>Using this tape in conjunction with Cindy's two other tapes, I have already seen results- even though I'm nursing, and I can't cut back on calories as much as I'll be able to when my daughter is over a year old.  I've lost 5 pounds so far, and my energy levels are amazing.<BR>Yes, some of the moves go a little too quickly for some people.  This is not meant for people who don't already know the correct postures to take when exercising, and who need reminders when working out.  But the intro pretty much states that- that this is a workout meant for healthy people.  <BR>Although I took off nearly ten years from using this tape, I got back into the tape very easily.  I do all the reps that she does, but it's not necessary.  If you prefer to go slower, you can- Cindy even states throught the video that you should only do what you feel comfortable doing.<BR>There are two great perks to this video, the first being that there are three different workouts.  The first two each last about 40 minutes, and they focus on lots of lunges and kicks, along with reps with barbells, followed by ab work and stretching.  They are good to use every other day... The third workout is a 10 minute mini-workout, great for when you feel the need to exercise, but don't have the time to do a full workout.<BR>The other perk is that, although Cindy is a supermodel, she voices some of the same disgruntlement with working out that most of us do at home:  she frequently admits that the reps coming up are hard, but that they are effective.  It's more like having a friend in the room than a cheerleader.<BR>Perhaps if you are prone to joint problems, you may want to pass up this video, or rent it to see how well it works for you before you buy it...
0783226063|4.0|When Alejandro Jodorowsy lost the rights to the film version of DUNE to Dino DeLaurentis he was understandably dissapointed. He was equally delighted when he saw the released motion picture, declaring it a terrible movie.<br />After ERASREHEAD, it was Mel Brooks who approacehd Lynch to direct ELEPHANT MAN, which Brooks produced. After the Oscar garnering sucess of ELEPHANT MAN, Dino D. made a deal of sorts with Lynch: \\"Give me DUNE and I'll let you direct your own film with minimal interference.\\" That film turned out to be BLUE VELVET. And with that, the body of work generally associated with Lynch began.<br />That said, don't ignore the incredible qualities this film has: The original inspired and creative set design. The amount of props, items, equipment, weaponry and sundry paraphenalia that you've never seen before, invented for this movie. Don't ignore the incredible atmosphere, the unique and disturbing performances, and the amazing sound design, (doubly interesting because sound is a major part of the plot.) Don't ignore how different this vision is against those of Spielberg, Lucas and Ridley Scott. This is a film of incredible vision and genius. It would be a shame if you all missed that
6302293553|5.0|A number of film critics have been rendered red-faced by this movie, practically forced into issuing revisionist statements to their reviews published at the time of the film's release.  Whether the change of heart is due to improved understanding of the text or to the pressures of popular canonization, this Holy Grail has proven one of the most commonly shared quests of followers separated by as much as 3 generations.  Film teachers are often disappointed to discover that young viewers no longer respond with interest let alone animation to Chaplin and Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and W. C. Fields.  The reasons are often attributed to the desensiticizing effects of fast-food modern culture, or to the postmodern amnesia that insures satire can not possibly work with an audience unfamiliar with the original objects of satire.  All interesting, if not compelling, theories--until you come to this film.  For a singular 90 minutes, the generations unite, erasing the boundaries of high and low culture, the informed and the uninformed, the old and the young.  There aren't many such grails left.  Long may this one continue to reside in viewers' consciousness, inspiring us to our individual and collective pursuits.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Snatch is a hip comedy/heist movie that, while lacking any \\"serious\\" themes, is simply irresistable. Guy Ritchie [brings] the viewer in with his edgy camerawork and disjointed storyline. All of the performers are excellent, and their thoroughly memorable characters really come to life. Even the \\"evil\\" thug boss Brick Top is a likeable character.<br />It is an excellently crafted movie, and the sheer force and energy this movie conveys more than compensates for its lack of substance. Its the perfect movie for the intellectual who, jaded from seeing Requiem For A Dream, needs a light-hearted pick-me-up that doesn't insult your intelligence.
B00004T9UF|5.0|After smashing onto the hip-hop scene with The Slim Shady LP, Eminem disappeared for  a while. When he returned, he shocked and outraged parents, gay and lesbian rights organizations, and even a few domestic abuse organizations. Well, what did we expect? This is the same guy who has written two songs about killing his wife! In all seriousness, his music is only about what he observes. While I personally don't agree with most of what he preaches  on here, musically it's one of the strongest rap albums in years. Lyrically it's a triumph. <br />When \\"Real Slim Shady\\" was playing, I remember hearing so many people saying the Eminem controversy would soon be over. Then he released \\"The Way I Am,\\" expressing his distaste for obsessive fans and controlling labels. That one convinced me to try the CD. And I'm very glad I did! <br />His next single, \\"Stan,\\" a dance influenced, heavy rap dealing with obsessive fans-again- with not-so-veiled references to songs on his debut disc. That was one that made everyone admit that Eminem is pure genius, regardless of the up in arms parents.<br />And for those who feel that all the hate in rap is for negative reasons only are sadly mistaken. By listening to the anger and pain of a song, you're more capable of making decisions. Even on tracks that might shock some, such as \\"Drug Ballad\\" or \\"Kill You,\\" I will stress that he continually reminds his listeners that it's just music. <br />Where you stand on the Eminem debate is your choice alone. Just don't pass judgement before giving him a chance.
B00005JKL8|5.0|This movie rocked! The whole disinchanted Navy Pilot, gets a lesson in the value of being, an American , and a member of the Armed Forces works well.  Owen Wilson's character grows up fast, and in war-torn Bosnia he has no choice.  Gene Hackman turns in another fine performance, as Wilson's CO.  The part where he starts talking to Wilson over the radio to get his pilot to calm down, and collect himself works well.  Being in the military I wouldn't have moved during the daytime, and if I could help it would have tried to avoid that booby trapped area.  Look past that stuff, sit back, and take a military action adventure ride Hollywood Style!
B000002U82|5.0|to Amazon.com and buy this cd if you don't already own it.  Pink Floyd is the most underrated band in the history of rock.  One word that is always used when referring to Pink Floyd is genius.  Can you name another band that is decribed using that term?  DSOTM is an incredible album, one of Floyd's best.  I've noticed that there are 3 kinds of people; 1.People that know and love Pink Floyd music 2. People who pretend to like PF.  They say things like \\"Pink Floyd, yeh, he's good.\\" and lastly 3. People who hate PF because they never gave it a chance.  These people usually like dance music and bands such as Backstreet boys, NSYNC etc..  These are you casual music fans.  People that appreciate music, people who get goose bumps from certain songs, those are your hardcore PF fans.  And that is good enough for me.
B000002J3W|5.0|I WAS NEVER A HUGE FAN OF EIGHTIES METAL BUT MY BROTHER HEARD THIS ALBUM SHORTLY AFTER IT CAME OUT AND TOLD ME I WOULD LOVE IT. I GAVE IT A QUICK LISTEN AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT METAL ALBUM.IT HAS EVERYTHING THAT I LOVED ABOUT HARD ROCK MUSIC FROM DAY ONE, GREAT RIFFS, GREAT LYRICS, AND GOOD SONGS! AFTER A YEAR OR SO I HEARD THAT THIS ALBUM DIDN'T SELL VERY WELL AND I CAME TO A CONCLUSION, ROCK MUSIC IS DEAD!!! STILL I LISTENED TO SUBHUMAN RACE AND TO THIS DAY I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE ANGRIEST MOST AGRESSIVE ALBUMS EVER RELEASED! I SAW SKID ROW WITH A DIFFERENT SINGER LAST YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T PLAY ANYTHING OFF THIS ALBUM WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT EITHER THEY DON'T LIKE SUBHUMAN RACE OR THE NEW SINGER CAN'T CUT IT ON THESE SONGS.....WHATEVER THE CASE, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS ALBUM...BUY IT!

While taking a vacation at home, the couple drowns in a mishap car accident. When their home is taken over by boisterous city-folk, they turn in several directions for help  in haunting the Deets family. One such prospective poltergeist is Beetlejuice- brilliantly played by Michael Keaton. <br />Featuring a star-studded cast including a young Winona Ryder, Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and of course Keaton, the storyline boasts creative, believable characters simply not seen in movies these days. <br />Everything in the storyline is clever, from props to costumes right down the score. One of my absolute favorite films!

B0000024R8|5.0|I really like the sparseness of just him and an acoustic guitar.  Most of the songs are fast and more like country blues than the protest folk songs he would later write.  I cant believe the gravely voice on FIXIN' TO DIE and IN MY TIME OF DYING come from the baby faced kid on the front.  He sounds like some 60 year old black man from the Mississippi Delta.  Great powerfull music!
0201485672|4.0|Refactoring is so important and many companies don't put enough emphasis on refactoring.  This book provides a great introduction to what refactoring is and a great reference for how to refactor.  The first few chapters are crucial for every computer programmer and project manager to read.  These first chapters will clearly explain how and why you need to be refactoring.  The later chapters go through various refactoring patterns.  These later chapters will be very useful to programmers with less OO programming experience but may be less useful to many programmers.  Regardless, the book is well worth it even if you only read the first few chapters.

Through her hap-hazard adventures, she teaches us what &quot;titchies&quot; and &quot;witchies&quot; are (drinks and sandwiches, respectively), how to deal with banks (skip town, of course), and even how to snag two of the richest men in the country. <br />Despite her early-life crisis, Rebecca grows from the pitiful and confused &quot;shopaholic&quot; into a very savvy business woman. (Even if she can't speak Finnish.) It's a favorite of mine, I think you might enjoy it, too!
B000001F7R|5.0|As with many rock bands, this first release from Def Leppard stands the test of time.  One comment I always hear after Def Leppard concerts is, \\"I wish they would have played something from 'On Through the Night'... Although they have certainly done some incredible things since this very early album, this represents them at their youthful, primal best, stripped free of the heavy production that glosses their later releases.  And the songs ROCK.
B0000214F0|5.0|I know this may sound strange...but this is one of the funniest films ever made.First of all Peter O Toole does a William Shatner imitation throwing his voice at the end of each line to show emotion. John Gielgud makes an appearance and seeing perhaps the early rushes of the film commits suicide within 5 minutes.And Malcolm Mcdowell does everything, incest, rape of men and women, getting jiggy with a horse, fornicating with a corpse... I mean he does Everything.And as if that wasnt enough, you have cut scenes(thats what they are like ) of sexual acts with absolutely no relation to the main story(dont worry there isnt one).All in all this is one unique film...it seems like a spoof of all Roman films ever made.<br />No wonder Macdowell from Clockwork Orange had his waterloo in this film...he overacts,hams and haws. And everyone seems to be hamming for all he/she is worth.Punctuated with hot sex scenes here and there....<br />It got 4 stars for the sheer ridiculousness. 1 star is for the DVD extra of the producer..an Italian slick Jim with chest hair showing and half a dozen chains explaining how this was high art.......the sheer pretentiousness of this pimpy guy was tooo much...
0425170349|5.0|A review by Brian <BR>This book is about the fictional story of international terrorism, by Tom Clancy. This book is about the quiet CIA legend, John Terrence, Kelly, or otherwise known as the famous Mr. Clark, who founded Rainbow, an elite group of counter-terrorist specialists selected from the best organizations from around the world, and put into one unit serving as a secret Counter-Terrorist unit. The team undergoes many vigorous missions, including an Amusement Park takeover, and massive scheme involving a nerve gas agent distributed during the Sydney Olympic Summer Games, resulting in the death of over half the population on the planet...<br /> The plot of this story is amazing, and is far-stretched, and this book is has so many characters, and tells about this character from his or her point of view. In the beginning of the book, it starts off with a bang of excitement and an adrenaline rush-but then settles down in the middle of the book, but is very interesting anyway, of the different things happening, that will soon all come together in the very end of the book, where all the character's situations will wrap up in one huge explosion, it seems the end of all books by Tom Clancy are very exciting. Tom Clancy seems to tell this story rather fast paced, moving from character to character, which all speeds up in the very end of the book. Personally, I didn't want the book  to end, and would have liked it if the book was a little bit longer. It was somewhere around 800 pages long, but I went through it real fast. I was very surprised when and how the story ended, and was surprised that John Brightling didn't go to court or had a trial. I somewhat liked the way the story ended, it was creative, and a little funny, when John Clark left Mr. Brightling and his men in the jungle, alone. Overall,  I think it is a good story that is well put together and well thought out.
B00004RHZU|5.0|No one has made an R&B debut that has impressed me half as much as Pink. Here's why:<br />1. Split Personality- \\"You don't know me well enough to label me sick, or even disturbed..\\" What a way to start an album! It surprises with it's quirky beat, fresh two-sided thoughts from Pink's spilt personality. \\"Everybody's got his ennities, I got a split personality.\\" #1 potenetial, shocking look at life. <br />2. Hell Wit' Ya- \\"Yeah, I remember that time we went to Pizza Hut, you told me she was your cousin.\\" Talks about a lousy player who doesn't know how to treat the girl who cares about him (Pink)  For anyone and everyone who's been in a bad relationship. <br />3. Most Girls- Her terrific #1 song. Most girls may want moolah, but Pink just wants real love. If you haven't heard it, you have to. Also check out her singles for \\"Most Girls,\\" they include some really great mixes. <br />4. There You Go- The song that started it all for this beautiful new diva. A #1 better than any Britney song you've ever heard. Also check out the single for this one. Dare you not to sing along! <br />5. You Make Me Sick- Pink's latest #1. I mean, how hot is this song? \\"You make me sick, I want you and I'm hatin' it!\\" \\"You got me goin' again, baby you got me goin' again.\\" A little hard to understand at first. I think you'll love it once you give it a try. Hate to be repetative, but check out this single, too. REALLY awesome mixes. *****<br />6.Let Me Let You Know- This is some REAL R&B stuff here. Not a personal favorite, but a good song to unwind with.  <br />7. Love is such a Crazy Thing- The classical piano intro, the sultry guitar, the funky strings and drums. Oh, what a song! Pink confesses her love in this one, a break from the girl power theme, \\"Is this love for real?\\" Very nicely suited to her range. <br />8. Private Show- This is my favorite song of the album, and just listen to it once to see why. \\"See I don't wanna meet on a lonely street, where the talk is cheap and the price is sweet..... And you don't wanna see the other side of me so I'm gonna hit you off and I'ma set you free before you fall too deep.\\" What more is there to say? <br />9. Can't Take Me Home- Okay, a lot of the \\"F Word\\" in here, but it's understandable. As I've pointed out, the fact that this is the song the album is named after says a lot about Pink's personality. Or at least one of them. This one can take a while to grow on you. <br />10.Stop Falling- Who can resist the vocals in this? Pink's sexy, scartchy voice, and her sad tone and sad story her song tells will move you. I think the climax where she shows off her range is wonderful! <br />11.Do What U Do- Hey, whatever you're comfortable doing, do it! Directed to anyone and everyone. However you are, be comfortable with it. Great message, the tune could use a little work. ****<br />12. Hiccup- \\"Why every time I try to tell you how I feel, it's like a hiccup-cup-cup it just won't come come.\\" Such a different song from anything else out there. \\"Pink don't think before she speak, but you got me feelin' feelin' feelin' kinda weak\\" ****<br />13.Is It Love-  Oh, my! Pink is in love- she thinks, but she's not sure what's up with her man. One of my favorite songs, from this album or any other! *****
0812548094|4.0|Terry Goodkind, Stone of Tears (Tor, 1995)<br /><br />Terry Goodkind continues his Sword of Truth series for another thousand pages, writing a book as good, if not better, than Wizard's First Rule. The adventures of Richard, Kahlan, and co. continue.<br /><br />The events that concluded the first book (not recounted here because they're plot spoilers) were supposed to bring peace to the world, right? Right--but peace is the last thing on anyone's mind as book two opens, a few minutes after the close of book one. (Nice touch, that.) Richard may have figured out how to use the Wizard's First Rule to his own advantage, but in doing so he violated the Wizard's Second Rule, about which there is much talk without anyone really saying what it is. (By the time anyone gets around to teaching it to Richard, you'll probably have figured it out on your own from the varying contexts; it's a reworded clich&eacute;.) By now, everyone but Richard is well aware that Richard has the gift. He is a wizard, albeit an untrained one. Richard's refusal to believe that he has the gift gets him into enough troubles, but now he's confronted with others who know he has the gift. Some of them are less than happy about it. And so a whole new set of problems opens up.<br /><br />Despite some of the more soap operalike aspects that are unavoidable in any multi-thousand-page fantasy epic, Goodkind keeps the string-the-reader-along stuff to a minimum, uses more subtle cliffhangers than he did in the last book, and once again keeps the reader's attention well in hand. The last three hundred pages of this book, for me, demanded to be read in one sitting. (As to a previous reviewer complaining about all the sex in this book, I wonder if s/he and I were reading the same novel. Perhaps we have different definitions of \\"sex.\\") The last few pages of this one have one truly contrived moment, but somehow Goodkind pulls it off without too much cheesiness.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about the book is that I was planning on leaving the series for a few days while I finished some other books. And yet, after I closed the back cover on this one, I was reading Blood of the Fold within ten minutes. Goodkind has created a worthy successor to book one here. ****½was planning on leaving the series for a few days while I finished some other books.

B000002V1D|5.0|&quot;Ordinary World,&quot; &quot;Come Undone,&quot; and &quot;Too Much Information&quot; are worth the price of this CD alone!  These three songs are some of the best work Duran Duran has ever done.  I love how they chose to strike back at the media with &quot;Too Much Information.&quot;  It's so relevant today, what with the pop acts that are struggling to combat the constant focus on their images.  You can't really compare Duran Duran to a group like the Backstreet Boys.  BSB has played instruments in concert before, and has plans to continue doing so, but they've always been more concerned with showcasing their vocals.  Duran Duran has just always wanted to rock, and they definitely do on this record.
0804106304|5.0|A review by Caleb<br />This powerful story is about a club started in China many years ago during the Sino - Japanese War. It was formed by a group of four women who came together in a time of need, when people and families were being torn apart. The book follows sixteen stories of themselves, their daughters and future generations all molded together. The club was like a social event were they would play games, socialize or just eat; anything to bring hope and joy. The book jumps from one woman to the next, detailing very intricately the amazing stories on each Chinese woman and Chinese American women. This book deals with controversies about how the Native Chinese mothers want to raise the daughters in the Chinese customs and cultures. The only problem is the daughters were born American and they are stuck in the ways of the American culture. This story has many stories filled with drama and adventure that take place in past China to present day America.<br />The thing I really enjoyed about this work of art was the great amount of detail Amy Tan designed in my mind. The form of sentences and types of vocabulary she used was amazing. It's like Amy Tan created a blanket full of detail and wonder. Each story is woven into the next, a panorama of distinctive voices that all have a similar goal. There were a lot of different stories, and sometimes I was confused with all of the different names, but it wasn't to bad. This book really shows the constant struggles of cultures dying in America, the sadness of a mother not returning, the hope in friends and the love of family.<br />Overall, this book was excellent. What more can I say, it was on the New York Times best selling list for nine months in a row. I recommend this book for anyone who wants more wisdom and more knowledge on Asian or Chinese American cultures.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I saw the movie in the dollar theatre, but had the music beforehand.  To me the music was way bigger than the movie.  Let's face it, the movie did not do very well overall and the Homer references were sort of lame.  That may change now with the Grammy Awards.  I enjoy all music, from Frank Sinatra to Selena to Soundgarden (boy, do I miss them!), but I knew this album was something special.  Not only does it tell a story, but you can hear alot of todays music in there.  Granted, you might have to look pretty deep outside of Country, but it's there.  Bluegrass and Gospel have not received the attention they deserve, from a musical contribution standpoint, so I hope this publicity helps change some of that.  Maybe we'll see some more great examples in movies, on the radio, etc.  I bet some of this stuff would sound better in that tinny, no bass sound quality from years ago.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is THE film that will put you in touch with your spiritual side faster than any other audio-visual experience. If you are the type of person who actually understood the power of silence, the breathtaking panoramas, and the sonic tapestries shown in the film &quot;Chronos&quot; or even &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, you will love this gorgeous film.  You will end up playing this over and over.  When I feel everyday life is pressuring me, or I am caught up in my own little world of stress, I play this disc and at the end, my perspective has changed and I no longer feel my worries are important.. This is heaven, my friends.
B00003CXB7|5.0|\\"M*A*S*H\\" is a masterpiece of comedy set in the bleakness of the Korean War.  I always enjoy watching this film.  Like the TV-series that it inspired, it never gets old.<br />This is a MUST HAVE for any DVD collection!
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer spans a good range of pop, jazz and folk influences in this CD. Some of the lyrics are very youngish and poppy-like, yet extremely seductive, deeply felt and fairly raw. His voice does have some similarities to Dave Matthews, but I also sense a young Chet Baker. I haven't been this excited about a new voice since Rufus Wainwright. Good stuff here! And if you like to make out to music, try &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Steven Speilberg's Hunting Masterpiece is by far the best sci-fi film ever made and for good reason its vissuely stunning,mysterise,complex,beutifuly photographed,epic, and in the hands of a master. Stanley Kubrick would have produced the movie and Steven would have directed it at least thats what Kubrick wanted since he came up with the adpation of the novel the movie was based on. But Steven had to take the whole project over wants kubrick died(rest his soul) and I think kubrick would have loved the way the movie turned out. This is steven speilbergs masterpiece and a trbute to the great director.
0783240236|5.0|The Birds is a fabulous movie.  I enjoy it more each time I watch it.  The movie is made up of a web of discrete scenes -- like the pieces of a puzzle.  Tippi Hedren is beautiful and captivating.  The restaurant scene with Mrs Bundy (Ethel Griffies) is excellent.  So many horror movies focus so much on &quot;gore&quot; -- this is one is much more subtle.  And as the movie progresses, and even after it is over, you are not exactly sure how it all fits together.  (A more recent example of this type of movie I think is The Blair Witch Project.)<br />If you are looking for a movie that is predictable, and ties everything up neatly at the end, this is not for you.  If you are looking for wonderful acting, captivating characters, and a suspense and intriguing plot -- then you will enjoy this movie!
B00003CXXP|5.0|First, Haley: Following his work in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Pay It Forward,&quot; Haley Joel Osment's convincing &quot;A.I.&quot; portrayal of a robot child who gradually becomes more human completes a trio of outstanding performances.  We may well be witnessing the accomplishments of the finest boy actor in the history of American cinema.  (Ask yourself, &quot;If not Haley, then who?&quot; and start working back from present day.  Pretty soon you're all the way back past Dean Stockwell and Freddie Bartholomew, and still no rival has emerged.  Haley is left standing above them all.)<br />Second, the heart of the film: &quot;A.I.&quot; explores the allegorical territory of two questions: What does it mean to be human? and What are the responsibilities of creators to their sentient creations?  Its answers are not flattering to humanity.  In &quot;A.I.&quot; the behavior of the robots is almost always more admirable than that of the humans.  Young David (Haley's character) yearns to become human.  In one telling moment in the second act, without realizing it, he does.  Contrary to his programming, he files into a rage and murders another David, the robotic equivalent of his younger brother, Cain slaying Abel.  The filmmakers' true genius is revealed in what happens next: William Hirt's character, the creator and father-equivalent of both Davids, enters the room and registers no shock, disappointment, or even acknowledgment of what has just happened.  It is the worst possible response, because it underscores the unimportance of the creation to the creator.  The indictment of the human race is complete, the failure in its obligations to its technological children is total.<br />Finally, the third act: Some critics have attacked it, but I think it appropriate.  David learns, as all humans do, that there is no love that does not end in loss. To make artificial beings who can love, and to make no provision for them to deal with loss, is ethically reprehensible.  The inevitability of loss can be temporarily skirted, though not averted, only by something approaching the scale of divine intervention. In this film, that is the arrival of empathic alien robot archaeologists.  If the reason why David's human mother could be recreated for only a single day feels a bit contrived, the alternative proves less appealing upon examination.  Had she lived longer, she would have begun to miss her husband, her biological son, and her life beyond her relationship with David.  That would have made him unhappy, and, in the end, he would have lost her anyway.  <br />&quot;A.I.&quot; is a heart-wrenching, thought-provoking film, one of the best ever made.  I have two thumbs; they are both up.
B00004U45G|4.0|I'm listening to the jimmy page and black crowes concert. I had to adjust the equalizers for this to be listenable: basically consisting of lowering the middle range ones. But this album is \\"better\\" on worse speakers, these speakers(120 watt B&Ws) bring out the fact that the sound is too thick throughout the middle and accentuate by their accuracy the general lack of definition probably due to it being a live recording. Now, turning down the middle range allows for somewhat of a wall of bass like what you could expect from led zeppelin music, I mean, custard pie is on right now, after all. But the recording levels are so high too, that I could break my apartment before I got the volume knob halfway up the dial. Now, the drummer, he's so shattered, I mean he's very precise but not very good and relies mainly on his middle range drum that has this thin sort of sound to it, and then the bass drum when used isn't brought out enough in the recording for it to come through as something special and unique like a separated member, making him sound even more mediocre. The whole drop down thing in Custard Pie just isn't brought out at all. So, the result is that I had more fun listening to this on my old speakers (40watt Sanyos) which could hide behind their muddy sound than I do on my new ones. And suddenly at the beginning of sick again, the drum/bass combination booms in more than did the drop down, drop down with drum response in custard pie so they're just full of--it that's all. I mean, sure this recording, for a concert, is fairly clean mainly, more technologically mastered and all that I guess you could say than song remains the same, this was recorded 26 years later, so you know, it should be even though you could argue each instrument doesn't separate out as much even as did the 73 recording (probably because there are too many guitars), but I can't believe Jimmy Page would be satisfied with putting this thing up and being happy about it enough to distribute it, whereas at the same time he's so damn stingy about old led zeppelin concerts which must exist on masters--you know they do--and that could be produced and sold, but he won't do it because as rumor has it he isn't satisfied with the recordings or the performances. Well, there are all those bootlegs out there and it is so frustrating the sound's so bad etc, and you just wanna say, come on man, you can put out a concert from say 1977 or I don't know 1980, why not, it won't kill you, I bet he's got master tapes of something, anything, doesn't he realize that if all those bootlegs exist, it's because people are STARVED for more of their music on stage. And it isn't always a question of the best concerts, there are bootlegs of mediocre performances, etc. but they're still fun to listen to because you have a window on a world gone, and I'm sorry but this album is a worse window into what had been, with all its slick recording techniques (which are questionable even still), than is a shoddy bootleg sounds like you're listening from a room down the hall. But I'm a sap and I love Led Zeppelin and just as I am in ecstasy over any bootleg you give me because you try to distill out what's wrong to get to the heart of something great, you can essentially distill out what went wrong here and get a little taste of what used to be, which was of course wonderful.
6305311463|4.0|I enjoyed 'Armageddon'. I generally back off from mainstream Hollywood stuff, since it tends to be inane and cliched. 'Armageddon' treads a very thin line, for it borders on becoming just another annoying populist flick, but it manages to avoid such a calamity for the most part.<br />That is not to deny that there are a few cliches here and there, and one or two cringeworthy moments of the type that made 'Independence Day' such a travesty. But such moments are commendably brief, and are easily forgiven in the light of some of the film's delights, as are some of the more commercial, mainstream elements which never quite manage to override the finer qualities of the film. Visually, it is stunning and original. The cast are simply fine, and are given a decent script to work with. Amongst the supporting actors, Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi and Owen Wilson shine. The film moves between witty comedic moments and tense drama with no noticeable awkwardness or disjunction.<br />You will enjoy this apocalyptic tale, though after the events of September 11th, its undertones may seem darker and more real than we might otherwise have thought.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was one of those who did not get a chance to watch Moulin Rouge in theater, but my friend was raving about it so much; especiall about Ewan McGregor's singing talent.  I bought the DVD as soon as it came out and was intrigued from the beginning. When Ewan McGregor started to sing &quot;Your Song,&quot; my mouth just dropped and I just fell in love with his voice! From beginning to end, the characters, their songs, and the visual effects take you through an emotional roller-coaster.  One minute I'm laughing and the next minute I'm crying my eyes out!  I've watched it for about 20 + times and the the last scene between Christian and Satine still tug at my heart and makes me cry for them.  This movie breaks out from the normal mold of film making.  I hope that this is just the beginning of a new era in musicals and we can enjoy many, many more to come!

Its' sweeping beauty and grandeur will make you grin so hard your face will hurt...and it's perfectly legal!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I'd love to take the high road and bash this film to pieces, but I can't. AI: Artificial Intelligence is a very well crafted film that succeeds on many levels. The film's plot is intriguing and captivates the viewer for almost the entire running time of the film (well over 2hrs 30mins). Based on the premise of families who cannot conceive or have lost children to tragedy, a MECCA child named DAVID is born. He is taken in and programmed to love only one person FOREVER. David's journey is long and frightening but rewarding. Haley Joel Osment, child or not, is one of the finest living actors. AI will cement his status in hollywood as a top notch child actor and even (eventually)leading man. NO other child actor could have even come close to pulling the empathy out of the audience that Osment does. He is simply incredible. Jude Law's role is very overplayed and less essential to the overall plot than I had originally perceived. Nonetheless, he does a fine job as Gigolo Joe, a suave ladies man who hooks up with David by mere chance. AI contains some of the most breathtaking computer animation ever seen on the screen, especially in the city and in the underwater sequences. Many people seem content to bash AI simply because it is not Kubrick's COMPLETE vision. To those people I say, who better than Steven Spielberg to finish Kubrick's vision. I am a hardcore Kubrick devotee but I loved the ending of AI (one of the few). The contrasting directorial styles of Kubrick(dark) and Spielberg(light) meld into a perfect nightmare of a fairy tale. Many people have said that Spielberg's ending is too happy. Personally, I found the ending unsettling and eerie even more so than Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" or \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\" Overall, AI: Artificial Intelligence will go down in history as one of the greatest film achievements of all-time. I wholeheartedly endorse this film for purchase.

B000000993|5.0|This album is basically where Tool came to life. This is their heaviest, most complex work to date. The album kicks off with Intolerance, a great song to chant along with. Maynard's voice is awesome on this song, as it is throughout the entire album.  All the tracks are great, but for me the song that stands out is 4 Degrees, I just find it to be a really moving tune (even though its subject matter is sorta disgusting), my friends and I all agree this is the best song on here. The sad thing is Tool only play Sober and Prison Sex at live concerts, while there are a few other better songs, (even though Sober and Prison Sex are great). And Maynard has vowed never to do 4 degrees at a live concert ever again. Such is life...

B00005T30L|2.0|slightly conscious of my own alienation, i really wanted to connect with this movie.  or, atleast, have a couple good cynical laughs.  unfortunately, the actions and development of the characters just seemed too contrived and unexplained, giving this movie a very disjointed feeling.  and then there are the subtle smacks in the face that serve to hurt the movie, like the cheesy bus scene at the end.  the story simply flails its arms, trying to grasp a sense of solidarity with high-school untouchables, and fails miserably.<br />quick and dirty description: cheesy, clunky, contrived, and painful in a bad way<BR>what would i rather watch? high school spanish videos, they provide more insight and understanding of people and are also more amusing.<br />i recommend watching the trailer, you'll get all the funny parts and delve into the depths of the characters.
0140187650|5.0|This book should be read by every highschool student, but unfortunately even our most celebrated members of society (congressmen, presidents, newscasters, opinion makers) have probably never read it.  If they did they might see a little (or a lot) of themselves in Eichmann.  But probably not because one of Eichmann's fatal flaws was a complete lack of introspection; a huge blind spot which is no doubt shared by many of our present day pundits.<BR>   When Arendt first saw Eichmann he struck her more as a clown than a monster.  He thought in cliches, seemingly unable to have an original thought outside what was programed in him from party indoctrination (remind you of any of todays pols?).  He was able to do his job good (coordinating trains and working with local officials)  but he was unable to really think clearly or with any depth (though he did quote Kant which is no doubt more than what todays Bozos can do).  He was just a career cog going thru his pathetic, self-absorbed motions - In the 90's he'd have been a real shining star at Enron.  <BR>    These days we're constantly exposed to all the dogmatic  posturing about \\"how it'll never happen again\\" (especially not in Europe) and yet it DID happen again between 91 and 95 in Bosnia (quarter of a million murders) while the Western world stood blindly by and the leader of the western world occupied himself with oval office \\"cigar parties\\"<BR>   And if you don't think morality can be relative consider this: Iran was the only country to act with resolve by shipping the Bosnians arms during those years.  Now Iran is part of the \\"Evil axis\\"<BR>   In our lifelong quest to reconcile with evil, be it banal or absolute, and to understand the human condition, this book is a must...<BR>   Best of luck
B00004XQ83|5.0|As a child I loved watching Lester Flatt & Earl Scrugs, live from the Grand Ole Opry every Saturday afternoon.  They were fun.  Their music was alive.  It breathed.  It had real blood pumping through its veins.  As I grew a little older I left what had become \\"country\\" for more modern genres of music, as well as classical.  The Rolling Stones had far more life in their music than did the crying-in-my-beer-becaue-I'm-running-around-on-my-wife claptrap that Nashville was (and still is) passing off as music.<br />If I wanted to hear living renditions of material that mattered - \\"I'll Fly Away\\", \\"Angel Band\\", \\"You Are My Sunshine\\", \\"Keep On the Sunny Side\\", \\"In the Highways, In the Hedges\\", etc. - I had to either play them myself or find a rare band that had let Nashville pass them by.  Old recordings of the Stanley Brothers were available, as were old recordings of other legendary bluegrass and gospel performers.  But prior to the advent of CDs, and the re-release of archived material, they were painfully hard to come by, and often in poor condition.<br />And then I saw OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU.  The movie is great, a hoot from start to finish.  But I fell in love with Alison Krauss without having ever seen her.  What an absolutely beautiful voice.  And her band, Union Station (aka The Soggy Bottom Boys) are fantastic.<br />The three Peasall sisters are precious.  To the best that I can find, their reording of Maybelle Carter's \\"In the Highways, In the Hedges\\" is the only recording of these children available.  Unfortunately the album left off their rendition of \\"Angel Band\\", which ends the film.<br />To my pleasure however, immediately after the little girls' version of that song, the film follows with the 1956 recording of The Stanley Brothers singing the same song, which is on the album.<br />\\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" ROCKS, no two ways about it.<br />Every song and artist on the album could be praised.  Special kudos need to go to T. Bone Burnett for having produced the album, and to the Coen brothers for having done the entire project.<br />This music lives.  It breaths.  It has real blood pumping through its veins.  It's the best album I've heard in many years.
6303269826|5.0|I honestly do not know why so many critics panned this movie. It is a comprehensive, well-paced and exceptioanally well done story of a great American who provided law and order when there was none.  Costner's performance as Wyatt is subdued but very effective, communicating the quiet resolve and intensity of the man while Dennis Quaid's Doc Holliday is perfection, equalling Val Kilmer's outstanding performance in Tombstone.  The photography is deep and earthy, evoking the loneliness and gritty realism of frontier town inhabitants after the Civil War.  If you love the old west and the courage and fortitude of those that had the guts to tame it, you will love this movie.
B000002UVZ|4.0|Another reviewer called this album \\"Chinese Food R.E.M.\\", and I think that sums it up pretty well. I like when I'm listening to it, but with the notable exceptions of 'Swan Swan H' and 'Hyena', I rarely remember any of it. I think it's a good album, don't get me wrong--but it's the most consistent R.E.M. album, which means that the highs and lows have been smoothed out. It's certainly not my favorite album, R.E.M. or otherwise. I prefer the other hit-or-miss albums, if only because the good ones are really good (and this is the 21st century. You can skip the bad ones.). Of course, 'Hyena' and 'Swan H' are great. I'll even put myself in the minority here and say I love 'Underneath the Bunker'. <br />This one definitely beats 'Green', 'Murmur', 'Out of Time', and I never bothered to listen to anything after 'Monster' (though I liked that one). Overall, if you're new to R.E.M., you'll probably like this one. If not, you'll probably like it anyway.
0446525537|5.0|I read this book because a friend was reading it.  I did not do so however until my Freshman year of Highschool.  I regret at waiting so long.  A Walk To Remember is a book for all emotions.  I laughed, I cried, I was shocked, I was amazed.  For anyone, who has not read this book, read it.  It is a fine work of literature, that should win some kind of a Newbery or other award.

I'll even put myself in the minority here and say I love 'Underneath the Bunker'.  <br />This one definitely beats 'Green', 'Murmur', 'Out of Time', and I never bothered to listen to anything after 'Monster' (though I liked that one).  Overall, if you're new to R.E.M., you'll probably like this one.  If not, you'll probably like it anyway.
B0000033OZ|5.0|I'm not an ELP fan, but I am a fan of this album. In the aftershock of King Crimson's \\"farewell\\" album (Wake of Poseidon) and still reeling from the breakthrough \\"The Yes Album\\", ELP's first release captures much of what is best in the shortly post-emergent days of progressive rock. Having followed Emerson through some tortured releases with The Nice, ELP finally framed his talent with a pair of musicians that could, at least, keep up with his outstanding ability. Just listen to \\"Hang on to a Dream\\" on Elegy, by The Nice: I don't think Jackson or Davison had a clue to what Emerson was doing with that piano. Unlike The Nice, ELP plays here as a unit. And while their taste will be called into question in later releases, the first album balances extravagance with restraint in performances that sound as if they had been playing together for years and years.<br /><br />What remains so strong about this album is that each piece is archetypal. Each is the definitive version of itself. From the virtuosic  \\"The Barbarian\\" to the introspective \\"Take a Pebble\\" to the theatrical \\"Knife's Edge\\" and the fairy-tale-with-a-message \\"Lucky Man\\", all the music is strange, new and familiar at the same time. You may think you'd heard it before and elsewhere, but until this recording came along, you hadn't. It even set a new standard for sound reproduction: my friends and I often used \\"Tank\\" as a demo for evaluating stereo equipment. The climactic thumps once set a Phase Linear 400 amp on fire. Honest.<br /><br />Perhaps it was simply the newness of combining all these influences at this particular moment in music, but the lads came out with what may be the only truly unique, complete  and coherent record of their careers. It's one of those records where every note is in place, every inflection is absolutely right ( even though the reverb gets over the top in places ) and all of it stands the test of these past few decades at least. It perfectly captures that singular moment in music.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Maybe that's a stretch but the movie is excellent.<br />I saw it in the theater first, immediately ran out and bought the soundtrack. I've purchased the dvd multiple times...once for myself, many times for gifts to others.<br />If you add this to your collection it will be one of the few that you pull off of the shelf time and time again to watch.<br />I don't want to give away anything to those few who have not seen the movie but Clooney and Turturo both put on outstanding performances. You will fall in love with the &quot;Old Timey Harmony&quot; songs that litter the movie, and after the twentieth time you've watched you'll be able to sing right along...This movie is a 'Must Buy'.
B000005IU2|5.0|Bloodied, screaming, original, basic and hypnotic. One of the essential albums of all time. Never to be seen again, above analysis and beyond critique: Rock 'n roll that is pure, perfect and outside rational experience. The Stooges were a force and a style unto themselves and Funhouse is the definitive document.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Leave it to animation studio Pixar to tackle a project like \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" Pixar has always taken us to places we've never been but have always suspected existed. In \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\", they showed us the secret world of toys that kids have always believed in. In \\"A Bug's Life\\", they showed us... the life of a bug. And now, with \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", they show us the world of the monsters we always thought were hiding in our closets to scare us. <br />John Goodman is James P. Sullivan (\\"Sully\\", as his friends call him), the top scarer at Monsters, Inc. His best friend is Mike Wazowski, voiced by Billy Crystal. Their job at Monsters, Inc. is to scare the living daylights out of children. Oh, you didn't know? Scream energy is what powers Monstropolis, the city they live in. At the time the film takes place, Monstropolis is having a power shortage. \\"Rolling Blackouts\\" are to be expected. So of course, the faithful monsters at Monsters, Inc. must scare as much children as possible. But wait... in this film, the monsters are scared of us, too. Whoda thunkit? So if a child just happened to get through the closet doors that separate the monster and human worlds, just how do you think those poor little monsters would be able to handle that? <br />There's more to the plot, but I won't take up any more of your time with silly plot details. I had a blast at \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" for a good deal of time, and even though it has it's lulls, it certainly is a solid piece of work. This is going to draw a lot of comparison to DreamWork's previous \\"Shrek\\", so let's get that out of the way here. First off, the animation. While they're both computer animated, the animation in \\"Monsters\\" differs from that in \\"Shrek\\" in a few ways. The animation from Pixar is well-rounded, and uses a lot of cooler colors and more colorful tones. Even though \\"Shrek\\" was DreamWork's first completely computerized animated feature, it's been apparent in all of their animated flicks that they've gone forthe more hardened, realistic look with a more yellowish palette (take a look at \\"The Prince of Egypt\\"). Me, I like the Pixar way myself. Take your pick. <br />But in other ways, \\"Monsters\\" fails to live up to \\"Shrek\\" or its Disney predecessors. Mainly because unlike \\"Shrek\\" or the \\"Toy Story\\" movies, this won't appeal to all ages. This is one of the few animated movies I can point to that would play better to the adults in the audience than the children. If the kid who was crying in my row is any indication, there's a lot of stuff in \\"Monsters\\" that could really scare the little ones, especially when things start happening to Boo (the little girl who found her way into the monster world). <br />But let's not talk about the bad stuff. \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", with all of its flaws, is a fantastic film. It starts off in an incredibly fresh way (the opening credits reminded me of an old Disney short, \\"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\\".) The whole beginning segment pulsates with energy and originality. With Pixar films it always seems the filmmakers had a great time making them, and it shows here. Yes, it does slow down in the middle as the focus becomes more story related, but there were a few jokes that I think went over most people's heads (including one sly pun involving lemon flavor snow cones-- if I were with Mike and Sully, I'd give them a helpful piece of advice- don't eat yellow snow!) <br />However slow the middle may be (and trust me, it's not that slow), the movie picks up with an exhilarating climax involving millions of closet doors. Without a doubt this sequence was put together with the thought of a Disney World ride in mind. This scene is a testament to the abilities of computer animation. It's quite a sight to behold, and it never becomes stale or uninteresting. <br />\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a tremendous accomplishment from Pixar. It's got plenty for most of the family (although the really young ones might want to skip it). Newcomer writer/director Peter Docter can't quite top \\"Shrek\\" as computer animated flick of the year (and \\"Shrek\\" can't beat \\"Waking Life\\" as best overall animated film of 2001). Hopefully though, if we're lucky, he's just getting warmed up.
0783235607|5.0|that pretty much all I Have to say.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Jones is the product of an Oklahoma mother and an Indian father (Ravi Shankar, in fact), yet her album displays none of her genetic background.  It is put out by Blue Note, though this is not in any way a jazz album.  It's the work of a lounge singer or the girl singer with a garage band who has suddenly decided she wants to branch out and do something just for herself.  Her voice is astonishingly mature, but small.  It reminds me a little bit of Julie London's sheepish comment about her own voice: \\"I've only got but a little thimbleful of a voice.\\"  <br />Jones instantly pulls the listener in with the husky intimacy of her voice, but the album would be better served were there more variety.  Each song, while fine in its own right, begins to blend into the next song (and the song before it) when they are nearly all slow, pensive and ballad-like.<br />The things Jones does well, she does exceedingly well.  Listen to the regret in \\"Shoot the Moon\\"--Jones packs so much meaning into the lyrics, \\"The summer days are gone too soon/You shoot the moon/And miss completely.\\"  The song understands the cyclical nature of love without necessarily accepting it.  This is the gorgeous stuff.  Also successful is the gospel-tinged \\"Turn Me On\\" in which the Hammond B-3 organ is employed to great sustaining effect.  Jesse Harris wrote the best new songs on the album: \\"Don't Know Why,\\" \\"Shoot the Moon\\" and \\"I've Got to See You Again.\\"<br />The reason Norah Jones is someone to watch is that when she takes tentative steps towards work other than the folk-tinged lounge music that makes up much of this album, she intrigues the ear.  She transforms Hank Williams' classic \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" into a silky and thoughtful meditation on love's ruination.  On the final cut, Hoagy Carmichael's lovely \\"The Nearness of You,\\" Jones makes the yearning in the song make perfect, primal sense.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Speaking from my personal experience with the conflict in Vietnam from 1960 thru 1976, I can highly recommend the film \\"We Were Soldiers.\\"  No one film can tell all the stories of that war, however this one tells in a powerfully graphic story all about this battle.  And it tells it pretty much like it was.  Probably too graphic for most of the younger generation who do not remembmer seeing some to these scenes on the evening news during the 60's and 70's, but I feel it is a \\"must see\\" for that same and any following generations, especially in view of the current world situation involving the military.<BR>I was in a remote area of Vietnam as a civilian nurse with a civilian health organization, my husband was one of the first advisors to volunteer to go to Vietnam, and served two tours there, the last as an officer on General Westmoreland's staff, my father was in Saigon with AID from 1960 thru 1966 as an engineer advisor to the Vietnamese civilians building Tan Son Nuit Airport, so I feel I have some history with the country and the times.  I remember the first American advisors who were wounded and killed, the first Marines who went down in helicopters and my first case of Napalm burns, they were on Vietnamese children.  The scenes in this film \\" We Were Soldiers\\" were as realistic as they can be using special effects and special make-up.  The sounds of battle, the helicopter flights, the terror the soldiers on both sides is accurate and necessary. <BR>I once rode a helicopter from Danang to our hospital with an Army Major who gave me his flack jacket to sit on, in those days,  the V.C. would lie on their backs and shoot up at the choppers as they passed over them. Rounds would come up through the bottom of the choppers and those guys were more worried about that wound than any other.  <BR> I also remember the first American woman killed in battle to be a famous war photographer, I attended her memorial service in Saigon.  I feel honored to have known so many of the people whose paths I crossed in Vietnam and I know they would appreciate finally having a realistic film of one small part of that terrible war.<BR>I recommend seeing it if you are over 60 for one reason, and if you are under 60 for another.<BR>Those who cannot remember the horrors of war are doomed to repeat them in the coming generations.  Hopefuly<BR>credible films like \\"We Were Soldiers\\" will help us to remember these lessons of war.<BR>God help our sons if we cannot learn from this war's mistakes.<BR>Barbara Boyd Moore
B00005N9CV|4.0|On this album, Diana Krall trades in her tiny back-up band for a full orchestra (both the London Symphony Orchestra and a Los Angeles session orchestra).  She revels in the plush, expanded sound.  The album opens with &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; and to my mind this is the only tune on which Krall doesn't quite succeed--instead of embracing the deliriously happy nature of the lyrics, she turns the song into one of her signature smoothy-smoothy efforts.  It doesn't serve the song well, but she sounds fine here.<br />Better elsewhere on the album are efforts like &quot;Cry Me A River.&quot;  On this, Krall gives a musical shrug and tells her lover to go to hell.  Not bothering to temper her disdain with regret, the song has the finality of a damnation.  On &quot;The Night We Called It a Day,&quot; Krall follows the lyrics in looking everywhere but at her ex-lover, fearing the pain and recrimination she'll find there.  Hoagy Carmichael would definitely approve of Krall's rendition of his marvelous &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well.&quot;  She takes steps towards trying to convince herself she's better off and does a superb job of employing hesitation and tentative phrasing to highlight the doubt implicit in the song.<br />May I make a request of the marketing folks?  You don't need to keep selling Diana Krall.  A step in the direction of fewer she's-all-cleavage-and-long-legs photographs would go a long way towards lending gravity to the serious reputation she richly deserves.
B00005N9CV|4.0|While many jazz purists have panned &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; others will find this album very enjoyable. On this CD Ms. Krall is backed not only her usual quartet but, on many of the cuts, she's also backed by the London Symphony Orchestra.  She sings many of the standards, and her voice is strong, smooth, and seductive. <BR>There are many well known romantic ballads on this CD, including &quot;S' Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Cry Me a River,&quot; &quot;Besame Mucho,&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; Some may scoff at the lush strings (frankly, I'd rather hear Diana Krall's voice) but every jazz artist seems to do a &quot;with Strings&quot; album once in their career, and this may be hers. <BR>A word about the CD packaging. Ms. Krall is a very attractive woman, and the photos in this CD only emphasize that fact. I know we shouldn't buy CDs based on the CD art, but, in this case, it's an added bonus.
B000003NA4|5.0|Diana Krall burst into the public's consciousness with this 1997 album and was suddenly hailed left and right as the new jazz sensation.  There was subsequently the expected backlash, and now that five years have passed, it may be time to see how this album has stood up.  I'm happy to report that it has aged beautifully.<br />On Dave Frishberg's simultaneously hilarious and sexy \\"Peel Me A Grape,\\" Krall manages to make her voice sound like an aural version of what Mae West looked like visually.  You can't go wrong with lyrics like, \\"Best way to cheer me/Cashmere me,\\" but Krall manages to transcend the slight silliness of the song to give it some real kitten-with-a-whip snap.  Towards the end, her whispers and moans have the flavor of the Julie London version of \\"Go Slow\\"--all enticement and sex.<br />Krall sings \\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\" with a forthrightness and sense of righteous expectation that makes it clear she fully intends to find out more about \\"you\\"--and she manages to make every red-blooded listener wish that someone would sing to them this way.  <br />On \\"Lost Mind,\\" Krall admits her helplessness in the face of a \\"wild romance\\" and asks for help wherever she can get it, while simultaneously injecting some defiance into her plea for whatever aid she can find.  When she sings \\"He was cool and sweet/Sweet and cool as homemade sin,\\" you find yourself wanting to grab a partner and indulge in a little bit of homemade sin yourself!<br />Too bad Krall grabs all the headlines, because her backing band is brilliantly capable.  They show a restraint that's refreshing and which shows off to best advantage the intimate nature of Krall's sinuous voice.
B000003CKH|5.0|This album, like every Cake album, is the kind of album that is always welcome, always satisfying, always loveable, and always the best album that could be playing at that moment.  No matter where I am, if I hear a Cake album playing (especially this one), I feel compelled to turn up the volume louder and louder. The lyrics are beautiful and always poetic.  These lyrics were not written to fit in a song, but instead were written as poetry, and then they were woven into music.  The lead singer, John McCrea, has an odd vocal key that hovers between singing and talking, but he executes it best on this album. \\"Prolonging the Magic\\" and \\"Comfort Eagle\\" are good albums in their own right, but this one is the best, in my opinion.  \\"Pressure Chief\\" and later albums are great if you are a fan, but if you are new to Cake, try \\"Fashion Nugget\\" first.
B00000J7S8|5.0|For those who find Krall's style too languid, take a listen to the jaunty \\"Devil May Care.\\"  Krall ignores the fact that jazz great Teri Thornton owned this Bob Dorough song in the 1960s and decides to take it on anyway.  Hopscotching along with the staccato beat and defiant lyrics, Krall shrugs off her oh-so-cool persona with this song.  \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" picks up this welcome new thread again later in the album.<br />Krall continues to show a gift for picking out songs which may not quite be standards and shows the world why they should be.  On Leslie Bricusse's \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\"--curiously, first sung by Rex Harrison to a seal in the great film version of \\"Dr. Doolittle\\"--Krall unleashes her lower register to very great effect.  On first listening to this, I thought mistakenly that Krall had used a male guest singer in the beginning of the song.  No, it's all her--and the darkness of her voice works astonishingly well to establish the pain and regret implicit in the song.<br />On \\"The Best Thing For You,\\" Krall is a woman with her mind made up.  Briskly, brooking no dissent, she tells her man what's what and does it beautifully--you can hear the smile in her voice.  The album closes with the teasing, sultry Gershwin classic, \\"Do It Again\\" in which Krall indulges in a get-close-then-pull-away game with the listener.  <br />Despite the usual overly sultry photographs of the ever-photogenic Krall plastered all over the place, this album goes a long way towards showing the world she's more than a sexpot babe with just an OK voice and a minor gift for piano-playing.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Given the conservative nature of most current mainstream films, Moulin Rouge has been rightly applauded for taking cinematic risks.  However, the simple taking of risks is not, in itself, a guarantee of great cinema and, for mine, the thinking behind this film is confused and ultimately unsatisfying.<BR>*<BR>On my first viewing, the blinding tempo of the editing, with shots often lasting less than a second, was startling;  it was also physically irritating.  Certainly, it's unusual for the big screen, but it's also redolent of formulaic video clips on MTV or the like - hoardes of box stepping dancers, with the star attraction up front, all digitalised jump cuts and jitter - we have, actually, seen this before.  So it's not so unusual after all, and the question then becomes, does this technique add to the viewing experience? ( Which is close to asking whether one wants to see a two hour long dance video clip.)   I think the elaborate sets and spectacle would have been even more impressive if normal editing techniques had been employed.  More crucially, the main characters might have established more of an emotional connection with the audience, so that when tragedy strikes later in the film, something approaching a catharsis might transpire.  The excitement generated by the opening seems artificial, one distraction layered upon the other, until the characters and the story are lessened, if not lost, instead of being heightened.<BR>*<BR>There is extensive use of models and CGI to allow otherwise impossible shots of the cityscape of period Paris.  The opening is thus visually arresting but, in principle, this has been done before (go back to Olivier's Henry V from 1944 for one example) - the digital 'flying camera' technique is then repeated several times, until its impact is diminished, and this again reminds of images routinely used and reused in music video clips.<BR>*  <BR>In the commentaries, the writers, Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, seem convinced that the crashing together of different genres and disparate elements is inherently a good thing.  I think they have failed in judging what elements complement and mutually elevate each other, in contrast to those which merely intrude and detract from the work as a whole.  There's the feeling that if another association occurred to them, they forced it in, and that the paring down process was not guided by a single strong vision.  They sound a little too enamoured of their own brilliance. It's particularly telling when they come to discuss the final scenes - in terms of story resolution, they admit that they were unsure how to end the film: the story was unclear in their own minds, and yet throughout the commentary they have been paying lip-service to the idea that everything must be subservient to the needs of the story - in the commentary they bluster through the inconsistencies, but you can hear their confidence wane.   <BR>*<BR>In a way, you can hardly blame them.  An enormous amount of money was thrown at this film, and Lurhmann and co. must have been surrounded by lackeys all too ready to canonise them as creative geniuses.  You wonder who was around to challenge their ideas on artistic (as opposed to economic) grounds.  So when Baz suggests combining French bedroom farce, with the operatic tragedy of La Boheme, themes taken from nineteenth century French novellas with the whimsy of Hollywood musicals, nobody is there to ask whether all these elements combine well or combine badly.  <BR>*<BR>So overall, there are numerous incongruent elements struggling for the viewer's attention and sympathy:  there are comedic elements - but they make the mistake of not being humorous;  there are tragic elements, but the tragedy hardly seems tragic; there are sexual elements which stop short of being sexy; opera with the melodramatic action but no Mozart or Puccini to lift this musically towards the sublime - although it is lifted sufficiently (by Madonna Ciccone and Reginald Dwight etal) to be passable as entertainment.  <BR>*<BR>It's as if two chefs decided to create a new dish by combining a large number of tried and tested ingredients into the one big pot.  None of the produce is particular fresh, and copious spices are required to disguise this fact.  After two hours on the boil, the dish is ready, and lo and behold, it's a kind of casserole - unfortunately, one that's likely to leave the discerning viewer with an upset stomach.
B00005RYLE|5.0|If you're reading this, odds are you're already a fan of the Evil Dead Trilogy, and if you've been a fan for any amount of time, you've been DYING (pardon the pun) to get your hands on a good DVD copy of this classic horror film, and the debut of actor Bruce Campbell, and Spiderman director Sam Raimi.<br />Anchor Bay has done an excellent job on all the re-issues of the Evil Dead series, and this is probably the best I've seen from them yet. I had a VHS copy of Evil Dead for some time, and the quality was just horrible. Needless to say, after a few years, I'd gotten used to it. When I put this in my DVD player, I was simply blown away by the picture clarity it had. For once, Evil Dead actualy -looked- like the low-budget masterpeice it truly is. The audio is equally improved, and 5.1 mixed to boot.<br />What really makes this the coolest DVD around is the packaging. It's not one of those standard hard plastic snap cases, with graphics on it. It's an actual replica of the Book of the Dead from Evil Dead 1, with an intro by Tom Sullivan! It also comes with a booklet INSIDE the Necronomicon, following the release history of Evil Dead on video, DVD, and Laserdisc. It's a special feature in and of itself.<br />There are two seperate audio commentary tracks, one featuring Sam Raimi and Rob Tappert, and one with Ash himself, Bruce Campbell. The only real soft point of this DVD is the commentary. The tracks are informative, and funny as always, but just not as entertaining as the Evil Dead II commentary. That being said, the EDII commentary track is the best I've ever heard, so it's a tough act to follow up.<br />An outstanding release, both aesthetically, and content-wise. Jam packed with features, and one of the damn scariest movies I've ever seen. Buy it now, or regret it later!
0790733226|3.0|Although the science fact here is lacking, the science fantasy is wonderful.  But what was important to me was the rare character of the woman scientist.  It was for that reason that I wanted my 10 year old daughter to see this, and own this film.  It is not often that girls can see themselves in the characters of science fiction.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Wow! This movie is so abstract and beautiful. I highly recommend it to everyone. (especially if you love animation) This is very deep. I will definatly buy this.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I can't remember a movie that stuck with me like this one does.  It seems amazing that so much of what it is to be human, to be in love, and to be loved is described in this motion picture.<br /> Frankly I don't know where the comments about this film being somehow flawed come from.  Haley Osment is astounding, I can't recall any child actor putting forth a perfomance even close to this in it's span of emotions, I'm not sure more than a handful of adults could have done as well. The blending of Spielberg and Kubric is seamless to me.  You will find yourself forgetting the characters are actually human actors and not mechanized.<br /> Science Fiction should always teach a lesson that is relevent to today but told in the context of tomorrow.  As such, this movie is Science Fiction at it's very best.

6303695779|4.0|When I picked up \\"Vampyr,\\" I thought of all the commentary I have read about the film.  I read the back of the package and was a little dismayed that the ending was given right there.  Don't worry, the package is wrong, so the ending is not spoiled.  And, that is not the only thing that is not right.<br />First, the movie does have subtitles, but they are not in English.  When the hero is reading a book, you see a Germanic or Dutch gothic script, then a translation in English will appear.  This covers the whole screen so I would not say it was subtitled.  When you do see the subtitles, they are not in German or English.  From reading another review, I am inclined to believe it is in Dutch.<br />There is some classic vampire folklore in the movie, not just what we learn from \\"Dracula.\\"  Don't be dismayed, the vampire, or vampyr, is still a malevolent being.  It is interesting to see the other attributes given to these creatures in different cultures.<br />In regard to quality, I find it is a great film.  Since it was originally filmed in 1931, the video was taken from the original film.  Because of this, there is quite a bit of distortion and hissing (sometimes sounding like a helicopter in the distance or a trawling motor).  This distortion can make the actual words and music sound faint.  Although this may look like a silent film, it is not.  You just have to listen for it.  I think it adds to the eerie effect rather than detracts from it.  Think of it like reading an ancient book that has the feel and smell of antiquity.<br />Carl Dreyer is experimental in his camera tricks.  Remember that he is not making errors.  He is using these tricks to help add to the ambience.  For instance, take a close look at the shadow of the guy shoveling.  That is all I will say there.<br />If you are a vampire or horror enthusiast, this is a must see.  If your idea of horror is the typical \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" movie, then you may want to give this a skip.  It is nice to see where other horror directors got their ideas though.
0449227421|5.0|I notice that there are two distinct groups of reviewers for this book. One group feels that it is excellent and the other feels that it is very poor in quality. However, I have found the book to be an excellent read and so have other book lovers among my acquaintances. <BR>The story is gripping, full of suspense and with a lot of twists. I liked the strong determined character of the heroine. The characters of Steve Logan, Berrington Jones etc. are also well drawn sketches. The plot is intriguing and deals with cutting edge BioTechnology.It has been thoroughly researched as any Ken Follett novel generally is (I know Follett has a good research team to help him out while writing ) The tension is taut throughout. It is well written as any Ken Follett novel is. It has all the ingredients of a top class thriller.<BR>The only drawback that I have noticed was the computer program that Jeannie Ferrami wrote to retrieve matches from databases. That seems a bit far fetched since the program seems to run on any platform, search any database of any type. I have not come across any program like that.<BR>However, apart from this minor flaw, there is hardly any blemish in the book. It made me a Follett fan at once and though the other books he has written are different, I have enjoyed most of them.

B00000IH7P|5.0|One thing I like this album about most is that all the songs are album versions, while previous collections used to be single version or excerpt. Running time is almost 79 minutes. I think songs were well chosen and sound quality is good. I hope this should have been \\"ADD\\" though.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|If there has ever been a film undeserving of the accolades it's received, it's Moulin Rouge. From beginning to end, there's not a trace of true soul or emotion. The acting is uniformly over-the-top, the script is arid, the musical numbers are occasionally fun,...and the only thing that sticks in the memory afterward are the sets...
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is great! It is truly a science fiction movie and is done fantastically with every bit of technology at Spielburg's fingertips. Many people are searching life for things they can never have, if only they could search a little longer. David, played by Haley Joel Osment, is searching too. Only since he is mechanical &quot;mecha&quot; instead of &quot;orga&quot; organic, he can search and wait a lot, lot longer to find what he wants. The emotions that this movie evokes make you feel great. It really has a wonderful ending that makes you feel good! This movie shows what folly people are capable of in their search for love and how they mistakingly pass this on to creatures with &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;. Bravo!
B000060OFT|5.0|This was an amazing version of R&J not all the acting is strong but the visuals and the atmosphere really make this a stunning adaptation of the classic.<BR>As with most Baz films it is the first 20-30 minutes that will make or break this film for you. If you can stand the fast paced in your face, loud and different take on Shakespeare I think you will really like the inventivness of this film. This not classic Shakespeare by any strech of the mind! For one thing Mercutio is a gay/female impersonator far from the orginal characterization. But he is actually one of my favorite people in this film.<BR>I will not reveal the ending but I will say Baz tweaks the classic ever-so slightly enought to make this movie completely new to me and I found myself sobbing at the end even though I knew the outcome.<BR>Truly if liked both Moulin Rouge and Strictly Ballroom you will probably enjoy this film. <BR>I find Baz's pictures so fresh even when using an established theme or subject. I have yet to be disapointed and I look forward to his next project!
6303257844|5.0|I saw this movie on television and it had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. I give this movie 5 stars because it's thrilling, exciting and left a good impression on me. I would recomend this to anyone who likes excitement but not of the scary kind. It is not scary.
B00005Y228|5.0|This has to be the best Kylie has ever done. I thought \\"Light Years\\" was her disco best, but now I've gotten \\"Fever\\".<BR>There are so many tracks with the potential to be hits, that this CD is a great buy no matter what you pay.<BR>Pop is so boring right now and this sound is(again)refreshing!<BR>Disco Down Kylie!!!
0385484518|5.0|&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; is a true story between a psychology professor, Morrie and his ex-student, Mitch Albom. In the 14 Tuesdays, Morrie taught him about the meaning of life and care of his friends and family. I like this book very much and thusI would like to share my feelings with all the readers.<br />After i read this book, I learn what is love and how to communicate with others and simpathy of my friends. Sometimes I think that my personality like the author, Mitch. I do not care about the relationships between my friends and families or even do not trust them. But, when i read one of the chapter, Morrie taught his students to trust others, so he use a game. I was really touching when I finished to read this chapter. And thus, I suprise that I never care about it. <br />Now I'm a student and i will go to work soon. Thus, I think this book can really help me to improve my inter-personal skills and how to communicate with others more smoothly. I hope all of you can recommend this to others when you finish to read of it. Now, I always recommend this to my friends and my families because this is the best book that i never saw it before.
B00005OCMR|3.0|As mentioned before, it is confirmed, if you are playing this DVD on a playstation 2, you can expect a major glitch during the exchange between Flynn and RAM in the holding cell.  This glitch results is a yellow gridded pattern layed over top of what the movie is supposed to be displaying.  This results in you having to either eject the disk or reset the machine to restore normal playback. I've checked multiple copies, and unfortunately the only workaround is to fast-forward past the scene.<br />I don't know what' causes the problem, but it is quite disappointing, I assure you.<br />Otherwise, the movie is great.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I picked up this album when it came out, and didn't listen to it much. I listened to it in my cd player about a month later and I'm hooked. I'm a big Dave Matthews Band fan, and I don't see the comparison to the band. This young man has the potential to be even bigger then DMB. This album is full of cool jazz rythmn's and uplifting songs about life. These songs are from kids from MY generation, and in time this album will be looked at as one of the first great album's of the 2000's. I cannot recommend this album enough!! I listened to one song, and I was hooked. Amazing stuff, folks....
B000002MY3|5.0|I am a teenage girl, and I feal these songs touch me everywhere. there not the average Ill love you forever .... Instead, she has meaningfull lyrics about life in general.<BR>1. All I Really Want-the first time i heard this song i hated it, now i feal this song kinda depicts me. Alanis kinda schreeches thourgh it but has TERRIFIC control. the lyrics are very powerful.<BR>3. Perfect- good song, soft, touching, about parents that expect their kids to be perfect in everyway<BR>4. Hand in My Pocket- this song is ME. great lines, but the chorus is ehhhhhh.<BR>5. Right Through You- good lyrics, good beat, good in general<BR>6. Forgiven- terrific song, terrific lines<BR>8. Head over Feet- VERY good melody, good lyrics<BR>9. Mary Jane- dont like this one<BR>10. Ironic- teriffic, extremely addictive<br />Her lead voice is slightly raspy, and that adds a lot. I actually dislike each song the first few times i hear it, but usually end up liking them right away, so dont start to judge until you've listened a bit. I recomend her newest \\"Under Rug Swept\\"<BR>Good listening!<BR>-Hannah<BR>teenager in IL

0380973650|5.0|Gaiman is another one of my pet authors.  A real imaginist.  American Gods is this Brit author's search for the real America.  If you want to read a novel that attempts to capture the soul of America, this is it.  Man, this bizarre fantastical journey reaches for it and finds it.  The idea?  As America was created by the great melting pot, those who came here brought their culture, their lifestyle, basically, their gods.  And those gods are still here, wallowing in half forgotten-ness, but still fighting for survival.<br />It is a grand work.  Read it.  If you want to think about what it is to be part of America.  If you want to think about how new culture and old culture combine and merge, how ideas fade through the ages, like an old forgotten god, read it.<br />For me it was even more vivid after recent events to read a novel like this.  I think Gaiman says it best in his acknowledgments, where he buried his most sturring statement, and here since I don't have the book with me, I will destroy his comment and misquote him, but it goes something like, and thanks to my family for putting up with my while I went looking for America, which ended up to be in America all along.<br />Thanks, Neil.  We needed that.
0446677450|4.0|(From the Department of Marketing, City University of Hong Kong)<BR>This book has changed my concept about money! <BR>The concept of cash flow reminded me not to have liability over asset. If we spend our money on something which brings no income/ interest to us, we just waste our money. Therefore, we should know what is asset and try to get as many as possible so that the asset can generate income/ interest for us. <br />However, the author did not tell any practical guide for us to follow so that we could be as rich as he to be.
B000003TA2|4.0|i just picked this up the other day and i enjoyed it. tracks like Dirty Boots, Kool Thing, &amp; Disappearer are really good. some songs focus on Kim's vocals and even Kool Thing features Chuck D from Public Enemy. pick this one up and also go for Daydream Nation and Evol.
0380799006|5.0|I bought this book because my toddler (2) was being very aggressive toward my newborn.  While, I think the theories in this book require at least one child to be emotionally and verbally developed enough to express their emotions and thoughts, it has helped me look at her aggression in a new light.  And treat her in a more positive manner even when I don't like her behavior.  There are also some very valuable lessons to foster good relations between siblings - that's the best lesson I learned.  My children may have personality differences that keep them from being best friends but there are things that I can and MUST to to foster an respectful and caring relationship.  EVERYONE with more than one child needs to read this book.
B00005B4GU|1.0|I like to think of myself as a pretty forgiving music fan-and a big Radiohead fan at that-but this sounds more like crap that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I quite liked 'Kid A' and it grew on me.  But here I find only one or two (ahem...) 'songs' in any resonable sense of the word.  The rest is just bizarre but apparently it needs to be said again: just because it's strange or different doesn't make it good!  I'm all for moving forward, but if this is some sort of improvement in their musical progression I'm not seeing it.<br />'Pyramid Song' is great and one or two others.  The rest is a major let down.  Knowing Radiohead's supposed hatred of mass marketing and publicity, I would not put it past them to continue to release stuff like this just to see how long it takes for people to really criticize them.  They've been media darlings since 97, but if they continue on this course they will destroy any fanbase they once had.  People will just go back to playing the last 3 albums instead of bothering to buy the new stuff.  If they don't do something better next time they're gonna lose my interest...
6304118392|1.0|I've tried to watch this [film] several times, but the editing is so abominally bad that it  is a total a waste of time.<br />As anyone knows, the job of the film editor is to be invisible. This travesty is in-your -face- editing, obnoxious, obtrusive, amateurish. Add to that the total lack of talent from Woody, and the totally inept diection of Holywood's most over-rated director and you have one of the worst films to come out in the last 50 years.<br />The film industry should be ashamed to ever let this piece out if the can.
B00000I41J|5.0|A great disc by a great collection of musicians.  Cannonball often takes a side role-even as a leader-to the playing of others, specifically Miles Davis, yet the album has a warmth and atmosphere that are fully his.  'Autumn Leaves' is a stunner-beautiful and long with great solo work by all.  'Love for sale' is also very catchy-you will probably recognize the melody when you hear it.  I think the last track is supposed to be called 'Rangoon' but I'm not positive-it is 'Bangoon' on the back of the jewel case.  A great introduction to Adderley's work.  Highly Recommended.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|So-called reality TV (actually very contrived TV but with non-professionals in front of the camera - some might add also behind the camera) is a very sad and uninspired entertainment cycle which relies upon the exploitation of all that is unpleasant and unattractive in humanity.  The film \\"Series Seven\\" brilliantly captures this sadistic aspect of voyeurism, but in 1976 \\"Network\\" predicted it all.<br />This is truly one of the very best films of the 1970s.  Every performance is flawless, the script is fascinating, the direction sure-footed enough to contain what could in lesser hands become a campy hysteria.  Every character except Holden's and Finch's is ruthless to the point of inhumanity - especially the cold Dunaway (whose evil delivery of her final line in the film is one of the most shocking and even chilling moments in cinema history).<br />I've always believed that comedy - especially when it is this black - can provide the most cutting insight into human nature.<br />This is a perfect film.
B00005NW02|5.0|Just when it seemed I was going to have to give up my love for rock and follow all the hip-hoppers, I found System of a Down. This second album from the band has so much to offer. With the definate Middle-Eastern thing going on, it makes the album so much better. This is a very good choice for anyone who is sick of all the washed up rockers of 2002. System, after delivering this to the fans, will be around for a while. Thnanks for a rocking album guys!

6300274187|5.0|Hello all! A great classic starring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, English nanny and helpful chimney sweeper extrodinaire-by the way, despite what the dictionary says, supercalifragilistic-expealidotious, means to expidite, to go fast. Anyway this is a timeless classic, and it was aired on Disney's ABC-Sunday night for the first time in probably twenty years, shown on television that is! A spoonful of sugar is probably about cough syrup, but back then I believe it was either castor oil or cod liver oil!YUCHHHH! This movie must be seen to be beleived and if you have the time, watch as Mary Poppins floats down on the town in a dirty black smock and a black umbrella, and gets herself a job as a clean the kids room type nanny! A wonderful and expediantly timed film!-Thank you dear childre-Love Mary Poppins(Garry Hixon)-POOF!_bye
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Starring Peter Mullan, David Caruso, Josh Lucas, Brendan Sexton III, Steve Gevedon, and Paul Guilfoyle. Written by Brad Anderson & Steve Gevedon. Directed by Brad Anderson. Shot in the real-life abandoned Danvers mental hospital near Boston (most of what you see in the movie is as the crew found it).<br />SESSION 9 is one the most horrifying movies of 2001, and it's not even technically a horror film--at least, not as many people understand horror to be. In other words, there are no mask-wearing psychos or ghosts that jump out and yell \\"Boo!\\" The film works on the psychological level, taking you into the darkest recesses of the characters' minds as it takes you into the darkest recesses of the Danvers Hospital. That's true horror, because few things are more terrifying than what the human mind can conjure up, or what it's capable of under duress. As a result, even the stock genre devices--the character who wears headphones when he shouldn't; the generator running out of power at the wrong time--have their intended effect, because they seem genuine in the context of the story. The conclusion is somewhat confusing, but most of the pieces do fall into place upon reflection.<br />The script doesn't rule out a supernatural dimension to the story, but neither is it necessarily present. Everything in the movie has a plausible explanation. Whether something otherworldly is happening is left to the audience to decide, and that's part of the fun...and if you find yourself scoffing at the premise once the film is done, note that the story is inspired by a true incident that occurred in Boston several years ago.
6304401132|5.0|This movie is great, a lot of fun. What's weird is all her life they keep sharp things away from her, so when she's 16 she doesn't die by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel, and of course on her sweet 16th birthday, she's sewing on the wheel and bam! she cuts herself, and dies. The prince has to make it through a gnarly maze of thorns miles wide to find her though, and slay the dragon, but he makes it. A truly kind of ignored movie though, which is sad, I guess Aurora never could compete with snow white and Cinderella, definetely the most colorful of the sleeping beauty/snow white/cinderella trilogy though, George Lucas would be proud-Thank you Walt Disney for another timeless classic, and thank you Mr Michael Eisner for keeping it dust free-love Aurora(Garry Hixon)-enjoy children!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I thought it was a good movie,yeah a bit silly at times,but it was a love story.It looked alot like the war movies form back in the day.The special effects were really good and the southern accents were the best I have heard in years.It is just a movie,not a Documentary.Get over it.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Okay, first there was Donna Summer: THE QUEEN OF DISCO. Then there was Gloria Estefan's foray into dance music with GLORIA! (Hence she is the modern day Queen of Dance). Then there is Jamiroquai's A FUNK ODYSSEY:  a absolute fantastic trip into the retro world of Disco. Then Cher tries her hand at dance with BELIEVE and then solidifing her place in the dance world with LIVING PROOF. Then all of a sudden this tiny Aussie named Kylie decides to break into the American dance scene with FEVER. And she does!!!<BR>FEVER does what any good dance cd does, it grooves!!! I could not help and dance (or at least move a little) to every single song. I CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD is, right now, running through my head. The entire cd is fantastic. There is at least one song that slows down, but not for too long. Also Kylie is a knock out. Her body is as hot as this cd. She has blossomed into something mature, fantastic and sexy. <check out the video for the first single--what a body!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!><BR>If you like to dance and enjoy any or all of the cds mentioned in the opening of my review; go out and get FEVER. It is hot, hot, HOT!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Geez people.Even if you think you are too good for big movie blockbuster is have a little respect for the whole basis of the movie.It's just wrong the way you look at the big picture.Thousands of people died.It was the start of the biggest war in the history of the world.So have a little pride,but more importantly a litle heart.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Whats wrong with Hot hot hot!? Just because it's not depressing dosent make it bad.The lyrics are psycho, and just something about it gets me in a good mood,its one of my favorite cure songs. Anyway, this is a great album, i cant find any bad songs and there is alot of them. one reason i think this is such a great album is because i think its one of robert smiths best vocal performances. Like on disentigration, i liked the other insterments better. not that his voice is not good on other albums, i think it just really shines here.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This just in.....Michael Bay could not direct traffic,more a less a &quot;historical epic&quot;.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Our whole family loves these shows, except Grandma who gets too nervous at the impending disasters so she has to distract herself with a magazine. The rest of us are laughing so hard we cry. We are glad to be able to watch these whenever we wish, and there are enough episodes that we haven't tired of them. We overdosed on them for about two weeks. Now we pull one out once every few weeks or so. Though we are all adults we feel like small children with a well-worn favorite video.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This is a very good film with Amazing special effects,I have heard so much bad press about it,that it's not as it happened,but it's a very good film so who cares if it's not strictly 100 percent accurate,Im sure that no film like that is,They had to make it passable as a film and not just another war series or something like that.Top film
B00000AD94|4.0|If you're like me, you'll be bored of all this \\"neo-prog renaissance\\" hype nonsense. Bands like Radiohead, Muse, Tool, Grandaddy and the Flaming Lips have chopped off all of prog's excess baggage and stuffy concepts and created a new style of streamlined progressive music...who needs middle-aged fishermen smelling of patchouli trying to literally revive the hippie-dippie elves and goblins ... that went off the deep end in the mid-70's? I must admit Transatlantic left me feeling cold, its dodgy cover tunes and over-the-top excesses were contrived as hell. I'd given prog up for dead.<br />But Spock's Beard are so much more than the usual band of tedious revivalists. The reason? MUSIC. This album is absolutely chock full of catchy vocal lines, fantastic riffs and wonderful tunes - all experimental enough to be prog and yet never ever EVER becoming *difficult*. Anyone who doesn't like this should just go back to their original \\"Tarkus\\" vinyl issues and their Dungeons & Dragons collectible dice games. This is a glorious album, delivered with knowing smiles by a band (come on, the Spanish acoustic bits on the title track are so enjoyable it hurts) too clever to fall into the usual prog traps of trying to please all the warlocks all of the time.<br />Sure it's not a perfect album, and the band are clearly re-treading ground already covered by Yes, Genesis and King Crimson, but who the hell cares? Spock's Beard true genius lies in their refusal to take themselves too seriously - \\"I am the catfish man!\\" roars their singer, but you can laugh with him at the same time as humming his tunes all the way home. An enjoyable, beautiful, pivotal album which will please the Classic Rock readers just as much as it will please the young kids who've gotten hooked on genuinely good 60s/70s prog.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a great movie.The love story was very good and Josh Hartnet and Ben Affleck made it even better.Maybe next time you wanna dis on a good movie like Pearl Harbor you should make sure you spell things like 'Oaklahoma' correct.Why would you not know how to spell Oaklahoma?.Sorry I just had to point this out.
B00005QK5X|5.0|This is an extensive collection of early Wipers, a Seattle area band that influenced more &quot;alternative&quot; bands than you would think.  Is This Real? starts us off with a raw, melodic, punk-pop sound, reminiscent of the era in which it was originally released.  Tracks like Mystery, Tragedy, and the title track are short, catchy, rock nuggets.<br />On Youth of America, Greg Sage reverses the trend of short, jumpy, new wave, style tunes, in favor of long, long, long sonic pieces.  Remarkably, this approach works.  Sage injects his work with power, melody, and a meticulous blend of studio techniques and sound experiments that hold the listener's interest.  Even more remarkably, after listening to the 10 minute plus title track, I immediately wanted to hear it again!  Sage really pushed the envelope when making Youth of America.  He planted the seeds of influence that I hear in the work of Nirvana, and especially Sonic Youth.<br />Over The Edge takes the best of the previous two works and brings it all together.  The title track, and the first single, Romeo especially demonstrate this, although the entire set is rock solid.  The bonus tracks add significantly to the collection, for a memorable, and historic look at one of the pioneers of the post-punk sound.  All fans of rock music from the late 70's, early 80's, and on up to the present should get this.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|.....after all, this is a LIVE concert which captured quite accurately the energy that happens during Sade's concerts.  Yes, there is a crowd, what a concept!  As for the band and the performances, Sade is \\"the Queen of Cool\\" and her band the Royal Court of Badness!! <br />My only complaint is that the disc serves as a teaser for the DVD, which I can't wait to buy, and guess what folks...its going to have crowd noise AND crowd shots.<br />What are people looking for anyway?  If you don't want crowd noise, the solution is simple...buy a studio version of Lover's Rock!!<br />Buy this disc and you'll have a slice of heaven without being there....to the critics: you can't possibly call yourselves fans!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|PET SOUNDS is my all-time favorite album: the soundtrack to my teenage years, and the one piece of pop music, more than any other, which has rescued, comforted, amazed, and inspired me above all others. I can safely say that at times it seems as if the group's early work existed merely to get me ready to hear this. All of the production and arranging tricks that Brian Wilson used so well on the group's best-known hits are employed to full effect here. The result is an astoundingly deep emotional song cycle. <BR>It's wistful, sad, tender, nostalgic, hopeful, joyful, spiritual all at once. An amazing album, beautifully written, arranged and sung. <BR>This new CD pairs the original mono release with a new stereo mix. After wearing out three vinyl copies of the mono album, it was hard for me to believe that I could actually hear anything new in a &quot;new&quot; PET SOUNDS, but the stereo mix reveals musical nuances which will surprise even the most diehard Beach Boys-Brian Wilson fan.
B00000DI06|5.0|Since 9-11 we are all in need of consolation and reassurance.  John Rutter's lovely &quot;Requiem&quot; will provide solace for everyone; his music is universally appealing and will please all,  not just  those with advanced musical training or  highly discerning ears.  Lyrically beautiful, and filled with the interesting harmonies of British music of the modern period,  the piece will soothe your soul.  I often play it in the evening when it smooths away even the most trying day.
B000000H57|5.0|With the release of this disc in 1996, Type O Negative crossed the threshold from being a cult band listened to by Goth teens to annoy their parents, to a thoughtful, talented hard rock group poised on the brink of commercial success.  Peter Steele had it in him all along; and those of us who had been waiting for these bad boys from NYC to grow up were awed and thrilled by the power, depth and downright beauty of October Rust.  How good is this CD?  It's one of the handful of CDs I'd grab as I ran out of my burning house, or would take with me if about to be marooned on the proverbial desert island.<br />There are so many highlights on this disc, you'd never finish reading this review if I tried to list them all.  But any discussion of the best tracks has to begin with \\"Love You To Death,\\" without a doubt Type O Negative's signature song and the best track they've ever recorded.  This song will conjure up vivid mental images as Steele's brilliant lyrics paint a picture of willing subservience to your female lover, with 100 candles burning and black lipstick staining her glass of red wine.  The basic but beautifully haunting piano, backed by deliciously heavy guitar riffs and ethereal backing vocals, make this song a true masterpiece...the Goth national anthem, but equally enjoyable by mainstream listeners.<br />Other instant TON classics include \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend,\\" about living every man's dream; and \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", Type O's version of the Neil Young song.  Both of these are the type of radio-friendly track that many thought TON would never record; but both are excellent, and their strategic placement among the other tracks on the album is perfect.  \\"Green Man,\\" \\"Burnt Flowers Fallen\\" and \\"Be My Druidess\\" are solid songs, all having an almost power-pop quality.  <br />Two songs that are brilliant, yet a bit scary and depressing, are \\"Die With Me\\" and \\"Red Water (Christmas Mourning)\\".  These tracks are good showcases of Peter Steele's talent, as his incredibly deep, unique voice compels you to actually feel his sadness for a girlfriend who is going away, and family members who are no longer with him on Christmas (and whom, you strongly suspect, the singer of the song might have killed).<br />You always get your money's worth on a TON CD, as they tend to go the full 80 minutes, and it's quality stuff, not just filler.  But what sets October Rust apart from all other CDs is its thunderous conclusion, as you get almost 20 minutes of lyrical and musical perfection with the back-to-back tracks \\"Wolf Moon\\" and \\"Haunted.\\"  The mandolin-tinged notes of \\"Wolf Moon\\", with beautiful cello injections, lead into provocative lyrics about wolves in the night, with slight hints about menstruation (if you can believe that).  And the final track, \\"Haunted\\", is one of the most memorable recordings ever made.  Though not designed for commercial success, \\"Haunted\\" holds your undivided attention through more than 10 minutes of unique musical effects, including spoken poetry, highlighted by lovely, haunting piano notes reminiscent of \\"Love You To Death\\".  You'll again succumb to mental pictures of the undead roaming the night, rejoicing in their time under the stars...until morning's cold light chases them back to the crypts and caves from whence they came.  \\"I hate the morning\\", sings Steele...in only the way that things cursed to shun the light of the sun can hate the morning.<br />\\"October Rust\\" is a masterpiece...without this album, no collection of rock music is truly complete.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Now, I loves me some Ricky Martin &amp; J.Lo does her thing, but watch out...  There's a new Latin king in town!  This album is incredible.  Every track from A to Z is sooo good!  I think they all have that potential radio-friendly quality going.  With every song you can just place yourself in clubs &amp; at the gym &amp; on a road trip.  It's just an awesome album!  And what a step up from his 1st English-language album.
B00005NW02|2.0|I may have enjoyed this album, had i been 14 years old or deaf. Strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like, #1 his voice is very annoying from the get go, where are they going with this garbage.Its been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metal/music that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnt,i dont think this genre will be pop  much longer.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie was the most amazing movie ever. I own it and i keep it safe and no one touches it besides me, I thought ewan/obi wan was great in the movie..i loved the lightsaber battles to, and you gotta love the make up of darth maul.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|angelina jolie as always been my favorite actress..untill this movie came out..she has been my heroine. She was the most beatiful woman I have ever seen in my entire life in this movie. I couldnt take my eyes off her. I so wish i was married to her and i wish she could see this review. Well i own every single one of her movies.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The first twenty minutes of this movie made me wonder why the reviews had been so horrible when it came out. Then I saw the next two hours.<br />Argh...<br />There are certain elements put forth by Plato thousands of years ago about how good plays (and by extension, movies) should be structured. A.I. broke most of these rules.<br />1.) \\"No character or action is superfluous.\\" In A.I. wonderful interesting intriguing characters are introduced then immediately removed form the movie. Why offer David a nannybot then have her distroyed at a flesh fair? What happened to the scientist who tried to buy David out of slavery? Why did David's creator finally meet him, give him hope for a new family only to NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN WITHOUT EXPLANATION AS TO WHERE HE WENT?!?!??! Why show David repeat \\"Please make me a real boy\\" about a billion times in four interminable minutes (it was like the end of \\"Poltergeist III\\" after that girl died and the director had to do something to cover up her obvious not-coming-to-work-ever-again so charatcers ran around for 20 minutes yelling \\"Carol Ann!\\" without ANY other dialogue!)??<br />2.) \\"Brevity of time and place.\\" Whereas in a quest there hero can roam about for some time and finally get to his destination, a 2000 year jump forward in time in the last twenty minues was unnecessary and added more confusion to an already murky plot.<br />3.) \\"Reasonably assume the audience knows something and can infer the rest.\\" What the heck happened to the humans and why was there an Ice Age? How did the supermachines evolve? Why was it necessary to radically alter the entire world in order to have a happy ending?  Why not have a sad ending?<br />4.) \\"All conflicts must be resolved.\\" Whatever happened to Joe? He was charged with murder we assume but whatever became of that? I guess the impending Ice Age made follow-through unnecessary. Shouldn't David have had the chance to confront his family (particularly his jealous brother) with the knowledge he gainedfrom his quest? I mean, that is the point, ins't it? A hero learns something mere mortals don't, then return to make life better for norms.  The leftover brotherly angst was more distressing than anything.<br />5.) \\"Unity of plot.\\" Yeah, there were like three different stories going on here, and I think I like the cynical, existentially burdened one better than the over-the-top, deus-ex-machina, We're-a-superior-being-so-step-back-enjoy-the-light-show-while-we-solve-everything, Speilberg-esque ending (Don't get me wrong: it worked in ET and Close Encounters and even in The Color Purple after a fashion, but not here).<br />Darn. And the first twenty minutes were so great.

B00003CXXP|5.0|an absolute masterpiece.....i could not budge from my chair... what a journey of pure love this boy/bot goes on...words cannot do it justice! the film runs the full gamut of emotions...the visuals, of course, are the best ever...haley joel osmant should be handed the oscar singlehandedly...yet not even a nomination! this work ranks with spielberg's best...from e.t. to empire of the sun..to the color purple..to schindler's list! i defy you to walk away from the final 20 minutes of &quot;a.i&quot; unmoved...it is an absolute beauty...and in the years to come, it too, will be a film to measure all others by!  bravo, again, mr. spielberg..and thank you for making our lives richer with your film.

B000000OQF|5.0|Albums just don't get any bigger than this. Ever.<br />From W.Axl Rose's banshee wail introduction to \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", through to the final notes of \\"Rocket Queen\\", this album takes listeners on a rollercoaster ride through the Gunners' sleazy world of heroin, whores, and hell raising. With this album, the band grabbed the 80s LA glam rock scene by the throat, and beat a 70s punk rock attitude into it. And the rock world just lapped it up.<br />This album invokes memories of drunken teenage parties, wild headbanging, and over-the-top air guitar solos.<br />Released in 1987, this album really took off in 1988 and 1989. It seemed rock fans were sick of the over-produced, polished pop-rock of Def Leppard and the pretty boy posing of Bon Jovi. Guns n Roses offered a harder edged alternative.<br />W. Axl Rose played the part of schizoid screw-loose frontman to perfection, equal parts tortured artist, runaway lost soul, and megalomaniac egotist. His vocal style was theatrical, yet hard edged. Just compare the wailing of \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" and the almost croaky drawl of \\"Mr Brownstone\\".<br />Slash, resplendent in a top hat and curly black mane which covered his eyes, let rip with his unique lead guitar style all over every track. His is no techno-guitar fest style, sacrificing feeling for the number of notes which can be jammed into a bar. The introduction to \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" remains one of the most memorable solos of all time.<br />And what of the rest of the band? Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin' was always destined to live in Slash's shadow, yet he provided much of the grunt which separated this band from the pop pretenders. Drummer Steven Adler took the sex, drugs and rock n roll lifestyle too far, with drug addiction eventually seeing him out of the band. Duff McKagan was the big punk fan of the band, and the major musical contributor. His role in the band has always been under rated.<br />And the music? There are no bad songs on this album. \\"Paradise City\\" is a good times rocker, which builds in tempo to a maniacal crescendo. \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Night Train\\" and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" are all straight forward rockers. \\"Anything Goes\\" is an ode to sleazy sex, while \\"My Michelle\\" is dedicated to wasted youth. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" is a power ballad extraordinaire, featuring the band's best all-round performance, with heartfelt lyrics, sensitive vocals, and wailing guitar solos.<br />This was the defining album of an era. It was the peak performance of the LA glam rock scene. It was never bettered by this band nor any other from that scene.
B00005B58Y|2.0|I found this release to be to saxaphone/Coltrane heavy.  There seems to be Coltrane blowing at every moment.  I love Coltrane, but I bought this album expecting more of the delicate, intricate work that had been recorded before with the Miles Davis Quintet and I was some-what disappointed.  Buy Relaxin' or Workin' instead
0380778556|5.0|This book has to be one of the greatest books i'll ever read. My mother recommended me this book, and nagged me forever to read it. I finally did read it and finished in 4 days. I simply could not put it down! The plot was fabulous with many twists and turns. I was surprised by every chapter. This book I will certainly recommend to those around me and i recommend it to anyone. This book is highly enjoyable and simply wonderful. One of the best books i will ever read.
B000022TSW|5.0|Although not a highest-grossing film of the year, this movie was a surprise success when it was released. It has caused people like the writers of the Simpsons to reconsider making an animated feature film of Homer and the rest.<br />On the surface this is not much more than a long episode on South Park with slightly better effects. But under the hood they developed a lot of technology to create the film, and it has definitly smoothed the process for the show's production.<br />As for the plot, I'm sure it's been discussed to death, but I will say that the quality of the movie is at it's best! Terrance and Phillip (my favorite characters) play a starrng role, and the show wastes absolutely no time trying to explain to the audience who such-and-such is (except for a small blurb about Ike being Canadian). All of our favorite characters are in it, without it being a showcase. And of course, since it's a feature film, it's much more irreverent than what's on the public airwaves. But again, it's not a giant excuse to offend you. It's all done consistently and it remains hilarious.<br />Finally, as usual, Trey Parker is given full writing credits since he's usually the one that ends up physically typing the script. But like always the show is a full collaborative process between Parker and Stone. At least, this is what they publicly admit :).
B00003CXI1|5.0|After reading and loving the books I had to see the movie. I was definately not disapointed! I very much enjoyed the movie and went back to see it 6 times. The characters coming to life in front of you entraces you every moment. This movie will go down as a classic for sure and will be remember just as the books. A worthy buy.
B00000K0DV|3.0|NEW YORK RIPPER is Lucio Fulci's 'odd man out' film of his gore stint between ZOMBIE and THE BEYOND. Part Italian crime drama, part paint-by-numbers giallo, NEW YORK RIPPER is effective for  being a precursor to the superior Bill Lustig film, MANIAC. The story is relatively simple and if you read the other customer reviews, you can get the jist. I enjoy this film a great deal-my reason being is that NEW YORK RIPPER lies somewhere between the seediness of a Jess Franco film and the sleaziness and misogyny of Joe D'Amato, although some (gasp) XXX scenes would have made this a sick flick. Which is a good thing. The ending is understandable but still remains as that makes one say 'huh' to themselves...
B00003CXXP|4.0|Spielberg had a masterpiece in his hands and let it slip away.  There seems to be a common thread in his work that he only rarely eludes, and that is the instinct to play Father with the audience.<br />So often in his films, he can't help himself jumping in and reassuring the audience that everything is ok, or over explain a point.  This ultimately cheats the audience of discovery. <br />In the otherwise excellent `Flesh Fair' scene, why introduce the characters of the Father and little Girl?  It would have been a much stronger scene without them. They are there only to provide relief. `David' could have been `discovered' in a much rougher manner, and could have escaped in the riot that ensued. <br />All of the voice over and sub-titles could be cut, as well as the scene with `David' and the evolved Meca at the end of the film. We already have all of that information. Spielberg can't stop himself from reassuring the audience about the Mother dieing after only one day. The scene of `David' saying good night to his Mother with the pullback and fade out, or of the long shot of the Underwater Vehicle with David praying to the Blue Fairy followed by the shot of the frozen water and the Transport ship, should have been presented with no explanation. They would be much stronger.  The audience then has to think. How much better it would have been if we found out what was going on when the Blue Fairy says, \\"Your Mother died two thousand years ago.\\"  Spielberg robs us of that discovery by whacking us over the head. <br />I don't think he does it because he thinks we're stupid. He does it to `protect' us. Art can't be safe. He can go a lot farther than he lets himself go. The only film where he resisted (most of the time, although there were a few lapses) was `Schindlers List'. The obligation to represent the Holocaust correctly, overrode his paternal instinct.  It should happen more often in his fictions as well.

B00000IQC8|2.0|After seeing the rest of Kevin Smith's masterpieces, I was highly disappointed in this film.<br />Although I found it funny, a number of things turned me off.<br />Number 1 was the fact that the entire film is shot in black and white. I realize the K. Smith was probably trying for an artistic deviation from todays movies but it made the film harder to watch. The lack of color gave me a headache and I was ready to turn it off midway through the flick. It'd be different if the film was shot on the true, old, black and white cameras. These had definition, shades, and hues that can't be replicated. <BR>The cameras used in Clerks remind me of watching a cheap, fuzzy, security surveillance camera.<br />Number 2, except for the opening scenes, the director never takes the viewer outside of the mini-mart. I felt trapped in a convenient store, devoid of colors, for a long 90 minutes! I would've liked to see what was going on outside of the Quickiemart. <br />Number 3, there was no real plot, just a series of events. A day in the life of a clerk at a convenient store. Except for the man who passed away in the bathroom, this leads to a very boring motion picture. <br />This has to be my least favorite of Kevin Smith's films. Even Jay and Silent Bob, and their antics, couldn't save this flick. In my opinion, the director tried way too hard to make his film stand out amongst others. <br />If you're considering buying this movie, and you haven't seen it, I recommend that you rent it first!! It's hard to believe that this ...came from the mind of the director who wrote Dogma, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and SB Strike Back!
B00005U8EM|4.0|If ever there was a movie designed for DVD, it's &#34;Groundhog Day.&#34;  By repeating scenes, pausing the picture, even comparing portions of the movie to other parts, you get a sense that the movie is put together wonderfully.  Unfortunately, the additional features of this &#34;Special Edition&#34; do little to enhance the enjoyment of the movie.  The documentary, shot last year, is too little too late.  A &#34;making of&#34; PR movie from HBO or E! would have been more enjoyable.  The comments from director Harold Ramis fail to educate.  If you don't have the movie already, buy this one; however, if you already have the basic DVD that came out in 1997, save your money.<br /><br />This review is an update to a previous review of this movie that follows:<br /><br />While most viewers try to catch the number of times the scenes repeat themselves, this modern (within the last ten years) movie contains one of the classic scenes that can actually enrich ones life.<br /><br />In &#34;Groundhog Day,&#34; weatherman Phil Conners, played by actor Bill Murray, is locked in a time warp in which he seems destined to relive Groundhog Day, February 2nd, over and over again. The classic scene occurs after midnight, but before the bewitching hour of 6:00 a.m., when the day begins repeating itself.  It is the day when Phil has succeeded in convincing Rita, his producer, played by Annie MacDowell, that he is truly reliving this one day, again and again.<br /><br />As they lay platonically in bed, with Rita falling asleep, he begins to tell her what he should have told her the first time that he saw her, instead of being so self-absorbed that he couldn't see what she really was like (&#34;I think what I wanted to say was I think you are the kindest, sweetest, prettiest person I've ever met in my life. The first time I saw you, something happened to me that I never told you, but I wanted to hold you as hard as I could. I don't deserve someone like you, but if I ever could, I'm sure I would love you for the rest of my life&#34;).<br /><br />He awakes the next morning, without Rita by his side, but with a a new persona. Perhaps this change is because he was spurred on by Rita who told him the evening before, &#34;Maybe it's not a curse (referring to his reliving this day over and over), it's just how you look at it.&#34; Suddenly, forgotten are the days when Phil used his endless life to temp fate by living his life through the seven deadly sins, as he finds the joy of living each day to its fullest, learning to expand his purpose in life through helping others. Finally, he lives a Groundhog Day in which he becomes something of a local hero to many in the community, and Rita, realizing his inner beauty, buys his services at the bachelor charity auction. That night, they platonically fall asleep, again, with the true realization of each other's stellar inner qualities, and instead of waking-up on February 2nd, it's February 3rd. Together they begin to plan a life together with the realization that there is something more after today.<br /><br />Phil's final characterization of life can be depicted in the words he uses to describe the Groundhog Festival near the end of the movie. &#34;When Checkov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and beraf of hope, but we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But, standing here among the people of Punxsutawney, and basking here in the warmth of their hearts, I couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter.&#34;fe&#34;).

B00004XPOZ|4.0|Anyone who thinks that apparently, Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi will never be released widescreen will be proven wrong. Now that this Trilogy has been released in Widescreen Format, you have access to all four released STAR WARS movies in Widescreen. If you have a widescreen TV, this is recommended. The Star Wars films have all been updated from the original 1977, 1980, and 1983 releases. First off, there are new scenes that were never seen before in the actual film. Second of all, Lucas updated the Battle of Yavin and Hoth with effects that couldn't be done before. Third, the explosions have been updated with energy rings that weren't there before. Fourth, the Star Wars: A New Hope print has been cleaned up, actually \\"Better than the Theatrical Release\\". I only gave this package four stars because the scenes with Biggs Darklighter(Tatooine) from SW:ANH, the Hoth scene with the Snowtroopers getting clobbered by the Wampas in TESB, and the Sandstorm scene from ROTJ haven't been restored into this, or any for that case, release.<br />So, overall, getting these movies in this Widescreen Package is better than to get the package that can be found easily for 29.99. These are the only movies that are really needed in a \\"full\\" video library: Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.<br />BONUS: Comes with a 10-Minute Behind the Scenes Featurette on Star Wars: Episode II(Now known as Attack of the Clones.)<br />PS: For the last time, it's not \\"STAR WARS\\", it's A NEW HOPE or Star Wars: A New Hope. The Empire Strikes Back is not Part 2, it's Part 5, Return of the Jedi is Part 6, and A New Hope is Part 4. Then technically, it's not a \\"real\\" trilogy, because there are prequels.
B00005R8GU|4.0|In 1970, when I was visiting my brother in Maryland, a neighbor's son had this album and let me record it on reel-to-reel. For years I treasured the tape, then it deteriorated to dust; but, as luck had it, I found a copy of the LP in a used record bin.  I've gotten rid of over 600 LP's, but \\"Fathers and Sons\\" stayed with me for the last 10 years, along with a turntable to play it (and some quad records).  With the issuance of this CD last year, I can forget fretting about whether my album will play warped or not, and play this CD in the car, while cutting the grass, or when I want to lift the spirits of everyone in the room.<br />To say that this is \\"one hell of an album\\" is an understatement.  Most people like blues music, fewer people love it. Muddy Waters bridged the some of the walls that separate blues and pop with his energetic, lifting voice and wailing guitar.  If you have, or just listened to, the \\"Chess Set\\" or \\"Electric Mud\\" of Muddy Waters and you were disappointed, \\"Fathers and Sons\\" is the CD for you.  Recorded with some of the best players on the scene at the time:  Otis Spann (Piano) , Michael Bloomfield (Guitar), Paul Butterfield (Harmonica), Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn (Bass), Sam Lay (Drums), Buddy Miles (Drums on \\"Got My Mojo Working, Part Two), and others, in a Chicago Studio and live in concert at the Super Cosmic Joy-Scout Jamboree in Chicago (both over 4 days from April 21st to April 24th, 1969), the tunes have a faster tempo, a more uplifting style.  As for the tunes other than \\"Mojo,\\" Muddy's electric guitar sings the blues in ways that reminds us of his importance to British groups, such as \\"The Beatles\\" and \\"The Rolling Stones.\\"<br />There's not much more I can add to this review other than I dare anyone play \\"Got My Mojo Working\\"  on their stereo or in the car without inching up the volume and feeling great about the state of the world.  Enough said....Buy it!!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you are only able to get one cd for the Beatles and you couldn't get any others this would be the one to get. It has 27 songs on it. And all of them are grand and great. My favorite of course &quot;Hey Jude&quot; is here. And is a great satisfying number. Some people may complain that even these songs were successful, they aren't the bands best songs. I think some of them are though it is missing &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;OB-La-Di, OB-La-Da&quot;, &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, &quot;Back in The USSR&quot;, and some others. This cd is quite a collection though and a worthy start for a Beatles novice.<br />&quot;I want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot;,  <BR>&quot;Help&quot; , &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;All You need is Love&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Let it Be&quot;, and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are all worthy of getting and the best way to get them all (on one disc) is to buy this album. And no I didn't listen to the orginal mono versions. And no I truly will never understand the impact of that song on the older generation. But then how could I ever unless I lived during it. I do like the Beatles. And I think this is a fine showing of work that EMI put together. Buy this album today then get White Album as soon as possible. It's the next step for any Beatles fan.
B000053ZS6|4.0|Finally, the full European version of RELOAD is available on this side of the Atlantic!  For perhaps a year, I've been trying to get this version of RELOAD that has the Peppermint Jam Mix of \\"Sexbomb\\" on it, and my wait is over.  Having heard this cut on \\"Wright Around the World\\" on the BBC WorldService, I had searched high and low, Internet and otherwise, for this CD.  And while Amazon did list it, it never arrived.  Now, however, it ships in 24-hours.<br />Up until this expanded version arrived, I had to make due with the RELOAD that did not have \\"You Need Love Like I Do (Double Click Remix)\\" either.  Perhaps \\"make due\\" is too strong of a phrase for the tune selection, parnerships on duets and arrangements are first class.  Not all are true winners, otherwise the CD would be rated 5 stars, but six of the tunes are GREAT with \\"Burning Down the House (with the Cardigans),\\" \\"She Drives me Crazy (with Zucchero),\\" \\"Lust for Life (with the Predenders),\\" \\"Little Green Bag (with Barenaked Ladies)\\" and the aforementioned \\"Sexbomb (with Mousse T.)<br />If you have ever liked Tom Jones, and are looking for a good \\"dynamic\\" CD of covers with interesting duets, this is the CD for you.  Be sure to try to get the version with 19 tunes on it.

Norah takes everything at a snail's pace because she obviously still needs her training wheels. The voice is nice, but the songs are mostly empty, and the monotony of the mood and pace are deadly.

0800187873|5.0|This griity and grim mob flick, deftly directed by Mike Newell, is based upon the true story of FBI undercover, Joe Pistone, who. as his alter ego \\"Donnie Brasco\\", infiltrated the mob for a number of years, resulting in its eventual decimation. So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.<br />Here, Johnny Depp, plays the role of Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco. He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates. He is befriended by \\"Lefty\\" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino. Shifty and common, \\"Lefty\\" typifies your low level made guy, the guy on the fringes doing the dirty work, a real bottom feeder. He is the guy who does the hits, and he is the guy the higher ups look to whack when something goes wrong. It is not an enviable or glamourous life, as has been made out by other films, such as the \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\". The existence of \\"Lefty\\" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride.<br />\\"Lefty\\" takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him. He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a \\"made\\" guy. \\"Lefty\\" himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy. It soon becomes painfully obvious that that ain't gonna happen. One cannot help feel a little sorry for \\"Lefty\\", so limited is his world view and so at the mercy of others. Still, \\"Lefty\\" gives Donnie some invaluable lessons on mob etiquette. He also unburdens himself to Donnie, treating him as if he were his adopted son. The bond between the two men grows. As this happens, Donnie finds himself being pulled more and more into the world of mobsters, until his old and new reality begin to merge.<br />As he distances himself drom his wife (Anne Heche) and family, Brasco is thrust into a maelstrom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him. He tries to get \\"Lefty\\" to go straight and retire, in hope of avoiding his betrayal. It is to no avail. Brasco, in for a penny, in for a pound, now stands to become a \\"made\\" guy himself. It is only at the eleventh hour that an intervention set up by the FBI plays itself out, setting up the betrayal of \\"Lefty\\". It is a sad moment for Brasco, as he knows that \\"Lefty\\" has just been handed a death sentence at the hands of the mob for vouching for an FBI agent. It is Brasco's ultimate salvation, however, as he was on the brink of committing an unpardonable act, one in which he would have crossed the line and from which there would have been no turning back. It is a decision that was, luckily for him, taken out of his hands.<br />Al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film. Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize. Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent. All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.eatens to tear him apart and consume him.

B0000062Y2|2.0|I have the newest version of the Jesus Christ Superstar performance with Glenn Carter, and I must say that it's exceptionally better.  Even though it lacks \\"This Jesus Must Die\\" and a couple of other songs (which by the way I'm very mad about!), Mary Magdalene played by Renee Castle does SUCH a better job than the MM from the 1973 version!  Talk about one huge yawn!  Also, Ted Neely looks possessed in this film.  Sorry, but Glenn is so believable and Ted is just plain scary to me!  I think that the newer version is all around improved, and after seeing both films, let's just say that a newer version was quite in need.  I admire the originality of this film, but the 2000 version is much better.

0345440900|1.0|In the month after this book was released, the local hospital had to re-admit 8 newborn babies for &quot;failure to thrive&quot; - i.e., malnutrition. One of them died. All of the parents had read the book and followed its advice.<br />Your newborn needs breastmilk as often as he or she can get it - to limit a new life to a rigid 3 hour feeding schedule is ridiculous and dangerous.<br />Your baby is not a lump of clay. He or she needs to be stimulated when awake, not put in a corner and ignored for an hour after feeding. When they cry, they should be comforted, not forced to suffer through agony in the name of &quot;self-reliance.&quot; Yes, you should not make them dependent, but you need to treat them with kindness and respect, something this book seems to have very little of.<br />Yes, babies like routine, but it has to be a natural routine, arrived at after several months of experimentation, not forced upon you both like some immense rigid structure. Newborns have no systematic understanding of the world; you can not expect them to conform to anyone else's desires. Yes, of COURSE you should bathe and read to your baby before bed! That is age-old common sense: gradually develop a routine that will help your baby realize when the family goes to sleep at night. But you can not try to impose a structure on a newborn in 3 days, as this book suggests; you must give them time to adjust to life. You most certainly can not expect them to get hungry and sleepy only at nicely defined and pre-packaged 3 hour intervals. Your baby and you will find the right schedule, naturally, together, but not for many months. You can not rush this; it is as it should be, nothing more.<br />You are raising a human being, a person, who has feelings, needs, and wants. You should try to make them as happy as possible, to bring them into a loving and wonderful atmosphere. Yes, when they are 4 years old, they should mostly sleep by themselves. No, when they are newborn, they need your contact and love. This is their first experience in the world. Make it a good one.<br />The worst thing you do for your newborn baby is to read this book. While there is some common sense advice, there is much which is absolutely deadly. I'm sorry I'm not allowed to give it 0 stars. For the sake of your child, choose love and understanding, not some L.A. fad pop-psych over-hyped publicity-fueled totally clueless and irresponsible and DANGEROUS book. Good luck and love.
B00005YW4H|2.0|22? You bet. Real jazz artists take it slow for effect -- think Lady Day playing catch up to the beat or Jimmy Scott stretching meaning and melody until they nearly break. Norah takes everything at a snail's pace because she obviously still needs her training wheels. The voice is nice, but the songs are mostly empty, and the monotony of the mood and pace are deadly.

020530902X|5.0|My late father was a writer-journalist, and I wanted desperately to follow in his footsteps. He bought me &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; and told me that, along with a typewriter (this was the Dark Ages), it was all I would ever need.<br />He couldn't have known about the typewriter, but he was completely right about Strunk &amp; White's timeless classic. As a professional editor of long standing, it is one of my jobs to hire and train beginning writers and editors. It never ceases to appall me that bright young kids right out of some of the finest colleges have no sense of the written word--no sense of the most elemental grammar (one young hiree told me that my insistence on commas to set off dependent clauses was hopelessly old-fashioned; &quot;commas are out of style and are no longer used,&quot; he said).<br />I recommend &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; to these budding editors, and it never fails to help them. I also am not above dipping into it myself--OFTEN. It is probably the simplest, most elegant book on grammar and usage ever written, and it is as important today as it ever was, probably more so. I consider it a tool of the trade, and recommend it to anybody who uses language on a daily basis. And that's just about everybody!
B00005LMBK|4.0|I saw this CD in a local music store and decided to check it out because I was bored. If you're looking for a quick high, then this is it! This group mixes everything from rap, funk, and rock to produce a strange, funkadelic sound that really is unlike anything else I've ever heard. If you're tired of the usual mainstream stuff, then you owe it to yourself to get this CD.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I was not sure what to expect when I sat down to watch O Brother, in fact I expected to get bored with it and shut it off.  This is a not a run of the mill film, and I think what happened is they let a run of the mill marketing group handle the publicity for it.  It is really not a fugitive story, which is what everything from the cover to the commercials had me thinking.  This movie has good humor, a likeable story and great old-timey and gospel music (and I don't listen to either of those and still thought they were great).  The Siren Scene was my favorite.<br />There is only one fault I can find with this movie: The last scene in the old cabin in the valley was completely unnecessary for the story and I would have enjoyed this movie more without it.  We did not need to bring that plot line to a close, it was satisfying enough before.  I felt that the scene was a gratuitous excuse to throw in another song or draw the movie out another 5 minutes to meet some kind of quota.<br />One fault not withstanding, this one is a gem.  Definitely one to get.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Very long and for no good reason. The first half hour was OK with its human interaction but this soon ends and you have to sit through 1:50 minutes of robots and such to reach the finish line. At best Speilberg could have saved his movie and used a lot fewer special effects and  tryed to keep a far more interesting plot going. Its just another low budget screen play that relies on just the visual effects.
B00004T8RK|4.0|this is a very solid album intended 2 b listened 2 from start to finish. The album is somewhat lacking somewhere though. It doesnt have a almighty given 2 fly or alive, but thats ok, pearl jam are moving on and maturing. If music doesnt evolve it is pointless. I think of binural as one long track as each song contrasts with one another and it is great to listen to. The guitar riffs are not as good as previous songs and albums but still good, although of the girl is a great guitar song. Many of these songs especailly evacuation and grievance sound alot better live. If possible buy some pj bootlegs (pittsburg, lisborne, philladelphia are my picks). Dont buy this album looking for hit single material buy it for the musical experiance, the album as a whole. <br />Breakerfall - 7/10 a fast energetc punkish song great opener.<br />gods dice - 7/10 another fast punk song, reminds me of habbit.<br />evacuation - 6/10 one of the worse pj songs on the cd, although sounding much better live.<br />light years - 8/10 the second single from the cd, good stuff.<br />nothing as it seems - 9.5/10 the big pj single on the album very pink floydish.<br />thin air - 7.5/10 a love song by stone a very simple but catchy and memorable song. A good song for a beginer guitarist as it is basically E, C, E, C then a chorus of C, D, A.<br />insignificance - 9/10 - the most rockin song on the album with effective pauses.<br />of the girl - 9.5/10 - very much a groove song, awsome guitar stuff cool opener for the live shows 2.<br />grievance - 7/10- 9/10 live. Fast song but so much better live.<br />rival - 6/10- cool song but gets boring and tiresome, good lyrics though.<br />slight of hand - 10/10 the only real shiner that stands out by itself, as eddie says in the pittsburg song this song actually has a bit of musical experiance in. Very cool song.<br />soon forget - 4/10 - edd on his ukalalie (i have no idea how 2 spell that), kinda boring after a while<br />parting ways - 8/10 - sounds likea experamental song off vitolagy very cool though. Nice closer.<br />The album on a whole 7.5/10 defanatly not as good as vitolagy or yeild but still great, i cant wait for the next cd. If you are are new pearl jam fan though buy the pittsburg bootleg or any bootleg with alive on. Also the albums TEN and vitolagy.
6302797535|5.0|Everything great about this movie has already been said so I don't need to repeat it here.  As my favorite movie ever, I've seen it literally a few hundred times and have become one of those people that annoyingly say the lines right before the great actors deliver them.  Now, about that missing scene:  I don't know about the DVD version, I haven't seen it, but as far as the video goes, it is missing a great scene at the end where all the detectives are leaving the Twain mansion.  In this scene, Wang's car is in the front, and stops at another car approaching from the other direction.  This car has none other than Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in a cameo!  Watson asks for directions to Twain's mansion, which Wang gives him.   Adopted son Willie asks \\"Gee pop, why didn't you tell him it was a rip off?\\"  Wang responds with a grin: \\"Let idiots find out for themselves.\\"  This scene was included on the TV broadcast version from maybe 20 years ago or so (bad print but the scene is included).  Why it is deleted from the video is a mystery to me and is unfortunate for fellow fans of this movie.
B00005OM4N|4.0|OK, so Britney has changed styles. It seems now she's gone from pop queen to raunch queen...and I think she pulls it off well. The tracks on this album are more varied in musical style, the lyrics are less sugary, and overall it's good. On the one hand you have RnB-like dancey tracks like \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Boys\\", and on the other you have \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"Anticipating\\". This makes it more balanced and much easier to listen to (rather than her earlier albums where you were aurally saturated by pop). Of course, the lyrics are still shallow so if you're the deep-thinker type this album should be avoided. Otherwise, it's nice to listen to, nice to dance to... and, well, nice.
0345440803|5.0|Tracy Hogg has given us yet another gem. If you, like myself, have found yourself beating your head against the wall where your toddler is concerned, you should do yourself a favor and splurge on this book. In the first &quot;Baby Whisperer&quot; book, Tracy taught us how to respect our infants without surrendering our parental control, and gave us simple acronyms (E.A.S.Y., S.L.O.W.)to remind us of her helpful advice. In her &quot;toddler&quot; edition, she uses the same method. Is your toddler refusing to potty train or play with other kids? What about dinner time- do you dread the constant fight over getting the kids to eat their veggies? Tracy gives helpful hints to overcome common toddler struggles, all the while encouraging us to praise our kids and give them the structure they need and, oddly enough, desire. Other topics are discussed, such as food allergies, kids who won't seem to talk, air travel do's and don'ts, the 12 ingredients of conscious discipline, typical or chronic sleep problems, and how to help your toddler deal with a new &quot;intruder&quot; in the form of his/her new baby sibling. Never has applying practical advice been presented in such an easy-to-follow fashion.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|His first album wasn't really too good, but this one definitely is. Enrique is definitely a romantic crooner, as is obvious by his excellent rendition of the song 'Hero'. Although he does sound weird doing fast songs, I don't think he should stop singing them. His slow, sentimental style adds a unique edge to dance music. Among my favourites are 'Escape', 'Love to see You Cry' and 'One Night Stand' and of course 'Hero' (although it sounds WAY better in Spanish). Overall, this is an album where all the tracks are solid rather than one being spectacular and the rest filler material. It's a good buy.
0783117523|3.0|I'm a sucker for a pretty face, so wanted to see this because Gia was so beautiful. Angelina Jolie isn't quite as beautiful, but certainly attractive. As tabloid readers know, Jolie is an emotional wreck of a person, so that's probably why she plays this role so effectively! One of my boyhood friends played the small part of Gia's girl friend's boy friend. Hey, Reggie, it was fun to see you on the screen! Wish the part had been bigger! Anyway, the movie kind of dragged. But I love beautiful women, so I liked looking at the movie for that alone.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Savage Garden is one of the few acts such as Jewel who sing with sincerity and on larger issues rather than just &quot;She broke my heart, boo hoo hoo&quot;. The sweet ballads like 'I Knew I Loved You' and 'You Can Still be Free' are balanced by the infectious 'Animal Song', 'Chained To You', etc. This is a great album which I always listen to.
B00005IC2H|4.0|I must agree with one of the reviewer here, Sigur Ros does sound like a crossover between Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emperor, (thats the only reson i didnt rate it 5 stars), but i dont consider this a major flaw or a bad thing. It just prove that Sigur Ros is a now a powerfull band that will one day, once they find their real unique sound identity, will become a phenomenal band... Their music is sublime and delicate, yet powerfull in the emotions it creates... If you are fans of Radiohead, GYBE, Mogwai, it is almost impossible that this cd will deceive you... Enjoy...
B00005R2M3|4.0|This Latin lady is definitely going to take the world by storm...or at least, the musically refined world by storm :)<BR>This is a brilliant album. Full stop. My favourite tracks are 'Fool' (sentimental, but rocky), 'Objection' (One word: tango), 'Whenever, Wherever' (One word: flutes), and 'Ojos Asi' (the Middle Eastern style is fantastic). I haven't heard any of her earlier albums, so I don't really know if she lost anything in the crossover. But that makes me impartial, and this impartial reviewer says this album is HOT.
B00005NNT1|5.0|I was a little kid when this movie first hit the theaters. I was fascinated by it then and I am fascinated anew as I watch it on videotape. My 3-year-old granddaughter often asks to see it. She sits through every viewing with the happy involvement and enthusiasm of a first-timer. &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; doesn't have the visual sharpness and depth of color we see in contemporary cartoons and the heroine's singing voice is not likely to be emulated by very many youngsters, but the film stands up beautifully as a source of innocent entertainment and probably will continue to do so far into the future.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I've seen this movie twice, and I love it!  It's pretty ridiculous, and I think that's what makes it funny.  Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and especially Will Ferrel are all brilliant and hilarious in their roles.  I did have one qualm though:  I heard that VH-1 decided to digitally erase shots of the World Trade Center in light of September 11th, even though this movie was made long before that.  I do realize that they had their hearts in the right place, but I'd rather just have the movie the way it was made, without any post-theater, pre-dvd editing done to the movie.  I recognize the fact that the shots of the world trade center last just seconds, and that their removal doesn't really affect the movie...or does it?  I don't know, but I think that if a movie is realeased on dvd, it should be unaltered, just for the sake of art...or whatever.  Anyway, I don't know this for a fact -- I just read it somewhere.  If anyone else hears or sees anything about this, let everyone else know.  Other than that, it was awesome movie and dvd!  Worth buying!
0590259385|2.0|My children did not enjoy this book as much as I thought they might.  The illustrations are darker, mute tones... not a lot of curb appeal.  I was not too impressed with the story itself.
B0000508U6|5.0|Now THIS is good stuff! Nothing like the nice soothing sound of British rock to save us from heavy Creed/Linkin Park grungy angst infestation.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I think people have terribly misunderstood this film.  This is not a film meant to be totally realistic. Watch it from start to finish, it's a fairy tale, it's a modern Pinocchio.  The audience who wants something based totally in reality need not watch this movie.  A.I. is a fairy tale at heart.  At the same time it is a dark and disturbing fairy tale that tried to point at our society and say &quot;look what can become of us.&quot;  It's a fairy tale with a point and worth a good look.<BR>A.I. is wondefully made and acted from start to finish.  Sit down and enjoy this story of the journey to be loved, which in a way is what everyone wants.  Steven Spielberg boldly took this movie and came out with a masterpiece.  He created a dark but beautiful film well made from acting to the photography.  Everything about A.I. is first rate.  Set aside the realism of current movies and watch a fairy tale; be drawn into a futuristic world where anything can happen.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Well done.  I'm looking for \\"The Look Of Love, Vol. 2\\".  What many refer to as the elevator or Muzak type of sound I just so happen to enjoy.  I not too long ago discovered Bossa Nova, starting with one of one of the masters, Mr. Jobim.  I finally caught \\"The Wave\\" and have been surfing along ever since.  With all of the loud, blaring music we've seen over the past couple decades, it is nice to hear a popular artist step back and just simply peform something beauiful.  If you would like to sit back and enjoy a nice piece of work (with strings included). then I would recommend it.  It may not suit the jazz purist, but I don't think that was the goal.  Though the average rating might not be that high, for some reason it is one of the top sellers in the jazz category...it just might be worth your while.
B000002BUY|3.0|This is back from the experimental days of the now awesome band, Incubus. Their music is quite innovative, and on this album, they merely experiment with sounds and musical ideas, which they would only perfect on their later albums like \\"Make Yourself\\" and \\"Morning View\\".<br />So obviously, the resulting collection of songs they produced here is a mix of hits and misses. So there is a lot of fun to be found in this experimental work, amongst the stuff that just doesn't work.<BR>Here's a guide based on my opinions:<br /> Redefine - 10/10 - really catchy, good mix of guitars and weird sounds, and a unique melody<br /> Vitamin - 10/10 - this is a very good intensity building song, and has a cool riff.<br /> New Skin - 10/10 - classic. They hit the nail on the head with this one.<br /> Idiot Box - 6.5/10 - starts out quite unique yet musical, but loses interest about a minute into the song<br /> Glass - 6/10 - an effort at the same, but doesn't really stand out<br /> Magic Medicine - 4/10 - this is a bunch of weird sounds and bass that comes off as pointless and dull<br /> Certain Shade of Green - 9/10 - Not one of the best, but definately fun!!<br /> Favorite Things - 10/10 - I love this song.<br /> Summer Romance - 5/10 - their attempt at a more laid back song. Quite weak IMO.<br /> Nebula - 7/10 - Interesting. Not very /good/, but interesting.<br /> Deep Inside - 8/10 - cool funky stuff<br /> Calgone - 7/10 - ya. The definitive song of this album. It's just experimenting really, with strange sounds, unusual applications of heavy guitars, funky basslines, scratching and weirdness. It starts off as an almost-song, then goes off into a long, weird sounding jam of this style of music, quickly changing and shifting, trying out many different ideas through its meandering 16 minute length. It doesn't really have any memorable musical moments, and it has no real focus. Still an entertaining diversion.<br />All in all, for a new Incubus fan like me, it is interesting to lookback at this work, from before they have fully developed their sound. It is a truly fascinating experience and i enjoy listening to most of it, even the cuts that aren't the greatest!<BR>I just don't believe it'll have the staying power of the musically mature albums that followed. I'm quite sure i'll get sick of this really quickly. (Except for the occasional awesome tune like Vitamin).<br />But i'll mostly stick to their more musically complex, brilliantly crafted, mature new stuff.
B000002H72|5.0|Get this thing ASAP. A rock gem from start to finish. One of many perfect rock records. Its nostalgia to GenX, the Rosetta Stone of intelligent alternative rock for GenNext or whatever youre calling yourselves this week. Anyone who can't enjoy this is a stiff.
0345347951|3.0|&quot;Childhood's End&quot; begins during the Cold War, when gigantic alien spaceships appear over all of Earth's major cities.  Within a few years, the alien &quot;Overlords&quot; have eliminated all war, poverty, and disease, and turned the Earth into a real-life paradise.  The main strength in this (and every other) Arthur C Clarke novel is the writing.  If you buy into the idea of the novel, then you'll find that it moves at a good pace and provides decent suspense.  There's no denying that Clarke was a skilled writer, and that he produced good dialogue and excellent visual descriptions.<br />The body of the book is spent describing life on Earth after the arrival of the Overlord's.  There are a lot of interesting concepts that are brought up but not developed in full.  For example, Clarke mentions that the visit from the aliens leads to the elimination of all religions on Earth.  I don't think that demolishing religion would be quite that easy, and I think that the argument could be looked into at great length in some other book.  Unfortunately, Clarke only spends a couple paragraphs on that subject before he abruptly jumps to the next one.  Similarly, Clarke doesn't explain the new economic system of the planet very thoroughly.  He merely states that poverty has been eliminated and that no one needs to work menial jobs any more (presumably, they've been replaced by machines).  But how would this affect people?  Wouldn't most of them choose to sit around being lazy most of the time?  Although there's some description of science and artwork after the encounter with the Overlords, it's not very in depth.<br />And then there's the ending, which I didn't like at all.  I won't it away, but I will say that Clarke tries to describe humanity's proper place in the universe.  I felt that the ending was rather shallow and dodged many of the important questions that were raised earlier in the book.  Overall, I found that this book didn't live up to its reputation.
B00005Y1Y3|4.0|For another Jim, that famous American philosopher Cheech Marin said, \\"Let's dig Jim up and get him to lay down a few more tracks.\\" Well they didn't do that, but they did the next best thing.<br /> When I first saw this I couldn't believe my eyes. How good could it be, a live tape that's been in the vaults for more than 30 years? There had to be something wrong. I stood at a listening post and listen to the whole thing before I bought it. And guess what, except for someone clowning with the mixer in \\"Love Me Two Times\\", it's all good! I expected off key, bad tape something. It's as good as the Doors live concerts, heck it is a live concert! Through some electronic wizardry, the engineers cobbled together 14 songs from 10 concerts and make it sound like one concert.<br />In retrospect, the Doors had a strong Jazz Fusion aspect. In \\"Light my Fire\\" Robbie Krieger quotes John Coletrane's version of \\"My Favorite Things\\". The Blues in \\"Been Down so Long\\" is really gutsy, if not too \\"R\\" rated for the 60's. Lot's of blues here. In \\"RoadHouse Blues\\" Jim sounds as if he's had a drink or two, it's raw, but real, but he still sings on key.<br />The eerie part is to hear Jim rap about eternal recurrence and re-watching your life over and over after death. Jim says \\"You'd better have some good incidents happening\\" to watch forever or words to that effect. Wherever you are Jim, I hope it's good for you.<br />This is the first of a proposed release of Doors live concerts 30 years in the vaults.<br />Well worth your money. On my tough grading system, 5 points for performance, 4 for recording quality. Very close to five stars.
B00000JMQE|2.0|Bad movies are almost always bad for one reason: the writing. It's rare that you find a wonderful script and a stinking picture.  \\"Return to Oz\\" was a big budget flop for Disney, and an unfortunate fledgling directorial outing for the brilliant editor Walter Murch.  But as wrongheaded as much of it is, you sense that Murch was sincerely committed to the material and the strangeness of the whole enterprise will keep you watching.  Dorothy, here played by the young, wide-eyed, rather stolid Fairuza Balk, isn't sleeping too well after returning from her first trip to Oz.  For God knows what reasons, the moviemakers decided to have her sent to an insane asylum, run by an obviously unhinged Nicol Williamson (actually, Williamson always seems unhinged) and a nightmare matron played by Jean Marsh.  That Aunt Em (Piper Laurie, Carrie's mom) would leave her here suggests that Aunt Em is the one who needs to be committed.  During a thunderstorm, Dorothy escapes and is swept away in a chicken coop which, somehow or other, deposits her and her barnyard buddy Billina the hen in Oz.  This mode of transportation is lifted from the third Oz book, \\"Ozma of Oz,\\" though in that story Dorothy was swept overboard while returning from Australia on an oceanliner.  What follows is a hodgepodge of \\"Ozma of Oz,\\" \\"The Land of Oz,\\" and \\"The Emerald City of Oz.\\"  Perhaps, in an attempt to give the material a \\"modern\\" feel, Murch and screenwriter Gil Dennis have given the work a dark tone completely out of keeping with the spirit of the original books, which were entirely shadowless.  This works, in a spotty way, until Dorothy and friends arrive in the kingdom of the Nome King (wacky Williamson again) at which point the picture falls completely apart.  Nonetheless, there are some lovely moments: Dorothy's exploration of the ruined Emerald City; Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead; the assembling of the Gump; Dorothy's horror film encounter with many-headed Princess Mombi (Marsh again) and the return tolife of the Emerald City at the end of the film.  Also of special note is the inspired score by David Shire.  Though \\"Return to Oz\\" does not hold together in the long run, it still has a unique, melancholy flavor all its own, and will be of interest to fantasy fans and Ozaholics.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Zoolander is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. when i went to see it with my freind, you could bareley hear the movie because evreyone was laughing so hard.  <br />... What [the] reviews say is basically the people who reviewed them think the movie is stupid.  Allright, i have to agree with them on that. But what i dont agree with is that they think stupid is a bad thing.  This funny part about this movie is how stupid it is.  Also, this movie is meant for younger people.  THIS IS NOT A MOVIE THAT IS GOOD FOR OLDER PEOPLE.  what i mean by that is that one of the key parts of being able to enjoy this movie is being young.  Overall i would say that this movie is one of the best movies ever and it is very funny so it deserves a 5.
B00003CXRM|4.0|It is very well made and humorous, but it is slightly boring in some parts, so I'd give it 4 stars.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Jane Austen is a wonder. Any woman who could capture such emotion and humor within simple stories of matchmaking, archery lessons, and tea galas has to be a genius indeed. This visual adaptation of Emma is superb. Great acting from Jeremy Northam, Gwyneth Paltrow, Alan Cumming, and Sophie Thompson. But above all, Toni Collette truly steals the show. Her performance of the plain, easily manipulated Harriet was so endearing. She knows, as well as all of us watching, that she belongs with Mr. Martin. However, she is too much taken with Emma, and wishes to oblige her every suggestion of a `worthy' husband. This story is quite sugary compared to Austen's other works, but this characteristic does not diminish the essence of the tale. Simple, warm, and lovely. Thank you, Jane.
B00005Q66T|1.0|I must be getting to be an old fart that doesn't like anything new or different.  I was an early fan of Madonna.  I even saw her perform in a \\"raising star\\" concert.  I have her first four CDs which I really enjoy.  Other artists, however, caught my attention and  I began to ignore Madonna.  My niece gave me an Amazon gift certificate for Christmas so I used it to buy this CD to see what I've been missing.  What an absolute disappointment.  Without a doubt, my worest CD buy in months.  If this is one of her \\"greatest hits\\" CDs, I'm sure glad I stopped buying her CDs when I did.
B000002H33|5.0|This, in my personal opinion is the best album that metallica released. a lot better than than metallica's new stuff. This is one of the best CDs I own. If you like metal, do yourself a favor and buy this CD. No collection is complete without it. Another recommended album is Ride The Lightning.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I went into my first viewing of We Were Soldiers with high expectations(I have seen it twice now, and plan to see it again) Being a Mel Gibson fan, as well as a war movie aficionado, I could hardly wait to see this screen interpretation of retired Lt. General(Colonel at the time of the battle)Harold Moore's novel entitled We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, a true account of the first battle of the Vietnam War which involved American soldiers in combat. The movie covers the events leading up to the battle, including the massacre of a French regiment in 1954, 11 years before the battle takes place, which plays a role in Col. Moore's battle strategy against a much larger Vietnamese army. The story develops several important characters. Gibson delivers another rock-solid performance as Col. Moore, a highly intelligent and seasoned commander whose life is guided by a firm dedication to his family and his country. A quick note: Mel Gibson is seriously considering retiring from acting to focus on producing, which will allow him to spend more time with his wife and seven kids. His next movie, Signs(from the wrier/director of The Sixth Sense, which is done filming, may be his last as a lead actor, so relish this one if enoying watching his performances. Madeline Stowe is excellent as his wife, Julie. Some of the most emotional moments in the movie occur when Mrs. Moore takes on the difficult task of informing some of the other wives of their husbands' deaths in battle. Sam Elliott(Tombstone) turns in an excellent performance as Col Moore's 2nd in command, Sgt. Major Plumley. Chris Klein and Keri Russell do a fine job as Lt. Jack Geoghegan and his wife Barbara, who have a child shortly before the fighting begins. Greg Kinnear once again delivers as Major Bruce Crandall, a helicopter pilot who provides invaluable assistance by transporting supplies and troops, as well as provoding cover fire under extreme pressure. And last but not least is Barry Pepper, who follows up his amazing portrayal of Roger Maris in 61* with another wonderful performance as Joe Galloway, a photograper who risks his life in an attempt to help himself(and his country) understand the nature of  a war that divided this country more than any before it had ever done. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of portraying the American side, but it really distinguishes itself by giving a face(as well as respect) to the Vietnamese soldiers who fought and died along with many American soldiers. Many movies about the this war villianize the Vietnamese people, but this movie takes an important step by showing us a glimpse of the actual people on the other side. While we obviously  give unyielding support to our own soldiers, it is also important to remember that the soldiers on the other side were real people who belived strongly enough in their cause to give their lives for it. We Were Soldiers does an excellent job of creating extremely intense and realistic battle scenes. This movie is not for the squeamish, but if you're like me, you want the battle scenes to be as realistic as possible in order to give the most accurate portrayal of what really happened to the men out there. We Were Soldiers is a story about a group of men showing extreme courage and dedication to one another under the most dire circumstances. While one might say that this is a fairly common theme in war movies, let us not forget that this is a TRUE story. The men who died on the battlefield weren't just fictional characters, they were real people with families who died serving their country. These men became a family themselves, and went to extraordinary legnths to help one another. Their dedication and sacrifice  truly somthing to be respected and admired by everyone. We Were Soldiers is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the Vietnam War and the men who fought in it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|So many people are so quick to juge the hell out of this album, that quite oddly I to this point belive some people do it simple because at this day in time that it's the \\"cool thing\\" to bahs creed, they don't know why, they just do by spouting off irrealvant comment like stapp want to be like vedder, creed has no origanality etc. Come to think of it I can's think of a band with 100% orgianality, band's barrow different elements from there root's and influences. Just because a band sound's simalar to other band, like ones who are considerably older does not mean that they \\"ripped\\" that band off. In creed's case pearl jam, whicth creed is influences by pearl jam,u2,the doors, etc whitch is in no way a bad thing at all. So, lets get to the albums shall we? I just basicly decided to up date this review. Argueably better than my own prison in some terms, whitch I think so. Yes, my own prison was and is a fantastic album, and remains so to this day. But creed or stapp has stated many times that songs in the future prior to MOP will not conatain the same spiritual messages MOP dealt with. Rightfully so, creed matured and touched on different liryical levels with human clay. One thing that I love about this ablum is it's diversity, yes diversity, and any one who states that this whole album sound exactly the same throughout every song need to really consult a ear doctor. First off, one cannot deny that this album has a remarkable production level, not to polished, yet to raw. You have your hard side, then you have your sof side, and medeocre where it's neither rocking nor to soft. Songs like beutifull, say I, wrong way, faceless man, never die, wash away those years, inside us all are all just superb rock tunes. If you are new to creed I would definetly go out and buy this album.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I have them all and it's obvious they really pulled together as a cohesive unit to create this marvel.  Their true talent and musicianship is displayed and expressed on CD #2.  Outstanding work!!  If you like Dream Theater & real music,...low-talent, throw together for marketing, alternative because its popular right now, rock, then you will go nuts for this gem.  Amazing talent in the rock arena is hard to come by these days but these 5 gentlemen, and it's obvious from their roots, do and know music...period.  Buy something of worth, get this compilation.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This DVD was given to me as a gift, and honestly, I first thought I wouldn't like it.  Thinking I didn't have the time to see it, I put off watching it until the day I really had time for anything.  However, after watching it, I found it to be surprisingly funny and entertaining.  The animated characters and plot of this movie are reminiscent of the old \\"Fractured Fairy Tales\\" of the \\"Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\\".  This is an animated feature suited for all ages.  Although the character of Shrek may seem gross and disgusting to most people at the beginning of the film, later on, you'll be cheering him on as he plays a hero out to restore the privacy and sanctity of his swamp (his home).
B000002U9Y|4.0|Pink Floyd's second album is called a masterpiece by some and a total flop by others. Actually it's not either. It certainly isn't as coherant or as inspired as the debut. Instead it is a fascinating document of a band that is partly in disintergration and partly in rebirth. It definately contains some good songs and is a very promising pick-up-the-pieces job by the band. The eleven minute title track is what the band claimed gave them their second breath. Roger Waters: \\"It was the first thing we'd done without Syd that we thought was any good\\". On this album the track, \\"a saucerful of secrets\\" is far from the mind-blowing epic that it is on the live Ummagumma album but it shows considerable promise and also gives the impression that Dave Gilmour is becoming part of the creative process. Roger Waters writes three excellent songs, \\"Let there be more light\\" (exciting piece of psychedelic space rock. Intelligent lyrics. Great guitar licks), \\"Set the controls for the heart of the sun\\"(mysterious, experimental dirge with more intelligent lyrics) and the controversial \\"Corporal Clegg\\" (a good song. I don't think the kazoo completely ruined it but I'll admit that it seem like a bit of a fart in the face the first time I heard it). Rick Wright contributes the superb \\"Remember a day\\" (faultless. Especially Syd's slide guitar)and the not-so-superb \\"See-saw\\" ( not too terrible but very dreary.Sounds like something from Blur's first album). Barrett's \\"Jugband blues\\" is a harrowing final contribution but one which shows us once again just how bright he shone and how unique he was. Syd plays great slide guitar on \\"Remember a day\\", which fits in wonderfully with Mason's drumming and Wright's piano. Basically the album contains good songs which it is rarely given credit for and retains enough experimentation and genuine weirdness to sound like definitive Floyd but often sounds what it is: a disjointed collection of out-takes and hastily-written songs as well as an experimental probe of a title track. Also see some of the tracks on Relics which also give a good idea of the bands recovery period, including Water's \\"Julia Dream\\" which hints at his ability to write magical folk gems....
6305265666|5.0|This was a really nice movie with Drew Barrymore. It put a very touching twist on the classic Cinderella story! I just wish that there were more special features!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|While I was watching the movie, I noticed that the storyline is exactly the same as &quot;Clueless&quot;. However, the settings are completely different. Anyway, I think that Gwyneth Paltrow did a very good job in this movie.
0449215644|5.0|Like other reviewers, I read most of Mary Stewart's novels as a teenager when they were called &quot;Gothics&quot;.  Nine Coaches Waiting and Wildfire at Midnight were wonderful, and among my favorites, but Airs Above the Ground lingers in my memory as the best of Mary Stewart's works.  The scene with the old horse on the hillside gives me chills and brings tears to my eyes every time I read it, or even think about it.  I went to see the Lippizaners in Austria just because of the influence of this book.  Read it--you won't be disappointed.
B000002VCW|5.0|It's hard to believe this album came out 25 years ago. I'm a big fan of all of Al's music. but this one remains my favorite...it has two of my three all-time favorite Al stewart songs: &quot;Lord Grenville&quot; and &quot;On The Border&quot;.  (if you're wondering, &quot;Roads To Moscow&quot; is the third) There are a lot of different styles of songs, and as usual his songwriting is first rate. Al Stewart has been an underrated and under-appreciated singer/songwriter for years. If you like this one, get another! Also...he is still very active performing in clubs. If you ever get the chance, see him live...you can tell how much he enjoys performing and telling stories. (both in his songs and not) OK...so how come you haven't clicked the order button yet??
B00005YTFG|5.0|...My daughter (16) loves it. I tolerated it in the name of being a good Dad :) When all is said and done, it is a nice love story -- gotta love those. It does have great music throughout. Nicole Kidman (always easy on the eyes :) and Ewen McGregor did an excellent job in this. <br />For the Amazon crowd over 35 (like me) -- when folks say this movie is fragmented and frenzied, think of the movie Tommy (Rock Opera). <br />So, if you make it through to the end, I think you'll be left with a good feeling. I made it and ultimately look back on it fondly (but will live a fine life if I never see it again). My daughter has seen it 10 times and will probably wear out the tape.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|After an eight year absence, Sade returned in 2000 with one of that years' true musical triumphs and arguably her best effort yet, LOVERS ROCK.  Now comes this live disc culled from her recent concert tour, and with it the affirmation that Sade remains one of the most sublime and original artists to surface in the last two decades.  Possessing one of the most exquisite vocal instruments in today's musical landscape, she glides gorgeously through this too short thirteen song cycle, punctuated by a rock-tinged take on 'Paradise' and first-rate readings of such classics as 'Kiss of Life' and 'No Ordinary Love'.  Those fawning over current it-girl Alicia Keys will question what the fuss is all about once they give this record a spin.  Highly recommended.
0694003611|5.0|I read this book (still!) to my now three and five year old boys. The book itself is a soothing lullaby with a very catchy rhythm. But the reason I rated it five is that not only did my boys enjoy the book, but the older one, at a very early age started this little Good Night Moon game, in which he'd look for the mouse. It seems that Clement Hurd, the illustrator, did this intentionally (and quite ingeniously) as the mouse is not always easy to find! But my kids always had a blast looking for that little mouse!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is a tale that can only be called the best Western Film ever!  If you like westerns or even just good moview you must see this!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Clearly, the majority of the viewers who composed these negative reviews went into the movie expecting Spielberg. However, what they received was something alltogether different and something that they may never see again: a monumental motion picture collaboration by two of the industry's titans that, as unsettling as it is, DEMANDS that the viewer THINK about what they've seen. I question whether the average movie goer had experienced much Kubrick before Tom & Nicole made him a household word; naturally they were shocked at what the film turned out to be.<br />However, what is most annoying and disturbing is how the movie was thrown off as a \\"failed experiment\\" by so many people. I didn't see the film on its theatrical run, so I snapped it up as soon as I could. Yes, the effects and art direction are astounding and yes, the score is a nice departure from the usual Williams/Spielberg soundtrack; in fact there are a great many things to admire in this movie. But, the single most astonishing thing about the film is that IT IS ALIVE. It breathes, it cries, it cackles, it soars and is, in the end, one of the most satisfying movie experiences I can remember. I won't bore you by revealing plot points by way of a synopsis. That won't make you go out and rent or buy this movie anyway. If you truly love the work of these two directors, you owe it to yourself and to them to see it. The film \\"pushed my buttons\\" in ways I did not think were possible; it has become clear to me that many of the people who saw it have no buttons to push.
B00003CX5P|2.0|He's one more 'boomer' who has grown old and lax in his judgement. These films struck a bland, austere, and matriarchal note which cuts all the way through these diverse and exciting environments. It could've been a great adventure, but it splits its story over too many supporting characters, none of which add or build on anything, because Lucas is not a writer. I think these films reemphasize the importance of screenwriters in this industry. Go back and compare it to 'THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK'.    Star Systems are severing ties to the Republic in what will form the Empire... there's some mystery the Jedi need to go to Naboo to warn the Queen of, and she meets her future husband... that's all that's going on here. The tone varies so much because it doesn't know when to be exciting/thoughtful/foreboding, so we have ROLES instead of CHARACTERS --like Jar-Jar, the walking doll. We spend so much time with CGI, creatures, and a whining blond boy, that all of the important things are sucked right out of it. A beautiful, but thoroughly lifeless experience.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I love this movie.  The DVD is great!  Please note the brightness in the movie.  Even the fight scene in the castle is filmed with quite a bit of light.  You can tell a great director when they do not fear to film in daylight.  Also, the dialogue is quick and funny.  My kids were running around yelling \\"Willllowww\\" like the goat (sorceress.)  This was a very good \\"hero\\" story.  I also like the romance involved.  It was very sweet.  See, you don't need excess violence, mind blowing special effects and sex to sell a movie.  Just a great director, great actors and a darn good screenplay!  If you really want to know if a movie stands on its own two legs, close your eyes and actually listen to the dialogue.  This is what makes movies great and memorable.  The dialogue in this movie was hilarious and witty.  Wish Lucas would remember this in his newer films,  I think that is why his last Phantom Menace stunk! Wooden actors, wooden dialogue.  I don't expect to much from \\"The clones\\" either.  Just eye-candy and no meat.  Maybe Lucas should team up with Ron Howard again to get a realty check!  Make your characters likeable/dislikable by what they say, and you can see how people will truly \\"feel\\" for them and remember them!  Bav Morda and Darth Vader truley wicked and memorable.  That guy with the crayon marks on his face in phantom menace had no wicked/witty dialogue can't even remember him.  This goes for the heroes too.  Stupid directors think we are stupid just sitting there waiting fo another pop from a special effect.  Sorry, it just is one of my pet peeves how directors have forgot the enchantment of the simple word.
B00005TT77|4.0|I love this cd. The covers are beautifully done and subtle- especially Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot; and Ben Folds &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;. Even the unknown artists on the cd put in some great covers. I think the only song that disappointed me was Nick Cave's version of &quot;Let it Be&quot; (WHAT were they thinking?) I just don't get the whole Nick Cave thing in general, so maybe I am missing something...<br />However, nothing can be as good as the Beatles' versions of these songs. After listening to the cd for a few days, I pulled out my Beatles collection and had a great time listening to it all.<br />Like most soundtracks, it gets old after a while. However, it's upbeat, great for mixes, and a good listen. It's worth having, even if you won't have it in your cd player for days on end.
B00003CXSP|4.0|I had awaited the arrival of Hannibal on DVD ever sense I had read Thomas Harris's sequal to Silence of the Lambs. If you plan on seeing this flim, I recomend seeing Silence of the Lambs first, and if you liked the movie, read the book Hannibal. You'll be surprised, because Harris had a different ending.<br />The DVD is packed with an entire second disc that is filled with extras worth watching, the movie is great (but not as great as the Silence of the Lambs), and consider it worth your time and money. That is, if you like movies that will make you think, and not be able to sleep for a week.
B00005JKES|4.0|A superb show--very refreshing and original.  The acting of some of the minor characters was less than excellent.  But to be fair, these were only television episodes, not full-blown movies with multi-million dollar budgets and an all-star cast.  My real complaint concerns the menu page.  The type is orange on a similar orange background, making it extrememly difficult to read.  I've had to use the trial-and-error method to find the features.  However, once found, they've proven to be rich complements to the show.  If you don't consider the price too steep, then I recommend making this purchase.  Caveat Emptor:  this item does not come with the pilot episode.
0790730960|5.0|Certainly the darkest 'kid-material' based film ever made.<BR>This film noir has great imagery, psychological depth and funny,<BR>sad and outright dark black quotes plus brilliant, gothically <BR>decayed nostalgic visuals. Also, four other characters represent the character 'Batman' in the movie. Max Shreck-the millionaire<BR>businessman, Penguin-the orphaned outsider, Catwoman-the costumed<BR>vigilante, and Bruce Wayne-the awkward, concealed identity of Batman, though his exact opposite, and the characters are all written to hint at it in the film, but it won't hit you over the head with it. <br />The characters that are alive at the end of the film speak to<BR>reveal it's main character's current mental health state. The<BR>films plot concerns a character abandoned, literally thrown away<BR>in his childhood because of being born with his irregular hands<BR>causing him to look like a Penguin. Out of what he sees as vengeful justice, he becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, gradually assuming the role of the horrible monster that he always looked like. <br />He is reluctantly accepted when he returns to society and is<BR>given another chance. He decides somewhere along the way that he does not want to return to this city for some reason (or was it planned all along, while looking at the record list when he was supposedly searching for his human name, did he write down the first born sons of Gotham? Later Catwoman remarks that he already has an 'enemy list'<BR>before staying long in Gotham). <br />He 'forgives' his parents but is secretly blaming the city for his woes. Penguin tries to live<BR>there but he cannot fully, he finds his sense of belonging seemed<BR>like an illusion (like most Tim Burton films portray), he then,<BR>self-destructively gives up, betrays their trust and bitterly<BR>attempts to murder the innocent before his mayoral bid can be won.<BR>Gotham City represents a lot of evil in this picture, Batman is<BR>a brooding, anti-hero and he's one of the only good people in the<BR>town -in film noir there are no heroes, this is the essence of<BR>Gotham. There's a consistent motif of having the Penguin character<BR>see everything he can't have through bars, if you look you'll find<BR>him eyeing his parents (as the camera) behind bars and Catwoman<BR>after she rejects him, etc. yet he never enters a jail cell. <br />\\"Did you miss me... did you miss me?\\" Penguin, to his penguins<br />A notable amount of biblical resemblance's here, a basket<BR>carrying a baby down a river that is like from a story about Moses,<BR>Penguin is exactly 33 years old when he arises, like Christ is<BR>said to have after death at that exact age. Originally he was<BR>originally supposed to actually state \\"yes, Virginia, there is<BR>an anti-Christ!\\" in the ballroom scene, etc. Penguin reminds<BR>some people of an evil man from 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', he later wants to drown infants. <br /> \\"I am not a human being! I am an animal! Cold-Blooded!\\"<br /> When the actress portraying Catwoman/Selina Kyle is making the cat<BR>costume, she opens a drawer with about four different colored<BR>scissors, on Edward Scissorhands, Burton explained having scissors<BR>in his films \\"is about, trying to touch someone, and not being<BR>able to.\\" That was established, as one of Catwoman's many problems,<BR>no real love life. We know why she destroys the Shreck building,<BR>because he is guilty of crimes and she cannot prove it, she sees<BR>this as revenge, like Penguin does. In 'Batman Returns' there are<BR>no situations that have a black or white answer, like film noir. Burton also said<BR>that dressing up changes every character. <br /> As well look at how Burton depicts colorfully clothed overly happy people as stupid,<BR>fake and annoying, without really changing much of anything about <BR>people we know, this harsh contrast is obvious right before<BR>the Penguin agrees to be mayor. Max Shreck (named after the<BR>actor who played Nosferatu in 1922) is a murderous businessman<BR>but in the ballroom scene he shows that even he loves his child,<BR>unlike Penguin's parents, proving he does not deserve to die.<br />The star character hardly gets shown as often as the others do<BR>(because studio limitations dictate Batman wouldn't be allowed<BR>to be portrayed as messed up as the villains in the movie so<BR>you can't show much of the character or really learn about him,<BR>therefore, the villains represent Batman). The song<BR>'Super Freak' is in this movie as an instrumental during the masked ball, I think that must say something<BR>about Batman! At the end with when the car stops, a sign reads 'Super Drug'. It all is clothed a very unreal, hazy, dreamlike<BR>quality. The image at the cemetery where the Penguin looks down<BR>at the ground with a gravestone cross above him and the first<BR>time we see Bruce, staring out the window reflecting the bat<BR>signal are my favourite parts. In the sewer, close to the finish,<br />Batman/Bruce admits with Penguin, Shreck, and Catwoman there,<BR>that he is Bruce Wayne, and that 'we're the same, split right<BR>down the center'. He rips off his mask, and at that moment a<BR>thread in Catwoman's mask breaks open to reveal her blond hair.<BR>With an admitted (in the film) sad, though satisfying <BR>Christmas-time end to it all, the movie was dismissed as a 'shallow'<BR>script because of it's superhero nature (it does have some<BR>bizarre fight scenes) and did not make as much money as was hoped.<BR>Still, I think it's genius and it must be my favourite film,<BR>nervous breakdowns and all. Batman debuted in 1938.<br />\\"Go to heaven!\\"
B00002E224|5.0|Simply put, this movie is amazing!  I caught the last 15 minutes of it on tv a few weeks ago and that was enough to enrapture me.  I finally saw the entire movie tonight and it blew me away like no other movie has done in quite some time.  The plot is very believable, romantic, and sophisticated, yet simple at the same time.  The dialogue between the two leads is interesting and flows naturally.   Delpy and Hawke have such an electric chemistry on screen, I wonder if they had something happening off screen too.  The progression of the story is fast enough to keep it interesting, yet slow enough to savor every word the characters say to each other and every camera shot.  I also enjoyed the scenery shots of Vienna and on the train (travel by train in Europe is the only way to go).  I am usually a finicky movie watcher, but I highly recommend Before Sunrise!
B000002H72|5.0|Despite the fact that this album is generally held in ridiculously high regard, it remains impossible to overrate. That's right. It's one of a handful of pop records that's even better than the truckload of hipster cred it has garnered. When this record came out, it re-wrote the rules of pop/punk/rock in many ways. It fused the sci-fi fixations and complex arrangements of progressive rock with the immediacy and honesty of Mission of Burma, the humor of the Ramones and the visceral impact of Husker Du. And even those comparisons don't do it justice. The album is over a decade old and still sounds like it was recorded tomorrow. The album is uncompromising yet accessible. They brought hooks galore, some of the best shout-out-loud choruses in the history of recorded sound, and some really deft musicianship to support Black Francis' twisted visions. As with all Pixies albums, Black's schizoid vocals are the focal point. He sounds like a serial killer on &quot;Debaser&quot;, a choirboy on &quot;I Bleed&quot; and a martyred saint of &quot;Silver&quot;. The interplay between his whoops, hisses, croons and howls with Kim Deals school-girl deadpan was something of a unique and impossible beauty never heard before and never quite matched since.
6304711905|2.0|This is one of the best movies ever made but the poor picture quality cause the low score. by low quality i mean not enhanced for 16:9 tvs. If you own a 27 inch or smaller the dvd quality looks great. if you have a big screen tv buy the vista series tombstone DVD. it cost less and has superior video quality. (The movie gets 5 stars)
B000002B30|4.0|I will leave it to others to say whether a Bruce Springsteen box set is overdue.  Leaving that issue aside, I feel that this CD is just fine, if you aren't wishing it to be something more than what it is.<br />Of course, most of the obvious hits are there -- &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, etc.  What is the most striking inclusion on the album is &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, a deeply depressing song from the &quot;Nebraska&quot; album that didn't chart high enough to really be considered a &quot;greatest hit&quot;.  However, this dour song sets up the last half of the album beautifully -- the next songs are his &quot;Born in the USA&quot; hits, all of which are either upbeat or, at least in the case of the &quot;USA&quot; title track, highly spirited.<br />For the final stretch of this album, it's a mix of post-&quot;USA&quot; hits that define a change in Springsteen's attitude.  Many of the lyrics from songs such as &quot;Better Days&quot; and &quot;Human Touch&quot; show a more reflective songwriter.  For those of us living the second half of our lives, this has particular significance.<br />The last few songs are new ones, one of which is &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, which would be used prominently shortly thereafter in the movie &quot;Jerry MacGuire&quot;.  This isn't to put a gravestone on Bruce's career, but this album from the mid-90s might provide the essential Springsteen, if not the comprehensive Springsteen.
B00005UW7V|4.0|I thought AI described a world where everything good that existed was no longer 'real'. His mother (not just the 'aliens') was a robot at the end, too. He was just fooling himself, or couldn't tell reality, because he wasn't real himself. Had he become a real boy, I don't think so. Just satisfied after searching, but he was probably programmed to know better.<br />People thought A.I. had a stupid, happy ending, I think it was sad. You see his mother never changed in life she was cold and cruel to the very end (before the underwater ship). She did not come back to reunite with him, another robot did, which is why she could not remember. A completely bitter misanthropic ending, yet in an ignorant way he is satisfied. It's technology making our dreams come 'true', only they can never really be 'true' - Look at 'Gigolo Joe' for instance, he has no point, other than to remind people of that. AI DOES NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING, MY FRIENDS! Just because it looked like her doesn't mean it's her. It's like Kafka's Metamorphesis book, a man wakes up one day and just is a giant cockroach, no reason, he just is. His sister takes care of him, but she soon becomes tired of caring for her brother, the monster. She throws him out. Many people thought the metamorphesis was about the man who turns into a giant cockroach, but it was actually about his sister, who changes from a loving character into a cold one, towards the same person for nothing of his doing. It's bitter, despite the soundtrack, the smiles, etc. and no one has realized it.<BR> <BR>all the human are stereotyped as being 'bad'. From the brother he has, to his mother, to the people at the 'flesh fair', to the guy at the beginning who feels a need to 'test' the sex robots, etc. Then compare with 'Gigolo Joe' and 'David', good people, who aren't really people, because good people don't exist anymore in the world. Gigolo Joe only exists in the film to show this. It's a film noir nightmare parable. Maybe the robots realized this, and decided to kill them off. <br /> I love all of Kubrick's work and I love some of Spielberg's, though Kubrick was gone, you can still see his influence.
B000002MJC|5.0|This album is my favorite of all Depeche Mode albums, and I have been a fan for over 20 years now.  The tracks have a dark, but soothing sound.  My favorite tracks are Mercy In You and Higher Love.  This is a breakthrough album because D.M. uses real instruments for the first time, including electric guitar.  I Feel You has a harder edge and is a good opening song for the album.  The rest of the tracks flow in a rhythm pattern ranging from very dark to spiritual.  Never heard anything like it.
B0000065O1|5.0|I got this video a few years ago, and enjoyed it at the time.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in the right mindset to really concentrate on losing weight at the time, so I quit working out for a couple of years.<BR>About three weeks ago, I became serious about being healthy again: I got tired of coming home and not having enough energy to enjoy playing with my seven-month old daughter.  So I started eating much healthier foods and exercising daily.<BR>I started with Cindy's New Dimension workout to ease me back into a routine.  After about a week, I started alternating that tape with Cindy's Shape Your Body.  About a week ago, I felt brave enough to try this video again.  Boy, it knocked me for a loop!  Although I'd just gotten past the sore muscles from starting exercising, this made me sore in different places- and in a good way.  <BR>I know I'm nowhere near my goal: 5 pounds down, 35 to go. But I already feel firmer, and I have infinitely more energy than I did three weeks ago.  The music is great in this video, and Cindy occasionally grumbles about being told to kick higher- much like I do when I hear Radu telling me to aim higher or push harder.  There's something about hearing a supermodel grumble the same way I do that's oddly refreshing.<BR>The cardio section of this tape is very intense, at least for me.  But every time I think I can't go any further, it's break time, so I catch my breath, drink some much-needed water, and I'm able to continue.<BR>After using Cindy's two other tapes, it's kind of weird not having any repetition of the sets, but it's nice as well- this provides for a much more well-rounded workout than repetition does.  This keeps the muscles from operating on &quot;auto-pilot.&quot;<BR>This is a great workout, but please be aware that it's NOT beginner: I'm relatively new to it, but this was not the first workout tape I did my first day working out.  It may only take a couple of weeks, but you do need to build up to it.  I suggest buying Cindy's New Dimension workout with this video.  Although New Dimension is intended for new moms, it is also well suited for the former couch potato (like me!) who wants to get back into shape.  Then ease your way into this tape.  It's money well spent!
6300216268|5.0|I just saw this movie for the first time a few days ago and I am sorry I never discovered it sooner. What an amazing movie! I don't think I could say enough about how touching this movie is. There isn't one thing I would change about this movie. The characters are absolutely perfect! I especially liked Bud Cort's performance. I don't think there is anyone else out there that could have been a better Harold. There are so many really funny parts in this movie. I admit the whole age difference thing is kind of weird, but it just goes to show you that if you let appearances bother you, you could be passing up an amazing friend that totally changes your life for the better. That's what makes this movie so special. People not caring about what the world thinks of them. If you havn't seen this movie, I reccommend you see it as soon as possible. If you want to see a feel good movie, this is it! I think some people might think the ending is sad, but I think it has the best ending possible. It's the perfect ending if you really think about it. It was the best way to go. I couldn't give 'Harold And Maude' enough praise. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I know if you like romantic comedies, you will love this movie. Share it with everyone you know!!!
1565113306|5.0|If you love the movie that was robbed at the acadmey awards get it on DVD, VHS, and on book . The dialoge is awesome and you can learn so much from it. This book can change your life. It sure changed mine.<br />&quot;His name was Robert Paulson&quot;
B00003CXC7|5.0|It's hard to believe how this still holds up. I could watch it again and again and I do! It's a classic and you should really seek it out, everyone I've showed it to loves it. Also try: Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'.
6300163431|4.0|I hated this when I saw it years ago.  On second viewing last weekend, I found it much more fascinating then I had realized, even more imaginative than I had recognized.  It is not a film to make one enjoy it or to feel \\"good\\" or \\"happy\\" since the plot is unpleasant, the characters pretty much reprhesible; but the exceptional acting by Rourke and DeNiro...Ah!!!!!!!!!  Even Lisa Bonet seemed better in the second viewing.  It was worth the two viewings; maybe a third down the road a piece.    And the ending...well, evil is punished as it should be, but so are the innocent.  How true to life that sometimes is.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|POP music at it's finest,take it as an insult or compliment but it's true.This album lists the songs that topped the charts but doesn't necessarily represent the Beatle's best work.A lot of great tracks are missing from this fairly decent album and filled with alot of super-catchy 2 minute love songs that don't properly show what the Beatles were all about.The good thing about this album is that the tracks are in chronilogical order so you know what NOT to listen to on the album,like almost all of the first half which contains all of the bad love cliches that you can catch on the radio over and over again.But on the other half of this album contains some classics that may never be recreated(such as &quot;Let It Be&quot;)or covered properly(but nice try with &quot;Revolution&quot; Stone Temple Pilots).<BR>This album is worth a listen but is not really anything more than a list of easy tracks to help 1st time listeners get into The Beatles.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer has a voice that captures the sultry sound of Seal and recalls the crisp rhythyms of Dave Matthews. Take a listen to this CD and you will notice the influence of many genres and musicians: jazz, blues, R&B as well as rock. Mayers muisc is mellow enough to listen to when you are working and up enough that you will find yourself dancing in your chair without realizing it.<br />He is a classic songwriter... in what is a nice contrast to much of the mainstream music, his lyrics are not a streaming jumble of verbiage leaving you nothing but a vague sense of frustration, but words to relate to. His songs are truly artistic and expressive, showcasing the sometimes meloncholic beauty of life. His subject matter is of a wandering soul, for whom every experience is a new one. I could have skipped \\"No Such Thing\\" because I twitch whenever I hear the words \\"high school\\" but his point is a good one- draw your own lines, there is no real world. Likewise, all his songs are effective at delivering a message. In the catchy \\"Why Georgia\\" the message is a question we all ask, Where am I going? Life, \\"am I living it right\\"?  Ever say something you wish you could take back? Johns answer is \\"My Stupid Mouth\\". If you are a woman, you wish you were facing Johns singing, \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" (me, personally, I'm jealous of whoever that might be). You'd swear you've had \\"Neon\\" in your collection forever, with a natural melody and an R&B/jazz feel that will have you singing along. If you can't relate to these songs, you just aren't human... \\"City Love\\" conveys the excitement of a new relationship, \\"83\\"- stolen innocence, \\"3x5\\"- a long distance relationship, \\"St. Patricks Day\\"- overrated singlehood and the dating scene. \\"Great Indoors\\" is Mayers version of yelling, 'Carpe Diem!' as well as suggesting we look inside ourselves. I did. Hearing one song, \\"Love Song For No One\\", made me buy this album... I recommend you do the same.<br />If you like Train, Dave Matthews, Peter Gabriel, Sister Hazel or Seal, there is very good chance you will like this CD. And it will definitely leave you with a smile.abriel, Sister Hazel or Seal, there is very good chance you will like this CD. And it will definitely leave you with a smile.
B000002C4J|4.0|Celine Dion's 1997 release LETS TALK ABOUT LOVE embraces you in a message of love.  The album contains soft ballads, rock, movie themes, duets, and opera.  The one song that hits me the most and has become my best favorite from the album is Track 14-TO LOVE YOU MORE.  A passionate ballad with a very elegant violin opening, the song sorts of like a response to BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME in the previous release.  <br />The producers of this album (Vito Luprano and John Doelp) have saved the best for last in the album.  Track 15-LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE is sort of like the kind of song you'll hear in Olympics closing, like AMIGOS POR SIMPRE (Barcelona Games 1992).  Celine is joined by a children choir in this heart-warming piece.  Track 13-I HATE YOU THEN I LOVE YOU (duet with Luciano Pavarotti) will share the merit with LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE as my second favorite from the album.  It's a beautiful opera song.  As Celine has noted, Luciano is the greatest tenor in the world and she had been secretly hoping to sing a love song with him.  <br />Speaking of popularity, everyone will agree that Track 12-MY HEAR WILL GO ON (theme from Titanic) is the most popular piece in this album.  James Horner had do an incredible job on the music score for the film.  The music is stunning, breathtaking, and heart-pounding.  Cameron (Titanic director) originally did not want to have a vocal theme but instrmentals.  After listening to Celine's demo of MY HEART WILL GO ON, Cameron adopted the song as the movie theme.  The movie version (as recorded on the Titanic soundtrack) is slightly different.  The arrangement is better in this version recorded in Celine's album.  The very last four songs, Tracks 12, 13, 14, and 15 are my personal picks and have made the album worth to buy.  The album, however, has some other jewels.<br />Track 07-WHERE IS THE LOVE and Track 08-WHEN I NEED YOU go hand in hand as a pair of beautiful love soft ballads.  Track 08-WHEN I NEED YOU Celine sings with a very soft voice.  The song would make a nice Kareoke choice.  Track 06-TELL HIM (duet with Barbara Streisand) is a very beautiful ballad again.  What can I say about two divas coming together and perform a timeless classic?  The twin opening cuts Track 01-THE REASON and Track 02-IMMORTALITY have some good tunes but are nothing compared to Track 14-TO LOVE YOU MORE and Track 15-LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE.  Track 03-TREAT HER LIKE A BABY is a nice twist from the rest of the album-it is a cute and fun song.  I only own two Celine Dion's CDs:  FALLING INTO YOU and the current one being reviewed.  But I can honestly say that I love both albums.  They consistently make their presence back to my CD player.  Let the music pulsate in your mind...
B00003CXFV|2.0|so you have a female enpowerment film.  ok, now problem.  more power to you.  but this woman uses her body to get things done. wait! a contradiction.  what are we telling young girls--you can be a better man by being a bad woman?<br />sad
B00005NNU4|5.0|This album stays in my CD Player. Everytime i think i get tired of hearing it I turn the radio on. Five minutes later im playing the album again. It is truly TTD's/SM's most popular flavored album since Hardline. Not at Great of an album as Symphony or Vibrator but lyrically & musically sound. It far surpasses most other Popular releases I have heard so far from other artists. Im not quite sure why it has not been released in the US as of yet. Terence's voice is haunting, incredibly powerful yet sweet. Terence is truly a blessed talent. B..<br />Update:<br />The US TTD released version of Wildcard (Jokers Edition)  manages to far exceed the previous now over-priced import edition. The addition of new songs has added to the genius of the album. \\"Testify\\" is pure and simple what pop radio music could be. Oh only if they had the balls and a clue. oBx
B00005R23X|4.0|Although this movie takes quite a few liberties with Bram Stoker's novel, the changes are inventive and flesh out Dracula's character.  The addition of a love story between Dracula and Mina Harker (who looks like his lost love) transforms Stoker's theme into a context where evil is even more sympathetic than in his Victorian novel, and the tragic dimensions are clearer.  The visual style may be bit off-putting at times, but Coppola's inventiveness more than makes up for it.  <BR>    Finally, I'd like to address the \\"faithfulness\\" of this movie to the book, since many people see it as heresy.  If you want to see a strict visual version of the book, then read the book and use your imagination.  It's free and you can use all the special effects you want.  If you want to see how someone else interprets the story (someone with actors and money to use), then watch this and enjoy the ride, but leave your pseudo-biblical concordance of Bram Stoker at the door.
B000002BHE|4.0|Celine Dion's 1996 release FALLING INTO YOU keep making it back to my CD player.  This is an unforgettable album--a compilation that is full of passion.  Dion vocalizes this passion thorough her strong voice.  The album kicks off with the breathtaking 7:37 Track 01-IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW written by Jim Steinman.  The music will catches your attention right away and creates an element of suspense before Celine sings the first note.  This original unabridged version is by far the best as the promo edit we have heard on radio was terribly cut.  In fact the song doesn't even sound like it is 7:37 long.<br />The most popular and widely aired piece from this album is Track 02-BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME (Theme from Up Close &amp; Personal).  You've probably heard it at wedding, birthday party and farewell function.  Diane Warren wrote this affectionate piece and no doubt the song stayed in chart for quite a while back then.  I particularly like the lyrics that is almost an ode to friendship.  Very inspiring and heart-warming piece.<br />I know many have commented on this album and some really like Track 03-Falling Into You.  Honestly I do not really like this title track all that much.  It might be a change of tone from the two previous tracks but I personally think both music and lyrics-wise this track is nothing compared to IT's ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW and BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME.  I guess the major reason is that the song doesn't touch me as much as the previous two do.  Track 04-MAKE YOU HAPPY and Track 05-SEDUCES ME are again somewhat dull and banal.  These two tracks contribute to the reason why I have taken out a star for this album.<br />Track 07-DECLARATION OF LOVE is a candid cute performance.  The song is more upbeat and rock-n-roll like.  My other favorites are Track 08-DREAMIN' OF YOU and Track 09-I LOVE YOU.  These two songs are very similar that I didn't remember which one was which after listening to the album for a year.  Both are very passionate expression of love and sentiment.  I particularly like Celine's high pitch in DREAMIN' OF YOU.  <br />Talk about music that pulsates in your head and makes your heart throb, the two final cuts Track 13-CALL THE MAN and Track 14-FLY will just do.  These two songs are beautiful in a very sad mood.  I do not own all of Celine's albums but I can assure that this is a very well-done one.  I'm sure it touches many souls.

B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones is taking the country by STORM!  This, her first CD, just came out 2 weeks ago and is already highly acclaimed. Her shows are sold-out wherever she plays!<br />I feel priviledged to have access to WXPN-88.5 FM; a listener-sponsored radio station that has played a huge role in turning the NorthEast, and now- with the internet- the country, onto such talents as Dave Matthews, Keb Mo, David Grey, Moxie Fruvous, Susan Werner, Christine Lavin, and now Norah Jones.<br />The whole disc is lushly listenable, but if all you got was her rendition of 'Cold,Cold Heart'(a Hank Williams tune), it'd still be well worth what you'll pay for it. Her interpretation on piano and her vocals are brilliantly understated and delicate- pure yummy jazz.<br />Give it a listen! You'll want to own it.
B000002J1M|5.0|\\"Foxtrot\\" is my personal favorite Genesis album from the Peter Gabriel era, with the other albums from \\"Trespass\\" to \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" all tying for second, and \\"From Genesis To Revelation\\" third (but in good company). What can I say about \\"Foxtrot\\"---it's got \\"Supper's Ready\\" on it, the epic masterwork about the battle between good & evil, that is not only Genesis' magnum opus, but is also arguably the very best of the 20-minute-plus epics ever recorded by a rock band, with mood, feeling, tight musicianship, fascinating lyrics, and the commanding voice of Peter Gabriel all combining to transport you to prog rock Heaven! I could probably end my review right there, but I'll give you a little more insight.... The rest of \\"Foxtrot\\" is just as powerful as \\"Supper's Ready,\\" as the classic line-up of Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins & Steve Hackett tackle their second album together with great musical guts. The chord changes & arrangements are complex, but what are you expecting from these guys, dance music? Early Genesis albums, especially, are meant to be sat down and *listened* to, and \\"Foxtrot\\" is no exception. It's rock music for the mind as well as the ears! The majestic \\"Watcher Of The Skies\\" kicks everything off in a big way, as Tony Banks' mellotron intro sounds like a spaceship coming in to land (it's not surprising, then, that the song is about an alien's observation of Earth). It's a classic. \\"Time Table\\" is a lovely tune about glorious times gone by that I've always thought could've been a hit song for Genesis. \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\" is a great mini-opera about suburban life, with Gabriel gleefully embodying all of the characters, and \\"Can Utility And The Coastliners\\" is another magnificent, sweeping tale, played with ferocious thunder by the band, and one of my personal favorites from the album. Steve Hackett's gorgeous acoustic guitar piece, \\"Horizons,\\" is now regarded as one of his signature compositions, and rightfully so. And finally, there's The Big One, the legendary \\"Supper's Ready\\"....simply delicious.A person interested in checking out the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis can't go wrong starting with any of the albums from \\"Trespass\\" to \\"The Lamb\\" (I like their first album, \\"From Genesis To Revelation\\" just fine, but it's so different from anything else they've done, I wouldn't recommend it just yet to a newcomer to the band). But \\"Foxtrot\\" is arguably the best place to start. It signifies a creative peak in Genesis' career, and, starring the one-and-only \\"Supper's Ready,\\" it will give you a classic slice of Gabriel-era Genesis, back when Gabriel's flower costumes and alien make-up were all the rage. Buy it! :-).

B00005R87Q|1.0|In the DVD extra features the director talks about the basis for this film, an article on street racing - on the sub-culture of men and women who live for speed and souped-up cars.

And I haven't seen a film in years where you could virtually hear the director call \\"Action\\" before every scene.

And very bad over-dubbing for extras rhubard mumbling.   The writing hit the biggest lows in every scene where the characters supposedly opened up.  Vin Diesel's BIG speech about Dad dying was like a laughably bad acting class audition speech.  Get the idea I hated this movie?  Too right I did.  And how depressing that it actually made money.

I don't care for pop music very much, and was afraid this CD would be kind of like Britney.  Ick.  But I am so glad that I decided to get it.  It is great.  Her voice is so strong and I love the bluesy feel on most of the songs.  I definately recommend this to anyone.

B00005N5S5|5.0|\\"I HATE Terminator 2!\\" I have uttered this phrase many times in the last ten years since I first saw T2 and have taken a verbal beating every time! Everyone I know seems to like T2 better than the original, but I still stand firm. With the obvious exception of special effects, The Terminator is far superior to the sequel in every way, and remains James Cameron's masterpiece. Way back in 1984 he turned an action-science fiction flick into a violent, depressing, totally compelling work of art! The writing, direction, and acting are all outstanding, with a sense of style being maintained throughout the entire experience. And, unlike in the sequel, Arnold is believeable as a murderous cyborg, that will do anything to complete its objective. The action sequences are truly brilliant with slow motion, foreboding music, and razor sharp editing all combining to create an original and brutal benchmark for both action and science fiction films! Well, in my opinion, anyway. Seriously, though, what happened Mr. Cameron!? From raising the bar with awesome films like The Terminator and Aliens in the mid 80s, to turning out meaningless garbage like True Lies and Titanic a decade later!! I thought you could only get better with time! I guess I was wrong...<br />In conclusion, I think it's fantastic that the studio released a Special Edition DVD of The Terminator. It was long overdue, and deserves to be in the collection of anyone who even remotely enjoys science fiction films.
B00QFNLJZQ|4.0|UPDATED Mon June 20, 2016 for Grammatical and Structural Issues:<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM 2002:<br /><br />This movie was intensely emotional, while at the same time, very cold and distant, and very artificial.  The film deals with many very complex emotions, and Haley Joel Osment does an amazing job of capturing such both an unemotional and emotionally complex role as &quot;David&quot;. At such a young age he was able to capture that raw and complex emotion that David feels as something that shouldn't be able to even feel emotion, and he captures his progression from a robot to a boy in a manner few actors ever could, and it is truly a shame he was in very few films after this and had so many legal problems.<br /><br />What I perceive as the reason most people do not like this movie, is due to the fact that they have a difficult time reconciling the tough emotions and feelings of this film, with the cold calculation of it's script and special effects. David's need for love is the central theme, and since this is a human need, it feels somewhat cold given the sterile surroundings he finds himself in, with actually people who are completely unloving to him. He was created to love and be loved in return, but he could not have it no matter how much he tried to keep it and get it, so he tries to become a real boy. It just is bringing me to tears right now, it is very hard for me, the idea of being turned away from the one thing you need and want the most from one person. BTW I am 17yrs (or was in 2002).<br /><br />I think everything in this story fits perfectly, the Pinocchio story line is perfect for its emotional foundation, but it is much more then a science fiction take on Pinocchio. You may think the movies too long, and this is certainly a flaw, because instead of leaving you hanging it explains everything. Though it's surreal atmosphere reminded me of another film about the human need for love &quot;Solaris&quot; (the original Polish version), This is a film best viewed its it's entirety, so you have time to watch and ruminate on the ideas it posits.  I am fairly certain most teens will find it boring (though I am one I love it) and even the majority of adults wont understand it because of it's very complex emotional subtext. I know because I know both adults and teens that have seen it and could not make heads nor tales of what the film was about.<br /><br />If you're willing to explore your emotions open up your mind and think a little, I think you will enjoy this movie a lot.  It is not a perfect film, and one has to wonder what it would be if Kubrick did not die, but as it is, it still a technical and emotional achievement in film making. long time.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amylm best viewed its it's entirety, so you have time to watch and ruminate on the ideas it posits.

B00003CXXP|2.0|The title Artificial Intelligence aptly captures the emotions engendered by this movie. It is an intelligent, but artificial film -- it manages to be genuinely emotional, yet somehow also cold, detached, and distant. The viewer ends up caring more about abstract moral dilemmas than about the film's characters.<br />As other reviewers have explained, this paradox arises from the clash in styles between Stanley Kubrick (the coldly intelligent one) and Steven Spielberg (the populist, emotional one).<br />AI undoubtedly deserves Oscar consideration for special effects. But hands down, this has to be one of the saddest, gloomiest movies ever made. It is deeply depressing to witness the lead character's quixotic odyssey lead absolutely nowhere -- a child robot obsessed with the impossible fantasy of being transformed into a real boy.<br />Fairy tale writers know how important it is to please the crowd with a happy ending. Spielberg must have forgotten this simple lesson, or perhaps he tried to postpone the inevitable by dragging out the ending over an ungodly number of hours. <br />Either way, AI ends up being a tragedy far removed from the expectations of American pop culture. This is a genuinely disturbing film, brilliantly visualized but destined to trouble adults and children alike.
B0000024K1|5.0|Not only is \\"It Tahes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back\\" the greatest rap album of all time,it is one of the greatest musical achievements in music history. Never has an album spoke to the problems of America so well. Chuck D touches on such subjects as drug use (on \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\"), jail (on \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\"), and FBI surveillance (on \\"Louder Than a Bomb\\"). The whole album has a rebellious feel to it. The Bomb Squad's production is wild, filled with wailing synths, sound clips, and heavy drum hits. There are scattered musical interludes, such as \\"Show 'Em Whatcha Got\\", which surprisingly add to the effect of the album. Towards the end of the LP is one of the greatest songs in hip-hop history, the epic \\"Rebel Without a Pause\\" which still sends shivers up my spine.<BR>The bottom line is this: any person who does not own this album can not call himself a true rap fan. With this album, Public Enemy achieved a pinnacle which many have tried to reach, but failed. This album will never be touched in terms of importance or sonic beauty.
B00004TH6O|4.0|There seems to be a definite hunger among rock fans/listeners for reference points and comparisons when one seeks to capture the sound (and feel) of a given band. Before even hearing Queens of the Stone Age, I culled, from divergent sources, the following musical comparisons: Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, The Cult, Danzig, Cream, Soundgarden, Motorhead, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Radio Head, The Stooges, Ozzy, Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet, Corrosion of Conformity, Marilyn Manson. Their music was alternately labelled \\"cocaine pop\\", \\"stoner metal\\", \\"stoner rock\\", \\"tripadelic metal\\", and \\"desert metal\\". Given the breadth of these descriptions of the QOTS sound and genre, and the fact I love many of the aforementioned bands, I was definitely intrigued and expected Rated R to wow me. <br />IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT. I was however, taken aback at first. Expecting to hear the saturnine, grinding and repetitive Iommiesque guitar riffs on every track, it took me about 6 listens to fully appreciate Rated R. The album simply defies pithy categorization, with nearly each song demonstrating a different genre. Rated R features:<br />(1) PUNKish jams in 'Feel Good Hit of the Summer' - the lyrics to which you can't help but smile knowlingly; and 'Quick and to the Pointless' - a Ballroom Blitz-type number complete with handclaps and a \\"yeah yeah yeah\\" cheerleader chorus); <br />2) trippy, PSYCHADELIC offerings 'Auto Pilot' - perhaps the album's only low-point, and 'Better Living Through chemistry' - an interesting track with fuzz guitar, excellent bass work and timeless percussion; <br />(3) POP. Yes, that's right. \\"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\\" is damn near a top-40 single. The song harkens back to Cream, features excellent vocals and a very catchy chorus. There's even a vibraphone thrown in which lends crispness to the overall sound; and \\"In the Fade\\", an excellent track featuring the Screaming Trees frontman on the vocals; <br />(4) ROCK. \\"Leg of Lamb\\" doesn't really fitany of the genres. It features a quirky guitar hook with a strident, minimalist solo which I think actually works. (some reviewers have described it as an aural equivalent to fingernails-on-chalkboard. To each his/her own I guess); \\"Monsters in the Parasol\\" - simple (yet effective) straight-forward rocker about hallucinations with humorous lyrics. <br />(5) ACOUSTIC/easy listening. Despite its evocative title, \\"Lightning Song\\" is an acoustic instrumental in the mold of a Zeppelin album filler - a kind of comic relief that's not very funny. This is the second disappointment on the album; and <br />(6) (you knew this was coming) METAL. I have found THE RIFF. When the UK rag NME called \\"Tension Head\\" one of the greatest rock songs ever \\"realised\\", I dismissed it as pure rhetorical hyperbole; Well, its not. This song begins with a biting, low-string guitar intro reminiscent of an accellerated \\"Into the Void\\" and morphs into an all-out speed metal assault in which the band's unsavory 'habits' (\\"hustlin' little girls\\", \\"I feel so...sick - on the bathroom floor\\") are chronicled in a breakneck race to the bottom.  The riff on 'Tension Head's is so good, so huge, so.......PERFECT for the type of song and its message, I think it ranks as one of the all-time best guitar songs despite a lack of an actual guitar solo.<br />Rated R's other hight point is the album's final track. \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" begins with a clean, haunting riff reminiscent of Soundgarden/Sabbath and picks up steam with brilliant use of steel drums, in which the percussionist displays an incredible ability to hit the \\"off notes\\" - something that I always marvelled at because so few people can do it. It takes incredible coordination and a near-perfect ear for music. Think Neil Peart. \\"I Think I Lost My Headache\\" is probably my second favorite track, next to \\"Tension Head\\" (in case you couldn't tell). The only disappointment is that the last few minutes of the song degenerate into a monotonous horn section which plays the riff over and over and which definitely detracts from a song that has all the makings of a magnum opus. I would have preferred if Mr. Homme and crew would have continued the song's guitar wizardry and flawless drumming through the end. So there you have it. 11 Songs with nearly as many genres. And 9 of the 11 are excellent songs. You must listen to this one several times before forming an opinion, however. Josh Homme cements his status a top-notch axeman despite Rated R's ironic dearth of actual soloing.

When I watched it I fell in love this was a remarkable movie about romance,friendship,and true love at first sight.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|In his commentaries, Baz Luhrmann is at great pains to justify every trick, gimmick and extravagance in terms of its service to The Story.<br />It's a pity then, that in this regard, what seems to have escaped his attention is the script itself. The slender plot could well have done with some of the savage editing applied so ruthlessly to the dance routines, and would have been better served by a running time closer to 80 minutes.<br />He also goofs by opening with the ending. He has a justification for this too, but it doesn't explain away the fact that it makes the story struggle to engage the audience who then see the simple mechanics of the plot laid bare. If you're going to take away with one hand the audience's anticipation of the ending, you have to offer them something interesting in return with the other, and he simply doesn't.<br />What he does offer us is a visual feast. From the conductor standing in front of the Fox logo at the beginning, Moulin Rouge remains one of the most inventive and beautiful films ever made. It's impossible to take it all in at one sitting, and while some of his visual conceits work better than others, the sheer quantity of imaginative touches is breathtaking. This results in some real highs: the danceadelic introduction of the Moulin Rouge itself provides an astonishing adrenaline rush, and the rooftop `Your Song' really flies with old-style musical romance.<br />But elsewhere, and at the crucial points, it all kind of gets in the way. We are constantly reminded-- and frequently for no very good reason-- that we are watching a film (see the gun clanking against the miniature Eiffel Tower). Ultimately, the film's cleverness, anachronisms, self-consciousness and eagerness to please have a distancing effect, holding the audience at arm's length outside the story while desperately trying to draw it in for its sentimental coda.<br />Moulin Rouge is half the experience it should have been, but the half that works is more than worth the asking price.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This is just a down right bad movie. I mean, they put a few teen pop-stars in it to get the teen population to come see it, and then they made it into a war movie. this cast of characters needs to be in some mtv movie. The information in the movie is way off... they have just disgraced the one of the biggest tragedies in US history by trying to make it ARMAGEDDON!! This movie is just down right horrible... i would NOT advise you to spend your time watching it.

1577311523|5.0|Eckhart Tolle elegantly walks the tightwire of truth in this prescriptive discourse on finding the path of enlightenment. While wise men know that \\"truth is a slippery fish\\", Eckhart manages to sustain clear focus on the most common areas of difficulty for spiritual seekers (such as ego idenfitication with the pain-body) without getting lost in the inherent fluidity of the topic of how to be here now.<br />THE POWER OF NOW is one of those books I read quickly, feeling that I am already aware of everything it says.  I had this same response to \\"Conversations with God\\", finding that it's contents were quite obvious to me already.  I am learning that when I have this reaction to a spiritual book, it indicates the book in question is destined for greatness!  POWER OF NOW is written in layman's terms about some of the most profound metaphysical and spiritual insights.<br />If you are interested in a clearer understanding of the true nature of one of the most fundamental dimensions in your life -- time -- I could not recommend a better book to get you started on your quest!  For those interested in deepening the understanding of this most mysterious thing, I'd recommend reading one of Tarthang Tulku's excellent books on space, time and knowledge.
B0000047EC|3.0|Unless i have a bad cd, this album does not do justice to the actual live production.  The sound is not crisp, and coming from Magnepans that is highly unusual...and in contrast, i absolutely love New Chattaqua and the Mays-Hall album.  I think they are very superior to this production, at least in the recording techniques.
B000002BUY|5.0|To be perfectly honest, after hearing Pardon Me, Drive, and Stellar, I thought of Incubus as nothing more than Fuel with a DJ.  Then I got my first taste of A Certain Shade of Green on the local radio station, and my view of Incubus was turned on its ear.  Then, after some suggestions by my friends, I went out and bought S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and it really shocked me.  The first song, Redefine, basically Redefined the image I had of Incubus (Pardon Me for the pun... oops, I'll stop it now.)  After listening the whole way through, I had mixed feelings.  Incubus had gone funk on me!  Of course, I instantly fell in love with Nebula (you would have to be crazy not to want to wander off into a nebula at some point) and Favorite Things.  The other songs, especially Redefine, took some getting used to.  But there was a point that I just snapped, and now I can't listen to Pardon Me, Drive, and Stellar the same way.  And that is one of my Favorite Things about Incubus.  (Okay, okay, I'm done.)
B00003OSSL|4.0|This film delves into the intensely personal and painful effects of betrayal in marriage. This is a tricky subject, and not naturally pleasant material in which to spend 2 hours of ones life and call it 'entertainment.' On the other hand, adultery and lack of commitment is so common, so pervasive in our culture that almost no one is untouched. So I give the director and all the actors credit for trying something different. As many of the reviews reflect, this film is not for everybody. For me it reflected the mystery and unpredictable nature of love and relationship. In particular the gradual unfolding of the complex and deceptive reality both unfaithful spouses lived (the secret apartment, for example) brought home the depths of deception to which we can descend in a marriage. I'm sure at some level they both believed they had a right to do what they were doing. Perhaps you 'had to be there' to enjoy this movie. I did.
B000002534|4.0|In the 1970s this album was greeted with some trepidation by Sanatana fans who feared that Carlos' recently found religious conversion would affect his music.<br />It did but not in the way people thought it would.<br />Religion permeates this album, most clearly in the lyrics which some can find a little in your face. It is also reflected in the music not only in the guitar solos but also throughout the band's playing. Quite simply it is joyous music and it is easy to feel the ecstasy in Carlos' playing.<br />Often compared with Caravanserai, Borboletta stands the tests of time much better. The songs are definitely stronger and the playing is much more passionate. While one cannot escape the religious aspects of the music it does not detract from it but is the glue that holds it together and essentially is the dominant theme of the album. In some respects some of the songs are transcendental in nature.<br />Personal favorite tracks are One with the Sun, Aspirations and Mirage although I like them all.<br />Carlos pulls out all the stops on this album and it shows.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Now I realize that this film is not going to be to everyones taste. I suppose that it will fall under the category of &quot;Cult Film&quot;, yet in my opinion, &quot;A.I.  Artificial Intelligence&quot; is one of the greatest science fiction films of the last ten years. In time it may very well be placed within the top twenty greatest Science Fiction films ever.If you want something that is thoughtful, imaginative, daring and unique for a film. This film  is a MUST SEE!Its a shame that the public wasn1t very receptive to this film last Summer, because they missed out on one of the better ones from 2001. Why? For a great many reasons. I wont go into more discussion over the fact that &quot;A.I.&quot; was the posthumous collaboration between Spielberg  and Kubrick. A lot of space has already been written  covering this fact.Many complained about the ending and the disjointed structure  of &quot;A.I.&quot;, yet if you give the film a chance and pay attention from the first frame, the film  does tie together and make sense. Frankly, the ending is one of the things that make it so strong. The film itself ties in well with Kubricks sensibility of Mode Shifting, in this respect &quot;A.I.&quot; is similar to &quot;2001&quot;.The films look at the mysticism of Fairy Tales is something that Kubrick must have wanted to address. &quot;A.I.&quot; is a parable about many issues, from parenthood and paternal instincts, to Religion, to hatred of people or things we don1t understand, to ecological issues, To questions about scientific ethics,  Above all, &quot;A.I.&quot; is about the simplest of all things, its message, its warning is be very careful, take care of the families that you create. It does have a challenging undercurrent of ideas, moments that are disturbing throughout viewing the film. From the Flesh Fair sequence, to Rouge City, to the underwater New York skyline  and the Excavation site ending.Jude Law and Francis O Connor do a wonderful job, yet it1s Haley Joel Osment who carries this film with an Astounding performance. I have been a fan of his since &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, yet he outdoes himself in the role of David. The rest of the cast fills out the film nicely, William Hurt, Sam Robards, Brendan Gleason, Jake Thomas, as well as voiceover cameos by Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and Chris Rock. Technically the film is nearly flawless, with a great production design, Januez Kaminsky1s cinemaphotography, some great robot designs by Stan Winston, including Teddy. The visual effects by I.L.M. are seamless and probably, in my opinion, some of the best work by George Lucas' company in awhile. No offense to Star Wars fans, but the effects in &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; pales in comparison to &quot;A.I.&quot;. John Williams score is one of the highlights of the film and one of his best since &quot;Close Encounters&quot;.The films ambition is something that isnt seen enough, it isnt much of a surprise that it had such a polarizing reaction with the viewing public last summer. The film was Kubricks concept, with Spielberg as its interpreter. After all, most of Stanley Kubricks films polarized the public upon their first theatrical release. Many still dont understand &quot;2001:A Space Odyssey.&quot;I should mention the DVD does a great job with the layout and progression of the documentary features. My only mild complaint is the omission of a director commentary.Can anyone really say that last summer1s remake of &quot;Planet Of The Apes&quot; will be something that will still be talked about, remembered and seen, twenty years from now?Can anyone really say that this years Oscar nominee &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; will be remembered in twenty years?  (No offense intended to Apes fans or fans of Ron Howards film.) I'm not really sure about that, Perhaps, Perhaps not. Yet I think &quot;A.I.&quot; will only grow in statue over time. That it will age better over time than its contemporaries. Much in the same way that Terry Gilliam1s &quot;Brazil&quot; or Ridley Scott1s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; are now seen in a very different light.&quot;A.I.&quot; is better with each successive viewing, get this film!
B000002ITW|4.0|... The album was made to be true to its time. Although I've always been a strongly devoted Neil Young fan, I enjoyed the days of the groups beginning as well as their separate albums  which made their return to each other all the more sweet and defining. Especially, at 47, because I began listening and seeing them as a group much younger than a lot of my fellow concert fans and later, individually, when I was able to truly appreciate the music and the lyrics. It's great to be able to raise that one clinched hand and the other hand, with 2 fingers signifying the feeling (or rush that some others prefer,) felt at the end of every live song.
0312243022|5.0|The revelations in this book, combined with a comforting empathy and confident prose, combine to make &quot;The Hours&quot; into an eye-clearing experience.<br />I've just finished it, and can't imagine concentrating on other works of fiction.<br />A truly seminal experience.
B00000IMTH|5.0|Undoubtably, my favorite release by Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. This disc features one hot song after another, combined with Blackmore's refined guitar work and Dio's energetic vocals. The entire band at this point was so good, LONG LIVE ROCK is a veritable feast for the listener's ear. Swords and Sorcery is alive and well here with great tracks like \\"Gates of Babylon\\" and \\"Kill the King\\". Dio's voice is supreme on \\"Long Live Rock N Roll\\". Other great songs are \\"Lady of the Lake\\", \\"LA Connection\\", and \\"Sensitive to Light\\".<br />If you've made it past FINYL VINYL and BEST OF RAINBOW, now it's time to pick up the best of what didn't make those discs. LONG LIVE ROCK...is the best start you can make to fill that hole in your collection. Truely a great disc!
B00003CXV4|1.0|I know lots of people liked this movie but, I for one did not.  It was very obvious within the first 10 minutes of this movie that you would know how it was going to end.  I don't know who pared up Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron but, they make a lousy couple.  They just don't click together.  There is no chemistry there.  I would recomend renting this one first before thinking about buying it.
B000001FQ4|4.0|In 1975, this was the first Thin Lizzy album I ever bought. I had been hearing a catchy tune called \\"It's Only Money\\" and I had to have it. The album totally caught me by surprize; as the band was quite good. This album would make me a Lizzy fan for life, but, I have to admit, the way they continually put out choice material helped a lot.<br />Back to this release, there are a number of very good songs here, including, \\"Still In Love With You\\", \\"Showdown\\", \\"Sha La La\\", and \\"Dear Heart\\". This release is where the twin guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson began the trademark that would mark the band throughout their career no matter who the guitarists were. As with most Thin Lizzy albums, there is a bit of Irish music, ballads, and, of course, some hot rockers.<br />Whether you are just looking for a taste of 70's rock and ballads, or, the turning point in a bands career, or just need all of Thin Lizzy's work, this is a must! The price here makes this disc all the more attractive...
B00005QZWI|4.0|First of all. I was SO enthralled with the movie and how the music seemed to fit every mood. The way Howard Shore was able to capture the essence of each scene was truly beautiful. And as much as I enjoy listening to this CD (I've had it a week and so far I have completely listen to it about half a dozen times) it has the same issue as almost every soundtrack. The music is based around 3 - 4 main themes, and depending on the screen action, it's mostly only the tempo that changes. This of course doesn't change the beauty of the music, just explains why the music begins to grow old quickly.<br />One thing I liked about Shores music here is how he chose certain styles for different characters. For instance, the Hobbits are represented by an almost Irish folk style. Beautiful yet solitary in sound and mood. Also the two songs included here by Enya match well. Her voice adds vocal expression to a wonderful melody.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys beautiful orchestral music. Although I probably will stop listening to this for awhile I will most definitely keep revisiting it.
B000001ES9|4.0|The very begining of the Rush epic, but hey, there's no Neil Peart, just some guy named Rutsey. Undeniably this is a different sounding Rush, but this is the band in its prehistoric state. There are many unforgetable songs here that were showcased in many a live set. Geddy's original screeching vocals and Alex Lifeson's unmistakeable guitar work are still here, but the drummer, although good, is not Neal by a longshot.<br />Some of the songs that we all know are &quot;Working Man', &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. My favorite from the set, though, is &quot;Take A Friend&quot;. Despite being a Rush many fans are unfamiliar with, the album still rocks and has many great moments before they would depart into the sci-fi realm most of us came to love and expect. This disc just doesn't quite stack up against 2112, CARESS OF STEEL, A FAREWELL TO KINGS, GRACE UNDER PRESSURE, and others, so, I have limited it to a strong 4, but it is still an important part of any Rush collection.

0375507507|4.0|Alexandra Fuller has written an unsentimental, darkly funny memoir about growing up as a white settler in Africa during the midst of change.  <BR>Fuller describes civil war, poverty (her own family's, as well as the Africans who live near them), and the loss of her family's farm without self-pity or apology.  <BR>The lure, as well as the dangers, of the ex-patriot lifestyle are evident in each event.  Fuller's descriptions of her mother's alcohoism, and battle with mental illness  evoke empathy for the family.
B000001FQQ|2.0|I may have to change my rating to 3 stars, or at least 2 and a<br />half, for there really are some GREAT songs here. The previous<br />two KISS albums were pathetic and probably had a total of only<br />two good songs between 'em. ON HOT IN THE SHADE, KISS started<br />going back in the right direction, if not musically, at least<br />lyrically. To be honest, I can't recall how much of the second<br />half of this album sounds, but the first half contains three<br />of the greatest songs to appear on a KISS album in a very long<br />time. RISE TO IT, starting out with some slide guitar work from<br />BRUCE KULICK, is a rousing riff rocker in the tradition of older<br />KISS songs like LOVE GUN and I STOLE YOUR LOVE, with a very powerful vocal from PAUL STANLEY. The first time I heard FOREVER<br />was at a WEDDING, for pete's sake and I love the heck out of it!<br />Tis one of my favorite power ballads ever.I also really like BRUCE KULICK'S acoustic<br />guitar solo on it, which sounds very much like JIMMY PAGE'S solo<br />for THANK YOU! NICE SONG! SILVER<br />SPOON is another ROUSING RIFF ROCKER and contains one of my<br />favorite lyrics by PAUL STANLEY(\\" in the city where the buid-<br />ings rise, I was just another face...), that part!<br /> The rest isn't quite as spectacular, but...you can't have every-<br />thing....where would you put it?
B00003CWL6|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever but the dvd?  Very disappointing, mainly because the director speaks of an alternate ending but it is nowhere to be found.  Actually there isn't even one deleted scene either, and this is one of the movies that I would have loved to been able to see what was cut.  I can only hope that there will be another edition released.
B00005N83M|4.0|A lot of people criticise this album for having too many songs that aren't worth the money. I agree, but not on such a massive scale. Most of this album it's fine (mostly the first half) songs like 'Love Don't Cost A Thing' and 'Ain't It Funny' stick out as being the major smashes on the album, with their catchy lyrics and heavy beats, but don't overlook the rest of the album. Songs like 'Carino', 'Play' and 'That's Not Me' also have their moments, but mostly suffice as background music. A few of the songs on this album should have been overlooked completely (I'll let you decide them for yourself) but if you check out the last part of the album you'll find some slow and sexy jams like 'Come Over' which is my faivorite songs on the album, as it displays J Lo's true vocal talent. I also like the Murder Remix of I'm Real with Ja Rule because you can hear the Ja Rule touch through the song. Overall, try it out before you criticise it, and if at first you don't succeed, dust the album off and try again.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great features, I already have this on tape from when I was young but decided to get the dvd so I would have it to show to my kids someday.  Watching it I realized that they would probably be bored with this, seeing as how far animation has come.  Still, it was a classic of my childhood and I look forward to boring my grandchildren about how cartoons used to be.
0920668364|2.0|This book is full of dark symbolism. It is about a mother who sneaks into her little boys room to watch him go through puberty while he sleeps. She sometimes picks him up and sings to him. When he is an adult, we see that he sleeps in a single bed, meaning he never got married. Soon afterwards mom comes and pays a late night visit...she uses a ladder to crawl into his room. Shortly thereafter you see the son with a baby, but no wife, yep mother and son have produced an offspring????<br />Later, after mother ages quite a bit, we see a strange picture where the son is cradling her next to his breast singing that sinister lullaby.<br />Very campy stuff!!!
068485743X|3.0|Any time you can get information from an editor of a book, by all means, go for it.  This book is written by an editor so one would hope you would get some insight to getting published. And you do. That is, you do if you haven't already read a number of other books on writting. Funny thing is, most books on writing tell you the same stuff, and this one is no different than, Writing the Blockbuster Novel, How to Write a Damn Good Novel, Self Editing for Fiction Writers and the such.  I would recommend to you, the aspiring novelist to READ THIS BOOK, but also to read two others: Elements of Style (type that into the search window on Amazon, its by Strunk and White) and On Writing, a Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King.  Great book on what to do and what not to do.
6300185249|5.0|i did'nt see this movie until several years after it's release and consequently missed all the \\"professional critics\\" reviews. i am glad, otherwise i might have missed the funniest movie i have ever seen. tom hanks was awesome in his portrayal of a man sucked into a never ending nightmare with one diaster after another. his reactions as the situation worsens had me rolling on the floor laughing my head off. while the critics may think it poorly directed/acted, having no redeeming social value or deeper meaning, it is a truly entertaining film-watch it on a gray day and it will brighten your whole day. i hope they release it on dvd so i can definitely add it to my collection!!!
0553573403|4.0|This story was like a mix of Fiest, Goodkind, and Jordan -but maybe better.  The story was well told and then characters were first rate. He goes into more of established cities and lands like in Fiest, and has a wide open epic like Goodkind and Jordan.  What I really liked abou this book was the way the magic took a backseat. It was well put into the story, but didn't over power it.  Unfortunately for Mr. R.R. Martin, I have weaned (sp?) myself off of all multiple book sagas until the last one comes out, and then I read them all at once. (Thank you Mr. Robert Jordan and Mr. Terry Goddkind.) I find I have such a busy life, I forget what happened in the books prior.  Maybe that's my fault for being a bad reader, or maybe thats the writer's fault for not writing memorable fiction.
6304595247|5.0|This version differs from other movie versions of this book by actually following the complete story. Very few liberties are taken in changing the storyline and the changes do not adversely affect the story. Both lead actors are strong and convincing. This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen in any genre. Parts actually brought me to tears and I am a person who is rarely moved by any drama. If you want a version that more accurately follows the book and really brings out the essence of this great novel, this is the version to watch.
0671024256|5.0|Let me tell you something, I have read a BUNCH of books on how to write a novel.  This book told me more than any of those other books and much of what the other books left out, this book  gave me.  It also goes into detail on King's life. Excellent. I cried while reading it, and that is rare for me.  Even if you dont want to learn how to write, read the beginning of the book for the story, its great.  I dont give out 5 star reviews every day, but this one deserves it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor was a great movie it was a  romance,action,comedy,and basically horror film all in one.It was a great movie and Ben Affleck and his best friend in the movie look and act alot better than the sorry Leonardo Decaprio in Titanic.I think this movie should make it to the movie awards along with winning first place.
B000002J1C|5.0|There are a few records that define their moment with utter clarity, and this is one. Like Revolver, The Madcap Laughs, The Land of Grey and Pink, Pawn Hearts, Nursery Cryme, Another Green World, Hunky Dory, Electric Warrior, and others, The Yes Album is quintessential and unique. No question, 30 years is nothing to this album. But to really get it, you had to hear it in 1971.<br />Bruford's drumming literally knocked you down - every listen gave you another &quot;how did he do THAT?&quot; Squire's snarling play sang and elevated the bass to a lead role - the most melodic bass playing next to Richard Sinclair you'd ever heard by then. Brittle then fluid, jagged then round, franatic then calm, Howe redefined rock guitar. Kaye's keyboards are still closer to rock than the later classical discipline of Wakeman, and his work travels from support to the front, shadow to light, adding dimension where it's needed. On top, Anderson's maturing writing and vocals brought glimpses of poetry and a language the began a more phonetic link to the overall sound. Individually it could seem that they were playing in different directions, different spaces. Yet the whole is light as air, bright as the sun and perfectly solid.<br />This was new music, authentically new. Complex  and accessible, contrapuntal and straight-ahead, there were no words up to describing what was going on here. Take it apart, put it together. Pick a favorite track then discover something new and change your mind. It doesn't matter. With &quot;The Yes Album&quot; things changed. Importantly, the work on this record stands at the boundary between innovation and innocence, and is all the more powerful for the fact that it is free of the sometimes confusing and cumbersome concepts that shaped future releases. The focus was more completely on the music and less on peripheral concerns.<br />It came from nowhere and set a new reference point for the decade. For a while you could set aside Schizoid Man or balk at the tulmult of A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers. You could compare the brilliant recording quality of Yours is no Disgrace to the muddiness of The Knife. The Yes Album seemed to outshine them all.<br />Today, there's a better sense of balance, but the fact remains that The Yes Album was a revolution. Purposeful, dynamic, intricate and accessible, recognizeable and completely unique. This gave us all the intelligence and passion we sought in music.tulmult of A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers.

B000007MVM|5.0|There is no question that Syd cuts a fascinating figure, full of loss and mystery. But, set the personality stuff aside - something you should do with everything you listen to - and pay attention to the music.<br /><br />First and foremost, intentionally or not, Syd's lyrics are high art. Not self-conscious, referential and elitist nonsense. These lyrics are poetry, and poetry can only result from experience. We don't need to know or speculate about that experience, we need only comprehend that it somehow resulted in some amazing work.<br /><br />The music is the perfect match for the words. The feeling of accident, of the joy of finding the right note and the frustration of being just sharp or just flat, a split-second early or a half-second late, is all there to hear. It brings a remarkable one-to-one feel to the music, somewhere between the rehearsed and the improvised, and it never comes off as self-conscious or calculated.<br /><br />What are the influences? I can't detect any -- short of the James Joyce poem made into the song \\"Golden Hair\\". Has anyone else ever given us this specific combination of intent and accident? None that I'm aware of. The Madcap Laughs and Barrett both work because the artist we're listening to is a natural at what he does. Whether the drugs heightened his ability or killed it hardly matters now. The work is still here, still with us and like all lasting art, it resists classification and interpretation. Let's just say that whatever life brought to Syd, his particular nervous system had a singular way of transforming it into the transparent and immediate experience of a music all his own.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Just old enough to renember the 40's and the ethics of those days...renembering also my father's words..the movie gives a flash back to the abundant courage and stamind of the depression kids...that generation saw it and loved it all...why not just enjoy it for the robust chemistry it has.
014028902X|5.0|This is my favourite book, bar none. I first studied it in school which should have been a reason for disliking it; instead I have fallen in love with Durrell's autobiographical description of his somewhat dysfunctional family, their gang of eccentric friends, and the fauna and flora he studies and collects ardently and for the seemingly magical island of Corfu. Overall a hillarious and very warmly and beautifully written book. My only regret is in not having a similarly magical childhood.
0897500482|5.0|As a child, I watched Bruce Lee movies without knowing much about the man. I thought that he was a talented martial artist; however, never knew his life philosophy. Unfortunately, the mainstream media rarely shared his insights with the public. When he died tragically, much of his life outside of the fighting or movie arenas remained an enigma.<br /><br />The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is much more than a martial arts book. Within its covers, the reader will enjoy the considerable intellect of Mr. Lee. He was a gifted writer and student of life. His undergraduate studies were in Philosophy, but this book is not a ambiguous spiritual odyssey. He provides many thought provoking quotes; however, they are not vague generalizations. His words imbue the same force as one of his legendary punches or kicks.<br /><br />This book contains excellent illustrations, along with Mr. Lee's own handwritten notes. I thought those were the most compelling feature of this work. You can feel his spirit through his words, and to see them in the original script only reinforces their message.<br /><br />He compiled much of this book while flat on his back with an injury. But as his wife, Linda, poignantly observed, his mind never stopped working. He was dedicated to his art, and this book is his legacy. One quote stands out: \\"Our sense of power is more vivid when we break a man's spirit than when we win his heart, for we can win a man's heart one day and lose it the next. But when we break a proud spirit, we achieve something that is final and absolute.\\"<br /><br />Thank you for the opportunity to review this book.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|How could this film be any better? The moment when Ewan Macgregor first sings a line to Nicole Kidman and her eyes light up I was hooked.

B00005UKKF|3.0|Im a huge Britney fan but I honestly have to say she didnt throw in any extras for the money you spent. Seriously if you know someone who has HBO just tape it. I spent the cash assuming it would be like OTOWN where they at least say thanks for buying the video and show them a lil backstage but it wasnt. Being a Britt fan if you saw the show you already have seen the tape.<BR>Its ok if your obsessed but if you dont throw money away dont buy it.
0312937385|3.0|This is only the 2nd book I read from the Ender series but I think I much prefer reading Ender's Game than having to read this again. The book lacks action and drama. Speaker is told with compassion and is a power sequel to Ender's Game but Like I said, I much rather read Ender's Game. IF you wanted to read Xenocide, you got to read this.:-(
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is an incredibly dark, comedic, and somber film that largely lacks in linear narrative, but covers its ground well with a stunningly original plot and quirky, tone-shifting atmosphere.  At any one moment, you could be howling with laughter, staring in disbelief, or form goosebumps from overall creepiness.  The most satisfying fact is that it is all done extraordinarily well, servicing up what is--in my opinion--one of the best build-ups and conclusions I've seen in a film since SEVEN.<br />The movie is nothing like SEVEN.  It is the story of a 1988 teenager named Donnie Darko.  While at first seeming to have the cliched problems of teen angst and a dysfunctional family, his world slowly opens up to someone with a deep, psychological malfuntion.  He takes commands from a giant rabbit while sleepwalking.  One night, while out talking to this rabbit, he is told that the world is coming to an end in 28 days.  While he is out that evening, a jet engine that fell off an aircraft destroys his room.<br />That's all I'll say as far as plot, and I only have said that much because it all happens in the first fifteen minutes.  After that is a mystical journey through Donnie's mind.  While serving up a ton of foreshadowing and plot devices (which seem pointless until the film concludes), writer/director Richard Kelly gracefully churns out political satire, comedy, and insightful views on human nature and teenage rebellion.  I was also impressed by how well the characters developed, no matter how small or insignifican their roles seem to be.  They're all important in the overall scope of the film.<br />Like I said earlier, this movie does lack a linear narrative.  However, I feel that is overshadowed by how well it covers all the issues it presents.  This is a hard thing to do, but it is occasionally done really well (MAGNOLIA, SHORT CUTS).  The conclusion is something that will probably turn this into a bit love/hate film, if you throw things like implausibility and suspension of disbelief.  However, I am a big fan of such things, and I am tired of cash-filled, gutless Hollywood endings which are geared towards profitibility.  <br />This film is risky, but made with some incredibly promising talent.  I, for one, love it for everything it is.
0790736039|4.0|I saw &quot;IT&quot; for the first time yesterday and I still feel strange.<BR>There is only one thing floating in my head, I want to see this movie again now! To see for the second time Pennywise saying &quot;You all taste sooooooo much better when you're afraid!&quot;, this frightened me so much that I couldn't sleep at night and now I feel this need of seeing all the movie again but I rented it so I won't have this chance...too bad. But I recommand to everybody to read the book first, if you see the movie before reading the book, you will know the punch of the end(even if the end of the book is far much better, the monster is the same). This movie takes almost all the best parts of the book and add news too, the biggest difference is that Pennywise appears a lot more in the movie(and this is not bad at all, he's so scary when he shows his sharp teeth). I was also happy to see that there wasn't so much blood(I hate bloody movies). The only poor thing is the end but the rest is great(particulary the first part).<BR>So if you're a Stephen King fan, rent or buy &quot;IT&quot; fast!
B00005T30L|5.0|I didn't think I was gonna fall in love with this movie like I did...I rented it, and totally couldnt get my mind off it..so I went out and bought the dvd to add to my collection!! Thora Birch gave such a wonderful performance of Enid a girl who stands out in the world..I loved every movie she has been in since Hocus Pocus..she's a really talented actress. Once you see this movie you will be amazed on a great film..which was made out of a comic book! Found out if Enid gets her wish that she wanted at the end!...
B000002GQL|5.0|I have all of the Moody's albums, and the first seven - before the break up - are much better that after they reformed.  While there are exceptions, Pat Moraz's style was just too flamboyant for the Moodys.  Not that he isn't a virtuoso - just a much more agressive style than Mike Pinder.  All of the songs on &quot;Sojourn&quot; are well concieved and executed.  Very well done.<br />Also, if you like the Moodys, especially the orchestrated sound, then &quot;Blue Jays&quot; by Heyward &amp; Lodge is also excellent.  Not a bad song on it.
1556154844|4.0|I don't particularly enjoy reading thick books unless they are of reference type. This is a pretty thick book for the subject but overall it is worth it because it can be used as a reference tool.<br />The examples are very light on object oriented content and heavy on procedural language examples such a 'C'. There is no Java (didn't exist) and the tools noted are definatly of an older generation. <br />However this is an excellent read and should be on everyone's &quot;...on a slow rainy day I would do this...&quot; list.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This CD is essential...let's face it Madonna is essential.  GHV2 proves that no matter what, this superstar ain't going down.  I have no need for new Madonna music on this album, these 15 songs are so fabulous...why waste space?  One of my favorite things about this CD is the inclusion of some lesser(but still fabulous)Madonna tracks, any fan would include &quot;Drowned World/Subsitute For Love&quot;(cause we are living it right?), &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and of course the diva fest of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot;.  I do take issue with the truncated version of &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;...Madonna honey, don't try to fool me.  That is one editing mess that was DOA.  GHV2 delivers the songs that Madonna will be most remembered for, some sweet, some sassy, but all of them Madonna.
B00005Y1Y3|4.0|It's been a while since The Doors' actually released NEW material. Oh sure they've released new albums (well, new Best Of collections with songs we already have), new DVDs (that great tribute VH1 special with Creed, The Cult etc.) but fans were always wondering what happened with all the unreleased live material. Well, The Doors have given us an answer with their new record label, Bright Midnight, on which they plan to release every single complete concert over the next several years. Here we get their sampler, &quot;Live In America.&quot; It is one of the best Doors CDs to buy right now if you already have the other albums and collections. It contains some truly rare performances and it is refreshing to hear stuff we haven't heard before (unless you got a bunch of bootlegs). &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is still a fun tune and here we get a pretty good performance of it. The version here of &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; is one of the more passive performances, but with a nice bluesy atmosphere powered by Robby Krieger's edgy riffs. &quot;Five To One&quot; is not as edgy, but still in your face. &quot;Break On Through&quot; is as always exhilarating and active. But the true gems here are the songs we really HAVEN'T gotten live before. &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; is dreamy and soft with Ray Manzarek's organ which stands out here and we get some of Jim Morrison's best poetry. &quot;Touch Me&quot; is absolutely cool considering all the jazzy, orchestra elements were taken out and it just sounds like rock n' roll. A disappointment is the &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; track, which is a poor, muffled recording that is of real grainy quality, the version in &quot;In Concert&quot; is better. In fact, a lot of the songs in &quot;In Concert&quot; are better than the tracks here. But still, this is a CD worth getting for any true Doors fan. &quot;The End&quot; is a poetic trip, a little more menacing than the usual live material we've heard. &quot;Live In America&quot; is a sampler and it makes you get interested in what's coming up next. The music of The Doors remains timeless as does the influence and here is some new recordings to add to the legend.
B000001DTM|5.0|I can't say I am a true U2 fan. In fact, I am more a Reggae fan. But I do own four of their albums. Good music, after all, is good music.  And these guys are incredible.  The albums I own are: The Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB)and, quite recently, I bought Achtung Baby. <br />About Achtung Baby: the style is different from The Joshua Tree and ATYCLB. But this is an exceptional album. All the songs are good. All except \\"One.\\" \\"One\\" is an EXCEPTIONAL song. Perhaps their best song. Period. You cannot help but be moved by this song. The album would be worth its price if that were the only good song on it. <br />But there are 12 good songs here. My personal favorites besides One are: So Cruel, Mysterious Ways, Love Is Blindness, and Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World. <BR> <BR>I don't think there is anyone out there with Bono's gift for writing lyrics. And his voice is in top form on this album. Look, I can go on and on. Just get this album. You will not regret it.
6305922756|5.0|I've nothing to add about the quality of this picture - without a doubt it's the funniest rock spoof of all time (well, it's not exactly hard, is it? Can you think of another one that's actually funny?), but for my money I can't think what beats it for the title of funniest movie of all time, bar none.<br />I'm curious, though, that a couple of people mark it down as seeming 'tame' compared to what rock bands do now. Come again? Surely this misses the point? Spinal Tap was, and is, a dead-eye satire; it was not intended to be overblown at all. This is why so many people (including me, first time) didn't realise it was a spoof and consequently rated it a dull documentary about a bad band - it's completely on the money.<br />The bands of the seventies really did all this stuff - a lot of it is based on recorded fact. What is more amazing - and more telling, is that bands since haven't stopped! Bands STILL have umlauts over the wrong letters (Queensrÿche!), they STILL record experimental jazz concept albums (Radiohead!), they STILL release albums with black on black covers (Metallica!).<br />This film functions as a handy reference point for when rock bands can still be taken seriously and when they have gone over the edge into parody. All you have to do is ask: could Spinal Tap have done that?<br />So: Eric Johnston claims to be able to be able identify the brand of battery in his distortion pedal by the sound it produces. Sensible, or Tapular? TAPULAR!<br />Steve Vai plays a seven string guitar. On an album called Passion and Warfare. Sensible or Tapular? TAPULAR!<br />Radiohead insist on playing in their own tent so no corporate sponsors can advertise. sensible or Tapular? TAPULAR!<br />And you know what? the cucumber scene isn't even nearly the funniest. The little vignettes are what make tap so rewarding to rewatch. Every time you'll pick up a new point.  Nigel (from Squatney!) takes a cue off Jimmy Page, but plays hisguitar solo not with a violin bow, but a violin! And then stops and tunes it half way through! Genius!<br />Truly, truly inspired.iolin! And then stops and tunes it half way through! Genius!<br />Truly, truly inspired.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of the most original and distinctive vocal albums I have heard in a long time.  There is no pre-packaged, orchestrated sound on this album.  The recording quality and instrumentation make you feel as though Ms. Jones and company are in your living room.  Ms. Jones' voice is simply haunting, with tinges of Bonnie Raitt and Billy Holiday.  Madeleine Peyroux is the only vocalist who comes to mind whose voice is such a gumbo of styles.  It is amazing that someone so young could sound so mature.  Ms. Jones' piano work is as original as her vocals.  She is as smooth as a good strong port.  It is hard to characterize this album as far as style.  I found it in the pop section, but only one listening to her rendition of Hank Williams' Cold Cold Heart made clear that she has some very deep jazz roots.  The album is worth buying for this harmonically amazing version of a counrty standard.  It is every bit the equal of Cassandra Wilson's version of So Lonesome I Could Cry.  I am stopping now to put this one back on again.  Give me another glass of port, please.
0140277447|4.0|The Rape of Nanking : The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II by Iris Chang is at times a very difficult but necessary read.  Ms. Chang dramatically describes the brutal decimation of a city in such graphic terms that it is often necessary to put the book down.  As a frequent reader of histories of the Germany's war crimes I believed that I had read about the worst acts that one person can perpetrate against another, but I was horrified by what I read.  Hannah Arendt's description of the German death camps as the \\"banality of evil\\" certainly applies to the conduct of the Japanese in Nanking.  <br />The strength of the book is not in the details of the massacre.  While they are described in explicit detail and in such a way as to properly portray the horror of the occupation, the book excels when Ms. Chang moves on to discuss the attempts of the Japanese ruling structure to commit the \\"Second Rape of Nanking,\\" or the suppression of the actual events.  Ms. Chang does a splendid job of juxtaposing Germany's self examination of its role in the holocaust to the almost absolute failure of the Japanese ruling structure to even acknowledge that a massacre occurred, much less the horrifying scale.  <br />The events in Nanking are not isolated historical events.  The systematic rape of tens of thousands of women, the execution of hundreds of thousands of prisoners, the purposeful destruction of homes are not confined to several months of 1937 in Nanking.  The events in the former Yugoslavia make this point undebatable.  The failure of the Japanese to come to grips with the Rape of Nanking, and the world's acquiescence in this self denial, unfortunately makes the next massacre more likely.  It was Hitler who in announcing his war against the Jews told his fellow Nazis that they should have nothing to fear from the world's reaction by asking the question: Who remembered the Turkish massacre of the Armenians?  The lesson of Ms. Chang's book is that we ignore the events in Nanking at our own risk.<br />The book is written for the general public and is not an academic treatise.  For the serious student of the Massacre, it is only a start.  However, the book is well written, and except for the horrific descriptions of the killings and rapes, very<BR>readable.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an incredible movie that many people did not give a chance. It is a beautiful love story and musical, and Nicole Kidman (Satine) and Ewan McGregor (Christian) not only act but sing, really showing how talented they are. Through a course of mistaken identities, Satine, the Moulin Rouge's hot commodity, and Christian, a poor and naive writer, meet and eventually fall in love. Neither of them know that Satine has TB and is slowly dying. Satine's affections are also being \\"bought\\" by the man who is funding her first big show, which is her chance to get out of the Moulin Rouge. He doesn't know about Christian and when he finds out about him is ruthless in trying to get rid of him. It IS fast paced, but if you keep up through some of the beginning turbulence, the story really draws you in. I laughed and cried! It was a real movie experiance. It might not be for everyone, but you never know until you try. I'm 14, and I loved it! You have to see this movie!
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is such a special treat. Many did not like it.  I did, and I enjoyed the visual display, sifting through scenes to catch a \\"Kubrick\\" moment.  It is obvious Spielberg, who was supposed to collaborate on this project with the late Stanley Kubrick, left in many of his trademark touches.  Yes, it IS about robots and really spectacular effects, but, the real underlying message here is love. \\"David\\" the A.I. robot designed after the creator's dead son(his image) is as human as any natural child. The difference between him and the usual Mecha(regular robots) is that David feels Love. He comes to be the charismatic \\"replacement child\\" for a young couple who's son seems terminally ill. Martin, the son is never expected to wake from a coma-like state. David is a prototype used to give a grieving parent like Monica a chance at love again. The young \\"boy\\" rapidly becomes part of his new family. However, to his horror and chance he eventually finds himself left on a roadside because his Mommy must rid herself of him. Martin revived, returned home and a few coincidences and accidents later David is unwanted.<br /> The next chapter of this story has a really interesting \\"Blade Runner\\" feel to it. David is determined to make himself a real boy. Monica once read him the story of \\"Pinnochio\\" and David believes, now abandoned, that he must search and find the blue fairy so he will be real and his Mommy, Monica will love him again. David's search takes him to many places, meeting frightening and sometimes helpful people. His pal in crime happens to be an old-model \\"love\\" robot played by Jude Law, a very tongue-in-cheek, sexy, washed-up mechanical ladies' man. Together they must escape capture and many human enemies to help David find his fairy tale \\"blue fairy\\".<br /> The beginning, middle, and end of this movie are very different from one another. They seem like different movies all tied together with ease and many heart-warming moments. The ending was bizarre, but having seen this movie twice, I decided it was more thought-provoking than unrelated. Performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law were beyond remarkable. This was no surprise to me. The movie is packaged with two discs...one, being the movie. The other disc having an abundance of fabulous cast, movie, and special effects extras. It is definately worth watching. As for the movie in whole, I give it five starts. I love a flick that can force me to feel many emotions in an hour or two...The hallmark of a job well done...
B00003CXXP|1.0|What happens when you take the worlds most over-rated artist and have him try his very best to create the work of a genius?  You get this absolute piece of crap that we call Artificial Intelligence.  Stanley Kubrick created the idea for the film, and the idea is not a bad one.  The main problem is that Speilberg decided to write it.  Now, Steven Speilberg is not an intellectual at all which would be a requirement of the writer if this movie were to successfully present itself.  Also, it seems that instead of following his own thoughts for the film, Speilberg must have said to himself, \\"Hmmmmm.  I better try to be like Stanley and so i'll make this movie as dark as I can with a few touches of my E.T. type sweetness.\\"<BR>Problems with this:<BR>A.  There is so much more to Stanley Kubrick's art than just \\"darkness.\\"<BR>B.  Speilberg couldn't make a good dark movie if his life depended on it. (and I mean Clockwork Orange/Taxi Driver type dark i.e. Schindler's List isn't included.  I say this not wanting you assuming that I didn't like Schindler's because I liked it very much.)  Speilberg is a good director, but he isn't infallible, especially as a writer it seems.<BR>C.  His love is real.....he is not.  Sound's like a cute movie does it not?  Oh the childish, heart-warming joy that comes from watching Haley Joel Osment violently decapitating himself. (See the movie to understand what i said, or better yet don't see it and cheat yourself out of a fun-loving family film......NOT!)<br />The final result of A.I. is a three hour long movie that is so annoying you that the amazing visual spectacles arent even enough to stop you from at the very least wanting to leave the theater/burn the DVD.  The jumps from intensely creepy to teary-eyed-teddy-bear cuteness are simply too much for anyone who is of a sound mind to take.  The first 45 minutes of the movie are so unbelievably fake that its painful to watch. My favorite example of this is when the robot kid eats spaghetti in a funny but not comical way, the parents laught at him, and then they give eachother this look like, \\"maybe we should keep him after all.\\"  Give me a freakin' break.<br />For all you people who loved this movie, go ahead and love it.  But realize that you are a slave to the few words that read, \\"A Steven Spielberg film.\\"  I say this because I feel that the only reason one might have for enjoying this movie is if they have some twisted blind obsession with Speilberg.<br />The one star I gave this movie is shared by Stanley Kubrick and Jude Law.  For his few on screen moments, Jude Law  did what he could to save this movie, but it was ultimately all in vain, and Kubrick had the right intentions with this futuristic Pinochio tale and, sadly, he died before he could see it through to the end.
006092988X|5.0|even though i'm 12, i've found this book to be amazing.  it first appealed to me at a family friends's house at the age of nine.  i find it hard to believe that a book can be read at least 10 times.  now, my class is reading it and we all love it.  we analyze every single chapter to the point, and i absolutely love this book.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I loved the books, I LOVED thembut you're not going to listen to this review anyway because im one of the few who didn't like it. But This movie was rushed, it kicked everytihng up to fast speed to get it done in time. I tried while watching it to enjoy it, but it just didnt happen Little neeeds to be said about it, you can read other reviews. But LISTEN dont put too much stock in what the fans say. They are all Book fan yes men, who like the movie just because it is harry potter. I am an avid reader and have seen many good book movie adaptation, and this isnt one of them. If you want to see a movie based on a book, go see Lord of the Rings or anytihng by John Grisham. So im not bias this is a fair review by someone who really reallly wanted to love this film. SO take my advice and dont just love the name Harry Potter, open your eyes and read the books again if you have to<br />My Problem isnt that it was cut or it didnt have all the book material in it. It just didnt capture the essence of the story, the casting is horrendous, the acting is worse, and the story was told all wrong. Sorry I know you wont listen to me, you see all these other shallow reviews of Potter Maniacs and you WILL beleive them, I know I would, but I went to the theater with all open minded fans, and they all hated it. I have seen it twice in hopes to like it upon second viewing, NOPE<br />This is a good childrens movie, but \\"the emporers new grrove\\" or classics like \\"the Wizard of OZ\\" were MUCH MUCH better E.T is coming back to theaters go see that, buy it on DVD with the money you saved by renting Harry Potter instead of buying it.
0446310786|5.0|I had to read To Kill a Mockingbird for school, but I quickly found myself caught up in it. I got so involved in it that I finished it within a week that our class started it, well ahead of schedule. I was surprised how connected I felt to some of the characters by the end of the book, specifically Atticus and Scout. The symbolism of the mockingbird is first mentioned early in the book, chapter 10, but it wasn't until the very end that the full force of it hit me. Scout's wisdom when she said \\"Well it'd be sort of like shootin' a mockingbird, wouldn't it?\\" impressed me with how much she had matured throughout the book, along with the last chapter. <br />Altogether I thought that this really was a book that made me think differently after I read it. Atticus's wisdom throughout the book made me think quite a lot and I think I'll view the mockingbirds of our society a little differently from now on.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has burst onto the pages of Rolling Stone and so will soon burst forth from obscurity as his name spreads like wildfire all over my highschool as the downloading of his songs begin.  Hopefully most of those downloaders will eventually buy this album which is a beautiful combonation of Jack Johnson, Jude, and Dave Matthews.  Although Mayer's lyrics often give away his young age and lack complexity, his musical talent is evident and his passion about his music is clear.  His sexy vocals, sexy lyrics, and wonderfully upbeat and nostalgic songs immediatly hooked me.  \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" is by far the best song on the disc, romantic, sexy, and soulful.  I can't wait to go see him on his US tour.  This is a necessary CD (and soon to be famous artist) for any listeners of GOOD music!
B000000WJK|5.0|Try listening to `A Storm In Heaven' through headphones whilst lying back on your bed drinking tea.  The waves of sound will flow through you and without realising it; the album will have played itself out with the parting message `See You In The Next One (Have a Good Time)'.<BR>   Strangers to the genre (Like I was) may require a couple of listens before their resistance is completely broken down. However, once your mind has been set free from this cynicism, the album will open up and now reveal its true self.  A Storm In Heaven is a magical album, I only wish that The Verve had retained the same ethereality in their later efforts.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|This CD was recommended on a foreign language teacher's listserv, and when I first played it I was completely blown over! I felt tingles down my spine listening to Bruno Pelletier's \\"Le temps des cathédrales.\\" (I just received another of his CD's that are thankfully available on Amazon.) This guy has a voice that's to die for! \\"Bohémienne\\" is another favorite; in fact, I love them all!... I'm going to buy another copy for a gift!<br />If you love musicals in general, you'll love this one, even if you don't understand French! Great music transcends borders!
B00005JKYS|5.0|I live with a Vietnam Vet who served in the late 1960s with 1st Cav. Medivac. During service he earned two Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal.  Since WE WERE SOLDIERS concerns the 1st Cav., Randy wanted to see it.  I reluctantly agreed; I am not partial to war films and I dislike Mel Gibson, and Randy is very hard on Vietnam War films.  He dismisses PLATOON as a Hollywood 8x10 glossy; says APOCALYPSE NOW is an interesting movie that captures the paranoia, but all the technical details are wrong; and describes DEER HUNTER as excellent in its depiction of the strangeness of coming home but so full of plot holes that he can hardly endure it.  And about one and all he says: \\"It wasn't like that.\\"<br />He was silent through the film, and when we left the theatre I asked what he thought.  He said, \\"They finally got it.  That's what it was like.  All the details are right.  The actors were just like the men I knew.  They looked like that and they talked like that.  And the army wives too, they really were like that, at least every one I ever knew.\\"  The he was silent for a long time.  At last he said, \\"You remember the scene where the guy tries to pick up a burn victim by the legs and all the skin slides off?  Something like that happened to me once.  It was at a helicopter crash.  I went to pick him up and all the skin just slid right off.  It looked just like that, too.  I've never told any one about it.\\"<br />In most respects WE WERE SOLDIERS is a war movie plain and simple. There are several moments when the film relates the war to the politics and social movements that swirled about it, and the near destruction of the 1st. Cav.'s 7th Battalion at Ia Drang clearly arises from the top brass' foolish decision to send the 7th into an obvious ambush--but the film is not so much interested in what was going on at home or at the army's top as it is in what was actually occurring on the ground.  And in this it is extremely meticulous, detailed, and often horrifically successful.  Neither Randy nor I--nor any one in the theatre I could see--was bored by or dismissive of the film.  It grabs you and it grabs you hard, and I can easily say that it is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, far superior to the likes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, which seems quite tame in comparison.<br />Perhaps the single most impressive thing about the film is that it never casts its characters in a heroic light; they are simply soldiers who have been sent to do a job, and they do it knowing the risks, and they do it well in spite of the odds.  Mel Gibson, although I generally despise him as both an actor and a human being, is very, very good as commanding officer Hal Moore, and he is equaled by Sam Elliot, Greg Kinnear, Chris Klein, and every other actor on the battlefield.  The supporting female cast, seen early in the film and in shorter scenes showing the home front as the battle rages, is also particularly fine, with Julie Moore able to convey in glance what most actresses could not communicate in five pages of dialogue.  The script, direction, cinematography, and special effects are sharp, fast, and possess a \\"you are there\\" quality that is very powerful.<br />Randy did have a criticism.  \\"I don't think there would be time for casualty telegrams to actually get home while the battle was going on,\\" he said.  \\"After all, it only lasted three days.\\"  I myself had a criticism; there were points in the film when I found the use of a very modernistic, new-agey piece of music to be intrusive and out of place.  And we both felt that a scene near the end of the movie, when a Vietnamese commander comments on the battle, to be improbable and faintly absurd.  But these are nit-picky quibbles.  WE WERE SOLDIERS is a damn fine movie.  I'll give Randy, who served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the last word: \\"It may not be 'the' Vietnam movie.  I don't think there could ever be 'the' Vietnam movie.  But they get everything right.  That's how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.\\"'s how it looked and sounded, and that's what I saw, and this is the best movie about Vietnam I've ever seen.\\"
B000003CMB|5.0|Unlike a lot of jam bands out there these days, not a single note on this album is meant to just show off. Every solo, drumbeat, and bass riff comes right from the band's souls to you, the listener, and thank God for that! The Grateful Dead are left in the dust by the Allman Brothers who had jamming down to a science. Nowadays you have bands like Phish and Ominous Suckpods...I mean Seapods...who are out there jamming for the wrong reason, which is basically to show off...not the Allmans. Buy this CD and take yourself back to a time when music came from the band's soul and not their selfish childish little need to show off their skills.
B0000027RL|1.0|Great album!  Pure emotion and lyrical geinious the whole way through.  Not a bad song.  Never slows down.  Considered one of the best albums of the 90s by many critics.  Even Flow has a great guitar riff and an awesome guitar solo.  Alive is pure genious and Vedder demonstrates a beautiful singing voice.  Black is one of the best slow songs ive ever heard and Jeremy is wild the whole way through.  This is a great grunge/alternative cd and for anyone serious about music it is a must buy and probably among the top 10 cds of the decade.  Pearl Jam's never made a better effort yet.  This stuff is amazing.  Buy it buy it buy it buy it!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw Moulin Rouge in the theater I loved it. I thougt it was really neat how they added all of the modern music to a story that took place 100 years ago. Ewen and Nicole's voices are absolutely wonderful. It made the movie so much more exciting to know that it was their actual voices. I watch my DVD whenever i get the chance. I also own the first soundtrack and I plan I buying the second one. The music is just wonderful. I'm a big fan of musicals and always wished that someone would put one out in the theater like in the old days. I would highly recommend this movie to any theater buff or music lover. It is a great display of &quot;freedom, beauty, truth and love.&quot;

0440217563|4.0|This is the third in a series of books about Claire Randall, an English woman who mysterious falls through a wedge in some ancient stones and finds herself in eighteenth century Scotland. All three books have been mesmerizing, and it is difficult to determine which so far has been the best. Absolutely saturated with adventure, mayhem  and story after story of breath holding moments, in Voyager, there is plenty of adventure on the high seas, including pirates and shipwrecks, marooners, slaves, English soldiers and even a bit of life onboard a slave ship.  Truly this author does keep you enthralled and a willing page-turner. The love story between Claire Randall/Fraser and her eighteenth century husband spans so much eternity it is hard to see past it. Even though the book separates itself so openly from reality, the fantasy is still there, and very much alive. It is not at all difficult, through the literary gifts of this author, to imagine these things actually taking place, and to find yourself immersed in a time of wonder and intrigue and plenty of danger. Our protagonist is a woman of much courage. In real time she is an actual surgeon, chairperson of the board at a prestigious hospital, and somehow Diana Gabaldon can amazingly link that life to our protagonists life in eighteenth century Scotland. Truly a great read, but I gave it four stars because of the intense sex, it just becomes a bit much. Still, Im ready now for Drums of Autumn, the last in the series.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Robert Zimmerman aka Bob Dylan an elder statesman of the rock and roll world, has adequately demonstrated that he still has the stuff in his latest release the Grammy winning Love and Theft. Over the years his voice has changed from nasal to a gravel edged nasal.  Although not pleasant in the traditional sense it is a voice of emotion and integrity, that is seldom matched.<br />Love and Theft is a CD which represents the many sides of the Dylan musical personality.  First known for his skill with acoustic folk music, Dylan has branched out over the years to encompass many phases of popular music.  Love and Theft displays his versatility as an artist, lyricist and performer.  Diverse styles heard on this CD include as the jazzy upbeat &quot;Summer Days,&quot; the crooning lullabies of &quot;Bye &amp; Bye&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Poor boy&quot;, driving rock and roll of &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;, and the country blues of &quot;High Water&quot;.<br />At sixty, Dylan still has great poetic and song writing abilities that have earned him the title of poet laureate of rock.  He also continues to rely on some of the tricks and tendencies of early years.  Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle dum uses some of the literary allusions that he was so fond of in songs such as &quot;Desolation Row.&quot;  Mississippi reflects the feeling of being stuck in much the same way as &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.&quot; He is always at his best in the role of a cynical and scathing ex-lover as he expresses in &quot;Cry a While&quot; and &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; and as he did in the past with &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot;<br />Highlights of the cd include &quot;High Water&quot;, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, &quot;Floater&quot;, Moonlight&quot; and Lonesome Day Blues&quot;.  Having said that I must admit to me there is not a throwaway on the CD and I honestly like all the songs.  In High Water Dylan tips his hat to one of the founders of Delta Blues, Charlie Patton. The song is evocative of some of the music Charlie did reflecting on the great flooding of the Mississippi river. I would have purchased the cd for &quot;High Water&quot; alone. &quot;Moonlight&quot; a lullaby is one in which the listener could almost imagine Louis Armstrong singing. &quot;Floater&quot; is a pleasant melody evocative of floating on a lazy river on a summer afternoon. &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; is a thoughtful and reflective melody that shows the sharp edge of Dylan's cynical humor.<br />For a Dylan fan this is a CD not to be missed.  For a first time listener I hope this Cd encourages you to listen to some of Dylans earlier work more closely.rlie Patton.

0393316041|3.0|Many of my friends recommended this book and I finally took the time to read it. There are definately some interesting and exciting stories as well as insightful commentary. I really didn't enjoy hearing about Feynman's seemingly insatiable desire for young females and his habit of visiting strip clubs (6 times a week!). Sure it exposes the real Feynman but it takes away from the more useful and interesting parts of the book.
0451197968|5.0|This was the first book I read by Steven King (or Richard Bachman), and I was not disappointed.  This story catches you right at the beginning, and until the end, you can't set the book down.  I still don't know how anyone could ever even think up such an ending, by appairently they can.  If you want to read a good book by Steven King, pick this up, in fact, pick it up no matter what.
B00005R2M3|2.0|Shakira has done the worst thing she could ever do. Sing in English! Throughout &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, it's clear that Shakira doesn't have a clue what shes singing about, therefore it's pretty emotionless as well as totally boring. The best songs by far are both the English and Spanish versions of the hit &quot;Whenever Wherever&quot;. All the other tracks are bland and of poor quality. Shakira's older albums (in Spanish) were incredible, such a shame she had to turn &quot;commercialised&quot;.

B000002H2H|5.0|This album is incredible.  Because I am 14 years old, the first Metallica album I had ever heard of was the black album. That was the first Metallica album I  bought.  After going from that to S&amp;M, to the not so good Load albums, I decided to try out some of Metallica's old stuff. I went out and bought this album and Master of Puppets.  I now realize what Metallica is all about.  What an amazing CD!  It took a few listens for it to grow on me, but now I cant stop listening to it. In fact I'm listening to it as I'm writing this. The heavy songs with the infamous guitar riffs are awesome.  <br />For any of you who have only heard post-black albums and liked them.  Buy this album along with every other pre-black album and get ready to realize what good metal is
6305907145|2.0|That was the question that came to me while watching this movie.  This is a great departure from the story in Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park. If you are a big Austen fan I would stay away from this one.  Although it was well acted, with beautiful scenery, there were too many elements from the novel which were missing in the movie.
B000002HEP|5.0|As a fellow reviewer put it there is really no way to describe how good this album is. There are too many bands to list who have been influenced by this band but Soundgarden is the one who comes to mind first. Anyone familiar with their sound will love this album. Heavy as all Hell guitars played in such a laid back groove that is perfect for just about any occasion. The vocals are kind of in the same boat as Cornell's but John Garcia's range isn't quite as broad. This really doesn't detract from the album though, they seem to fit in quite pefectly. Key tracks include Gardenia, Space Cadet and Demon Cleaner. Highly, highly reccomended.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen is a literary genius.  Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue.  There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start.  You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through.  Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections.  I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says.  His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book.  Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy.  She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman.  There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas.  As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him.  I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible.  Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard.  Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get.  Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century.
630587493X|4.0|A very interesting  plot that really makes you think.  The story starts with Andrew, a house android, who was constantly being upgraded, until he became pretty much a human, except for his brain, which would keep him immortal.   The story makes you think, &quot;What is a true human being?&quot;
B00005QZ7U|1.0|To my mind, the musical is the best dramatic form for telling a story. By using song and dance to express emotion, humor, drama, love, hate, and so much more, a good musical can leave the viewer spellbound.  \\"Oklahoma!\\" is such a musical.  \\"My Fair Lady\\" is such a musical. \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" is not.  There are so many things wrong with this film, but first and foremost is, it's impossible to really care about any of the characters.  No one here is very likeable, except Ewan MacGregor's character, but he's nothing more than the young songwriting genius who could have very easily been played by Dick Powell in a 1930's Busby Berkeley film.  That's the other weakness to this film. What it all boils down to, is this is  a simple love triangle.  And it's very clear from the beginning of the film how it's all going to play out. So, if that's the case, the viewer must be taken for a memorable ride for the film to work.  \\"Moulin Rouge\\" tries, but ultimately tires the viewer instead.  Each production number is done with a type of \\"in-your-face\\" direction that it alienates more than anything else.  You do have to give the film credit for using modern, rock music to provide the bulk of the film's score (though most of the original songs sound like the same \\"showtunes\\" that have haunted Broadway for thirty years now.)  The attempt to use this type of music is groundbreaking, and there are only a handful of scenes where it works, mostly the one anchored by \\"Your Song.\\"  But the film tries so hard to impress you, that it forgets to entertain you.  Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein understood how to incorporate popular music of the day to take your breath away in the telling of a drama (And win Pullitzer prices in the process.) Sadly, no one connected with this film understands what makes entertainment work.  The musical could thrive once again if done properly; unfortunately, too many people may see this (or the sugar-coated \\"The Sound of Music\\") and think this is what the musical is all about.  It's films like this that give a great dramatic form a bad rap.   Watch \\"Oklahoma!\\" or \\"The Music Man.\\"  Those are musicals that work through and through.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|When I found out they were putting Strictly Ballroom on video, I was ecstatic! My friends and I love to get together to relax and enjoy this hilarious \\"mockumentary\\" on the sordid world of balroom dance. Unlike some other dance movies, most of the actors in Strictly Ballroom are actually primarily dancers, and it shows. This film is a bright, funny, energetic satire, and all the more impressive when you consider that this was Baz Luhrmann's first movie! The dancing is great and the characters are hilarious...and now you get to see them on widescreen!! Yes!
B00003CXIY|4.0|... The plot of the movie is little more than trying to get an incriminating videotape before it arrives at Brecken Myers' girlfriend's dorm, so the gang heads from Ithaca to Austin to get it. But along the way, a script peppered with some witty dialogue (yes, \\"witty\\"), some memorable visual gags, and likeable characters manages to keep you captivated.  The unrated DVD features several scenes of nude women, which don't appear in the theatrical release.  The behind the scenes featurette really isn't anything more than a look at the actors and crew goofing off, and the DVD-ROM game is pretty easy, so the special features here are somewhat lacking.   But if you're just looking for something to chill out with, and to get a few cheap laughs from, this movie is worth it.  If you're looking for the meaning of life, you won't find it here. (Maybe, \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\")

6305428522|5.0|\\"I thought we were gonna get television,\\" says Rob Morrow's character, the investigator Goodwin, \\"truth is, television's gonna get us!\\"  That line sums up so much about the film's outlook. This story, with great liberties to historic fact, still presents a compelling look at the quiz show scandals of the 1950's. While \\"The $64,000 Question\\" and \\"Dotto\\" are never mentioned, the basic tale of Charles Van Doren, Herb Stempel, Dan Enright, and Albert Freedman presents a very compelling case study in why good, honest people do dishonest things, and their rationalization behind it. Even as the film's credits are rolling, you'll hear Enright remain unrepentant, and insist their problem was they were just too successful at what they were doing, hence the attack on their \\"Twenty-One.\\"  The viewer should know that the Van Doren-Stempel clash was, in truth, stretched out for several weeks, and it was a few years after Van Doren's defeat that the truth of the fix was finally revealed.  (Also, Enright tells Van Doren in this film that Dwight Eisenhower didn't write \\"Crusade In Europe.\\"  Students of Eisenhower can attest to the fact that Ike most certainly did author \\"Crusade In Europe\\" and it was not ghost-written.)  This film, and \\"Network\\" are probably two of the most important films about the broadcasting industry you can find. Both do a very good job of telling the audience what the industry thinks of them, which isn't, at the end of the day, very much.
B00003XAQ5|1.0|Ok, sports fans! After hearing so many glowing reviews of this album and hearing it referred to as possibly the greatest jazz album ever made, I felt compelled to write this. It was about 20 years ago that I first heard this album, and found it to be boring. Everything is about the same tempo. I found Mr. Davis' playing to be laughable at best. Finally, it's irritating; and confusing that so many people laud it. DO NOT buy this album as a<br />primer for jazz. It is very misleading to hail this as the ultimate representation of an art form that has had far superior accounts of itself. If any musician showed up on a gig sounding the way Davis did on this album, they would be fired in a heartbeat! If you want to learn jazz, start with Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington. I give \\"Kind of Blue\\" one star for Cannonball Adderly's and Bill Evans' efforts. Otherwise, it is [bad work] hailed as something good-and it is with great effort that I've edited myself!
B00000DHZJ|2.0|I don't think anyone can deny that Jimi Hendrix was a great guitarist. But musical prowess alone does not a good album make, y'know what I'm saying? In my opinion, people were so caught up with Jimi's talent as a musician that they failed to notice (on the most part) that his talents as a song-writer were very simple. Much of these songs are very standard and merely impress with Jimi soloing over them. Add to that that much of what Jimi did was improvisation with little direction and what is left is really rather boring. Purple Haze and Voodoo Child are great songs, but the fact that many people have only heard of them (they wouldn't hear names like If 6 Was 9 or The Wind Cries Mary and think &quot;Aaah! Jimi Hendrix&quot;) may explain why.<br />I know I've done little here except make a load of people angry but I'm not afraid to speak out against the greats if I don't like them.

If you want to learn jazz, start with Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington. I give \\"Kind of Blue\\" one star for Cannonball Adderly's and Bill Evans' efforts. Otherwise, it is feces hailed as something good-and it is with great effort that I've edited myself!
B000003489|5.0|If you like old jazz, then you must buy this CD to add to your collection.  It is up there with some heavy Miles Davis, etc.  The alternate takes are pretty cool.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is an excellent cd that I would consider a must have for any punk rock fan.Not only does Rancid make punk in the classic style of the Sex Pistols and the Clash; they also add the influence of reggae and ska mixed with some down and dirty oi style punk making this a punk album to contend with.
6300182282|4.0|40+ years ago in college, I met a young man and we clicked instantly as friends and confidants. Both of us went on to marry other people but continued our unusual relationship(platonic) over all the years. Two years ago, we came together finally in a different way and have managed to see each other every month or so. It is heartbreaking and wonderful all at the same time. Both of us cannot (will not)leave what we have. I think Ellen Burystn says it best in the film &quot;There is respect, love, and a sense of continuity...&quot; It is possible to love 2 different people deeply, caringly and wholeheartedly at the same time. Strange but true. I watch this film and see my life and I laugh, cry and get a sense of contentment at the ending. These two actors make this film so real and so genuine in their emotions that you almost think that they are living it themselves.
0783242808|2.0|Hey sorry everyone.  I have to rate this movie poorly because thats what it is, a poorly made movie.  The acting is predictable, the gags tired, and the humor is so obvious, that you'd have to be commotose not to get it.  It's not to say obvious humor is bad, it's just delivered in such poor taste that you begin to wonder why you are watching this.  Oh great, we catch him jerking off,...  And the pie scene is probably the most overrated comic scene in this history of cinema.  Thats something I don't really want to see, a guy humping a pie.  For all the great movies out their with all the great actors, this movie get a lot of credit in the popularity department because a guy humps a ... pie. <BR>  Most intellegent people who watch this film realize that it's bad, but thats not the only reason this movie [stinks].  It's also destructive.  It inspired a lot of other [stuff] out their now, like 40 Days and 40 Nights. Why oh why lord do movie studios feel that we are so [stupid] that we will simply pay [good money] to go watch movie about a guys phallis.  I know this is the bible to most high school and college students, but let me say as a college student, I hate this movie.  So if you are planning to watch this movie, don't...  Hey, it gets two stars for a few cheap laughs, but thats not saying a lot.
0449227545|2.0|A totally unrealistic story about a commune making earthquakes. The leader is so smart but never learned to read or write. With his smarts he should have know how important reading and writing are and should have been able to pick it up rather easily.  He can make everyone like him, both men and women. From what is written I don't see it. I understand about office politics but for all that Judy accomplished she would not have been overlooked on any level. That is just the first part of the book.  Very stereotypical the way she is smarter than her superiors. So many of the characters are stereotypes (the people in the commune and the members of the FBI, for example). The novel is well written, but this novel is just a total waste of time with an unbelievable story and unbelievable characters. I'm still waiting for Follett to write another great book like \\"TRIPLE,\\" still my all-time favorite Ken Follett novel.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I saw A.I. when it first came out and couldn't shake it for a long time. I forgot about the whole  Kubrick and Spielberg angle, and just immersed myself in it.  I don't even know that I understood it, but it got under my skin almost like no other movie. As I read these reviews, I am beginning to remember the impact A.I. had on me all over again. It's no wonder there is such a love/hate reaction to this film. It's a deeply disturbing and challenging film. A.I. demands something from it's audience. I think we are spoonfed so much cinematic pablum in the US, that when an American film comes along that actually asks you to think a whole lot more deeply, a lot of people get angry and bored. This is one of the most haunting, heartbreaking films I've ever seen. It makes you question your core beliefs. If you want a film you can really sink your teeth into and think about for a long, long time, buy this DVD. I don't think you can see it one time and get all of it.  It's a one of a kind work of art--not easily accessible, but extremely rewarding if you open your mind and your heart to it.
0316234753|5.0|Emberley's dedication of this book reads \\"For the boy I was, the book I could not find\\".  I could not find a better description of this book if I tried!  My six year old son longed for art books that would teach him how to draw.  This book more than satisfied that longing.  Emberley's animals are fanciful, fun and easy to draw.  I have just ordered two more of his books.  We can't wait to get out the colored pencils and start drawing!
0060955775|5.0|This is the most amamzing book I have ever read and I strongly recomend everyone to read it. <BR>The story is about a young girl called Veronika who has lost the love of life and feels there is nothing to keep her in this world so she decides to take her own life by taking an overdose of sleeping pills only to wake up in Villete the local mental hospital. Although she is told she has an irreversible heart problem and will die within about five days. <BR>This story follows the next seven days of her life while she meets some amazing people and Paulo Coehlo links their stories in with Veornika's to make a stunning and  moving story which can alter the readers life. With an amazingly powerful ending that will stay with you forever.<BR>If you only read one book this year you must make it Veronika Decides To Die
B00004TRD8|5.0|I recently saw this movie for the first time.  I had no idea what to expect, and I thought that I was in for a stupid plot with lots of things blowing up.  I was so wrong.  This movie is great!  The visual effects are mind blowing and the story is definetly there.  In the first film, Arnold is a killer robot who is sent back through time to eliminate Sarah Connor, the woman who will give birth to a boy that will lead the human resistance in a future war against these machines.  In the future, John sends back his best friend to protect his mom, and he becomes John's father.  Now, another Arnold bot is sent back, along with Robert Patrick.  But now Arnold is reprogrammed to save John, who is now 10.  Patrick is a new prototype called the T-1000, made of liquid metal.  If Arnold was hard to kill in the first movie, this guy should prove interesting.  Go see this movie if you want thrills and action.  I guarantee you will be satisfied.
0061020710|5.0|This was not the first Discworld novel I ever read, which was slightly unfortunate because that way I expected something more from it when I first read it. It is not as good as most of the books later in the series, and aspects of the world are less well developed than in them; also, I felt that it was lacking in plot, being more like just an aimless journey from one place to another. However, I never got that feeling again when I reread it several times. I cannot evaluate this as a work of its own, because I have read (and practically fallen in love with) the whole rest of the series, but as a part of it it works fine. I would say it is propably a good one to start reading from, at least if you know that even if you do not quite like it, the rest are better. (This one is worth five stars, and it is considerably below average level for the series. What does that tell of the series?) It certainly contains some of the best elements of the series already, like ingenious facts about the world and very interesting characters, although both get even better later on.
079283318X|4.0|Before this movie, most Bond films had to do with the cold war.  In previous movies, he drove Aston Martins, and M was a guy.  Now, the cold war is over, BMWs are his vehicle, and the new M is played by Judi Dench in one of the best 007 movies ever.  It is about how Bond must save the world from a deadly satelite weapon in the hands of Janus, the leader of a crime syndacate.  But when Bond learns of Janus's true identity, the film goes off in a whole new direction.  This is a wonderful film, but the one flaw is that he doesn't use ANY of the gadgets in his new car, and in all the other films, he uses every one.  All in all, this is a great movie, and if you are a fan of action/adventure, you don't want to miss this one.
0800187873|4.0|i am a big fan of don e brasco. at the end you find out that there is still a hit out on don e brasco which is kind of cool. i wonder if he is killed how someone would collect the money. i think its funny when in gangster movies people who look funny like al pacino shoot people like in this movie. michael madsen is also in this movie and is kind of cool he was in reservoir dogs which was a cool movie. steve buscemi as also in that movie he was also in con-air and played a child molesting murderer who is very mean. is is not sexy at all. don e brasco on the other hand is very sexy. i think its funny that the name of the character is don e brasco and the name of the actor is john e depp.. do you get it? Wel I dont care if you do or not because I think its funny. I like the nude scene with don e brasco and the elephant. its funny too. you can see it at the end of the movie in the bonus features that are usually only there on dvds but there on this vhs because its really good a movie. i wish al pacino was sexier.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I went to this movie last night with a friend.  Words can't really even describe the film......but it is VERY powerful.  It is about a specific battle during the Vietnam War.  It was quite graphic but not in a needless sort of way.  The theater was silent during the whole movie and after it was over, I was completely speechless......no small feat for me!  I felt completely emotionally drained and unable to even discuss what I had just seen.  I highly recommend this movie and both my friend and felt that this was probably the best movie we have ever seen.   **NOTE - PEOPLE!!!!  Don't take small children to this movie.  There were several in the theater when I saw it.  There were a few times that I couldn't stomach some of the violence and I had to look away.... and not too much offends me.  It is rated \\"R\\" for a reason!
B00004RHZU|1.0|This CD has some catchy sounding songs and a strong vocalist. Unfortunately, like a party cake that is pretty to look at but dangerous to eat much of, it's filled from top to bottom with the kind of grief and discontent one rarely sees outside a therapy session. If the themes presented seem like fun then  saying &quot;CAN'T TAKE ME HOME&quot; is easily the most merciful thing you're going to say to anyone. I listened to this thing while looking for a gift for a friend. I think giving a loaf of bread filled with gravel would be nicer--and a lot less damaging to digest.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I believe this movie will truly go down as one of the few movies to draw the audiences in two seperate camps.  Either you saw this as a horribly done art piece, with cardboard cutout characters and inconcievable bad music superimposed over useless special effects, or you saw this as a musical masterpiece, a fine juxtapositions of emotion and music over a common theme: love.<br />I fell into the latter camp, but the argument for the first remains true.  Not everyone is going to like Baz Luhrmann's camera shots, the camera ducking in and out of Paris, heading towards the Moulin Rouge.  If you didn't like this style in \\"Romeo + Juliet\\", then you definately aren't gunna like it here.<br />As for the music, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of turn of the century imagery with popular music.  Although I'm sure if I hear \\"Lady Marmalade\\" one more time, I'll have to kill someone, most of the music truly fits the movie.  Songs such as \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\" are placed seamlessly into the movie.  I truly felt like Baz Lurhmann had created a world in which I wanted to be in.<br />As for the actors, this movie drew a strong set of talent.  Ewan McGregor's portrayal of the wide-eyed writer Christian is wonderful, showing how his youthful ideals of love transform into a more embittered view.  Nicole Kidman is at her best since \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" and Jim Broadbent is excellent, although I prefer his role in \\"Iris.\\"  <br />All in all, rent this movie before you buy it.  It's a great movie for some, and akin to gargling glass shards for others.
B00005JKYS|4.0|We Were Soldiers is one of the few good vietnam war movies.  The characters are pretty interesting and sometimes help lighten the mood of the war.  The war action was well done and has plenty of it.  Go see this one after you have seen Black Hawk Down (another great war movie).
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is surely the best musical of all times. It's contemporary, bright and magical, telling the love story of Satine and Christian. Baz Luhrmann was very competent bringing  &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; (the third film of the &quot;Red Curtain&quot; trilogy) to life and did it like no other director could do. It's wonderful the idea of creating a musical with pop songs of the last decades, instead of original songs, not known by the public. &quot;Come what may&quot;, the original love score of this movie, is a great track as well, since it captures all the pain characters go through.<br />The double DVD edition is exactly as I expected when I first watched this movie. It brings all the possible information related to the movie, with high quality and advanced technology. It has director's comments, rehearsal of the can can dance with the cast, interviews with the cast, videos of lady marmalade, etc. The DVD box is awesome, just like the movie. <br />I'm sure Moulin Rouge is a DVD which will please all types of viewers.
0345448898|5.0|My then 10-year-old son introduced me to the trilogy, saying Gloden Compass and Subtle Knife were \\"the best books I've ever read,\\" and that I had to read them. They sat by our bed for two years, and then I took Golden Compass on a trip, was hooked, and couldn't put them down. These aren't just great young adult novels. They're great novels in general. I like the Harry Potter books and eagerly read the next installments, but Potter's characters look like cartoon characters compared to those of Pullman. What I love about Pullman is that people are morally complex. They aren't just good or bad. Good people end up doing destructive things, sometimes for good motives. Bad people, in fact chillingly bad people, sometimes act couragely. But qualities like honor, generosity, loyalty, caring and ravery still matter. It's a much more realistic guide to a messy world.<br />Pullman also raises other challenging issues, like what we're doing to the environment. Without revealing too much of the plot, the image of intelligent bears fleeing the Arctic as their world melts in the face of global warming created by human  arrogance will stick with me forever--as a metaphor for what we're doing to our world.<br />One other note. A number of readers have been troubled by Pullman's seeming anti-clericalism. Indeed religious theocracy comes off very badly in the book. But when I heard Pullman speak, he mentioned that there was no figure more morally influential in his life than his uncle, an Episcopal priest, and this made sense to me. I don't see Pullman as anti-religion. In fact the book makes as eloquent a statement for humane faith-based values that I've seen. Rather, it attacks, and rightfully so, a religion that is not a religion of love, but one that is mean-spirited, controlling, and enchanted with its own power. His depictions made me think of the Taliban, or some of America's own bigoted fundamentalists, like Jerry Fallwell and Pat Robertson saying Sept 11 happened because of civil liberties groups, feminists and homosexuals.<br />From my take, these are profoundly moral books, in the best sense, with lessons for young adults and not so young alike, with characters you care about and wrapped in an amazingly imaginative page-turning story.<br />Paul Loeb<BR>Author Soul of a Citizen: Living With Conviction in a Cynical Time...<br />PS--I also think that among the few comparable books are Ursula K Le Guin's wonderful Earthsea fantasies.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has reinvented herself once again. Her album Music is a combination of pop-style that she has defined the past twenty years and the introspective style of her ray of light put into one.  The album is satisfying on many levels and leaves the listener wanting more.  Music in my opinion is the lower quality songs on the album and it itself is spectacular.  Madonna's creative ability really has a chance to shine with songs like Impressive Instant and What It Feels Like For A Girl.  I highly reccommend this album it is so wonderful you will enjoy hearing it again and again.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Spielberg and Kubrick have brought us so many fantasic films that we want to forget the ones that failed to amuse us. A.I., in partial, is one of those films. This film is full of great things, but they are overwhelmed by the many detriments you can find within it as well. Here's what I thought: <br />Good:<br />1.) Haley Joel Osment wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this? He was definitely the highlight of the film, and brought so much to the movie, which would otherwise have been a major flop. This kid definitely has the potential to do something in this business. Simply outstanding. <br />2.) The plot was very inventive. It made you think into the future, wondering what it would really be like. In a way, I think it will be like what we see here, and it's a bit frightening. <br />3.) The special effects were gorgeous, but too much at times. They take over in the film, just like we've seen in the past, but they're still something to be in awe of. <br />Bad: <br />1.) Other than Osment, the rest of the characters were flat. Even Jude Law was not properly developed, and he was one of the largest supporting characters in the film. You could care less what happened to David's family, along with the majority of the others. <br />2.) At nearly two and a half hours long, A.I. is a bore at times. The film has next to no action, and we spend most of the film wandering around. The first hour drags on for nearly two, it feels. <br />3.) The aliens were a bit too &quot;Close Encounter&quot;-ish for me. <br />So there you have it. A.I. is an okay movie, one I sat through once and would probably not sit through again. I might rent it sometime in the future, but it'll take me a day to struggle through most of it. I see why this film flopped at the box office, and if Spielberg decided to cut out forty-five minutes of nonsense here and there, we may have had a tight, concise film. But again, his artistic vision got the best of him, much like in his 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;.
B000056VIY|1.0|After jenifer lopez's first album her second came with anticipation, I went out and got it the first day it came out, what a mistake.  Yes, her image her changed it is a shame her talent had to too.  She fails the audience in so many ways with this album.  The songs are short, harsh, and to mainstream to be enjoyed anywhere else but on the radio.  It is sad the first album made me believe she had talent seemed like a fluke
B00005YTFG|5.0|It was so pretty!!!  from all the colors and light to Ewan McGregor's sexy voice!!  *girly squeal*  sorry.<BR>So what if it was jam packed with anachronisms?  It was a beautiful love story that makes me cry every time.  You don't have to listen to me, the dreamy little Junoir girl who still remembers what it's like to lust without shame.
B0000542D1|5.0|This is definitely the best movie The Beatles ever made. At the time it was made, no one knew that this movie would become such a classic. The Beatles personlities come shining through in this movie, and the songs are great. This is the one Beatles movie every Beatles fan has to have!
B00005Y228|5.0|What i like about Kylie is her unique sound that seems to appear with her last two albums.After the album ''Light Years'' i was looking forward to what Kylie will return with.I must confess that i don't expect such a good album from her (thinkin that Light Years was da best) but now i see Fever is da best Kylie album set to conquer the world.With a great opening More More More to the last song Butterfly , Fever has so much to proove .Kylie was giving signals to disco stylish music with On A Night Like This but i never thought she will get this far.Highlights of the album are (the album title) ''Fever'' , first single ''Can't Get You Outta My Head '' (UK smash hit of da year) , ''In Your Eyes'' the second and the best one out there  and ''Love Affair''.They come first then there are great but not best tracks like ''Your Love'' , ''Love At First Sight'' , ''Boy'' and ''Burning Up''.The tracks that are not that good for this album are ''Fragile '' and bonus track ''Butterfly''.The others are good.By the way Uk edition also have a bonus track called ''Tight Rope'' which is gorgeous and the best one after In Your Eyes.So i'm giving 5 stars to this awesome album and i know everyone out there will find something for their taste in this album.So what are you waiting for?Go and Get Kylie this year
B000001FN1|5.0|Lets forget the fact that Doro is  hot ... this album just plain blows the dust off your mullet.  Assuming you still have one... but I digress.  For those of you searching through all the crap that has turned our beloved Heavy Metal into the bad \\"Hair\\" cliche's (Whithout mentining any \\"Poison\\" names \\"winger\\"), you will be estatic to once again hear a classy talented band.  Doro,the blond Siren who's vocals cut you to the bone, delivers shivers with cuts like \\"east meets west\\", and \\"all we are\\".   Here's a revelation, the guitar work made from more than bad three chord blues riffs, whats that I hear, no pentatonic floundering, ahhh music....  A must hear five star HM album.
B00005JKYS|5.0|A truely great film!  One of the best movies I've seen in years. This movie is very realistic and shows not only what the soldiers went through, but also the reactions of the wives or fiances they left behind.
0425107469|5.0|This is my all time favorite Koontz and book for that matter.  My Mom turned me on to DK in the early 90's and I was reluctant.  Being a dog lover, I said to Mom that I didn't want to read a book where they would be cruel to animals.  She said,&quot; No, no, just read it, try it.&quot;  This is an intriguing story where a lost couple (for the movie which was AWFUL -  I thought Clint Eastwood, Sally Fields, Sidney Poitier and John Goodman would have been excellent choices)find there way through the love and companionship of a wonderful animal.  Even the side characters have life and are important to the story.  I read this book every summer (along with a Wrinkle in Time) and stop people of the street if the have a golden retriever, ask them if they have read the book and if not encourage them to do so.   We all have a Watcher, as Nora finds out.
B00005QXXO|5.0|The last two years have been very productive for Radiohead. Two full length LPs and now a live album. When a band/artist releases a live album it is either as great as their albums (Bob Dylan's Live At Albert Hall comes to mind) or it is very boring and a waste. What makes &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; as great as their albums is because instead of trying to recreate the original recordings live, they reinvent the song for live performance making it fresh and organic. Bob Dylan once said that he never listens to his old songs after he records them because he knows them already. I would apply this same quote to Radiohead. They do not see their songs as already set in stone but songs that evolve and change throughout time. I am finally happy to see &quot;True Love Waits&quot; making its way onto album. This has always been one of my favorite Radiohead songs and I'm glad they finally released it. This version is breathtaking and beyond words to describe how great it is. The other highlights are &quot;Idiotque&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates.&quot; The &quot;Idiotque&quot; version on this album has so much energy and has great sound effects in it. I never did like &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; but the version on &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; is amazing. It is done by Thom Yorke on piano. It is the way I think the song should've originally been recorded.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Umm.... I don't know how to discribe this. The CD is really good! I'm part of a big group of teens (the cool crowd, you could say) and I think there's only one or two people in our group that doesn't have it! It's really, like, moving and relaxing at the same times. Great therapy music if your feeling bad, and at the same time happy. <br />My suggestion! Everybody should get it! It's a wonderful collection.... Way better then any other CD in my collection!
B000002699|5.0|Defining moment in music, like Kind of Blue.  The primary statement of electronic jazz, studio-driven rather than performance-driven and one of the finest grooves.  The flip side of this was Jack Johnson, which was rock-driven.  Take the two and in between find the rest of 1970s jazz.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Hanks - great. Special effects and cinematography - great. But the two things that I want to see in this movie were card titles: 4 years later and 3 weeks later. I wanted to watch Hanks evolve on that island, not jump ahead. And Lord how I wanted to see those first 3 weeks off the island!!!<BR>Ultimately entertaining, but not as though provoking as it could be. DVD is noteworthy for the extras - and for finding out the script went through 150 rewrites!
B000002G0P|2.0|On Extreme's last CD they were moving away from Van Halen and when  III Sides to Every Story comes out they were ELO.  How does that happen?  They had a 3 part orchestra at the end of the CD.  It's been years since I listened to the CD but I remember it being overproduced and underwritten.  Yet it was well played.  Extreme is a confusing band.  I walked away before this CD was released.  Burn your friends copy.  You will be better off.
B00004Z511|5.0|...One day at school I saw my friend had a copy of Kid A and I asked to borrow it after being intriuged by the art within the booklet. I had never really heard any of Radiohead except for the song Karma Police from OK Computer. When I got home I listened to the cd all the way through and was totally thrown for a loop. I couldn't believe that such amazing music could be produced during my lifetime. The album perfectly flowed through each track, it felt as if I was hearing a story of alienation and frustration that I knew all too well. Thom York's lyrics are distorted and put together perfectly with melodic and repetative hooks that feel as if they are speaking on their own. I'm not going to sit and break down the album because several people have already done that, but let me say this: Kid A is a masterpiece, and definately one of the best albums of the new millenium. I suggest that any lover of music purchase this album; it's about the only thing worth $16 anymore.
B000002GIE|3.0|This was a band that stupidly played the hair band game and really if they took the high road they might still be around today.  Good songwriting, decent hooks, great guitar player.... bad image.  Maybe a little too much leaning on Eddie Van Halen sound?  That can be forgiven because everyone wanted to be Eddie Van Halen  This showed a lot of promise and hairspray... Even the drummer.  he had short hair but you could see the amount of hairspray involved in his hair.  Image kills no matter what you think.
B00005B36H|5.0|[i]Lateralus[/i] is a beautiful album through and through.  With the concept behind it still rather dim, it is a brighter step from 1996's pessimistic [i]Ænima[/i].<br />The lyrics on this album are stunning.  Though Maynard James Keenan does have his down points ([i]Lateralis[/i], [i]Disposition[/i]), he often turns a phrase into a beautifully crafted poetic masterpiece.  From the Grudge's &quot;Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity&quot; to Reflection's &quot;Until we pine away&quot;, Maynard puts forth a lyrical performance that contains no equal in modern music.  Though not as poetic certain [i]Ænima[/i] tracks, nor as confrontational as 1992's [i]Opiate[/i], the lyrics as a whole are undeniably Tool, and undeniably great.<br />The guitar and bass work are Tool's best so far--buy the album just for this--words cannot describe how incredible it is.<br />The drums have never been describable for he is too awesome to really gauge any sort of awesomeness.<br />The singing on this album is Maynard's best for Tool.  Edgy and rough like [i]Ænima[/i], yet beautiful like A Perfect Circle.<br />All and all--buy this album.  You won't be dissappointed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! It was the music that really grabbed me. This film has a wonderful mix of old and new.<br />When, in one of the opening scenes, Christian starts singing &quot;The hills are alive with the Sound of Music&quot; I had a sudden &quot;Wow&quot; feeling deep inside. The feeling became anticipation of songs to come and was quickly satisfied by a rendition of Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; and soon after that a medly of songs ranging from Paul McCartney's &quot;Silly lovesongs&quot; to U2's &quot;In the Name of Love&quot;.<br />The finale involves a spectacular stage show and a hauntingly uplifting version of the lover's &quot;Secret Song&quot;!<br />I rented the DVD twice before I bought it, and I have watched the movie around 15 times over the last month.<br />A brilliant performance by Nicolle Kidman, and Ewan McGregor.<br />This one's a must see.
6303433766|2.0|I saw all the 5 star reviews and thought I would check it out.I really don't understand what was so great about this movie.It wasn't suspenseful at all,it was too slow paced,it seemed to be half fantasy and half reality.It just seemed to go off in all different directions.I was sitting there thinking to myself...&quot; What am I watching here?&quot;  A wasted 2 hours
B00005JKYS|5.0|I saw this film today - and like everyone in the movie theatre audience, I was crying nearly all throughout the entire two and a half hours.<br />The emotion that's in this movie can't be beaten. And I think it's one of the best films released this year - Mel Gibson's performance as Lt. Col Moore is amazing and should be Oscar nominated.<br />I also loved the narration in the movie. It's true that Vietnam wasn't a popular war and the soldiers that gave their life and the ones that made it and ones were injured - in fact were rarely shown as heroes as they fought the war that no one else wanted to fight.<br />The war scenes are amazing - you can see the bombs coming down, soldiers on both sides being killed and the ones that were badly injured. <br />The camera work on this film was one of the best I've seen in such a long time. And the movie ends with a touching tribute to the soldiers that gave their lives.<br />Also the film goes between the US Army, the Vietnamese soldiers and the wives at home - especially when Madeline Stowe who plays Gibson's wife and Keri Russell handing out telegrams to widows of the soldiers.<br />This movie shouldn't be missed and is Oscar caliber.

What is less well-known is just how enjoyable reading this book is.  Ignatius O'Reilly is one of the finest, most amusing characters ever to walk through the pages of a book.  Once you meet him, he'll occupy a permanent little corner in your mind and you'll laugh every time you remember.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Don't get me wrong, there are mind-blowing moments in Moulin Rouge; the visuals alone keep you watching long after you've lost interest in the lame plot.  And it's an interesting idea here to do a sort-of send-up of the movie musical.  But come on, Baz--to stay engaged, we need to care about these characters, and we don't. Again, it's kinda fun to time-trip with music from today set in a turn-of-the-century (the PREVIOUS turn-of-the-century)fantasy, but couldn't you pick some more worthy examples than sappy, early Elton John--especially to be the film's signature song?  Yes, Nicole can sing, but she has little else to do. I'm amazed she got an Oscar nod for this non-performance.  I keep hearing that Moulin Rouge marks the rebirth of the movie musical.  While that might be a good thing, let's hope the next ones out of the gate are better than this dazzling failure.
B00005OM4N|5.0|After the pure pop ventures that were her previous albums, Britney Spears has hit the right chord with her new album. Her sound is much more mature than her past efforts, and accompanies her more adult lyrics. The lead track \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is a surprise - the thumping beats with suggestive lyrics is a change from her past lead-off singles of her previous albums. The first few tracks are quite good - \\"Overprotected\\" maintains Britney's old sound with a more polished touch, while \\"Lonely\\" has the trade-marked Rodney Jerkins beat which enhance the dancey, R&B feel of the album. Epic ballad \\"I'm Not A Girl..\\" boasts of good piano accompaniment, while \\"Boys\\" is raunchy fun similar to \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\". \\"Anticipating\\" is reminiscent of Jennifer Lopez's \\"Feels So Good\\" with its feel good vibes, and \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" is simply a guilty pleasure. The fillers \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Bombastic Love\\" lack the unique identities of each of the previous tracks, and are perhaps the lesser of the tracks in the album. \\"Let Me Be\\" sticks as being a catchy tune with heavy beats and lyrics not different from \\"Overprotected\\". The ballads are not too spectacular -  while breezy and light, they fail to create much of an impact. The ending track is perhaps the most disappointing - the highly anticipated collaboration with Justin Timberlake is a boring, forgettable track which leaves a sour aftertaste. But that aside, \\"Britney\\" is a good album which is definitely more slick and polished than her older works. Get the album - after all, it did hit Number One in the US!
B000002KLZ|4.0|I recommend both new and old Fleetwood Mac fans to buy this CD. The sound quality is not as good as &quot;The Dance&quot; CD, but about half the songs featured on this 2 CD set are completely different than tracks from 1997's &quot;The Dance&quot;. My favorite track is Stevie's &quot;Fireflies&quot;! This set also includes one of Stevie's vocal-chord-shredding performances of &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, that's worth the purchase price alone.

But I suppose you really have to be up on your music history knowledge to catch a lot of the inside jokes happening thoughout the film. Beautiful.

No onscreen couple could have done this better. <BR>The French may indeed be glad to die for love, but until then, I'll meet you in the red room, at the moulin rouge!
6300214370|4.0|Devised as a lengthened music video, Footloose was a film filled with catchy music, good-looking stars and a story that emphasized the relationship between the Hollywood movie and pop music. The story is about a teen from Chicago named Ren (Kevin Bacon) who moves to a small town in the Midwest and just wants to be accepted by the residents. Not long after moving there, he realizes that the religious congregation and the residents have outlawed dancing and rock music because of the evils that are associated with it. His quest, through the duration of the movie is to make dancing and rock music legal again and to hold a school dance for himself and the seniors of his high school. He has a lot of big city hangs ups to overcome as he tries to fit in to small town life. Ultimately he accomplishes what he set out to do and arranges to have the dance, but across the county line in another town.<br />This type of musical began with 'Saturday Night Fever' and continued the love of the Hollywood movie with a pop music soundtrack. It was not a musical typical to those of the '30s, '40s and '50s where the actors sang the songs, but rather referred to the actions of what was going on in the scene. Because of this, the film used diegetic sound, a term for saying that the film shows where the source of the music is coming from. There is always a radio or boom box present to add music to the scene and pinpoint the location of the music. For example, in one scene where Ren and Ariel's (Lori Singer) bully boyfriend Chuck (Jim Youngs) are having a tractor &quot;chicken&quot; contest (where one tractor races towards the other and the one who pulls out first is the chicken). Before the race starts, Chuck turns on the tape in the boom box and the song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot; by Bonnie Tyler plays. It appeared that this contest was set up to see who would be her &quot;hero.&quot; The song &quot;Dancing in the Sheets&quot; by Shalamar is coming from a boom box that Ariel and her boyfriend brought to a fast food drive-in. Everybody, taken by the beat of the song, begins to dance around. The finale was a big production number (if it could be called one) where their dream of dancing finally becomes a reality and at this time, the title song &quot;Footloose&quot; by Kenny Loggins was playing. Another type of sound used in this movie is nondiegetic where music is used to convey a mood or theme without showing where the source of the music is coming from. An example of this is the song &quot;I'm Free&quot; by Kenny Loggins where it is decided that the seniors of the high school can have the dance. The song begins faintly when the board is voicing their opinion that it is all right to have the dance. The most annoying aspects of this music is that every song was written by the screenwriter of the movie, Dean Pitchford in collaboration with some of the popular singer/composers of that time such as Eric Carmen, Kenny Loggins, Sammy Hagar etc. and all but the title song &quot;Footloose&quot; were written after the completion of the movie. &quot;Mr. Pitchford on all the songs has given the score a more consistent tone than the typical soundtrack potpourri. The music is also a text book example of how Hollywood adapts the latest pop trends and technological developments to its own uses.&quot; (The New York Times March 4, 1984)<br />Footloose was marketed so heavily on MTV with its music videos that everyone who saw the videos ran out to see the movie. It wasn't a particularly good movie, but people liked the music. In actuality, it was the musical numbers that sold the movie. I enjoyed the music videos that I saw on MTV that promoted the movie Footloose. However, I did not actually see the movie until it came on cable a year later. The movie was a typical teenage plot with little or no substance, but was done in a way that appealed to children and adults. &quot;Herb Ross brings to Footloose an adult sensibility often lacking in troubled teen pics, resulting in a film that could play off across a broad market place.&quot; (Variety February 15, 1984)resulting in a film that could play off across a broad market place.&quot; (Variety February 15, 1984)

0790744759|5.0|The first Technicolor film directed by Vincente Minnelli, Meet Me in St. Louis was a sentimental tale about a close knit family at the turn of the century.  The story begins in the Summer of 1903 and is divided into four segments, taking the audience through the four seasons of the year, culminating with the family's visit to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in the Spring of 1904.  There is virtually no plot to this movie, it is just a series of happenings, which take place in the lives of the Smith family during the year.  The audience is aware of the change of seasons which are also accompanied by changes, which are happening in their lives such as childhood adventures (Tootie's Halloween), a new romance (Esther and the boy next door) and a dilemma (who will escort who to the Christmas dance).  The most important earth shaking thing that happens in the movie is the probability that Mr. Smith (Leon Ames) will move his family to New York City.  Problems arise in the family because of his decision.  The climax of the movie shows the family attending the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, exclaiming what a wonderful city they live in and that it could only happen in St. Louis.<br />All of the songs in Meet Me in St. Louis flowed nicely with the sequences.  They more or less continued the dialogue.  As Ted Sennett expressed in his book Hollywood Musicals, &quot;...they emerged naturally from the feelings of the characters, especially Esther.  Her secret longing for John Truett, expressed in 'The Boy Next Door,' eliminated the need for dialogue.  Her joy at the prospect of spending a day with him at the fairgrounds bursts forth in 'Trolly Song,' and her sorrow of leaving St. Louis is tempered by compassion for her little sister in the warming 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.'&quot; These songs by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane have long been remembered and enjoyed by people of all ages.<br />Meet Me in St. Louis was released in the fall of 1944. It was an immediate success and became the second highest grossing film for MGM (Gone with the Wind was the first).  This film was the turning point for MGM and Hollywood musicals, where the director put together all the elements that go into creating a musical - photography, d&eacute;cor, costumes, performances, score.<br />I happened to enjoy this movie because the music was great, costuming was superb and the actors really complemented one another.  They actually seemed liked an honest to goodness family.  This movie was well-received at the time probably because it was released in the right place at the right time.  In 1944, we had already been at war for three years and the people were weary.  They needed a movie like this to take their minds off their troubles, to cheer them up and remind them of the way life used to be at the turn of the century.uccess and became the second highest grossing film for MGM (Gone with the Wind was the first).

B000002GMT|5.0|Let's face it; if you're an ABBA fan, you probably have every single track on this CD already.......except one.  This CD is a necessity for ABBA fans because this is one of only two places you can find the previously unreleased track, \\"I Am the City\\".  (The other would be the double CD, \\"Forever Gold\\", which is actually a repackaging of \\"ABBA Gold\\" and \\"More ABBA Gold\\".) \\"I Am the City\\", with it's slightly new-wave arrangement, hinted at what might have happened had ABBA stayed together into the 80's.  My only question is, why didn't they put the complete version of \\"Just Like That\\" on here as well?  (A question that every die-hard ABBA fan wants the answer to. )  While not as hit-heavy as the original \\"Gold\\" CD, every song is still a classic.

My favorite concert of the Rolling Stones however is the one on the video \\"The Rolling Stones Live At The Max\\" of their Steel Wheels tour.

B000002PH1|5.0|With her song Heaven Is A Place On Earth\\", Belinda Carlisle definitively has deserved a place in Heaven, be that on Earth or anywhere else. Other great songs are Circle In The Sand\\", I Feel Free\\", Fool For Love\\" and Love Never Dies\\". Belinda Carlisle has Punk Rock roots and New Age wings, a beautiful combination! And her singing comes straight from her heart, just as it should be.

The chemistry of the characters are unforgettable.<br />It is quite an adventure trying to figure out, if you've not seen Emma before, who loves who.  It's enjoyable and plays miscommunication very well.  I was quite fascinated with their lives and swept away.<br />Indeed the smug attitudes and mockery of one another and the misfortunes, and let me not forget the childish, prudish Emma make it a top choice.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's stellar debut \\"No Angel\\" was a welcome addition to a market saturated with boy bands and catchy pop one-hit wonders. \\"No Angel\\" is an album with staying power--it is still on the charts almost two years after its release, with good reason.<br />Dido's voice brings to mind Sarah McLachlan and Dolores Riordan at times: her soft, fluid phrasing and breathy tone searches for love and its absence in the twelve tracks (there are European and Asian versions that feature extra songs--collectors will want to hunt these down in place of the US version as they offer music videos and other goodies in addition to the standard tracks on the North American release).<br />1*Here With Me--I first discovered this song when Sarah Brightman covered it on her \\"La Luna\\" album. I can't pick a favourite between the two versions--both Dido and Sarah bring their own unique touches to the song. This was also used as the theme to the TV series \\"Roswell.\\" Very brooding and melancholy at first, but Dido declares that she will not give up searching: \\"I won't leave/I can't hide/I cannot be until you're resting here with me\\"<br />2*Hunter opens with a strummed guitar chord and moves to a layered chorus. Dido seeks to escape an empty relationship, to \\"be a hunter again.\\"<br />3*Dido's snarling, mocking attack on her boyfriend's *other* girlfriend: \\"So you're with her, and not with me, oh how lucky one man can be/I hear your house is smart and clean/ oh how lovely with your homecoming queen/Oh how lovely it must be.\\"<br />4*This is my favourite song off \\"No Angel.\\" It is almost a Celtic lament in sound: echoing vocals, very soft, wavelike background music, the sound of seagulls, the layered harmonies and the lyrics: \\"while I watch the ocean, my lover's gone/ no earthly ships will ever bring him home again.\\"<br />5*A slow, Alanis-Morissette-like pop ballad with an electric guitar supporting the fact that \\"you and your sin can leave the way you just came in/send my regards to her.\\"<br />6*\\"Thank You\\" has received the most airplay of Dido's songs and not without good reason. From the catchy conga drum opening to the intertwined piano and guitar and Dido's delivery, this is a gem: \\"And even if my house falls down now/I wouldn't have a clue/because you're near me and I want to thank you.\\"<br />7*A rather harsh, dissonant opening of electric guitar and synth fades into odd synthetic noises combined with accordion. The most club-like of the songs on \\"No Angel.\\" The chorus is pure \\"Surfacing\\"-era Sarah McLachlan note for note.<br />8*A similar opening to \\"Honestly OK\\" with synthetic background noises, again very electronic, even the filtering on Dido's vocals in the chorus.<br />9*\\"Isobel\\"'s bodhran-like opening dissolves into strumming guitars---and a chorus suspiciously reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan's \\"Ice Cream\\"--the chord progressions and notes are almost *exactly* the same as the \\"Ice Cream\\" lyrics \\"It's a long way down/it's a long way down.\\" Even Dido's delivery sounds *exactly* like \\"Surfacing\\"-era Sarah McLachlan. This song has a very world-music feel: tambourines, different kinds of drums. The song is reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan's \\"Adia\\": \\"It's been a long day coming and long will it last/When it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it pass/By loving you more.\\"<br />10*\\"No Angel\\" is a pleasant coffee-house ballad that, again, sounds a whole lot like...you guessed it, Sarah McLachlan...especially on the chorus when Dido sings \\"but does that mean that I won't fly\\" and it ends up sounding exactly like the end of Sarah McLachlan's \\"Possession\\" off \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\\" \\"No Angel\\" closes with a rather unexpected  harmonica solo.<br />11*\\"My Life\\" opens with an intro fitting of a smoky torch song: slow, sultry jazz with a drumstick and bluesy piano intro that morphs into a pseudo-gospel choir chorus. Very smooth late-night listening along the lines of Anita Kelsey's contributions to the \\"Dark City\\" soundtrack (\\"Sway\\" and \\"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\\").<br />12*The acapella, echoey opening on \\"Take My Hand\\" turns into a pulsing, danceable synth sound fest, slowing back down to a classical-sounding piano finale.<br />\\"No Angel\\" is an inventive, soulful album featuring a number of musical influences: club, dance, pop, jazz, coffeehouse, Celtic, and a vocal similarity to both Sarah McLachlan (delivery) and Dolores Riordan (tonal quality). Plenty of variety for everyone's tastes, this album is sure to become a classic.Eyes\\").<br />12*The acapella, echoey opening on \\"Take My Hand\\" turns into a pulsing, danceable synth sound fest, slowing back down to a classical-sounding piano finale.<br />\\"No Angel\\" is an inventive, soulful album featuring a number of musical influences: club, dance, pop, jazz, coffeehouse, Celtic, and a vocal similarity to both Sarah McLachlan (delivery) and Dolores Riordan (tonal quality).

B00003Q438|5.0|There are some who are less impressed with the text-only commentary on this loaded DVD. I too, was nonplussed before I watched it. I like audio commentaries! They offer personal insights and details about movies we love, at least enough to spend 30 bucks on it. The text commentary here is not just a bare-bones dissection of special effects, like, say, the audio com from Star Wars Ep. 1. What a dissappointment. <BR>Anyway, there are plenty of details about the actors, fluid breathing experiments, famous submarine disasters and even some karaoke(long version only)! Very fun. I was hoping for an audio with James Cameron (still am, for any of his movies) but this was just as satisfying. <BR>Go get it! Have a bud light (wink).
0792157850|5.0|Many think \\"Temple of Doom\\" is not as good as \\"Raiders,\\" but I think it''s the best: Here's why:     MORE EXOTIC: While we only caught a very brief glimpse at the beginning of \\"Raiders\\" of Indiana doing his real work, (going into forbidden temples with booby traps to get valuables) in \\"Temple of Doom,\\" the whole movie is like that. You'll have to see for yourself to understand.    FUNNIER: \\"Temple of Doom\\" is much funnier that \\"Raiders.\\" Kate Capshaw is hilarious and \\"Short Round\\" is a nice touch.    BETTER VILLIAN(S): Instead of a bunch of Nazis, here we get guys who pull out other peoples' hearts and lower them in to a lava pit v e r y slowly....     Much better!    BETTER ACTION: Much better action than \\"Raiders.\\" The last 25 minutes of this movie is jam packed with action, including many hand to hand fights, a great mine car chase which leads to a cliffhanger, (literally) and an outstanding rope bridge finale. The first 15 minutes is a treat as well in which we see Jones in a nightclub fighting guys and looking for the cure to the poison he just accidentally drank. (That itself leads to a car chase in the streets of Shanghai.) Are you convinced yet?    ALL IN ALL: Great action, villains, adventure, and acting. Much better than the first!!!    1984; 118 minutes; RATED PG for action/adventure violence; language; disturbing images; brief sexual innuendo; and gore
B00005YW4H|3.0|Every year, at the beginning of the year, the music media hits us with hype for the &quot;newcomers of the year.&quot; Anybody who's picked up a mag like Rolling Stone, EW, et al, has seen Norah Jones' name as one of those newcomers. Whether she can live up to that hype remains to be seen.<br />She definitely has her niche set up for her: tastefully subdued jazz/pop diva. And on her first album, she hews to that niche just a little too closely. Jones has a warm, intimate voice with a maturity that belies her twenty-something years. But the settings her producers place her in (hushed, tasteful, vaguely folkish) cry out for some immature spontaneity. <br />Craig Street used this sound for albums he has produced for artists like Chris Whitley and Cassandra Wilson. But both of these singers are idiosyncratic enough to use their own personalities to cut through the staid chamber-folk feel. Norah Jones isn't quite there yet. And Arif Mardin, who produced most of the songs here, would have done better to remember the touches of unpredictability he gave to the seminal Chaka Khan albums he did in the 70's and 80's.<br />The songs are a bone of contention, too. Jones langorously wraps her voice around Hank Williams' &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; and Hoagy Carmichael's &quot;The Nearness of You.&quot; But the other originals composed for the album by her band and herself lack melodic and musical variety. Some fortunate exceptions to this are Jesse Harris' &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; and her own &quot;Nightingale.&quot;<br />All in all, Norah Jones shows tremendous promise for future projects, as much for what she isn't (a half-naked, over-singing harpy) as what she is. But for anyone seeking an opportunity to hear Norah's interpretive skills in a more lively setting, I would reccommend the latest album by the Charlie Hunter Quartet, &quot;Songs from the Analog Playground.&quot; She is a featured vocalist here, and this was the first place I heard her, in a more straight-ahead,jazzy setting. She covers Roxy Music's 80's make-out classic, &quot;More Than This,&quot; and closes the album with Nick Drake's elegaic &quot;Day Is Done.&quot; Hearing Jones' voice singing Drake's resigned lyrics against Hunter &amp; Co.'s percussive arrangement, you know you're hearing someone special. I hope she gets more moments like that on her own albums in the future.

Speaking of which in some sences you can really see the true emotions overwhelling the actor or actress, watch for real tears starting not fake in some sences which makes this an even better film! Once again Steven Spielberg proves the he is one of hollywoods very best.

B0000041DF|5.0|This single, mid-priced disc is definitely one of Argerich's greatest achievements (I recently bought the &quot;Martha Argerich Collection&quot; (DG), and this is so from my point of view). Since this astounding and divine interpret is THE best pianist alive, you might just guess what I am talking about. Argerich plays the Rachmaninov full of sorrow and impetuosity; her tempi are unequaled in the history of the third corcerto's recordings. I have known people who came really close to commiting suicide when exposed to this monument of human passion, so wonderfully played by so sensational a pianist. <BR>Tchaikovsky's first concerto blossoms to its full tragic strenght, but the orchestra seems perchance somewhat lost at some parts. <BR>In my humble opinion, this is one of the greatest discs ever recorded. If you haven't bought it yet, well, it might be better to hurry.
0393037010|5.0|Over the years,  I have came across a number of stunning reviews for O'Brian's books. One day when I was faced with finding something new to read, I ordered this book from Amazon.<br />To be honest, at first I found the book confusing and boring.  The reader is faced with a number of unfamiliarities: the time period, the culture of the Royal navy, the dialect, the nautical terms, the political situations, the standards of behavior, the geography, the Royal Society with its Baconian approach to science, and state-legitimized piracy,  to name but a few.  I spent about 6 months reading this book ( I usually read a  book in a week or two), and would put it down for awhile and read something else.  After three or four chapters, I realized  that there was little value in looking up all the references to various sails and parts of ships. From this point on I really started to enjoy the book, and by the time Aubrey has his first piratical adventure, I was hooked.  After I finished \\"Master and Commander\\", I read the other 19 books in 11 months.<br />Some advice:<br />1. Read the books in order.  Characters appear, disappear, and re-appear throughout the books.  Sometimes they die, but usually not.<BR>2. Read the second book \\"Post Captain\\" very carefully. IMHO, it is the best book of all 20.  This book focuses on developing the Maturin character as a spy; a sophisticated man of wealth, background, and education; a drug user; and a nerdy womanizer - sort of an 19th century cross between James Bond and Bill Gates.<BR>3. Unless you are compelled by an obsessive-compulsive disorder to do otherwise, ignore the thousands of detailed nautical terms.  Sometimes they have some value, but generally only in the case of a nautical joke.  I bought one of the suggested help books (\\"Dictionary of Nautical Terms\\") and found it to be generally useless in defining terms used in 19th century sailing.<BR>4.  Keep a general US and World history text handy.  This will be useful for some quick background when Aubrey is involved in some minor war, especially the ones I slept thru in world history classes in college.<BR>5.  I looked up a lot of terms in the OED.<BR>6. Have fun.  These are easy reads.  It was fun to discover a unread series of 20 great books to read at my age.  It was like \\"discovering\\" the works of Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway, McPhee, and Updike in high school.
B00004Z459|5.0|I first heard Hybrid Theory when a friend brought it into work..I was a kinda Pop-Hip Hop fan..I hated all the Metal music like Limp Biskit and Manson..and to be honest did'nt think much of this..but then track #6 \\"Runaway\\" came on..The lyrics just grabbed me -l- \\"Grafitti decorations under a sky of dust..a constant wave of tension on top of broken trust\\"..really opened my eyes to this album..I started taking more notice of each song when it was played..and I was just blown away by the lyrics..I know this sounds weird but it was like I had this complete change in taste..I decided to buy the album for myself and listen to it on my own away from everything..It's hard to explain and Im probably sounding like a freak *l* but this album has touched me..The lyrics are amazing..Chester's voice (lead singer)takes you in..never heard anything like it..the way,one minute he sings softly..melodic..then burst into this awsome..screaming rage..and it's not like Limp Biskit or whatever..everything from this album sounds amazing..the way Mike and Chester's voices combined..There's nothing else like this..It's a must..I have like 4 copies..You'll never stop playing this..Linkin Park make the rest of the music world sound so plain..This album has made music a huge part of my life..Every song on the album is great..but I have muh 5 favourites..<br />#1 Papercut- Could'nt have made a better choice to open the album on..amazing lyrics..real fast tempo...very loud..with a soft,melodic finish..<br />#2 One Step Closer-From start to finish..awsome..It'll have you bouncing out of your chair..<br />#5 Crawling- Prepare to be blown away..Chester's on fine form..One of the harder songs on the album..The lyrics will take your breath away..<br />#6 Runaway- Always gonna be special to me cuz it was the song that in away introduced me to Linkin Park..Hardcore chorus with soft verse in between..<br />#8 In The End- My favourite song off the album..it's hard to choose a fave..but this is a specialsong.Everyone I know likes this song *l* even my Mum..One of the softer songs off the album..I've had the CD nearly a year and I can still keep this song on repeat for hours..Words can't describe..just have to check it out for yourself..<br />#12 Pushing me Away- Brilliant..like \\"In the End\\",has a softer feel to it..Amazing lyrics..Mike's rap-style lines blend in great with Chester's awsome voice..\\"I've lied to you..the same way that I always do\\"..Awsome..<br />I'd be suprised if you're still reading this *l*..I've said enough..Just buy it..You've gotta hear it....
6301697707|4.0|TREMORS, though not a great movie, has all the elements of a great movie. It's got a good cast (Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Michael Gross, Reba McEntire), decent plot (small desert town attacked by flesh-eating worms), lots of action and suspense, very realistic special effects, and plenty of humor mixed in. The movie makes no qualms that its a rehash of the old sci-fi flicks of the 1950's and 1960's that starred giant insects. However, TREMORS makes it all seem so new. The only drawback is that the movie never explains where the \\"graboids\\" came from (perhaps to be discussed in a sequel). Whereas JAWS is to MOBY DICK, TREMORS is to comic books.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There are albums you listen to and there are albums that you EXPERIENCE.  This is one of those albums.  From the first guitar licks to Thom Yorke's final vocals, OK COMPUTER makes the listener feel drained.   Each song is passionate and intense in its own way, be it fast or slow.  With each listen, the album also becomes richer and more rewarding.   Wow, is all I can say.  After The BENDS, this is my next favorite Radiohead Album.
B00000EZTQ|4.0|Beginning exactly where the original film left off, HALLOWEEN 2 continues the tale of the fateful night when Michael Myers returned home to hunt down and find Laurie Strode. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie, though she really doesn't show up until the second half of the film and Donald Pleasence is back as Dr. Loomis, the prophetic psychiatrist to whom no one would listen.<br />Like all horror sequels, it forgets that less is more and therefore has a much higher body count with lots of unnecessary gore. Another thing similar to other horror sequels is that the plot becomes more complicated, but the movie never actually follows the rules it establishes. .... He'll stop at nothing to get to her. Yet, why doesn't he kill the old couple at the beginning of the movie and doesn't spare the young girl next door? Go figure. Anyway, this movie is a nice follow up to the original even with the unnecessary gore and nudity.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Another year, another nomination for John williams.   Although it doesnt come as a surprise that this score would be nominated this year for an Oscar, the big surprise is how much it doesnt deserve it.   Now dont get me wrong, I am the BIGGEST john Williams fan out there.   I guess this makes me even more critical of his work.  He's been responsible for Raiders, Star Wars, and ET to name a few so there is no excuse that the score to HP has to be so safe and middle of the road Williams.  hedwig's theme is great but the entire score suffers from Williams' love of it.  Almost every track has portions of it and after awhile, it begins to get old and annoying.   The real jems on this cd are track 2 (harry's Magical world) and the Chess Match.  If you are just discovering John Williams' music, you wont go wrong getting Harry Potter despite how lackluster and typical it is.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I bought the dvd for the movie, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" without even seeing the movie first.  I wasn't disappointed.  My roommate bought the soundtrack cd recently and its a very nice compliment to the movie.  The real surprise here is not the remake of \\"Lady Marmalade\\" by Christina Aquilera, Lil Kim, Mya, and Pink---which, by the way, is dwarfed in comparison to the real deal sang by Patti LaBelle---its the singing voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  Both having very nice, sweet singing voice that are prefectly matched for this soundtrack and the movie.  \\"Come What May\\" is a beautiful duet and Ewan McGregors delivery of \\"Your Song\\" is right on the money.  The latin inspired \\"Rhythm of the Night\\" is good as are most of the songs on this soundtrack.  Skip the overhyped and overrated \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and you are guaranteed to enjoy this cd.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Simply put, LOTR is the best score to be composed for a film this year.   Like the film, it is at once Epic, sweeping, majestic, yet quaint and warm at the same time.  To those who scratched their heads after hearing of director Peter Jackson's choice to score the first of this trilogy, they can all breath a sigh of relief.  Howard Shore has delivered the goods and more.   From the ominous opening track (The Prophecy), to the final chords of the Fellowship Theme, this soundtrack manages to thrill, chill, and bring the listener to tears.  The magnificent choir passages in this score puts John Williams' Duel of the Fates to shame and Enya's singing surprisingly fits like a glove and even adds to the score's ethereal quality.  If this is a sign of what is to come in Two Towers and Return of the king, I'll be first in line when those soundtracks hit the stores.  If you still don't have this score, shame on you.  Get it now!!!
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet for me is one of those rare films that you can watch over and over and never get tired of.This movie has remained in my top five favorites for over 12 years.All the actors are supurb<BR>in thier performances.Especially Dennis Hopper and his airmask!One of the most suprising things about the film is how quickly it turns from an innocent bit of story telling to one of the most<BR>contriversial masterpieces ever! Although I will not give any details about the plot,I recommend this one with a vengence! However, this is not a movie for everyone. Lynch's trademark strangeness shows no mercy and could perhaps shatter the senses<BR>of some more conservative mainstream viewers.I only wish that Lynch had followed this same pattern with Wild At Heart.
0783117523|5.0|I really liked this movie. I thought Angelina did a great job, i gotta give the girl credit, shes fine and a great actress, and a good all around person. This movie is good id recommend it to anybody, and i have. Its a really sad story, but its one of those you just have to watch over and over again.It helped me to realize, have fun in life, but be careful.Thank you Angelina you truly are an inspirating actress.

B000002JSN|5.0|Though it was reported that the guys in Led Zeppelin detested the term &quot;heavy metal,&quot; &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is the ultimate &quot;heavy metal&quot; album.  Though there is no &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; on this LP, it stands out as Zep's best work.<br />Many other genres of music are covered on this LP:  blues, acoustic, Mideastern.  One of Zep's best songs, &quot;Ten Years Gone,&quot; still tugs at my heartstrings.  &quot;The Rover&quot; is one of Zep's best rockers, and &quot;Down By The Seaside&quot; mellows you out.  The centerpeice of &quot;Graffiti,&quot; &quot;Kashmir,&quot; stands as one of the Top Five Zep classics.<br />I would put this up there with the Stones' &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot; and KISS's &quot;Destroyer&quot; as being among the best albums of the 70s.  They don't rock like this one.
B00003CXXP|5.0|First off, I'm aware that people are free to express their opinions. What confuses me everytime is when they argue length. Many have said this film is too long, and quoting &quot; the ending should have come 30 minutes earlier.&quot;  I don't get it. This film doesn't drag at all. You wanna talk &quot;drag&quot;  see Pearl Harbor. <br />   The movie is the perfect length for the amount of information packed in it. The effects are brilliant, the acting, fantastic. I'm the first to admit that effects aren't everything, but in this film, they serve the story very well. (I'm a big fan of films that take place in one room).  <BR>  <BR>I loved this movie, it was incredible, it made you want to be there( and also pull teddy right into your living room--- that little scene stealer--)<br />The only thing that bugged me really was the music. At moments, it seems not quite right. Overall it works--but just those little bits are odd to me. I wish i could pin-point where they are in the film, but it's not that big a deal anyway.<br />Incredible achievment in film.<br />Teddy rules!<br />A.P.L
0393316041|4.0|What does a nobel prize winning physicist do in his offtime, and how does he do his thinking?<br />Well, as far as Mr. Feynman goes, he was an orrdinary person, with a predilection for investigation and curiousity. He seemed to be curious about anything that came along, and had a real sense of what it meant to be scientific. <br />This book was a joy to read, and gave me faith in how humans can really do whatever they want. The quotes and stories are interesting, although you won't get any further understanding of physics from this book. Nice thing is, you don't need to understand physics to understand this book - it's pure pleasure to read, from beginning to end.

If you have never seen it you should. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Surely one of the biggest disappointments in recent years after hearing such critical praise.  The Strokes play sort of amalgam of late 70's and early 80's punk and downtown rock but with little grasp of wit, melodic sense, or dynamics.  Sure, it sounds rough and tough on the surface, but there just isn't enough musicianship here to provide any ongoing interest.  They will have a few big singles and then fade into ... ruin.  The best thing these guys could do would be to take five years off, hone their chops, and see if they could write better songs.  Without the lead singer's family name, they would be a mere footnote on the NYC club scene.
6304698798|3.0|I give this one three stars... basically I agree with the &quot;one star&quot; guys. The story is kind of a mess. I remember watching the Italian version five years ago or something and there the story made definitely sense. In the DVD you'll find those &quot;lost&quot; parts but... it is not like what I consider the original.
0345448898|5.0|The \\"His Dark Materials Trilogy\\"....ahh, where do I begin? These books are outstanding. They are #2 on my list of favorite books (no one can beat Harry Potter- not even Lyra and Will!). The first is incredible, the second astounding, and the third is utterly amazing. Whenever I read these, I am taken into the world (or worlds) of Will and Lyra. When I stop reading (which only happens if I desperately need to sleep, eat etc.) I am left craving more.<br />Many people have denounced these books for religious reasons. I am Christian, and I admit that I was alarmed by the anti-God views in this book. But I believe that it is fully acceptable to read something you don't believe. Just because I read these books doesn't mean I am going to abandon my beliefs for someone else's. This book is a work of fiction, and should be treated as so.<br />In conclusion, I think that Phillip Pullman has done a more than admirable job in writing 3 of the best books in history.
B00005QB9A|5.0|This is a must have for any drama fan.<br />This is quite possibly the most beatiful film I've ever seen. One year before i saw it, I heard the Roger Water's song &quot;lost boys calling&quot; The song was excellent but i never heard it in the proper context. When it's played on piano in the film, when 1900 sees the girl, he tracks her and plays it, she leaves and there's only the sea. The song is also on the end credits.<br />The acting is superb, the story even better. I think those who've seen this will never forget the &quot;piano duel&quot;.<BR> I watched it with my girlfriend, we were both amazed and truly moved at the end. Even if I was alone, I think I would've shed some tears.<br />Fantastic film.<br />A.P.L
B000002LEU|3.0|My Joy Division experience began with \\"Closer\\" - seven songs of sheer brilliance, followed by an embarassingly somber funeral dirge, \\"The Eternal,\\" and culminating in the passingly decent \\"Decades\\". \\"Closer\\" is a cohesive, visceral, and harrowing experience. It takes you on a journey into darkness and despair, pushing you further and further to the edge of suicidal hopelessness. And then, without even flinching, it pushes you over. You're left feeling angry, sad, and frustrated. Ian Curtis essentially tells you \\"I'm going to kill myself and here's why.\\" Then, not longer after recording the album, he does. The reality of his suicide haunts the album. It's an intense human experience, which probably explains the appeal. And oh yeah, the music is outstanding!<br />\\"Substance\\" on the other hand is a relatively disjointed, at times mediocre, experience. \\"Substance\\" has its share of great songs, but not one of them measures up to the first seven songs on \\"Closer.\\"<br />The album begins with \\"Warsaw\\" and \\"Leaders of Men,\\" two singles from the Warsaw era. For those unaware, Warsaw was the name of the band before they became Joy Division, back when they were U.K. punk. In my opinion, the Warsaw material is bland and uninspired. It's not bad, but it's not really stuff you'd want to spend money on if it wasn't coupled with the other, better Joy Division songs. I bet that if Ian and the boys disbanded after recording as Warsaw, they would barely even be talked about anymore. Also, the last seven songs (which I believe are actually bonus tracks) sound very similar to these first two. (\\"No Love Lost\\" and \\"Failures\\" were recorded as Warsaw - I'm not sure about the others.) Brit punk is not really what Joy Division is known for, or what they're good at apparently.<br />\\"Digital,\\" track 3, is the first *good* song on the album. Surprisingly it's very similar to the Warsaw songs, but it's got a great beat and works really well. Then, just when things are looking up, comes \\"Autosuggestion.\\" It's a proper Joy Division song, at least moreso than what comes before it. But it's also a little tiresome, dragging on for over six minutes.<br />Tracks 5 through 10 are really the heart and soul of this album. (\\"One will burn...\\") \\"Dead Souls\\" will be familiar to Nine Inch Nails fans. Trent did a nice, angry cover of the song on \\"The Crow\\" soundtrack. The original's just as good, only different - Ian's vocals are so distinctive. \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" Joy Division's biggest single, is flat out essential. It's the kind of song that only Joy Division can do. It's also a perfect example of what I find most fascinating about this band. Hook and Morris create a pleasant, happy melody: perfect for New Order. The song seems made for romantic musings. But we're talking Ian Curtis here. In stark contrast to what the music intends, Ian sings desparingly of heartbreak and loss. The tension and contradiction that this produces is what gives the song character and bite. This compilation could have used more songs like this.<br />As mentioned, Ian had a very distinctive voice. For some, it's just too distinctive and different to be enjoyable. \\"Atmosphere\\" is a prime example of how bad Ian's vocals can get. For some reason they come off laughably bad on this song. Plenty of Joy Division fans rank \\"Atmosphere\\" as one of their favorites, but to me it sounds like he's mocking his own voice. It's almost hard to listen to.<br />Well there's my review. I am giving this album 3 stars with full knowledge that I will get blasted with unhelpful votes, mostly from Joy Division fans. But hopefully this has been helpful for the Joy Division-curious. My suggestion: buy \\"Closer\\" first; if you like it a lot, get \\"Unknown Pleasures\\"; if you're craving more, get \\"Substance.\\"
B00003CXXP|1.0|Haley Joel Osment played the lead beautifully and I couldn't fault the CGI special effects. As we've come to expect from a film with Steven Spielberg's name on it, they were state of the art. However I found this film very difficult to watch. I was sitting in the comfort of my own home, but this film made me feel uncomfortable, uneasy and slightly sickened. Had it been a horror film, i'd have been praising it for achieving such a state of mind. Instead i'm here to tell you to avoid it.<br />What did I hate about it?<br />1: The first part of the film where 'David' (Haley Joel Osment)    joins the tragic family, well this was positively bizarre! <BR>2: The rubbish tip where the deformed robots were scrabbling for    spare parts to improve their functionality and appearance. Sad    and tragic!<BR>3: The 'flesh circus' where the so called humans torture the    unfortunate robots for their pleasure. One sad looking 'Mecha'    turns to a robot friend (just before it's his turn) and says    \\"would you mind turning off my pain sensors?\\" Entertainment?<BR>4: The sentimentality of the ending.<br />I'm sorry, but I couldn't wait for this film to end. Avoid It!
B000002UAX|5.0|To call this an \\"experienced artist's new album\\" was to measure it by the wrong yardstick--the listener ends up expecting new ground to be broken. Or at least new ground at the time it was released. None of us who bought it back when it was first released saw it in that way once we'd listened to it--even those of us who had expected all sorts of envelopes to be pushed as we stood in line before dawn at the record store for the \\"new Beatles album\\". What we got was an effort from a group who paid attention to what their contemporaries were up to--everybody does albums or at least songs influenced by some elder statesperson, like the 'Stones with Muddy Waters. Like \\"Glass Onion\\", a look back at their own previous work a la Harrison's much later \\"When We Was Fab\\". Or \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", Harrison's nod to friend Eric Clapton (the two were later to do a duet of it at the Bangladesh concert). There's a lot of early Paul Simon in McCartney's \\"Blackbird\\". Sir Paul also takes a poke at C & W in \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" in a pretty fair southern accent, even if he does blow it with the word \\"raccoon\\". He also captures the manic side of Led Zeppelin in \\"Helter Skelter\\", long before the song was ever associated with Charles Manson. Lennon takes his own crack at Zep with \\"Yer Blues\\". Or maybe this one takes aim at Jack Bruce of Cream. There's a bit of Spencer Davis-era Steve Winwood in \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\". McCartney even gives a nod across genre lines to The Champagne Music Of Lawrence Welk with \\"Honey Pie\\". If he's anything like me, that can't have been easy--my own parents were Welk viewers who regarded the Beatles as \\"noise\\". Ringo winds it all up with a Disney-esque \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" lullabye in the form of \\"Good Night\\". See what I mean? There are lots of albums out there of various artists doing a tribute to one artist--they're a dime a dozen these days. How many have there been where it's the other way around--one band paying tribute to several artists?ying tribute to several artists?
B00003CXZ1|2.0|After  watching this film, I never want to hear anybody complain about Battlefield Earth again. I do not understand how this movie escaped public criticism.The story and script are pretty bad. The filming and editing make you feel like you are watching a two hour mountain dew comercial. The ony cool thing are the scenes of Angor Wat. People under twelve may enjoy this film, but others will find themselves scratching their heads.
B000002U82|5.0|I just heard 'Dark Side Of The Moon' today for the twenty millionth time. It just takes me by surprise every time. How? How can it be so slow and so intense, so quiet and so powerful, so simple and so sophisticated, that you wonder why you didn't think of it first, but you also know the answer very well? So chaotic and complex and yet so precise? It IS precise. I've never heard another rock album in which all the pieces fit together so perfectly, every song being wonderful by itself but the whole being much, much more. The songs, the instrumentals, the sound effects and the spoken parts are all essential for the comprehension of this creation. Roger Waters's lyrics (he wrote all of them) read like one brilliant, epic multi-parted poem, and Pink Floyd's music makes it complete and perfect. The weakest song on the album - 'Us And Them' - is a masterpiece, and enormously better than most of what any other band could ever make; but it's in the structure that the album's biggest strenghth lies, and it's the perfection of the structure that Pink Floyd would never again achieve in such level. It was structure that was always the biggest failing of previous Pink Floyd albums - Meddle and Atom Heart Mother, with one side-long piece and some others to go on the other side, or the strangely built double album Ummagumma. How awful that there are so many Pink Floyd compilation albums out there! How can someone appreciate The Great Gig In The Sky or Brain Damage and Eclipse without the context of the album?<br />Still, to go through this song by song, well... After the brief and vague instrumental intro 'Speak To Me', there is 'Breathe', which is a sort of an introduction to the album, and also a musical theme that runs through the entire work (the reprise at the end of 'Time', 'Any Colour You Like', and the beginning of 'The Great Gig In The Sky'). Strangely enough, the more I heard this album I realised that this was one of the best pieces on the album, and even if it's not assophisticated as 'Time' or 'Money', instrumentaly it's the best song on the album, with truly ingenious slide-guitar work from David Gilmour, as well as superb backing from Waters, Wright and Mason. David's voice shines, as it does on the rest of the album.<br />'On The Run' - like 'Speak To Me', hardly notable by itself, but fits precisely into the work. A tense, haunting electronic sounding rhythm, absolutely mesmerising. And after 'On The Run' you find yourself completely unprepared to the tense genius of 'Time'. Doubtlessly the best song on the album, possibly Pink Floyd's all time best, or at least most complete. Although- and it's hard for me to say - I think it could have been better. It's a truly brilliant composition that, somehow, doesn't reach the full of its potential; and instrumentaly, both 'Breathe' and 'Money' are more powerful (that's with the exception of two parts - the introduction, with splendid instrumental work by Waters and Gilmour but mostly drummer Nick Mason, who shines here brilliantly, and also David's guitar solo in the middle, which remains one of his best.)<br />'The Great Gig In The Sky' - to me, the best piece of music Richard Wright ever made, as both a writer and a pianist, and the singer's voice is unbelievebly beautiful. It should be heard at full volume. 'Money' - Roger's first real masterful solo composition, having now mastered the music as well as the lyrics. The strange seven-eighth beat, Roger's wonderful bassline and the repeating sound effects create an odd, haunting, incredibly powerful rhythm. Superb sax and guitar solos make it complete. 'Us And Them' - a beautiful song, though I feel that unlike 'Time' or 'Money' it doesn't quite justify its length. Another linking instrumental, 'Any Colour You Like' (with splendid guitar work) leads to the last two tracks - 'Brain Damage' and 'Eclipse' - which always go together, even though the first time the album was performed live 'Eclipse' wasn't even part of it. Both songs areunmistakably Roger's, and he also does an excellent vocal job on them.<br />I didn't really want to write a review about this album; there are quite enough of them. It's just that I just heard it and didn't have anything else to write about. And frankly, I was slightly blown away by the bad reviews (not that many, but more than a few and they certainly stick out) it got. But hey, listen to it and decide for yourself. Nobody should go through life without hearing it once. I'm not the only one whom it changed, in one way or another.
B00005UQD5|4.0|The actual abandoned Danvers State Hospital in Massachusetts is a fantastic Gothic revival pile of a building; it is mostrously oversized, larger than you'd think any such building would have a right to be, and makes an absolutely wonderful setting for this very sophisticated Gothic chiller. Four workers on a hazmat team have one week to remove the asbestos and other hazardous waste products from the abandoned state hospital, with its miles of ugly rotting corridors and empty rooms; by the end of the film there are fewer of the team than when we started. This is the standard set-up for a Gothic film (think THE SHINING, the orginal HAUNTING, the first ALIEN), but the unusualness of the hospital, the exceptionally fine performances, and the sophisticated script set this in nearly as high the same class as those aforementioned Gothic classics. The screenwriters give you so many fine red herrings that the ending works quite well. Peter Mullan gives a superb performance as the member of the hazmat team who most engages the audience's sympathies (though his Scots accent is at times a bit impenetrable). The cinematography is exceptionally and beautifully creepy.
B000002IQW|5.0|ok. let me begin with a disclaimer: i do not, in any way, shape, or form, condone eighties hair metal (featuring, Poison and their ilk).  but i like Skid Row.  A LOT.  and it kind of [irritates] me off that such a great hard rock band is so carelessly lumped in with all of that other spandex/hairspray trash.  so Sebastian Bach had great hair.  so what?  he also had a great voice.  no, INCREDIBLE.  breathtaking.  moving, emotional, expressive, clear, POWERFUL, big and beautiful.  just a few adjectives.  for those of you who denounced the Skids after listening to their admittedly weaker debut, don't pass them off for Bon Jovi just yet.  other than the obvious \\"Youth Gone Wild,\\" \\"Eighteen & Life,\\" and \\"I Remember You\\" (guilty aural pleasures for anyone who was seventeen in the summer of 1989), the debut was really no more that pop metal fluff with a little bit of an extra edge on what everyone else was doing.  so do yourself a favor and give \\"Slave to the Grind\\" the chance it deserves.<BR>         For me, this record almost surpasses \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" by the late, great Guns'N'Roses.  With the exception of 2 weak songs, \\"Riot Act\\" and \\"Creepshow,\\" there is truly not a dull moment.  This album was Skid Row's rite of passage, their coming into their own in the rock world.  it's a representation of their departure from the generic metal of their debut.  Yeah, the hard songs kick, big time.  But no matter how hardcore a rocker you are, there is absolutely no denying \\"In a Darkened Room\\" and \\"Wasted Time.\\"  Oh, my God.  I had always thought Sebastian Bach was hot.  I ain't gon' lie.  But it really wasn't until i heard his voice on these two songs, pleading, bleeding, needing, and tortured, that i really fell in love with the man.  he is just spectacular.  these two songs are my idea of exactly what a song should be.  no  matter what's going on, as long as they're playing, all is KOOL in my world.  so, in conclusion to my rather lengthy review (i love this record somuch that i didn't even say a quarter of what i'd wanted to), i just want to say that you would be doing yourself a great injustice if you didn't get this record.  you owe it to yourself!  (and to Sebastian just because of that voice of his.  LOVE YOU, BAZ!!!)  Did i go over 1,000 words?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think this movie is a great movie.  The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after the first 15 minutes being quite confused.  I tried watching the movie again and after I knew what was going on, it became a great movie.  I think the key to actually liking this movie is to relate to it.  I am in a chorus and love singing which is probably why I loved this movie.  When I heard Ewan McGregor sing I was in awe.  It was great.  Then Nicole Kidman....wow!  I would buy the soundtrack alone for 20+ dollars!  Th plot can get a little &quot;cheesy&quot; somtimes but it still kept me entertained the whole time. I love this movie.  If you're thinking about buying this movie, I suggest you go and rent it before you by it.  As you can see in all of the reviews, it's either a hate it or love it movie.  Also, this DVD has an extra disc dedicated to extras (easily 3+ hours)!  Overall, I think ths movie is great with great exceptional singing by the two main stars; Ewan Mcregor and Nicole Kidman.<BR>Movie: A       Extras: A+     Sound and Music: A+       Replay Value(how many times you'll watch it over and over): A-<br />I hope this review helped you. (It's my first one :)
B000002U82|5.0|I just heard 'Dark Side Of The Moon' today for the twenty millionth time. It just takes me by surprise every time. How? How can it be so slow and so intense, so quiet and so powerful, so simple and so sophisticated, that you wonder why you didn't think of it first, but you also know the answer very well? So chaotic and complex and yet so precise? It IS precise. I've never heard another rock album in which all the pieces fit together so perfectly, every song being wonderful by itself but the whole being much, much more. The songs, the instrumentals, the sound effects and the spoken parts are all essential for the comprehension of this creation. Roger Waters's lyrics (he wrote all of them) read like one brilliant, epic multi-parted poem, and Pink Floyd's music makes it complete and perfect. The weakest song on the album - 'Us And Them' - is a masterpiece, and enormously better than most of what any other band could ever make; but it's in the structure that the album's biggest strenghth lies, and it's the perfection of the structure that Pink Floyd would never again achieve in such level. It was structure that was always the biggest failing of previous Pink Floyd albums - Meddle and Atom Heart Mother, with one side-long piece and some others to go on the other side, or the strangely built double album Ummagumma. How awful that there are so many Pink Floyd compilation albums out there! How can someone appreciate The Great Gig In The Sky or Brain Damage and Eclipse without the context of the album?<br />Still, to go through this song by song, well... After the brief and vague instrumental intro 'Speak To Me', there is 'Breathe', which is a sort of an introduction to the album, and also a musical theme that runs through the entire work (the reprise at the end of 'Time', 'Any Colour You Like', and the beginning of 'The Great Gig In The Sky'). Strangely enough, the more I heard this album I realised that this was one of the best pieces on the album, and even if it's not assophisticated as 'Time' or 'Money', instrumentaly it's the best song on the album, with truly ingenious slide-guitar work from David Gilmour, as well as superb backing from Waters, Wright and Mason. David's voice shines, as it does on the rest of the album.<br />'On The Run' - like 'Speak To Me', hardly notable by itself, but fits precisely into the work. A tense, haunting electronic sounding rhythm, absolutely mesmerising. And after 'On The Run' you find yourself completely unprepared to the tense genius of 'Time'. Doubtlessly the best song on the album, possibly Pink Floyd's all time best, or at least most complete. Although- and it's hard for me to say - I think it could have been better. It's a truly brilliant composition that, somehow, doesn't reach the full of its potential; and instrumentaly, both 'Breathe' and 'Money' are more powerful (that's with the exception of two parts - the introduction, with splendid instrumental work by Waters and Gilmour but mostly drummer Nick Mason, who shines here brilliantly, and also David's guitar solo in the middle, which remains one of his best.)<br />'The Great Gig In The Sky' - to me, the best piece of music Richard Wright ever made, as both a writer and a pianist, and the singer's voice is unbelievebly beautiful. It should be heard at full volume. 'Money' - Roger's first real masterful solo composition, having now mastered the music as well as the lyrics. The strange seven-eighth beat, Roger's wonderful bassline and the repeating sound effects create an odd, haunting, incredibly powerful rhythm. Superb sax and guitar solos make it complete. 'Us And Them' - a beautiful song, though I feel that unlike 'Time' or 'Money' it doesn't quite justify its length. Another linking instrumental, 'Any Colour You Like' (with splendid guitar work) leads to the last two tracks - 'Brain Damage' and 'Eclipse' - which always go together, even though the first time the album was performed live 'Eclipse' wasn't even part of it. Both songs areunmistakably Roger's, and he also does an excellent vocal job on them.<br />I didn't really want to write a review about this album; there are quite enough of them. It's just that I just heard it and didn't have anything else to write about. And frankly, I was slightly blown away by the bad reviews (not that many, but more than a few and they certainly stick out) it got. But hey, listen to it and decide for yourself. Nobody should go through life without hearing it once. I'm not the only one whom it changed, in one way or another.
B000062X90|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating the reissue of this album.  Bassist/vocalist Martin Turner remixed the tracks on this disk a few years ago for their inclusion in two great Wishone Ash compilation sets &quot;Distillation&quot; and &quot;Time Was&quot;.  This is the first time the new mixes have been remastered and included in the original &quot;Argus&quot; album context.  The sound is excellent. Three bonus tracks from the &quot;Live In Memphis&quot; promo ep which was released in 1972 are also included.  <br />Their third album &quot;Argus&quot; from 1972 features the classic line up of Andy Powell on guitars (Gibson Flying V)and vocals, Ted Turner on guitars (Fender Strat)and vocals, Martin Turner on bass and vocals and Steve Upton on drums.  This set at the time of release was voted as album of the year by a few British music magazines.  The band hailed from Britain and their unique style is spotlighted at its best on this album.  The band's influences ranged from progressive rock, folk, jazz, and blues/boogie.  Tracks like &quot;Time Was&quot; and &quot;Sometime World&quot; progress from acoustic opening sections to more rocking numbers by their end.  &quot;Blowin' Free&quot; is perhaps the band's anthem and the new clarity of the remix allows for further examinations of the bands harmonic guitar approach.  Martin Turner's bass much to my approval also seems to be more &quot;up front&quot; in the new remixed version of &quot;Argus&quot;.  The new remastering enhances the harmony vocal approach which the band often utilized. &quot;The King Will Come&quot; a song about the second coming of God contains a great riff and one of my favorite guitar solos by Ted Turner.  &quot;Leaf And Stream&quot; shows the band's more folk/rock approach.  The tandem of &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Throw Down The Sword&quot; end the album on a high note and fit in perfectly with one of Storm Thorgerson's classic Hipgnosis album covers. The music and melodies are haunting while the axe workboth harmonic and solo is outstanding.<br />The success of this album landed them the opening slot on the Who's 1972 tour.  The &quot;Live In Memphis&quot; ep was recorded during the time and adds three of their better tracks featuring the Powell, Turner, Turner, &amp; Upton line up. &quot;Jail Bait&quot; is a great stomping boogie rocker, while &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; also from their second lp shows the more progressive/jazzy nature of the band and is mostly instrumental.  &quot;Phoenix&quot; from their first lp was their closing show stopper and evolves from a more subdued number to an energetic guitar showcase near its end.  The bonus tracks are a welcome addition.  I highly recommend this reissue. If you enjoy this cd I would also recommend the 4 disk anthology &quot;Distillation&quot; which summarizes the band's career with live material and rarities to that point or &quot;Live Dates&quot;.  Now if only Universal/MCA would reissue the &quot;Live Dates 2&quot; album on cd.
B00003CX6P|4.0|\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is built upon a fascinating, but terribly flawed, premise: disguised in a Princeton jacket, Tom Ripley is asked by one Mr. Greenleaf to go to Italy and bring back his son Dickie (fascinating).  The speed with which Greenleaf trusts Ripley nearly breaks the sound barrier (flawed).  This uneven beginning is a microcosm of the rest of the film.<br />Essentially a story about taking over the persona of someone else, writer/director Anthony Minghella goes a tad overboard with his imagery.  Populated by more mirrors than you'd find in an average funhouse, \\"Ripley\\" never lets you forget that Tom and Dickie are two halves of the same whole, or, rather, that that is Tom's ultimate wish.  It's never more effectively and obviously expressed than in a scene on a train.  While Dickie is asleep, Tom uses the reflection in the window to ape the famous shot from Bergman's \\"Persona\\" where two faces seem to melt together as one (this is the second movie I've reviewed this week to copy this shot, the other being \\"Mulholland Drive\\"; also, it's mocked in Woody Allen's \\"Love and Death\\").  Throw in the Saul Bass-ian fractured title sequence, and, yes Anthony, we see personality fragmented all over this picture.<br />But, just when you think Minghella's bag of tricks is plentiful but shallow, he composes a shot in the cover of a grand piano, after Ripley has made a particularly important decision.  He is seen in the piano's reflection, and when he walks away, the curve of the cover makes him seem to split in two.  It's subtlety and ingeniousness knocked me out.  See what I mean about the film's unevenness?  (Minghella further shows his thoughtfulness on the DVD's commentary track; he is learned, intelligent, witty, and thorough in allowing us some insight into his filmmaking choices)<br />The actor's are uniformly excellent.  Matt Damon, wearing ugly horn-rimmed glasses which I suspect are meant to play Clark Kent to his Superman's smile, gets Tom's social awkwardness just right, has a fun time showing off his gifts as a mimic, and doesn't shy away from the character's repressed (for the time being) homosexuality.  Damon, who's usually a very mannered actor, is so in many moments here too.  But he does let his hair down most of the time, going full-force in to Ripley's pathos.  Gwyneth Paltrow, luminous as usual, plays emotions that run the gamut from felicity to fear, with a touch of utopian ennui thrown in.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has a knack for stealing entire movies if he's given only a few scenes, steals the entire movie in only a few scenes.  Minghella gives Hoffman a grand entrance, driving a red Ferrari through a flock of bird, and Hoffman delivers the boorish gusto that makes the scene work so well.  Cate Blanchett, in what could have been a very unforgiving role (ignorant rich girl), milks melancholy from Meredith that's not in the script, and gives her some intelligence to boot.<br />Jude Law, who's made a living playing the ultimate object of both male and female desire, reaches the apex of his career here.  Dickie Greenleaf, the spoiled, Princeton-educated son of an American shipping magnate, has one true talent of his own: spending papa's dough in lush Italy.  Law, lithe and lovely, is a marvel when he's on screen, and even more so when he's not.  The movie sags during his absence, a point that's probably intentional.  We are made to desire Dickie as much as Tom does.  It's a tricky proposition for a film to make, to have so much of its momentum hinge on one character's presence.  And when Tom finally takes over Dickie's identity, making Dickie ultimately expendable, the film can't help but run out of steam.<br />The second half, in which the film downshifts swiftly to become a typical thriller, is not nearly as strong as the first, for just this reason.  Law is no longer around to brighten up the screen, and the film lags.  Add to that the clumsy bedroom-farce-minus-the-comedy antics of the characters (What would happen if Meredith, who thinks Tom is Dickie, and Marge, who knows Tom is Tom, meet in Tom's presence?  Well, let's run around like chickens with our heads cut off to make sure that doesn't happen!  Yeesh!) and you find yourself yearning for the end credits to come.  Thats not to say that the second half is devoid of merit.  Paltrow and Hoffman are particularly effective as they make concentric circles around Ripley, getting closer and closer to the truth.  Damon, for his part, manages to hold them off skillfully.  It's an intriguing chess game between these three actors.<br />But alas, the film overstays its welcome.  Too long by half an hour, I'd say, the film's themes become stale before the plot is brought to an unnatural conclusion.  On the whole though, mainly for its fervent first half and its gorgeous cinematography, I enjoyed the film terribly.
0425152251|5.0|This is a simple read and easy to understand book about the history of philosophy. Major concepts and ideas of various philosophers are introduced in the contents of a story about a young girl receiving a mysterious mail. The book covers philosophical ideas from pre-Socratic era to modern time. The author was successful in relating the development of different thoughts. Plenty of examples are given to clarify the philosophical concepts and the story itself elicits the reader to reflect and ponder about the presented ideas.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This is Prince's best album since Emancipation. He completely ignores the mainstream tosh coming out and hits us with freshly made funk with a touch of psychedelic jazz. He simply is stressing his believes and as far as I know he is actually a Jehova's Witness. But the lyrics and music blend together in a refreshing way. The highlights are 'The Rainbow Children', 'The Work pt 1'- which is a homage to James Brown, '1+1+1 is 3'- a mixture of a modern 'Erotic City' with classic George Clinton funk, 'She Loves Me 4 Me'- a relative of 'Adore' and 'Insatiable' and the last 3 tracks close a mind blowing but thought-provoking album. But it only gets four stars because the low voice is irritating. It's a shame that it is not well recognised outside the underground circuit.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|A love story between a farting ogre and a belching princess, *Shrek* poses as an iconoclastic movie, gleefully destroying the romance and spirituality of classic fairy tales with a mixture of teenage irreverence, bad taste, rock'n roll music, anachronisms and trendy cynical humour. Apparently, noone realizes just how formulaic the whole movie is (cliche-bashing being just as predictable as the cliches it bashes), down to the buddy-movie stereotype of the taciturn hero developing a friendship with an annoyingly talkative sidekick. Even the short-legged king coveting the hero's love interest is borrowed from the French animated masterpiece, *Le Roi et l'Oiseau*- a much more subtle attempt to reinvent the fairy tale (even though Prevert was not that subtle himself.)<br />Now what explains the success of *Shrek*, apart from the massive advertising campaign and the current popularity of outrageously bad taste?<br />I think America has recognized itself in the main character. Shrek lives in a cabin in the wilderness, like the pioneers of old, and is mostly concerned with the defense of his property rights and the ousting of squatters from his land : the typical American mindset. His individualistic, don't-tread-on-me attitude leads him into conflict with a despotic King, symbolizing the Old-World order which Republican America has been so sucessful at overthrowing over the centuries. And in the pursuit of his own self-interest, Shrek uses his awesome physical power (soon seconded by that of a Dragon, probably symbolic of the atomic bomb) to become a kind of benevolent world policeman, vandalizing churches with the same glee as modern Americans' French Huguenot ancestors, echoing America's centuries-old hatred of Catholicism. Finally, Shrek's obesity and rough manners suggest a life of abundance where high culture and the life of the spirit have been sacrificed to the pursuit of more down-to-earth materialistic pleasures.<br />(If you are interested in this analysis of America's historical role, I highly recommend the short, five-volume history of the United States published by Angelus Press under the title *Puritans's Progress*. Interestingly, in volume 3 p102, the authors mention a late 19th century Uruguayan essay entitled *Ariel*, in which the author, Jose Enrique Rodo, « contrasted the spirituality and culture of Latin America, which he likened to Shakespeare's Ariel, with what he considered to be US materialism- Caliban ». Shrek is just that : a cartoon Caliban, and the same symbolism applies.)<br />Another factor in the success of the movie, I think, is that it exploits the neuroses of modern Americans. It tells fat, ugly-looking people that they can actually get the girl. And it reassures girls who know exactly what they would look like without the plastic surgery, the make-up, the collagen, the silicon breasts, the intricate hairdo, the candlelight and the alcohol imbibed by their male prey. What the movie is saying is that we are all flawed individuals, and that we deserve to get the girl, because underneath, she is just as unappetizing as we are, and just as devoid of manners.<br />It is a pity that so much technology and animating talent should be forced to serve such ugliness : if you really want to see what beauty computer animation can achieve, rent *Final Fantasy* instead.rica's historical role, I highly recommend the short, five-volume history of the United States published by Angelus Press under the title *Puritans's Progress*.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I received the soundtrack as a Christmas present. I enjoyed it very much, but before I saw the movie, I would not have given it five stars. I would have given it four. Now, every time I listen to it, I can see Gandalf and Frodo on the cart, the battle with Sauron and Gandalf defeated by the Balrog and it is so amazing. I enjoy more every time I listen to it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|What happened to all you fools that said Spielberg lost his touch!<br />AI was quite simply one of the best movies of 2001. From the amazing special effects to the superb acting (Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Francis O'Connor), this movie has something for everybody. The plot is interesting too.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is so awesome.  I am 14 years old so I wasn't introduced to Metallica's old albums like this one until recently.  After buying the black album, S&M, and the not so great load albums, I decided to try some of Metallica's old stuff.  I went and bought this album and Master of Puppets.  These albums were so different and so much better than their more recent albums.  I now realize what Metallica is all about.  It took a few listens for it to grow on me but now I can't stop listening to it.  In fact I'm listening to it as I'm writing this review.  The original Metallica guitar riffs and Hetfields awesome vocals make this album a classic.  My personal favorite on here is Fade to Black.  This has some incredible guitar solos.  It starts out slow, but viciously builds up into a heavy fury.  <br />For those of you who have only heard post-black album Metallica, buy this and all other pre-black albujms and you will realize how great Metallica really is
B00003CXXP|1.0|The outstanding performances by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law cannot save this appalling movie!  It's glitzy pretensions cannot cover a very feeble, muddled, and dismal plot.........Spielberg  at his worst.  Don't bother with this one!
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D is the best band in the world. Not only is the music funny, but the songs are awesome and super catchy. You should also check out some of their HBO shows. The only thing that I didn't like was that the D did not put jesus ranch on the album. Every single song is just so good. No one should go without tenacious d. What are you waiting for, buy the album!

B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I.: Artificial Intelligence has a unique history. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick originally conceived the project, perhaps as a companion piece to his 1969 masterwork, 2001: A Space Odyssey. He struggled with the movies concept for years before deciding to collaborate on it with Steven Spielberg, who wound up on his own after Kubricks death in 2000. The result is a hybrid, a homage to Kubrick, one of the coolest, most intellectual filmmakers of all times, by one of the biggest icons of American pop culture. The results were not pleasing to most audiences. It had a smash opening weekend last summer, and then was promptly abandoned for easier to understand eye candy fare. <br />The movie takes place in three acts. In the first one we find ourselves somewhere in the future. Global warming has caused sea levels to rise. Many coastal cities, including New York, are under water. Rich nations like America have compensated and thrived. Enormous strides have been made in artificial intelligence. Technology has developed robots that look and act like human beings. One day Dr. Hobby [William Heard], head of a corporation that makes these machines, sets out to develop the ultimate product, a boy that can actually love. Once a prototype is developed, a couple whose only child has been hospitalized for years with a rare disease is chosen to test the robot child named David [Joel Haley Osment]. After awhile the mother, Monica [Francis OConnor] decides to keep David and says to him the seven words that unlock his love program. And love her he does; in fact, he is irrevocably bonded to her. All is wonderful until the real son miraculously recovers and returns home. <br />The second act covers a period when, for good reason, David is separated from the family and is alone in the world. During this time, he meets other robots and learns from them some terrible truths about the world. No matter how real they look and act, robots are not human andare thus disposable. Many people have a fear and loathing for them, feelings, I suspect, that are perfectly natural. The third act takes place 2,000 years further into the future. I will not give away the ending. <br />Osment gives an incredible performance as David, even more amazing because he has to carry the entire movie. I dont know how he did it, but he made David truly seem an almost, but not quite, real boy by giving him a very subtle mechanical quality. Forget the fact that Osment is just a kid. Hes one of the great actors of our times. Also wonderful are Jude Law as Gigolo Joe, robot love machine and Davids savior in act two, and OConnor as Monica. <br />A.I. is a flawed masterpiece. As such, many people will be too irritated by the flaws to appreciate its virtues. The story is linear, but each act has its own tone, pace, look and story. They are united primarily by Davids belief that somehow he can become a real boy and make Monica love him forever and ever. The structure forces the audience to shift gears twice, something many people dont like doing when watching a movie. Ironically, this says a great deal about how we ourselves have been programmed.<br />On the surface, this is a typical Hollywood big budget movie. It is filled with lavish sets and special effects. None of this does much to hide the fact that this is a thinking mans movie. Spielberg can not resist his natural tendency to warm the story up, something the coldly calculating Kubrick would never have done. I believe his style helps the movie a great deal because, otherwise, it would be all too dark. The complexity of the subject matter remains as great no matter what approach is taken. It brings up what is real and what isnt, how we project our emotions on an object and what might happen if an object were capable of projecting them back at us. Ultimately, for all his nearly perfect imitation of a human being and for all his abilities to feel and express emotions, David is a machine. Knowing this makes us uncomfortable. We dont know how we are supposed to feel about him. <br />Many critics also dismissed A.I. for various reasons. One complaint was the use of a childrens story, Pinocchio, as the one that inspires and motivates David. To me, its use is most appropriate. It reminds us that the idea to play God and to create life is nothing new. It indirectly references the Disney animated movie, and what could be a better example of how we project our emotions on something that is entirely an artificial creation?  <br />Fifteen years ago, both critics and the public, had a similar reaction to Spielbergs Empire of the Sun, which is now considered a classic in many circles. I have a feeling A.I.s time will also come. Movies that challenge us have become increasingly rare in the last decade. If you are as appalled by this trend as I am, then I highly recommend A.I. to you. You will be challenged, I promise.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I'm actually quite surprised by the number of negative customer reviews for &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.  Musically it's quite a departure from their trademark ska sound but it's still the same energetic No Doubt we all love.  Despite what some may say most of the album isn't even tailor-made for top-40 radio.  It doesn't hurt to experiment but essentially it's still the same hard-rock/pop sounding, laid back No Doubt.<br />I have to admit thought that I was put off from buying their latest album at first because of &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.  Simply put it's the stupidest, most pointless song they ever made.  Gwen and Bounty Killer are about as good of a combination as oil and water.  Luckily that's the only skippable track.  <br />The good old ska songs we all love are still there, like &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, &quot;Dont Let Me Down&quot;, and &quot;Start the Fire&quot;.  Although what really attracted me to the album is that it's largely produced by Nellee Hooper, Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent, and William Orbit (all of Bjork, Massive Attack, and Madonna fame).  So if you're a fan of these producers, chances are you'll like &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.  Hooper dominates most of the album's production.<br />Though Gwen's lyrics have never been that deep they are fun to listen to.  The songs are set in a much happier tone than in their last album &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;.  Songs like &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; and &quot;Rock Steady&quot; are examples of Gwen's happiness and inner peace in finding love.  As opposed to the dark, depressing, love-angst lyrics in &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;.  <br />Another highlight is No Doubt's collaboration with Prince on the love song &quot;Waiting Room&quot;.  It has that drop of Prince-ness on it with that electric guitar in the beginning, but it feels like an equal duet with a very catchy little melody.<br />I really didn't think they could top &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; but I was wrong, this is their best yet.
B0000507PC|5.0|So much, that I watched it five times.  At least the last time I caught it, I got to see the entire thing.<br />On the first level, you have Michael Caine's character that doesn't want any new doctors on staff at the orphanage.  Everyone on staff, including Tobey McGuire's character and the children know that Caine's character doesn't want anyone else finding out about his addiction to ether and his willingness to perform illegal abortions.  While new blood would bring some sort of financial backing for the orphanage, the head doctor had the above mentioned liberal flaws.<br />Tobey McGuire's character realized that he had to learn how to do something else instead of assist the head doctor, just in case his stay at the orphanage was &quot;abruptly ended&quot;.  He had been adopted three times and returned three times.  Out in the real world, he discovered what his true calling was when he discovered that Rose was pregnant.  Sorry, you are going to have to watch the movie to find out who the father is.<br />The one thing I didn't like was that in spite of these rules that governed his job as apple-picker, his place at the orphanage, and the rules of common decency, everyone seemed to know when to break the rules, even the people over McGuire.  Rose's condition could have been avoided, if someone from the camp reported her condition, but that would mean scandal for the rest of the pickers and loss of income.  She was still young enough for foster care. MGuire knew the girl he slept with belonged to someone else. It did hurt him but he knew better that to fool around with a person who would go back to the man that got her pregnant the first time they showed up at the orphanage.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I first saw Citizen Kane in the mid-'80s in an Intro to Film class at Community College.  I took the class because I thought it would be an easy A.  As it happens, I got a B+.  Anyway, I was prepared for a 2 hour yawn festival.  A cure for insomnia. As it happened, I was hooked by the 'newsreel' footage.  The whole Rosebud thing and Kane himself were a facinating mystery.<BR>I thought the characters were better drawn out in 'Kane' than in many of the films I usually enjoyed.  The friendship that Kane &amp; Leland had was particularly well developed.   It just felt like Orson Welles had really put his heart into the film.  One didn't get the impression that he was in it just for the money.  The fact that the film is Black &amp; White just adds to the beauty and mystery of this film.<BR>I'm not the type of person who likes a film just because<BR> it's soooo intellectual.  I do find 'Citizen Kane' to be a very smart film, though, and a film that one needs to pay attention to during their viewing.  Unfortunately, most people see film or TV as a merely passive activity, which you shouldn't have to actively participate in with the ol' noggin.  One really does need to pay attention to the details to really 'get' this film.  <BR>'Citizen Kane' is a great film, one of the greats of all time.  The greatest of all time?  Beats me.  I have seen too many films and find it impossible to narrow it down to one great film of all time.  'Kane' is even, perhaps, a tad bit over-rated, but I can find very few films made before or since that are as well crafted as 'Citizen Kane'.  Kane proves that one can make a film with a big visual impact without CGI, blue screens, chase scenes, or big explosions.  Perhaps some reviewers were bored with the film because it lacks explosions and enormous dinosaurs!?<BR>The DVD package is superb.  The picture quality is very close to perfect. The best quality I've ever seen on a film this old.  It looks better than some of modern films that I've viewed on DVD.<BR>The sound is great, too.  It's mono sound, but come on, this film was released in 1941, many decades away from Dolby Digital Stereo sound. The commentaries by Roger Ebert &amp; Peter Bogdanovich are great, with Ebert's being the most informative, in my opinion.  The documentary on disc 2, which is just a few minutes shorter than the actual film gives a lot of insight into the battles had over the film with William Randolph Hearst, who supposedly inspired the film.<BR>A very fine package, in my opinion. A film that I definitely plan to view at least a couple times each year.
B00005JKYS|2.0|the first half hour of this movie is a series of rushed overdramatic moments, each of which sets up a potential plotline which does not deepen significantly throughout the movie. these scenes, ranging from a take on racism of the day, to a soldier who helped orphans in africa before being commissioned (???), to one of the pregnant wives water breaking, all felt like they were crammed into the movie.  the writers should have stuck with one of these plotlines, and followed it through the movie in depth instead they attempted to cram many very different plotlines into one movie, and did not acheive any level of depth at any of them. the movie also attempted to reach out to viewers who were women and minorities so as not to alienate any potential customers, but ironically relied on stereotypes for both, characterising many of the women as bubbleheaded, and relying on stereotypes of the archetypal \\"fiercly independent black woman\\" for one such wife. many of the scenes in the movie were simply unrealistic, such as the japanese american soldier introducing himself to a reporter with a beaming smile, and informing him that his son is due to be born, in the middle of a raging firefight. i suppose these were attempts at irony, but they failed miserably in my opinion, becoming simply unrealistic. overall, i felt that this movie was very contrived, made in the wake of saving private ryan in a \\"it looks like war movies are selling, so lets make one\\" frenzy. it attempted to encorporate elements found in both \\"black hawk down\\" (yes, I know they started making we were soldiers before black hawk down's release) and \\"the thin red line.\\" it failed at both, creating a movie which lacked depth of any form. This film absolutely pales in comparison to Black Hawk Down, which might be the most powerful war film ever made. \\"we were soldiers\\" will be forgotten a year from now, while \\"Black Hawk Down\\" will be remembered for decades to come.
B00000I2UC|4.0|Jesus and Mary Chain have been producing good quality music for so long it's hard to believe they haven't had at least their 15 minutes of fame in the mainstream; hell, even Sonic Youth was well-known for a couple years (course, Thurston Moore admits &quot;the only reason we got close to mainstream is cos we knew Kurt Cobain,&quot; but oh well). Anyhow, forget what most people buy. Don't use the question &quot;is it popular?&quot; to determine worth or otherwise you may never find the music that really matters! This is one example. On here you will find lots of good material, like &quot;Blues from a Gun&quot;, &quot;UV Ray,&quot; and the tune that the Pixies covered &quot;Head On.&quot; Give J &amp; MC a chance and after that don't look back!
B00005UQ9F|2.0|i was sorely disappointed after watching this movie. after reading all of your reviews,i thought it was gonna be one of the greatest suspense/horror movies i have ever seen. but that was far from the case. it wasnt even the slightest bit scary, although the building itself is pretty spooky.i guess i was expecting more of a ghost aspect, but that wasnt really what the movie was about, and that kind of ruined it for me. its definitely a psychological movie, but they made the whole ending too confusing.if your more of a fan of psychological movies and not true suspense or horror, then check this one out, otherwise, steer clear.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Don't expect high end acting or much of a storyline from this movie.<br />Paul Walker is stiff as a board &amp; not believable as a car fanatic.  I couldn't picture him even changing oil much less racing! On the other hand, Vin Diesel does well with the script he was given &amp; looks like he fits right in.  Personally, seeing Vin Diesel with his shirt off made the movie for me, but the car scenes were a big plus!<br />Is it always correct?  No way!  Duh, it's a movie people!  It is for enjoyment only.  It is not a technical documentary about cars or racing.  You have to take it for what it is...a movie about a bunch of people that love their cars &amp; love to drive 'Fast &amp; Furious'.<br />There is this whole undercover cop/highjacking thing in the background, but it is so underdeveloped it's not worth worrying about.<br />Let me put it to you this way, if you get a rush when you see Eleanore in 'Gone in 60 Seconds' (for the pure enjoyment of it being a great car) then you would be able to enjoy this movie.
014043786X|4.0|The is the first book i read by Doyle and it is truely amazing. The book has the elements of suprise, intellect, and a great plot. Everything fit into place and worked out so nicely. Holmes is a great character with intelligence and wits.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Being a mystery fan, I enjoyed this storyline as it kept me guessing who was a friend & who was the foe until the very end.<br />It is a very fast paced movie that runs from end to beginning...makes you think you would have all the answers right?  Not so!<br />The only problem with this movie is that so much depends on the ending (or rather the beginning) that once you know the whole story, that is it.  All done.  Over.  Fin.<br />As much as I liked it, I don't think watching it again would have the same effect. I highly recommend it as a great rental, but I have to say I don't think it is something I would purchase.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd ever hear a new Leonard Cohen song since he's been 9 years absent from the record stores.Well,here's a new album!Is it good?Heck yeah!Leonard sounds like he never left,dripping with the poetic regret we love!That voice!A massive baritone conveying tales of loneliness,broken romance,addiction,and silent prayers for grace.Lyrically,this is one heavy album.The music is the keyboard programming and guitar we know from the last couple releases.Very much an album for adults.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It is rare that I will admit that a movie version of a book was actually good.  Most cases it's the exact opposite.  This movie was quite a surprise.  The movie didn't skip a thing. Alright, so it skipped a few things, but nothing too important.  I just loved the book and was very weary of the movie release only because I didn't want to see my beloved characters destroyed.  I was pleasantly surprised when they were just as I had pictured them all (except McGonnegal).  I would still suggest reading the book first.  Then, definately see the movie!!
B00005Y228|5.0|I started loving Kylie's songs ever since her Light Years Album which has a RETRO theme (You can check that album also, it's worth it!^_^). So after that, I knew the next one would be as good. And I'm correct! Now shifting to techno, Kylie blows me away again with this album. I absolutely love it. While all songs are different in style, it still remains true to its theme. It's an all new expereiece and is really worth a try for everyone, even people who are new to her. I absolutely recommend it! Keep it up Kylie!
0767818040|5.0|ok all these critics out there like to complain about the Hitchock comparisons in DePalma's film and yes, DePalma does use elements of his style to spice up his movies or take similiar plots and give it a DePalma twist. as far as this film is concerned, to look at it simply, is it worth your money and will you like it? the answer is yes, an excellent little gem about a man who witnesses a murder and now must get to the bottom of it. great suspense and great artistic direction, highly recommened.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is a cinematic masterpiece. Vibrant and spectacular, Baz Luhrman has created a fanciful world with the talents of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. The story is based on the Greek Orphean myth. But if you're looking to buy the DVD you probably already know what the story is all about. A general review of the DVD is what I'm trying to write about here.<br />The video is so clear and crisp that it finally does justice to Luhrman's imagination. Sound quality is just a little lacking, but overall, you get every note and lyric presented in this movie. You won't be amazed, but you certainly won't be disappointed. I only say it's lacking because as this is a musical, based on music and soung, I expected them to play extremely close attention to sound presentation. And I also hoped that some of the vocal drowning would be fixed, but it wasn't really. I guess it's my fault for being disappointed since I had high expectations.<br />The director's commentary didn't really talk about the movie as it was playing as much as I wish it would have. They mostly went off on tangents about their writing process which you also heard them talk about again on the 2nd disc. I was hoping for insight into certain scenes and shots.<br />The extra features are amazing. Being able to cut the tango sequence with the multi-angle view while it was streaming on the screen was amazing and seeing the extended version of the dances was great. Watching the backstage interaction between Kidman and McGregor was amazing and also made you realize how much effort they had really put into this and how normal these two people really are. The dance rehearsals really let you see how the dances developed, however I found there were some dances that Kidman had practiced in rehearsals but never made it to the screen and also weren't included in the extras. Kind of disappointed that they showed us glimpses and didn't let us have the rest. There is no doubt that Kidman certainly has a natural grace.<br />I wish they would've put more interview time with the stars into the 2nd disc, and they included some stuff twice, but it was still great to get this glimpse of their thoughts. I loved that they included recording studio clips while the actors were having fun playing around and rehearsing.<br />I was grateful they did edit out the version of \\"Come What May\\" they originally had, and very glad they changed the \\"Dance across the sky/Your Song\\" sequence because they detracted greatly to the feeling that the final sequences had. But it's still fun to see what they were originally planning and then going \\"Thank God they didn't use that.\\"<br />Having the Coup d'Etat dance sequence just reminded me that there was no Coup d'Etat on either of the two soundtracks, but that's for another review. This was in fact one of my favorite pieces of the movie because of the depth of emotion starting on Satine's first warbling breathy \\"Never knew...\\" till the very end when the curtains finally fall. However, it was still great to see this extended version.<br />The Music videos were pretty good, but I expected them to include Elephant Love Medley and an extended Come What May video... Instead they stuck a video of the Come What May Josh Abrams Remix which essentially ruins the track considering it's supposed to be slow and watching the speed up the tape too is just a little wierd because they are the same shots but at a different speed. Watching the \\"Musical Journey\\" interview makes you entirely grateful that they finally choose the splattering of 10 or so songs for the Medley than the 2 they had originally.<br />I have to say, I loved the photo gallery in the Marketing section of the 2nd disc. There are some candid shots, but most are from the actual shots and the quality and clarity of these pictures are amazing. The \\"Little Red Book\\" is also a very good guide and I highly recommend \\"flipping\\" through that.<br />All in all this is an extremely loaded DVD even if it is a little disappointing at some points such as commentary as to why things were cut and as to a few more extras. Anyways, I would recommend this like no other DVD. There haven't been a lot of directors who've utilized the DVD, and I love that Luhrman knows his market enough to admit that the DVD is an amazing tool that he very well plans to take advantage of. And to his credit, he does take advantage of it. The setup for the menus are awesome. Watch the movie, love it, then buy the DVD for all the goodies as well as quality. No doubt this is a great buy.<br />One final comment I have on this movie, is that no matter how many times I've seen it (no doubt somewhere in the thousands by now), it is a true testament to Baz Luhrman's directing that I always expect the movie to end differently. I know how the end will happen, but every single time I get towards the end of the movie I forget this is a tragedy and find myself caught up in the happiness. And that in itself is a sign of an excellently directed film.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A beautiful mind is a heartfelt rendering of what would otherwise have just been another biography.  It allows the viewer to appreciate the complexities of schitzophrenia, but achieves this without cramming a medical textbook down the viewer's throat.This may all be largely due to Ron Howard's directing, and the great performances by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connely, Ed Harris, and the whole gamut of supporting actors and actresses.  However, praise should be given the entire cast and crew for making us appreciate that poeple struggling with schitzophrenia, or any disease for that matter, are not that entriely different from everybody else.  They are ordinary people, just like us, struggling everyday to make the best out of what they have.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I purchased three separarte copies of this film and on each copy there is a freeze frame of a mans face in the flesh fair sequence that stops the film. Are other consumers finding this problem with their copies of this film? Is there a defect in the D.V.D. transfer or is there something wrong with my player? I purchased the wide screen format.
0679720200|5.0|I would like to refer to Matko Vladanovic's review. Like he said, this book left nothing in memory after the read. Nothing to discuss, not much vividness about anything. That's what Albert Camus was trying to put to us wasn't it? Why and what do we exist for? We go through life, just living, not knowing why or what we are here for. Like the book, most of our life just passes us by, not much thinking about it is there? <br />From home to work or school, back home, then to work or school, perhaps a few hobbies in between. Some of us understand the need to WAKE UP! But most of us don't. We live life just like the book, not much to think about after it has ended. Read the book just to reflect on this point, about why it feels so drab, like it NEVER EXISTED. I took the book from shelf, read book, put back onto shelf, forgot about book. Is it still there? Do I care? Ha, sort of like life really.
B00005B36H|5.0|I came into the world of Tool wanting something new.  getting fed up with the reconstituted format of songs that only have 4 chords and lyrics that show the true intent of the album (making money and fame for the artist), I knew there had to be something better out there.  and this is it.  Some things in this recording require some knowledge of music to fully understand the beauty of the art this group has created, but for the most part anyone can put this into their CD player and immediatly know that they are listening to true music.  instead of using the standard of the day, songs in a 4/4 time signature, they experiment and have used all sorts of signatures.  even the most popular song (schism), one that i expect might be dumbed down to adhere to people who cannot appreciate music as much as others, wasn't even in 4.  instead there is everthing ranging from 6/4 to 5/4 and even some 11/8.  there is more...but all in all, if you were a person like me who was looking for something new in today's sea of clones, this is the group for you.

Irrespnsible Hate Anthem is one of my faves.  This cd is perfect to get pumped up for a big game or anything.  and when you think your ear drums are about to explode Manson comes at you with a slower more haunting song.  Man you fear is probably one of my all time favorite songs.  Get this cd. you won't be sorry.

B000059XXZ|5.0|What can I say? This film was a box-office champ and now you should buy. It's the best tied with #3.<br />Nicklson was a good bad guy, ya know what I mean?

The most lovable characters are Alfred and Wuhl as Knotts. WUHL ROX!
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Moulin Rough was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I surprised my self by actually sitting through the whole 2 hours hoping it would get better. Boy was I sadly mistaken around the time when whoever was singing \\"Like a Virgin\\" I said to myself \\"could it get any worse.\\" Oh but it could it definetly could because then Kidman and McGregor tried to show a little bit of \\"ACTING\\" and display something resembling emotion and failed miserable. Maybe I would have felt bad for Satine and Christian when Satine died if I wasn't wishing for her to die the whole movie (not that it mattered cause they ruined that much in the first five minutes.) The movie was like a bad acid trip you try to get high off all the imagery but in the end you just get a killer headache and want to vomit. And don't even try to follow the story it's so predictable and so over done you wish the guy would shot you (oh and the gun hitting the Eiffel tower was amazingly stupid and inane.)<br />I give it 1 star for at least trying to be original but unfortunaly failing miserably.
B000006FYP|5.0|The Opening scene starts with a little intro to Two-Face. He tosses a coin. Heads, the victim lives. Tails, he dies. Luckily, Batty makes an entrance with the punching of some thugs. Kilmer made an awesome opening, and was fit to play Batsy-Boy. Two-Face made a bad opening. Eventually, the Riddler and 2y join forces. Riddler \\"Has Deviced A Way 2 Read Men's Minds.\\" I won't tell you how he wins and saves his new comrade, Robin, and his girl-friend, Chase.<br />Kilmer was an awesome Batty, Jones reminded me of '66 Penguin. Carrey could get annoying, O'Donell ruled at his work. Kidman was the average Kidman character. Sexy, romantic, ya know? <br />Overall, this is a must see. Buy it today!
B000003Z4C|4.0|\\"Let Love In\\" is something of a conundrum for me. It is not my favorite Nick Cave disc (that honor would probably go to \\"Tender Prey\\", \\"Murder Ballads\\" or, perhaps, \\"The Boatman's Call\\") yet it contains some of my favorite Nick Cave songs: \\"Red Right Hand\\" - the sinister tale of a dark messianic figure, \\"I Let Love In\\" - Nick's ode to the potential tragedies of surrendering oneself to love, \\"Lay Me Low\\" - Nick's vainglorious eulogy/epitaph for himself, and \\"Do You Love Me (Part 2)\\" - a creepy and horrifying tragedy about child abuse and murder which gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.<br />Also found in these tracks is my absolute least favorite Nick Cave song, \\"Jangling Jack\\", an abrasive rant about violence in the USA which usually has me reaching for the \\"next\\" button.<br />In fact, it is my dislike of \\"Jangling Jack\\" that influenced my four star rating. If not for this track, \\"Let Love In\\" would be a solid five in my book based only on the favorites mentioned above.<br />For those who are new to Nick and the Seeds this disc might be the perfect introduction as it is an excellent selection of the various moods and modes - from somber to rocker - the band and its gothic anti-Elvis frontman are capable of.

B00003CXXP|3.0|This movie is baffling, because it does some things about as well as an be done in a film, while just [stinking] horribly at other times.<br />Let's do the good first. Haley Joel Osment is just extraordinary. Is he the best child actor of all time? He certainly is a leading candidate. Margaret O'Brien was certainly as good in the 1940s, and perhaps better. But I can think of no other boys who were as good as he has been. His performance is utterly convincing, and deeply nuanced. The script demands that he evolve and grow during the course of the film, and he does so marvelously. There is no question that he carries this movie on his back.<br />Jude Law is fine in his role, though he has been much better in other films. I absolutely adore Frances O'Connor (MANSFIELD PARK, BEDAZZLED, and in this springs THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, as Gwendolyn Fairfax opposite Colin Firth's Jack Worthing), and she does a good job in playing an emotionally conflicted character. Visually, the film is way too dark. I could have stood a little more light, but overall the film is convincing visually. I especially liked the scenes shot in a submerged NYC, though it is poignant now seeing the imagined ruins of the World Trade Center, which met a far more apocalyptic ruin than was imagined in the movie.<br />Unfortunately, the minuses equal or perhaps even outweigh the bad. One of Spielberg's greatest vices as a director is his emotional manipulativeness. All directors, of course, try to engage the emotions of the viewers, but Spielberg pulls out every trick in the book. His efforts are sometimes just a bit too heavy-handed and way too transparent.<br />A more serious problem is that the script is just awful. While there are many nice moments, the overall story is poorly constructed, and one doesn't get a sense that the story as a whole is one that is especially worth telling. The central premise is a good one, but I think the film would have been stronger if they had jettisoned the Pinocchio themes and struck out on its own. The first half of the film, as \\"David\\" is trying to fit into his new home is extremely interesting. The second half is more or less irritating. And I think most viewers will feel that the ending is not very satisfying. David finds love and happiness, but the script and Spielberg have to resort to the most incredible artifice to achieve this.<br />So, despite some very good elements, overall this is not a terribly strong film.inocchio themes and struck out on its own.

B00005QDW1|4.0|I'm sure most No Doubt fans are a little disappointed because of their sudden crossover to the Pop/Reggae/Electronica genre. But by doing this, they are actually introducing something new to mainstream America, and you have to commend them for that. I have enjoyed this album thoroughly since I received it for Christmas, but I do long for their old sound though. It's hard to narrow down my favorite songs since there are so many, but I love &quot;Hella Good,&quot; (destined to be a big hit for them) &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; and &quot;Underneath It All (feels like you took a trip to Jamaica). From beginning to end, this is a sold, &quot;rock steady&quot; album, and should be enjoyed by the masses.
B0000039PW|5.0|No duplicant(Jay-Z) can never beat the genuine article.  Ready To Die set the tone for what was to come years later in the world of rap.  Hood tales told so vivid you felt you were actually there to see it happen.  None could do it with such lyrical grace like Biggie, but many still try to this very day(Jay-Z).  Biggie represented the rappers of the new hiphop generation, but possessed the originality and aura of an old-school rapper.  Ready To Die was more just a rap album, it was a classical testimony of a man who went from a hustler to a rapper to a rap phenomenon.  Yet Read To Die held a darkness that couldn't be overlooked.  Even though Biggie went from rags to riches, this never over shadowed his dark outlook on life, and that's what made this album so real.  Along with his dark themes, producers DJ Premier, Lord Finese, and Easy Mo Bee brought the ill flava to make Biggie's tales even more raw.  So while Jigga tries to steal the crown, the true king's name has been edged in stone forever.  Long Live the KING!!!!

B00005JKES|5.0|We all know about Twin Peaks, so this review is not an analysis of the theory of Lynch.  This review is just about the quality of the set.  Okay, the pilot is not included.  It's pretty easy to acquire if you are interested.  I'm new to Twin Peaks, so I realized that I had to get the pilot elsewhere when I rented the first disk of Twin Peaks: The First Season (Special Edition) on DVD.  I was pretty unhappy.  Nevertheless, I got the pilot, and while I was at it, I bought the first season on DVD.  Why not?  If I was going to own the pilot, why not own the entire first season?  A good analysis of the available purchase options for this wonderful series is available on Amazon.com.  Check it out.  After I watched the pilot and learned what to expect, I began watching Episode 1.  These DVDs are absolutely beautiful.  The picture quality and the remastered soundtrack are to die for.  I really hope that Artisan releases the rest of the series.  I'd hate to be forced to supplement this beautiful collection with VHS.  Final analysis:  If you like Twin Peaks, this set is really worth buying.  It's really beautiful.  Plus, you have the option of skipping to your favorite scenes and the option of the Log Lady introductions from Twin Peaks' rerun on Bravo.

0790743523|5.0|When first released in 1948, \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" was not well received. It was a box-office bomb, largely for Humphrey Bogart's transition from his traditional good guy roles started by \\"Casablanca\\". People were not just willing to accept Bogart as the amoral Fred Dobbs. Though the film was awarded three academy awards, Best Picture wasn't among them. Time, however, has proven to be kinder to this film (Plot spoilers ahead).  <br />One of the three Oscar wins went to Walter Huston as Howard, an old prospector who goes along with Dobbs and Curtin (Tim Holt) prospecting for gold. Huston gets some of the film's best scenes, including his line \\"You two are dumb, dumber than the dumbest jackass!\\" I also love the scene where he trails ahead of Dobbs and Curtin as they are climbing up a mountain (\\"He must be part goat\\", Bogart remarks) because its so different from Dobbs original remark that they would have to pack him on their backs. But the film's best line is given by Alfonso Bedoya as the bandit Gold Hat. If you don't know already, I'll give you a hint: It involves badges.    <br />The trio starts off fine with not problems. But as the money increases, Dobbs becomes increasingly paranoid, talking to himself and muttering phrases like \\"Fred C. Dobbs says nothing he don't mean\\".  When Howard takes a short leave, that's when things break between Dobbs and Curtin. His appearance during these scenes reminded me of a Mr. Hyde like personality. He even looks and acts like a monster, what with his ability to stay awake for days and his \\"Wolf Man\\" like appearance.    <br />The ending is very ironic. Due to their own stupidity, the gold has been lost. Yet Howard and Curtin don't seem to care too much in the long run. They have found and thought of other things more rewarding than gold. And while they may have lost much, it was less than what Dobbs lost. <br />With the Oscar winning cast, script and direction, this movie is a winner and belongs in the collection of anyfilm buff. <br />Cameo (Director John Huston): White suited man who gives Dobbs money three times during the beginning.
B00005OAIE|3.0|In a different world of music--that is, in one run by more than just a few multinational conglomerates who no longer show much interest in artist development--John Mayer would be allowed the time to evolve beyond this record and become the excellent artist he undoubtedly can be.  I can only hope he bucks the odds and makes it, for there is plenty of promise here.  He is, as some other reviewers here have noted, a fine guitarist (although there is no real flash or fire on display here, just solid accompaniment), and some of his songs are genuinely catchy.  His lyrics will be annoying to many, but in my case I can testify that much of his babbling is ripped straight from my own head in similar situations (from \\"My Stupid Mouth,\\" for example); while they may be juvenile in many cases, he's not acting as a proponent, just as a narrator.<br />The most obvious influence is Dave Matthews--a breathier and much, much lighter version (and those who, like me, are unconvinced that Dave Matthews really knows how to rock out will therefore be warned just how \\"lite\\" this CD gets), but one with a surer sense of melody that will serve him well on future releases, once he has shucked off the urge to imitate so shamelessly.  For my part, I enjoy the first four tracks--\\"Why Georgia\\" in particular, but then, I'm a sucker for a melody as pretty as this one--but after that the rest of the disc just fills space without particularly meriting any interest.  I wish John Mayer well, and I hope he finds his own voice soon.
B00004RF98|5.0|\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is often considered the greatest film musical ever made (Though some would probably disagree, preferring \\"The Sound of Music\\" or \\"West Side Story\\" instead). With so much happiness, it is impossible not to like this movie. Unless you have a problem with feeling good, you should see this movie. <br />The cast is dynamic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds all show real enthusiasm as though they want to star in the movie, not \\"I was forced to by my contract\\" or \\"I did it for the money\\". Despite the fact it runs at less than two hours, this movie packs more excitement and great music than most dull, three-hour musicals combined. With enormous laughs (The biggest provided by O'Conner and Jean Hagen), great dialogue (\\"Why, I make more money than - than - than Calvin Coolidge, put together!\\") and fourteen wonderful songs including \\"Fit as a Fiddle\\", \\"Beautiful Girl\\", \\"You Were Meant for Me\\" \\"Make Em' Laugh\\" and \\"Good Morning\\". But the one everyone remembers the most is the title song, sung as Gene Kelly dances, twirls and, of course, sings in a storm (Stanley Kubrick later used the song in a less flattering way, but that's another story). I have also seen few movies take such beautiful and generous use of Technicolor. <br />As many fans should know, this gem turns fifty this year. Perhaps Warners (Or whoever owns the rights) should celebrate this golden anniversary by putting out a special edition DVD. Better yet, I would love to see this projected on the big screen. If you're listening out there, don't hesitate. Many others are waiting like I am.
0800177177|4.0|Before 1992, Bram Stoker's chilling and masterfully written horror novel, \\"Dracula\\", had not been given the screen treatment it deserved. The Bela Lugosi version, while a fine film in its own right, was a far cry from what Stoker had in mind. The superb 1922 German made silent film, \\"Nosferatu\\", captured the mood of the book, but fell slightly short of being the definitive screen adaptation. Francis Ford Coppola succeeded with \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\".<br />Stylishly directed, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" packs quite a punch with delicious, eye-popping art direction that perfectly evokes the eerie atmosphere of Stoker's vision, Dracula's castle being the prime example. The cinematography, with its clever use of scenes dissolving into poetic montages, is just as impressive. The cast effectively brings the story's colorful characters to vibrant and vivid life: Gary Oldman is alternately frightening, seductive, and pitiable as the bloodthirsty Count; Winona Ryder is delicately charming as the ingenue, Mina Murray, the reincarnation of Dracula's tragically deceased love; Anthony Hopkins is witty and amusing as the eccentric vampire hunter, Professor Van Helsing; Richard E. Grant, Cary Elwes and Bill Campbell also contribute crackerjack performances as a triumvirate of dashing vampire busters. Only Keanu Reeves is disappointing (although, it is excusable in a film this good) with his awkward portrayal of the protagonist, Jonathan Harker. He never does get that British accent right! The connection to the factual Romanian King, Vlad Dracula, while not in Stoker's book, made the film more interesting.<br />The only real drawback to \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is its explicit sensuality. With a more subtle use, it would have been an even better film.<br />\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is an atmospherically gothic visual feast that is not so much a horror story, but an allegory of man's darkest fears and desires, as well as a story of undying love. But, if you are not as intrepid as I am, Isuggest you watch it in a brightly lit room with someone sitting close beside you!
B00005JKYS|4.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the best movie I have seen so far from this year. Unlike a lot of recent war films, which try to digitize the battle, this film is mostly live action, if not all.  <br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is different from a lot of Vietnam War movies in how it shows the soldiers on both sides. The Americans aren't pot-smoking hippies who don't want to be there. They are respectable, sane men who know that they have a duty and do it. As for the Vietnamese, it starts off bad in the beginning scene when their commander orders prisoners taken in battle executed. But the movie soon changes its tone, showing the human side of the enemy so that we sympathize with them. We even grieve when one of them dies. Some can say that these and other film depiction's differ because of the time; this movie takes place early in the war, before we really got dug in. <br />One of my biggest complaints with \\"Pearl Harbor\\" was its overdoing of the romance plot, which drew attention away from the attack itself. \\"WWS\\" does have a romance subplot, involving the wives of the soldiers. But the producers don't overdo this. There are no love triangles, extra-martial affairs, one night stands or anything like that. The producers know that the war is the main plot and focus on that. <br />I should mention a word on the acting. While no one in here could match Laurence Olivier while playing Shakespeare, they were all very good in their parts. I particularly liked Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Plumley who gets some of the best lines. Particularly memorable are the two encounters he has with an officer that says \\"Good Morning\\" to him and Gibson's idea to the battalion about family. He tells them about how the warriors in Crazy Horse's tribe referred to all older women as mother and all older men as grandfather. Plumley doesn't particularly like that idea, as he bluntly points out to the troops. <br />However, I have to show a balanced argument. The only compliant I had with this movie was the lack of time spent on the training of the soldiers as compared with say \\"Full Metal Jacket\\". But this barely tarnishes an otherwise a great movie. But don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself.
0345349571|4.0|Very early in the book the author tells us that the 14th century in France was \\"a violent, tormented, bewildered, suffering and disintegrating age, a time, as many thought, of Satan triumphant.\\" This she goes on to illustrate with a detailed description of the ravages \\"the Pest\\" or the Black Death inflicted on mankind between 1348-50, when roughly one third of those in the Eurasian continent died. <br />Tuchman uses the device of following the story of one French noble - Enguerrand de Coucy VII - to explore much more than the Plague's impact on life. Chivalry, village life, the English and French rivalry for Aquitaine, the Papal schism and the various military campaigns that were a constant feature of the times, are all depicted in great detail. The degree of detail is both a strength and weakness of the book. As a strength Tuchman's prodigious research allows her to make deeply insightful comments on the finer details or subtleties of 14th century life. Any illusions we may have had about noble Knights and chivalrous warfare are shattered when we learn that an archer was first described as \\"a coward who dared not come close to his foe\\" and a Knight was a mere \\"worm in his iron cocoon.\\" Her descriptions of village life are unforgetable and help to illustrate her point about the 14th century being extremely violent; in that sense making it A DISTANT MIRROR of our own century. Nevertheless we could have forgiven her if she had left out some details. For instance the village game \\"where players with hands tied behind them competed to kill a cat nailed to a post by battering it to death with their heads, at the risk of cheeks ripped open or eyes scratched out by the frantic animal's claws.\\" If we accept the purpose of such a description - disgusting as it is - as serving to make a point, what is the value of the following minutely detailed inventory? \\"Their homes contained, in the case of one comfortable peasant of Normandy, two featherbeds, one wooden bed, three tables, four skillets, two pots and other cooking utensils, eight sheets, two tablecloths, one towel or napkin, a lantern, two vats for trampling grapes, two barrels and two casks, a cart, a plow, two harrows, two hoes, two scythes, one spade, one sickle, three horse collars, and a pack saddle.\\" Don't forget the two aspirins you'll need after reading one too many pages of similar eye-crossing detail. <br />As a well researched and richly detailed history, it's hard to top A DISTANT MIRROR. It is not an easy reading, flowing, narrative history. The best word I can find for it is dense. I have lost count of the number of times I have started and stopped. Reading it is an educational experience but finishing it is a struggle - somewhat like what living in the 14th century was like I suppose, so maybe that's the point.
0679759328|4.0|It took me forever to get into &quot;Hotel du Lac.&quot;  I love Jane Austen and I love Anne Tyler and this books sorta straddles both and was recommended to me by a used bookstore owner who said his wife liked it.<br />Finally after several chapters I got hooked and I read it slowly enough to relish it.  I lived in Geneva and Basle so I could understand the place and was fascinated to read her version of  Lake Geneva.  The book slowly unfolds and has the unexpected twists you get in mysteries and at the end you are still puzzling - it isn't so neat  in fact like a good movie it makes you want to go out and discuss it with others.  The reviews here make me think the people who are reading it prefer action novels and would be the last people I'd like to discuss this book with.<br />But I really loved it.  I'm only sorry every  one says it's her best as I'd like to read others by her and not be disappointed.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This film is definetely up there with Memento and Usual Suspects and other fantastic films of this genre like Ronin. It is absolutely brilliantly written and directed, and the acting is amazing. Don't even bother renting it first, just buy it
630018160X|5.0|A wonderful movie based on one of the best musicals ever written. Shirley MacLaine is perfect for the part of Charity, because there is something that her and Gwen Verdon share...some unique quality as actresses...the ability to make everything so sweet, truthful, hopeful... theres just a look in thier eyes. Well anyway, she does a great job in this movie. and of course, the choreography of Bob Fosse is incredable. Never has there been a movie or musical that makes you fall SO in love with a character. You laugh with her, cry with her, hurt with her, and her hope is SO contagous. This movie's less than happy ending is painful at first, but then you realize it couldn't have ended any other way and hae still been truthful to Charity's character. It is strangly uplifting . &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; is a classic.
B00005R2M3|2.0|My wife and I have been huge shakira fans since pies descalzos.  We have purchased Done estan los ladrones and the mtv unplugged cd (i recommend all three of them).  When we heard she was going to make a bilingual album, we were very excited and waited soooo long for its release.  We couldn;t wait until the american and other english speaking markets heard this woman's artistic ability with words and music, both from a artist's and performer's standpoint.  HOWEVER, as soon as we heard the Miami mafia of the estefan family had dug their claws into shakira, and tommy motola had engaged an \\"image team\\" to promote her, we became very skeptical, and feared that her artistry would take second place to image and glossy overproduction.  We were not let down.  It happened.  The album lacks the ROCK element of her 3 sony releases, and quite frankly, thanks to the dyed hair, the T and A outfits, and other non-musical assets that Sony and MTV has decided to accentuate, she comes across as an older version of christina aguilera (or a much younger, blonde version of gloria).  And the result is that she comes across as just another run of the mill bleach blonde spanish sex kitten disco queen, except with a less sexy body to compete with.  Songs that are worth listening to: Te Dejo Madrid,Fool, Poems to a Horse.  All others can go in the bargain bin.  Maybe someday she will shake the fleas of the estefan family and Tony Motola off her skin and get back to ROCKING THE WORLD.
0451169514|5.0|I read this book in two weeks (well . . . thirteen days) and loved it.  One thing that most people don't mention is how funny King can be.  I've read a lot of books by a lot of authors (Koontz being my favourite) but nobody can make me giggle the way King does.<br />Yes, there are some rather scarry scenes, and I think I did myself well by reading it during the day, but this ISN'T a horror novel.  Not on your life.  <br />So ya, READ IT!!!
B00003CXXP|5.0|About two or three times per year, I purchase a DVD \\"sight-unseen\\" based on reviews that I've read.  Usually, it's because the comments and/or divided opinions about the movie intrigued me enough to have it in my collection.  Sometimes it works out well; other times, it's a complete bust.  One thing I've learned is that movies affect people in very different ways.  All of my favorite films have been trashed by someone (often world-reknowned critics) and all of the films that I think are terrible are on someone's \\"favorite\\" list (sometimes winning best picture, to my dismay).  Film reviewing is a very subjective occupation indeed.  With that in mind -- on Thursday, I bought A.I. sight-unseen.  Here are my thoughts, ...<br />1.  A.I. is one of the very best movies that I've seen in years!  I was captivated from beginning to end and I'm still thinking of it days later.  I absolutely cannot understand why some of the reviews I've read were so negative.  It was the perfect fairy tale.<br />2.  I vehemently disagree with all of the opinions expressed about the ending (*** don't worry, ... no spoilers here ***).  The ending was absolutely perfect.  I thought that the film couldn't have tied everything together so perfectly with any other ending.  A.I. was an epic, to say the least.  I also don't believe that it ran one second too long.<br />3.  I cannot understand why so many people thought that, of the three acts, two were Kubrik and the last was all Spielberg.  I disagree.  I thought that the movie flowed beautifully among the three acts.  Although the ending certainly took me by surprise, I didn't think it was out of place from the context of what had preceded AT ALL!  In fact, it was a breathtaking twist on the overall story and what made it so memorable.<br />4.  This 2-disc DVD set is as well-done as anything I own (with a collection of about 150 DVDs right now).  The picture and sound are perfectly done -- it is obvious that great care was taken in mastering this DVD.  The extras are amazing and plentiful.  My wife and I, after watching the movie, sat through all of the extras!  I've never done that before, ever.  A.I. is a great addition to my collection of DVDs.  I look forward to watching it again.<br />5.  The Oscars are totally fixed if A.I. does not get the following Academy Awards:<br />A.I. should be nominated for, ...<br />Best Picture<br />It should win (hands-down), ...<br />Best Actor (Haley Joel Osment)<BR>Best Supporting Actor (Jude Law)<BR>Best Director (Steven Spielberg)<BR>Best Original Screenplay<BR>Best Art Direction<BR>Best Special Effects<BR>Best Makeup<BR>Best Costume Design<br />Of course, we already know that A.I. is going to get robbed due to its lack of success at the box office.<br />Shame.<br />All I have to say is, ... Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews that you may have read about this movie, ... they're nuts.<br />Go out and buy this film today.  Don't expect Star Wars.  It's not that.  However, if you love character development, a deep story, and films that make you think -- you won't be disappointed!
6302814790|5.0|Beetlejuice is not a movie that you can't watch under . . . 5,000 times! It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place. Tim Burton did an excellent job, and you have to see this movie.
B00003CXXP|4.0|we watched it yesterday. It was superbly acted, beautifully made and well directed. Stunning. But it was one of the saddest, most depressing movie I've ever seen. I had a hard time not crying from almost the beginning and then when Monica dumps David in the woods against his emphatic protests, well forget it. I spent most of the movie wishing she had taken him back to the factory to be destroyed. She supposedly thought she was saving him but instead she introduced him to hell. My eight year old son was bawling, especially at the end. It was a great movie but I don't know how I feel about many aspects of it. I think horrified.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Disc one quickly kicks into high gear with \\"The Glass Prison\\" one of the heaviest songs in DT's catalog. Many purists have ripped on the nu-metal overtones, particularly the brief incidence of \\"record scratching\\" in the middle...well, for crying out loud, Dream Theater is a PROGRESSIVE band, which theoretically means incorporating a wide range of styles and sounds into their music, right?? All those other modern prog-metal bands (Shadow Gallery, Symphony X, Vanden Plas, etc.) seem to forget that, and basically clone the styles that DT and other classic prog bands have created -- it's almost like \\"progressive\\" has become merely a description for \\"progressive-like\\", in other words, copying a sound that was highly original thirty years ago but is no surprise to anyone now. TRUE progressive music, to use the strict definition of the term, doesn't even sound like classic prog anymore, and could more accurately be applied to original alternative & industrial music like Tool, Nine Inch Nails, etc. And in any case, this one song is FAR better than the entire collected works of Korn, Limp Bisquick, Puddle of Mudd and Static-X combined!!! How does that strike you, eh?<BR>Anyway...things take a much quieter tone in the next two tracks. \\"Blind Faith\\" opens with a moody keyboard tone similar to Led Zeppelin's \\"No Quarter\\", Misunderstood\\" features a gorgeous melody. Then we get \\"The Great Debate\\", a long jamfest that sounds for all the world like a grudge match between Rush and Tool in a dark alley, liberally sprinkled with news soundclips about stem cell research (ooh, topical!) The final track, \\"Disappear\\", could have been left off the album entirely...it's a pointless, monotonous drone that just might be the worst DT song ever.<BR>Now comes disc two, the much talked-about 42-minute suite. This song is GODLIKE!! The Overture crashes open with an orchestral movie-theme score that's highly reminiscent of late-era ELP (especially the ELPowell version.) Those overtones continue into \\"About to Crash\\", which is a fine piece. The next two parts take a much heavier, more aggressive route, especially \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\". Part 5 switches gears to the slower side of prog-rock, akin to Marillion or Gabriel-era Genesis. \\"Solitary Shell\\" is a direct pastiche of Peter Gabriel's \\"Solsbury Hill\\", featuring one of the most beautiful melodies I've heard on any DT album. Then comes the standard Pink Floyd-ish finale which is great. Overall, just with one flaw (Song: Disappear) prevent this album from surpassing Scenes from a Memory as the best Dream Theater album ever, but hey, it's definitely a respectable follow-up, and one that grows on you with each listen. Congratulations to the boys for creating yet another masterpiece!
6302968143|4.0|I watch a movie for 2 reasons; the trailer, and the actors. If it looks good there's a good chance I will go see it. If it has actors I love and it looks good there's an even greater chance. With this movie, I first rented it because of the three actress's on the cover. Bette Midler, on the cover, just looked like she would be funny. I was right, I have never seen Bette funnier in  this type of comedy, the voice, the facial expressions, the lines, GoodBye World? I also had loved Kathy Nijimy in Sister Act and she also was funny in this movie especially with the vaccum? Sarah J.P. was really funny as the dumb frightened, at times, witch. Seeing her jumping onto the black river, very funny? This movie doesn't have the best scipt all the way through but it does more than make up for it with these three great leading actress's. This will surely be a Halloween Cult Classic for years to come.
0446525537|5.0|I loved A Walk To Remember. Anyone who has ever lived in a small town can relate to this book. The chemistry of Landon and Jamie is so very typical of any teenage relationship. The relationship Jamie has with God is a little radical for a teenager, but in my opinion the world needs more like that. This book is wonderfully written, and has a superlative plot.  This book sparked deep emotions inside of me...I laughed on one page, and cried on the next. I would recommed this book to anyteenage girl, espcially those who live in a small town.
6304493738|5.0|What can i say? After the first time i saw this movie, my heart had a bmp over 4000 or something. It was amazing. It's like 1 hour and 30 minutes of great action builds up to the 10 minute ending, the most intense 10 minutes in the history of moving pictures. It's fantastic. And the second time you see it, you notice things you didn't notice before when you didn't know the ending, and you realize how complex and detailed this movie really is. It's a true masterpiece. And Kevin Spaceys achievement is just great. I've seen this movies about 20 times or so, and it's still great, but nothing can beat the first time you see this. You can tell that this is not just some movie to make money, they've all put down a lot of work with it. You owe it to yourself to see this one.
0767802624|5.0|The \\"Men in Black\\" Collector's Series DVD boasts the de rigeur CGI into and menus.  They look great and provide access to a small wealth of hidden material, and the movie itself is great.  Almost everyone reading this knows that already, so why belabor the point?  This review is specific to one small facet of \\"bonus\\" material that influences every one of my DVD purchases 100% of the time: The Commentary.<br />Very simply put: together Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Sonnenfeld shine as a great tag-team of dry wit and companionship as they watch and play witness to their film again.<br />I love this movie, and bought the DVD specifically for the commentary.  I was amazed to find that this is not the standard commentary that you get from almost every other DVD with boring technical specs and folks gushing over each other's performances, but instead is filled with so much subtle humor and good, personal vibes that it is much more interesting than the audio track that it subserviates and obscures.  (The bicycle joke referencing \\"For Love or Money\\" is brilliant in its self-deprecation!)  There are, of course, technical insights, but are buffered on all sides with a true concern with the movie and watchers -- very little of the standard \\"this scene was shot using a Claytometer lens and a forester-filter\\" kind of stuff that very few of us care about.<br />Putting the humor aside, the commentary track makes watching the movie feel like you're watching with a pair of good-humored uncles (well, I'm only 31, so it could happen).  Tommy Lee Jones constantly mocks amazement as the plot progresses while providing insight and asking questions, and Barry Sonnenfeld mellows out and points out some incredibly interesting facts while never being anything more than an omniscient observer.<br />All in all, the humor within is refined, intelligent, and genteel, like what you would expect from an NPR broadcast.  If you thought that Will Smith was the comedic powerhouse of the film, then you maynot appreciate the commentary.  If you recognize Tommy Lee Jones as the man with the best character and truly the best lines, then you should get this DVD and experience even more of his genius!
0374384576|5.0|I purchased this book for the purpose of reading it allowed to my daughter who is 5.  Boy did we BOTH enjoy it.  I found myself laughing out loud to many parts in this book, what a fun sense of humor!  It read very quickly.  It is interesting he (the author) uses his heritage of Norwegian parents and living in Wales.  The book takes place between Norway and England. Even though I am not completely for making witches the vile things as he presented, his sense of humor made it a very worth while read. We really really enjoyed this book and will be looking for his other works.
0812550706|5.0|This novel was an easy read that was full of inventive military creations as well as science fiction components.  The story line was interesting and never gave way to a dull moment.  Ender's trials and tribulations were an amazing triumph and the fact that the novel was written about children made it all the more interesting and thought provoking.  This story inspires the imagination to think beyond the technological, inferior age and look towards the future in a new light with a new understanding.  The ending of Ender's great career implemented a subtle jaw-dropping `twist' that made the story a complete success.  This was more than a science fiction novel, it was more than a coming of age story and it was more than a military strategy story.  This literature was a great source of entertainment and edge of the seat action.  Orson Scott Card knew what he was doing when he wrote this novel and succeeded in portraying a futuristic militia composed of children rigorously trained in the defeat of the enemy.  Ender represents a bit of all humans, he is the embodiment of human flaws and perfections.  There is some quality in him that each of us has within and he utilizes every strength and weakness effectively to serve in obtaining his goals.  I definitely recommend this novel to anyone seeking a smooth ride of intellectual entertainment.  It will leave you wondering about the future and invigorate your imagination in no time at all.
B0000507R2|5.0|The DVD-Audio version is very impressive.<br />the mix is not the best I've heard (like Blue Men Group) but Natalie couldn't sound more deep and warm than that.<br />I'd recommend that CD for it's quality and the advantage of this new hi-end mastering technology.<br />someone reviewed this DVD poorly because of it's mix. well, I can surely say that no CD (even DTS) can come close to the stunning quality of DVD-Audio.
0784010501|4.0|Groundbreaking movie making with Madonna in it What more could you ask for???. Great detail of  our most relkevant pop Icon revealed when it was  not fashionable bearing it all. This production gives 100 % of raw,  gritty  life caught on tape . It is also tha only  DVD outr with fragments of the Wonderfull Blond Ambition World Tour 90 wich in itsel was a millestone for  all artists. It does not rate 5 because of  the  limited content presented.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink's new CD is really good. I especially like the middle of song #5 Respect...\\"Mirror mirror on the wall, [dang] I sure look fine. I can't blame those horny boys, I would make me mine. When I pass you in a club \\"Ooh La La\\" you gasp- back up boy I ain't your toy...
B00005T5VE|3.0|As everything  Madonna's this  CD  surprises even the most die hard fans. It is still a great collection but not anywhere near Imaculate collection's status in pop music nor will It have the same impact IC had  on 1990. It is just to  comercial  and it lacked  the most emotional  work of this great Pop Icon then again most of the best work  she did this decade was not  Great nor a  Hit comercialy. If you have all of Madonnas CDs  you wont be needing this one. If you asre a new commer you might be intrested.  Nevertheless  tha songs are all great and is a fun CD to listen to. I just would have liked it more  were it more  creative.Shes allready done trhee greatest hits.....
B000001FTJ|5.0|Few artists ever seek to completely re-invent themselves on record, and fewer still make the transformation as completely successfully as did Tom Waits. His 70's albums are revered for their delicate, string-landen piano work with Waits croaking out lyrical strands of barstool philosophizing in a pseudo-Louis Armstrong growl. These albums are good, strong efforts, but they had become somewhat predictable by the time of 1980's Heart Attack &amp; Vine (although that album, and it's predecessor, Blue Valentine, had started to introduce new elements into Waits's music.) Swordfishtrombones, then, was a complete re-invention. Out go the strings and piano work (almost entirely in the case of the former, much less overt in the case of the latter), out go to late night bar-obsessed Beat poetry of the lyrics, out goes the Louis Armstrong growl. This album, instead, featured light, sparse, percussion-driven arrangements, with chugging basslines and occasional freakish burts of kaleidoscopic guitar. Lyrically, it was still drenched in weirdness, but moreso than ever - Waits's tales range from the insane poetry that would come to dominate his next album, Rain Dogs (Underground, Shore Leave), to his other typical 80's style song that he still leans on heavily in concert when he plays (16 Shells, Down, Down, Down), to the outright bizzarre and hilarous (Frank's Wild Years, In The Neighborhood.) We also see his vocals take on a more Howlin' Wolf-esque leaning - one critic described the album as sounding like &quot;The Three Penny Opera as sung by Howlin' Wolf.&quot; Although this was the prototype for all the rest of his albums since it, it can be a bit hard to get used to (not that all of his albums aren't), if you are used to his earlier efforts. But, like any great album, it takes some time to grow on you. After several listens, you will come to appreciate that this is an album of unique genius. Rain Dogs would be the apex of this era of Tom's songwriting, and his masterpiece may indeed have come in 1992 with Bone Machine, but Swordfishtrombones is a brave, admirable total re-invention the likes of which we almost never see. It's an essential Waits album.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I saw the trailer for this movie but  was not intrested at all. After seeing the movie  in the theather  I justs fell in love with everything about it. It as most people  say \\" You either  love it or hate it\\" and  am I glad  I love it. Wonderfull music, beatufull scenes great performances and now a  wonderfull, lush  DVD package  that is worth every cent and the best I have in my collection. This is a movie to share with a loved one. Just from looking  at it one minute you can clearly see it is  a dream come true for  the team who makde this wonderfull production. I just hope  you can learn to love this film.... Boy is it fun!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|2.0|After Pearl Harbor finished playing.I had one thing on my mind.I must see &quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;.Forget Pearl Harbor,Pearl,and Tora Tora Tora,From Here To Eternity is a efinately the film to watch instead.
B00005QDW1|1.0|No Doubt is one of my favorite bands of all time, but not even I like the change in their music that has taken place for this album.  I understand that they need to sell records, though, so I understand why they've changed their sound to something more mainstream.  This album is much more hip-hop than their other albums.  It's not my preference.<br />If you're a disappointed fan like me, take comfort in your other No Doubt cds.  I recommend buying their first self-titled album if you don't have it.  It's silly and fun, and it's a great example of what talented and fun people the members of No Doubt are.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a brillant film and its really sad and moving.The special effects are amazing and you wouldn't believe they weren't real.Ben Affleck may pose a bit too much but Josh Hartnett really brightens up the screen and is very nice.One to see any day.Go see it twice.

B000063V8R|5.0|Now this is where it gets interesting! After the shortened and varied second season, The Next Generation finally gets going in the third season. Not only is the writing brilliant but the production values have had a shot in the arm. The revised title sequence is much stronger and the title music is re-mixed. The entire ship looks and sounds better too, with the new uniforms with the collars (much better). <br />A new director of photography was brought whose lighting technique allowed them to get rid of that \\"this is obviously filmed in a studio\\" look when creating planet side sequences. This season also has some of the best scores to accompany the series before it became a constant rehash of the same orchestral sequences later on in the programme. Ron Jones does a particularly excellent job, especially with \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" and newcomer Jay Chattaway's score to \\"Tin Man\\" turned a mediocre episode into something more emotional.<br />This season shines with great episodes such as The Enemy (Romulans!), The Defector (real spy thriller stuff), The Hunted, The High Ground (terrorist episode). There are however 2 stunners: \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" and \\"The Best of Both Worlds.\\" Alternative timelines and the Borg have always made some of the best episodes - Yesterday's Enterprise gives Tasha Yar a chance to return for an episode where the Federation is still at war with the Klingons. The Best of Both Worlds is the high point of the entire series - great story, great effects, great music, and that feeling of \\"they can't do that\\" when the \\"To be continued....\\" line appeared on the screen. Great stuff.<br />Episode List:<br />Evolution <BR>The Ensigns of Command <BR>The Survivors <BR>Who Watches The Watchers?<BR>The Bonding <BR>Booby Trap <BR>The Enemy <BR>The Price <BR>The Vengeance Factor<BR>The Defector<BR>The Hunted <BR>The High Ground <BR>Deja Q <BR>A Matter of Perspective<BR>Yesterday's Enterprise<BR>The Offspring<BR>Sins of the Father <BR>Allegiance <BR>Captain's Holiday<BR>Tin Man <BR>Hollow Pursuits<BR>The Most Toys<BR>Sarek <BR>Ménage à Troi <BR>Transfigurations<BR>The Best of Both Worlds, Part I
0446608955|5.0|It is touching. It's a bout a boy who slowly becomes a man as he learns to love this girl, because of her heart and her mind. I literally stayed up to 11:00 on a school night reading this book in my alarm clock light. It is incredible. And there is a great price on it. I bought a paperback at a local book store. I think anyone will enjoy this book, especially if you need something to warm your heart. It is my favorite book I've ever read, I'm the kind of teenager who reads alot, so it is very intresting. It will always have this amazing perpetual affect on me. I think it is undeniably beautiful. The book is woven together so well. Thank you, please do read it, even if you won't buy it here. -Nichole
B000063V8T|5.0|This season of Star Trek: The Next Generation is full of \\"society episodes\\" for example, Violations, the Masterpiece Society, the Outcast and the Cost of Living. They're all actually very good, it's the other episodes that the writers can't seem to get right this season. For a start the 2 part special \\"Unification\\" featuring Spock is long, drawn out and only has the last 5 minutes with any action. It's still good as a thriller but nothing really happens. <br />Jonathan Frakes continues his directing with \\"Cause and Effect\\" - the Enterprise caught in a temporal loop, leading to it's continual destruction each time. Frakes manages to film each of the 5 or 6 times it happens from a different perspective stopping it from grating. \\"I Borg\\" features the return of the Borg with the twist - a faction of them are individuals now. We didn't expect another Borg episode to take such a different stance, that's why it works. \\"Power Play\\" and \\"Disaster\\" are action packed - Die Hard - type episodes, and this is where Star Trek tends to lose out over Babylon 5, is that everything goes back to normal the following week. Any trauma these characters might have experienced or any changes in their character aren't continued throughout the rest of the series. <br />\\"The Inner Light\\" is often sited as one of the finest episodes, where Picard lives the rest of his natural life (or believes he does) and has to deal with returning to the Enterprise after having come to terms with his new \\"life.\\" It's very well made and Stewart shines as always. The season finale \\"Time's Arrow\\" is an enjoyable romp but a bit pointless, it feels more like Doctor Who than Star Trek. Still, there are some good episodes here and this box set is well worth having.<br />Episode List;<BR> <BR>Redemption, Part II <BR>Darmok <BR>Ensign Ro<BR>Silicon Avatar<BR>Disaster <BR>The Game<BR>Unification, Part I<BR>Unification, Part II<BR>A Matter of Time<BR>New Ground <BR>Hero Worship <BR>Violations <BR>The Masterpiece Society<BR>Conundrum <BR>Power Play <BR>Ethics <BR>The Outcast <BR>Cause and Effect <BR>The First Duty <BR>Cost of Living <BR>The Perfect Mate<BR>Imaginary Friend <BR>I, Borg <BR>The Next Phase <BR>The Inner Light <BR>Time's Arrow, Part I
0446525537|5.0|This book is woven together so well. It's about a boy who slowly becomes a man when he falls in love with a girl, not because of what people say of her, but because of her heart. It will always leave a perptual feeling for me. It's my favorite book I've ever read. I literally stayed up to 11:00 at night reading in my alarm clock light. It is a good book, even if you don't buy it here please read it. It gives me as a person, strong feelings about life. It is about two people falling in love, through obstacles. It is so riveting...
B000063V8U|5.0|Season 6 of Star Trek the Next Generation has many middle of the road episodes with a few really strong thrillers and character episodes. Chain Of Command (with the superb David Warner from \\"Titanic\\" \\"The Omen\\" and other Star Trek episodes / films) deals with the capture and torture of Picard by the Cardassians while a new captain takes command of the Enterprise much to Riker's distain. The other 2 parter, \\"Birthright\\" is a wasted opportunity to integrate with Deep Space Nine. The 2 shows ran concurrently for 2 years yet once twice did they attempt to cross over. We really wanted to see a 3 or 4 parter with all the Next Gen / DS9 crews in the same story. \\"Birthright\\" has the Enterprise docked at DS9 while Worf spends yet another episode dealing with his family and honour. <br />There are less of the great episodes that we've been used to from the 3rd to 5th seasons. Face of the Enemy, Starship Mine, Second Chances, The Chase and Timescape are all good if somewhat contrived. Descent features the return of the individual Borg faction led by Data's brother Lore. It's not strong enough as a Borg episode, the feeling of them being invincible has gone from \\"Q Who\\". Every time Star Trek faces a new, deadlier enemy, several episodes later they are made out to have human values after all - which isn't the point.<br />Episode list:<BR> <BR>Time's Arrow, Part II<BR>Realm of Fear<BR>Man of the People<BR>Relics<BR>Schisms<BR>True-Q <BR>Rascals <BR>A Fistful of Datas<BR>The Quality of Life<BR>Chain of Command, Part I <BR>Chain of Command, Part II<BR>Ship in a Bottle <BR>Aquiel <BR>Face of the Enemy <BR>Tapestry <BR>Birthright, Part I <BR>Birthright, Part II <BR>Starship Mine <BR>Lessons <BR>The Chase <BR>Frame of Mind <BR>Suspicions <BR>Rightful Heir<BR>Second Chances <BR>Timescape <BR>Descent, Part I
B00005RYLE|5.0|This is any fans or collectors dream!  For the very first time the original classsic, The Evil Dead, is being presented in the WIDESCREEN format (1.85:1) and encased in a replica of the original Book of the Dead, which includes actual pictures from the book that was used in the film.  The outer casing of the book is amazing..very soft like styrophone, great detail and craftsmenship...your hands will shake when you first touch it.  The DVD is hidden on the last page of the book with a mini book about the genesis of the film located just before it.  I found the mini booklet very informative (and you will too!).  The DVD itself conatains all the extra features from the original Special Edition DVD released by Elite Entertainment: The Behind the Scenes Footage & Outakes are the same.  Both audio commentaries are identical to that release.  The Still Frame Gallery is different from the first release with many new & different pictures given (a reason to keep your Elite version if you're a collector).  You have to check out \\"Fanalysis\\" a short documentary starring and directed by the great Bruce Campbell himself, which focuses on the fans of Evil Dead as well as Campbells own experiences at Sci-fi conventions and his devotion to his many admireres.  The other \\"making of\\", entitled \\"Discovering Evil Dead\\" is far less interesting simply because Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, & Ted Raimi are not included in the featurette.  The theatrical trailer is also released in Widescreen and you even get some TV Spots as well which is rare.  The other big bonus is the film has DTS sound for the very first time and it sounds fantastic!  You can expect future DTS releases for Evil Dead 2 & Army of Darkness sometime soon.  If we're lucky, maybe each film will be encased in its own Book of the Dead...or at least a Boxed Set, right Anchor Bay?!<br />On a personal note, the first time I viewed this film, I dared it to scare me, so I watched it by myself at midnight with no lights on and the soundway up on my VCR (many years ago this was).  HUGE MISTAKE!!  I couldn't sleep the next few days and had nightmares of deadites screaming \\"JOIN US!!!!\\" at me.  Truly one of the scariest movies ever made!  But act fast and pick this Book of the Dead DVD release up soon before it's no longer available.  (remember what happened to the Army of Darkness 2 disc set?)<br />The Evil Dead - A Horror Classic!<br />\\"Kill her if you can...LOVERBOY!!!!\\"
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Maybe it's just one of my perks, but I do not look for spiritual inspiration from a pop star. To those fellow reviewers that have bestowed some divine significance upon \\"The Rainbow Children\\", I say that the measure of THIS Prince album is simple:<br />1) IS IT FUNKY? YES<br />2) DOES PRINCE STILL KNOW HOW TO INTERPRET A SONG? YES<br />3) ARE HIS LYRICS AS ENIGMATIC AS EVER? YES<br />4) DOES PRINCE MAKE MUSIC FOR HIMSELF FIRST? YES<br />5) IS THIS ALBUM A PLEASURABLE LISTENING EXPERIENCE? YES<br />6) IS THIS ALBUM WORTH PURCHASING? YES<br />Need I say more? I think not!
B00003CXXP|5.0|It surprised me to see some reviewers critising this movie for its boring , its ending, its storyline ....etc. Hey, only the acting of Haley Joel Osment is worth everything. <BR>Don't expect to see a Starwar or ID4like action packed sci-fiction movie. A.I. is all about love, the uncoditional love from a child for his mommy. I felt sorry for Monica(Frances O'Connor), she asked for the love(by impriting David - Haley Joel Osment) and yet, not dare to accept it. Only at the end of the movie when she can't remember anything but David, she told him,&quot;I have always loved you&quot;. That's the moment David had been waiting and hoping for his whole life and it's the most touching moment of the movie.<BR>On the contrary to some reviewers, I think the ending is perfect. Because David went to sleep for the first time in his life and in his dreams, he will be with his beloved mommy forever. It is indeed &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.<BR>Of course this review is for the one who has already seen the movie, as for the one who hasn't, you will love it if you have love in you.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read.  I also think that it has particular relevance to today's edge-of-war world. Orson Scott Card tells the story of Andrew Wiggin who is taken from his loving family (minus one monstrous brother) and taught to be a killer. Ender is Andrew's nick name and becomes an extremely appropriate name for this child. He is the third child of his parents and faces his first struggles in life because of his birth. In the earth of this novel couples are allowed only two children. The world has faced an invasion of buggers. These are beings that resemble ants: ants that fly spacecraft and conquer worlds. Earth has survived two of these invasions and is preparing for a third. To prepare for war, the brightest little boys and girls in the world are screened and tested for war training. Children are put into this training program at the age of six. Ender's brother and sister are older and had both washed out of the program. Ender seems to be the last hope for the survival of humanity. <BR>The majority of this story tells of Ender's transition from benevolent genius to the ultimate killer. The touching aspect of this novel is Ender's struggle to maintain his humanity. Many times in this novel the idea that Homo sapiens can be human or animal is quite poignant. These children are being taught to kill through games. Their play is taking them further from the humanity they are striving to protect. How far are we really from the beast behavior of animals? Do not we prove our beast-like nature in every vile and violent act we condone or participate? At one point in the novel Ender's sister comments that when we pretend long enough at being something, we become that thing. The children at the battle school are playing games of war. They become war and destruction. I think that we could apply this philosophy to current events in our world. We have played generations too long at becoming excellent warriors. When will we play games of peace?
0671781383|5.0|I choose this book to review as part of an academic assignment and found it to be an uplifting spiritual journey, rather than an ardous academic task! Dr. Frankl's story of survival midst the unimaginable human suffering in the Death camps of WW11 is a truly moving account of the indomitable nature of the human spirit. In many ways it is the same courageous, inspirationl spirit which I have the privilege to encounter through my work ( i.e. working with people who have cancer). People have an enormous capacity to cope with suffering as evidenced by Dr. Frankl's testimony -the power to do so is within all of us, deep within our core, our very being. This book is not alone inspirational, it is also  powerfully liberating; a liberation which emanates from Dr. Frankl's truism -- our one true freedom is our infinite freedom to choose our attitude, regardless of the circumstances. Our search or spiritual quest for meaning is as unique and individual as we are, and the meaning we eventually attribute to our inevitable human suffering is also unique. This book focuses the mind on the truly important things in life, our relationships, our loved ones, etc. My perspective on life and living has not only broadened but has deepened also. The philosophy/theory espoused by Viktor Frankl in this masterpiece has \\"grounded\\" me in a very real sense. <BR>The world is a lesser place without Dr. Frankl but his beautifully enriching work will shine brightly like a beacon of hope in the hearts and minds of men for years to come.
B000002J23|5.0|Lo digo asi, pues no se sabe que pasaba en la banda por esa epoca, lo cierto que este album lo compr en vinyl hace 18 aos y al darme cuenta que no esta John Anderson ni Rick Wakeman casi lo devuelvo, sin embargo al empezarlo a oir me di cuenta de la grandiosidad de este disco, canciones como Machine Messiah y White Car son verdaderas obras de calidad, sin embargo Yes no puede existir como tal sin Anderson pues es parte esencial del estilo de la banda, a pesar del esfuerzo grande que hizo Trevor Horn, pero Geoff Downes demuestra porque ha tenido tanto exito en su carrera como solista y con Asia, Tempus Fugit pareciera una despedida, que ciertamente asi fue, pues la banda como tal se desmembr, aunque lo positivo fue que de este proyecto naci ASIA
B000002KKC|5.0|I don't have to write a review for TUSK. Buy it and let it speak for itself. One track you can pass over IS &quot;Tusk&quot;, the rest is worth the time (and more). I believe that Warner Brothers should be ashamed of themselves for not releasing a remastered version of TUSK, with the full version of &quot;Sara&quot;. Did you hear that, you stuffy executives at Warner Brothers? You have access to a masterpiece, so do something! For those looking for new music to listen to, this is a GEM from the past.
B000002J1I|5.0|Lo digo asi, pues para mi este album representa el verdadero lado comercial de Yes, como deberia sonar la banda, con musicos, de gran calidad, con el inolvidable Rick Wakeman al que tanto extraamos muchos fans, Future Times es una cancion veinte aos adelantada en su tiempo, Steve Howe tocando como un maestro con su arsenal de guitarras, Madrigal sencillamente una belleza, y Release una cancion para rokear al maximo, aunque el<BR>seor Squire diga lo contrario sobre este gran Lp.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I love this CD.I can't stop playing it.It's one of the best cd's I have purchased in a long time.I live in Savannah ga she said in one of her bio's that she attended a college here for a while. I can't believe that I was so near her and never heard of her until recently.I am taking acoustic guitar lessons thanks to her.I'm anxious to hear her next CD. INDIA YOU GO GIRL!!...
B000002J29|5.0|Lo considero clasico porque a pesar que en esa epoca ya no estaba el legendario Peter Gabriel, es un album que retoma la epoca mas gloriosa de la banda, tocando autenticos clasicos en una gran forma y ademas no es un album comercial, como los que vinieron posteriormente, muchos se lamentaron que las celebres obras de Gabriel fueran interpretadas por Phil Collins pero creo que aunque nunca estuve de acuerdo con la direccion que este ltimo le dio posteriormente a la banda, lo hace muy bien pues no las canta tan melancolicamente, sino que lo hace con mucha energia y con una voz melodiosa y clara, la interpretacion musical y la calidad del sonido es muy buena a parte que los  musicos invitados como Bill Bruford y Chester Thompson son musicos de gran valia, a mi parecer nunca mas Genesis volvi a tocar todos sus clasicos como en este disco pues como todos sabemos la banda se comercializ perdiendo la identidad artistica y musical que con Gabriel habian ganado, todo fiel seguidor de este grupo debe tener esta produccion
6305736650|5.0|No point in writing about the movie - it is adequately covered elsewhere - just a note to say the quality of the DVD release is superb.  This is what B&W on the big screen should look like - all the subtlety of shade and texture and wonderful tonal values.  If you are borderline about buying it for the plot and have seen to many terrible prints on TV - get this to see how good the cinematography really was in those days!  Oh yes - it's also a good movie!
6302517036|5.0|Fright Night is one of the all-time greatest horror movies about vampires. It weaves together a blend of campy humor and truly frightening scenes to create a masterpiece of the horror genre. I know I may seem to be giving this movie high accolades, but I have to say that I'm still blown away by it's originality and wit all these years later. I first saw the movie when I was a young child who snuck out late at night after my parents had gone to be to watch the rented movie.<br />The plot is quite basic.  A teenage boy, Charlie, notices that people start disappearing and turning up dead when a strange new neighbor moves in next door.  Charlie is a horror movie buff and lets his imagination get away from him, and begins to believe his neighbor is a vampire.  None of his friends believe him, his mother thinks he has dreamt it all up and needs a cup of cocoa to settle him down, and the host of his favorite show \\"Fright Night\\" thinks he is insane.  Eventually Charlie's friends enlist the help of the recently fired horror host, Peter Vincent, and they take Charlie to his neighbor's house to prove he is not a vampire.  I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the entire movie.    <br />If you haven't ever seen this movie, go out and rent it. Once you do, I'm sure you'll want to buy it. This is a great movie for horror film buffs who can appreciate it's quirks. However, even if you're not a fanatic about scary movies, you will probably still enjoy Fright Night because it is a great movie on it's own merit. Don't be fooled by the premise of vampires who move into a teenage boys neighborhood and start wreaking havoc, because this movie goes beyond the realm of the typical and incorporates so many different elements that it creates an amazing final product. Watch it! Buy it! Love it!
B00005JKYS|2.0|Randall Wallace has turned a true story of valor and patriotism into an overblown, gory, corny mess.  Mel Gibson is one of the few actors who could anchor this film with his star persona, but he can't save this film from its own false heart.  The scenes involving the wives of the soldiers, sitting around the coffee table and discussing racial equality, are borderline comic.  As an air force brat, I lived through these years and watched my father leave the house on many mornings -- and I watched my mother's galvanized terror and fear.  There is none of that here.  On the battlefield, the blood virtually never stops flowing, in ways that make you think that the director kept trying to find new, novel ways of making a body explode -- so much so that he actually lets blood drip onto the camera, which of course reminds you that you are watching a movie.  While I admire the man (Moore)behind Gibson's character, the simplistic way in which the Vietnam war and its participants are handled -- including an absurdly PC epilogue involving the Viet Cong leader and an American flag -- felt false at every turn.  It's a big, noisy war epic, signifying nothing.
B00005YT8U|1.0|Tedious.  Trite.  Blasphemous.<br />I know it's \\"just\\" music, but I feel abused by this effort.<br />If you're a fan of The Chieftains you don't need to own or hear this CD.  You already own the best cuts and the other thirteen or sixteen are just pitiful grabs for the limelight that it seems they feel they're missing!<br />If you're not a fan of \\"The Chieftains\\", you won't become one because you listened to this collection.<br />Really!  Ziggy Marley!?!?!  My 19-year-old daughter and her friend were in stitches, laughing at that collaboration.  Others are equally moronic.<br />The Chieftains don't have to play back-up to every act!  <br />What next?  Accompanying Christina Aguilera as she sings \\"Danny Boy\\"????<br />Nothing is forever.  Forty years is a long time.  If The Chieftains have recorded all that they need to record, then don't record!!!  However, I will be the first in line to buy tickets when them come to Pittsburgh.  (Unless they feature Michael Jackson...)<br />[Nothing against Michael Jackson!]
B00003CXXP|2.0|I wanted more out of this movie. What I got was a flick with too many different plots all trying to be intertwined. While I didn't find this movie hard to follow at all. I did find it hard to really feel any of the story, since it seemed to be going in so many directions. I also didn't like the slow pace of the movie, maybe worst of all. It was simply too long! It could have ended 45 minutes eairler, had they just cut some of the weird sub-plots out. Haley does a very good job as the robotic boy who wants to be able to feel. An interesting fact I heard about him. All on his own, Haley decided not to blink durring any of his scenes. Because this would make him appear more more like a real robot. It might not seem like anything, but if you think about it, I at least, found that to be quite amazing. What made him think of such a thing? I definitely didn't notice this while I watched it, but I wasn't looking for it either. It might make it worth re-watching just to see this strange, but cool feat. One of the highlights here was without a doubt his robotic teddy bear \\"Teddy\\" I know it was nothing but a computer generated character, but the way it moved, talked and acted was darn cool. It had me wondering when our world will see such an advanced toy :)<br />Overall I slightly enjoyed the movie, but it just never came together like I had hoped. It's a shame because the premise here could have been something incredible, but sadly what we got was an over-FX'ed, drawn out movie that tried to do everything. As the saying goes this movie is \\"a jack of all trades, master of none\\"
B00005UEAR|5.0|First off, I'm sick of people saying that its not like \\"Images and Words\\", or like \\"Awake\\".....NO KIDDIN!!! Do you really think that they would put the same material out album after album???? Get with it!!!!Those are GREAT albums, and this is just another \\"MASPERPIECE\\" that DT has put out! Very powerful!! I was blown away the very first time I heard it!!!  This is a \\"MUST HAVE\\" in your collection! Keep up the great work guys!!!!
B000003TAW|4.0|I'm confused. I don't know if I'm revieiwng the green album or the blue album. Let's pretend it's the blue album. It's a good cd. With that said I feel i should mention Pinkerton, because i don't feel like typing out another review. Pinkerton is also a good cd.Buy them both.
B00004TWZF|3.0|This is one of the best cinematographed movies ever. When it comes to the plot it has some difficulties but overall this is a great movie and the DVD has decent extramaterial where the isolated score is the biggest extra.
B0000035E7|5.0|okay, so I'd give 5 stars to all of Nirvana's cd's but I'm only reviewing this one. Right, so this is their greatest cd ever. This is some really raw hard hitting stuff. Nevermind was just sort of out there, it was a good cd but did not compare to Bleach in any form or fashion. Buy this cd.Now.
B00001SIES|5.0|Sadly this great debut album will never be reconised for the ground breaking sound it gives. With all mainstream pop artists giving exactly the same [stuff] put with 1 or 2 \\"catchy\\"<BR>tunes per album it seems kinda sad that Muse have to be kicked down for having a hint of RH in their sound. Maybe the Radiohead fans are just a little bit irritated that a band with sharp vocals and crispy overdrive have made a album that is far better then RH's Debut and if not for all the bad publicity could give The Bends a real run for it's money. As it is you are just going to have to take my word for it and give the album the chance it deserves. My fav song is Unintended which is just about the most beautiful song I have ever heard completely smashing any pop \\"love\\" song to ground. Showbis took a little time to get to like but now it is a close second because of the fantastic high notes Matt reaches the gasping prepares you for the amazingly painful vocals with a just so much better then anyything RH ever did. If you into beautiful and emotional songs then this is the perfect album. But if you can't get over your pride about RH then take a look at Muse's second album with is very different but possibly better the Showbis. Enjoy
B00000AFWW|2.0|Oh my God! Sure am glad I didn't buy this cd! Whew, that was close. So really the songs weren't all that bad, but i'm not really into pop rock. Anymore. I would have liked this cd like two years ago. Oh well lets see uh, Petals, Northern Star and Playing your song are good songs. Malibu and Celebrity Skin are mediocre. The rest are bad. Except for &quot;Awful&quot;. That song was grotesque and painful to hear. I wish I had never encountered that song. It is, ironically enough, an awful song. I have strong personal feelings about it. It's just so ugly! What was Hole thinking? They just made all these great albums and then went and made Cebrity skin. This cd just should not have happened. Ever.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|When I saw the previews for the Moulin Rouge movie i had mixed feelings of whether or not I would actually like it. I ended up not seeing it at all. When Lady Marmalade came out I loved the song. Everyone of my friends and I would sing it all day long. Everyone I talked to said the movie was great. Some even went to go see it more then once. So, when it cameo ut on DVD I went over my friends house and we watched it. Well let me tell you...It was wonderfull! I went home, bought the movie, and watched it over and over again. More then anything I loved the movie because of the songs. I instantly fell in love with Come what May. So naturally, i bought the cd. I listened to it everyday, and still do. If you don't own this cd, you missing out on somthing great. There is somthing in it for everyone. Please, rush out and get it. I promise you won't regret it.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Altman followers will have no trouble seeing in \\"Gosford Park\\" the auteur's favorite themes and devices--a preoccupation with time and place over \\"story,\\" an intersecting repertory of actors whose various characters are subtly and gradually disclosed through their interaction, protracted shots with significant visual information planted in all corners of the screen, an audio track characterized by overlapping dialogue and multiple conversations.  Add to all this Altman's respect for actors who contribute their own ideas to the script and his ability to seize and incorporate the serendipitous, and the results can be purely exhilarating cinema.  At its best (\\"Nashville\\"), Altman's approach produces films that imitate and criticize life like few others, evoking spinetingling epiphanies during the film experience and indelible memories afterwards.  At its worst (\\"Ready to Wear,\\" \\"Kansas City\\") the results are little more than tedious, meaningless exercises in cinematic self-indulgence.<br />What distinguishes \\"Gosford Park\\" from much of Altman's previous work is the director's exercising of a much firmer hand over the proceedings.  Altman usually eschews film scores, preferring to go with source music (\\"Nashville\\") or no music at all.  \\"Gosford Park,\\" on the other hand, is a heavily scored movie, a device that insures narrative form and plot continuity not to mention a \\"melodramatic\\" heightening of emotion felt by both characters and spectator.<br />To describe the film as a satire on the crumbling of residual, anachronistic aristocratic values and class distinctions in the 20th century is to do it injustice.  True, Altman uses social distinctions, new  vs. old money, master vs. servant class, Hollywood actors who play roles for a living vs. the served and servants who live because of their roles.  And he throws in stereotypes of plot and character that somehow work--enlivening the proceedings while drawing both the satire and more subtle characterizations into sharper focus.<br />But Altman's satire on class, British culture, and literary and film genres themselves are all merely vehicles for his exploration of characters, of their dreams and desires, and above all the consequences of repressed and thwarted desire.  If there's a flaw in the film, it's Altman's failure to bring out the degree to which even the most \\"liberated\\" of characters fall prey to their freedom.  \\"Gosford Park\\" leaves us with the picture of a servant class making touch with its own feelings, daring to imagine a life of expressed desires and personal happiness as a consequence.  Only the stinging depiction and indictment of the ruling class carry any hint that personal freedom has its own liabilities.<br />\\"Gosford Park\\" is not the epiphany that \\"Nashville\\" is, but it's a brilliant cinematic house of mirrors, casting reflections and meanings that can only multiply upon repeated viewings.focus.<br />But Altman's satire on class, British culture, and literary and film genres themselves are all merely vehicles for his exploration of characters, of their dreams and desires, and above all the consequences of repressed and thwarted desire.

0425170349|2.0|It doesn't seem possible that Tom Clancy wrote this book.  The characters have no depth (John Clark and Domingo Chavez don't even resemble the same characters from the Jack Ryan series), the socio-political elements are one-dimensional and the book is filled with jargon and idiomatic expressions that Clancy never uses.<br />I've just finished reading non-stop 5 Clancy books, starting with the &quot;Bear &amp; the Dragon&quot;, and then reading in order from &quot;Clear &amp; Present Danger&quot; through &quot;Executive Orders&quot;.   Each of these books were addictive and provided insights on a wide variety of levels.   You could get into the minds of the characters and understand their multi-dimensions.<br />I'm having trouble finishing &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; as the characters and plot are so superficial.<br />Hopefully &quot;Rainbox Six&quot; was written by a ghost writer!
B00005JKYS|5.0|Okay. You have to read this before seeing we were soldiers.It is about the Vietnamese war, and Mel Gibson is Colonel Hal Moore.If you're soft hearted, or soft shelled, don't see this movie. You'll cry the whole way through.The effects are so realistic, I felt as if I was in a real war, with real guns firing at me.I was watching a program about it on the history channel, and they asked if it was history, or Hollywood.Well let me tell you something. It was ALL history. They used real guns (no bullets),and they really added some emotinal scenes to it that could make you cry your eyes out.BUT-if you like war movies, SEE THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Set aside Saving Private Ryan, and Pearl Harbor, and Hart's War.See We Were Soldiers NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!
0316236446|5.0|This is a great book for first time drawers, or doodlers of any age. I use this to conduct art classes in cub scouts. I always enjoyed making very tiny drawings in the borders of my notebooks at school, and later as an adult I find myself still doodling during meetings.  This book is for those of us who love to doodle. It shows you how to make the coolest little drawings of everything!  There are hundreds of people, buildings, vehicles, boats, and animals to draw.  And for learning how to draw, there is no better place to start than Ed Emberly!  In addition to this book he has the best series of books for learning to draw called \\"Ed Emberl's Big Green Drawing Book\\" and he has orange, red, and purple too. He also has the books on specialized items like trains, or animals, but the big books pretty much cover it all along with this one. A perfect set of books for the young artist.<br /><br />(When these books have been learned, and your artist is thinking of improving their skills they can try Mark Kistler's book next, then move on to books by Jack Hamm if they want to become a real artist someday.)<br /><br />As an adult, I still love this book.  I love it more now that it makes my son so happy that he can draw such neat things as castles, with dragons and knights in 2 minutes! A 5 year old or younger can easily draw many of the items in this book, as well as an doodle fan of any age. I give this my highest reccommendation!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Some people have called this a terrible movie, but I think it was wonderful, if you attack it with the right mindset.  This is a fun, romantic movie.  The music is done in an excellent manner - while the movie is set in the early 1900's, music from the 1970's to the present is used. And how it is used is the best part - whoever had the work of tying the songs together did a remarkable job.  Elton John's Your Song is the first part of the love songs, and it made me cry the first time I saw it!  That was always a favorite of mine, but the way it was woven into the story, and sung by Ewan and Nicole is simply breathtaking!  The Elephant Medley is awesome - taking a half dozen songs or so and making a fun, romantic, playful time for Ewan and Nicole, bounding around the top of a house shaped like a giant elephant (told you it wasn't supposed to be serious!) - it made me laugh and cry at the same time.  Watch the movie - you may or may not like it, but watch it to have a good time, and you'll be pleased with the results.  Don't watch if you are expecting a serious romance, or typical comedy.  Remember when Tommy first hit as a movie?  People had a hard time understanding it as well; it could only be enjoyed in the right frame of mind.  This is much, MUCH better, but you need the right attitude to enjoy it best.
B00003CXRP|3.0|good movie the first time but after having to watch it 4 times it gets kinda boring.  the movie is very long and some times very tedious.  It actually deserves more like a 3 1/2
B00005ALNI|5.0|A group of old college friends gathers for a weekend together after attending the funeral of one in their group. The member who died happened to be the idealist of the old gang and he committed suicide. His death forces the others to look at their lives and examine their own shattered dreams, false illusions, and struggles with reality. The movie has a great cast (Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Tom Berenger), but Jeff Goldblum steals every scene he's in. Also, the script is full of fun, memorable dialogue. You've got to believe!
B00005YTFG|5.0|When I saw previews for the movie, I said that I would never want to see this movie. My friend had the cd before the movie came out and I loved it.  So that led me to see the movie and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  As soon as the movie was over, I wanted to see it again and could not wait until it came out on video!  (of couse that took forever) This is also when I discovered Ewan Mcgregor, who is now my favorite actor, not to mention he's a hottie!  (especially in this movie)  When my boyfriend saw this for the first time on dvd, he didn't like it.  But after watching it more than once, it's his favorite movie also!  My advice, watch it more than once to get a feel for it!
B00004W5UA|4.0|This film was beautifully shot. The acting was superb; Ed Norton and Brad Pitt make a dynamic duo. However, this movie is not something that everyone will enjoy. The film is rather interesting and quite intriguing, though the issues the film raises are nothing new (anyone read Plato anymore; the movie reminded me a lot of stuff from THE REPUBLIC). There are a lot of fairly graphic hand to hand fight scenes, lots of language, and some sexual images as well. The movie is definitely not for everyone, and not just because of the above mentioned reasons. It's just a strange movie. Intriguing, but strange.
B00003CXSP|1.0|well, the long awaited sequel to silence... The Media was hyped, I got Hyped, the movie was banned from italian cinema.. wow this must be something.. however it was NOT! this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever.. it was just boring, there were a couple good moments but nothing horrible or terrifying
6305537798|5.0|I loved this movie, it was great.  I recommend you add it to your video library if you don't have it!
1587990717|4.0|I am a trader myself, and ran into this book as, ironically, a lucky coincidence: I happened to read the emerging markets chapter as a draft that was getting emailed around the office, and enjoyed it so much i purchased the rest of the book...<br />I found the book to be well written, opinionated and with some great ideas that frankly are hard to argue against. His book, at the core, is about the problem of induction. Statistics, for how useful they may be day to day, certainly do not solve this problem, and indeed, luck and skill are hard to differentiate in the markets. <br />He exposes a problem of a philosophical nature, and he is certainly not suggesting to drop all induced laws and redefine a day to day life full of uncertainty and incapable of establishing practical rules.<br />This book is not meant to be a textbook so i am not sure why Taleb's flair as a writer is getting attacked so repeatedly here. I think his writing style is elegant, amusing and smooth. This book is about opinion, so accusing him of having an opinion seems a misplaced objection. Also, i believe his writing is being somewhat misinterpreted. While there is an undertone of arrogance, it is self mocking. He does not claim to know better. His only, somewhat socratic claim is that he at least knows he does not know...I am surrounded by arrogance at work, and i can tell you, Taleb's ain't so!
B00003CXXP|2.0|Yes, just like my reviews title. The storyline for this movie ..is almost interesting.. (just almost). The scene was set in the future and the story is about a cute robotic boy who was trying to be a real humam.. He believed if he's a real boy, his mommy (actually was a person he was programmed to love ) would love him in return.. So he's searching for a blue fairy who he believed can make his dream come true.. At the very end, the hero turned out to be a group of high-tech futured creatures... Well, the story can't really make you feel anything and now and then, it made you wonder why it didn't come to an end yet... Anyway, good special effect though..specially the nanny robot and Jude Law's robotic play boy..  So if you really want to see this movie, rent it.. only if you're Spielberg fanatic, then you can buy it..
0440219078|4.0|i had to read a few of the anastasia books for a class.  i'll be kind and say they were not to good (they [stunk]!!) i was reluctant to read another lowry book after that.  is the author of the giver the same lois lowry?? lol of course it is and this book shows her talent as a writer.  it's very provocative and quite scary as well.  it's a story that sticks with you long after you read it.  i loved it.  why not 5 stars? i had to take one off because of the torcher the anastasia books put me through. lol
0345448898|5.0|One of my friends suggested this book to me because I told him I wanted a book like Harry Potter but a little more. After I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down. After I finished the Golden Compass I just HAD to read the other two. These books will make you laugh and cry. My personal favorite, the Amber Spyglass, was truly breathtaking! Even though these are one of my favorite books I wouldn't recommend any of Pullman's other books. I'm 12 and I would recommend this to people 11 and up because of the way Pullman \\"graphics\\" some of his scenes. I felt sick at times.Well, I don't think I would even be reading without these books. I would hate it if I went through life without reading this. I felt like a changed person hen I finished this series
B00005Y228|4.0|Everywhere else but the US, this pint-sized divette is a single-name superstar; mention \\"KYLIE,\\" in London, Sydney, Paris, or Tokyo, and a million men will fall breathless at your feet (either with lust or envy over her latest spangly costume).<br />Now, fourteen years since her last US pop hit (\\"It's No Secret\\"), The Divine Miss M is back with a vengeance. \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" is undoubtedly one of the most irresistible pop confections of this or any year. It's easily the centerpiece of the \\"Fever\\" album, but there are more goodies to be found here: \\"In Your Eyes\\" (the second European single), \\"Love at First Sight,\\" \\"Your Love,\\" \\"More More More,\\" \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Give it to Me\\" are all single-worthy as well.<br />If Kylie has sufficiently rocked your world, her back catalogue is well worth exploring. \\"Light Years\\" (2000) is pure disco camp, and even more fun than \\"Fever\\"--how can you resist a quasi-Village People stomper called \\"Your Disco Needs You\\"? (If you can, then proceed to the \\"Headbanger\\" section of your local CD emporium, do not pass Go, and do not collect $200.)<br />Her eponymous 1994 album is perhaps her most mature and diverse to date, featuring the moodily lush \\"Confide in Me,\\" the glamorous main room house of \\"Where is the Feeling,\\" the STUNNING ballad \\"Dangerous Game\\" and a slew of other goodies.<br />And, of course, \\"Greatest Hits\\" (1992) covering Kyles' PWL years is absolutely ESSENTIAL for anyone interested in pop perfection. \\"Better the Devil You Know.\\" \\"Step Back in Time.\\" \\"What Do I Have to Do.\\" \\"Shocked.\\" \\"Never Too Late.\\" \\"Hand on Your Heart.\\" \\"Especially for You.\\" \\"I Should Be So Lucky.\\" All are guaranteed to make you a happier, shinier person if played once a day.<br />As will \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" and the rest of the spiky, electro-pop contained on \\"Fever.\\" That so much fabulousness can be contained on a tiny silver disc isn't so strange when one considers that, out of her kitten heels, La Minogue stands a mere 5'1\\".<br />But she's still The Undisputed Queen of Pop.<br />Kylie...THIS Americano has loved you from day one. Welcome back!<br />P.S. 1 star deducted for not including \\"Harmony,\\" \\"Tightrope\\" or \\"Good Like That\\"...hunt them down on the import singles of \\"In Your Eyes\\"...<br />But she's still The Undisputed Queen of Pop.<br />Kylie...THIS Americano has loved you from day one.

B000000OE7|5.0|Obviously, any work made with Freddie Mercury's singing released posthumously will have a certain amount of wistfulness, but Mercury sung his tracks knowing he was dying. He would call in the middle of the night when he felt like singing.<br />The aching poignancy is added by the selected and nature of the songs, especially those like \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\", \\"Made In Heaven\\", \\"Too Much Love Can Kill You\\" and especially \\"A Winter's Tale\\". Even if you're not a Queen fan, this is a must-own - and arguably Queen's best album, even surpassing A Night At The Opera and News of the World, among others.
B00005QIPH|1.0|The most over rated cd in recent memory. Boring, repetive, drab. Wish we got to see more of the naked [girl] on the cover.(Cover refers to import edition of the cd).
B00003Q43A|2.0|A charismatic Will Smith and a boring, bland Bill Pullman take on world-destroying aliens in this crowd-pleasing, brain-draining disaster flick from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, who'd go on to make the even worse \\"Godzilla.\\"  More subtle than \\"Armageddon,\\" and twice as funny as \\"Mars Attacks,\\" this baby features the largest collection of stereotyped characters since Irwin Allen released \\"Earthquake\\" in Sensurround.<BR><br />Honestly, Smith is the best thing about this movie; he proves he has the big-screen presence to carry a film.  Or maybe he comes off so well because all the other characters are papier-mache, or something like that.  Jeff Goldblum plays... well, Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch despoils his formerly decent film career as Goldblum's Jewish Dad (he wouldn't be out of place in a 1930's radio show).  Then there's Harvey Fierstein as the Funny Gay Guy, and Harry Connick, Jr. as the Doomed Best Friend, and Mary McDonnell as the Saintly First Lady.  Factor in Randy Quaid as the comic-relief Crazy Guy and couple of Cute Kids with mooncalf eyes.  Somewhere in there we get strippers, a marital reconciliation, a wedding and a computer virus, plus a lot of heartfelt moments carefully lifted from better movies.  And explosions, explosions, explosions.<BR><br />This is one of those movies where unheralded billions die in spectacular SFX fireballs and CGI imagery, but a dog gets a slow motion leap to safety.  Granted, the effects are sharp and the battle scenes are truly massive.  But as long as the dog survives, why should we care about any of the people?<BR><br />This DVD release features a pristine widescreen print and tons of extras so you can get the full, empty \\"ID4\\" experience.  Actually, you might have more fun playing with the special features and just avoiding the movie altogether.  It's big, loud and silly.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I don't see how anyone can call this a good movie.  The movie spends all it's time trying to shock you.  Geez, I can get that out of any second rate slasher film.  For your time and money you get the following:  Man hacking off flesh from face and feeding it to his dog, a horribly disfigured millionaire, a disembowlment, routine shootout, throats being slashed, fried brains, leftover fried brains, hand being hacked off, man eating boars, and the unforegettible knife in the crotch.  And they don't stop there.  It seems every five minutes they are showing that grotesque millionaire's face on the screen.  The only hint of imaginatation of the filmakers was spent on gory and bloody images.  Agent Starling is almost a secondary character spending much of the film sitting in an office.   <BR>The thing that made Silence of the Lambs a good movie was the psychological battle that went on between Starling and Lecter.  You don't get any mental chess game in this trash.  All you get is gore gore and more gore.  I don't mind gore, if it applies to the plot.  Saving Private Ryan had alot of gore, but it had a purpose.  It was trying to show the horrors of war.  This movie had no purpose.  Like many other movies, it is a bad movie that hides behind special effects, gore and violence.  And given it's popularity, there are many undemanding moviegoers out there for sure.  My advice, just rent/buy Texas Chainsaw massacre.
0425170349|5.0|This may sound wierd, but I played the game Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear which then motivated me to read this book. But I must admit, the book is more exciting than the game itself.<br />What I admire most about this book is the way Clancy placed the character. How he describe each one. So it sort of displays a mini-biography of each character. Some the character's features aren't even related to their jobs. So I wouldn't say there is an EXACT main character. Each part of the story seem to tell a lot about them. Some humor, some action, and some tragic. This book was long enough to satisfiy this story. There was only one small thing that I didn't like (which doesn't really matter but I'll say anyways) is how he put a certian part of the story somewhere in the beginning, and let it out at the end. Sometimes I had to reread a part in order for it to make since. <br />Overall, I recommend this book to anyone which will not be offended by certian words.
6304457391|4.0|This is quite possibly the best movie about the cold war ever made.  It is not only intelligent but makes the argument that whether or not you disagree with the president's policies...he is still the one in charge!  It is &quot;we, the people&quot; who decides the fate of their elected officials and not a single group of individuals.  I often thought this movie has a particular insight into the Kennedy assasination, but who can tell?  Both Douglas and Lancaster give excellent, believable performances as career military officers who place duty, honor and country as their chief priorities. Unfortunately, Lancaster takes it much too far and believes that he has a divine right to circumvent the Constitution.
B00005RFAI|5.0|For all those people out there that think that Pink was too outspoken or needed to be censored on this album, I completely disagree.  This is a great CD that I listen to every day.  This first single was good, but the second one is great.  I like the way that Pink sets herself apart from the bubble gum pop stars........&quot;tired of being compared, to damn britney spears, she's so pretty, that just ain't me.&quot;  Setting herself apart and letting people know how she feels about herself is extremely commendable.  I like the fact that she lets a little bit of her personal life and the things that she has gone through come out in her music.  I applaud her for having a way to convey her feelings.  Most people hold them inside with no release.  I love this CD and I think a lot of people will too.
B000002UA7|5.0|An excellent compilation and a superb introduction to Kate's songs. The only down side is that it only goes as far as The Hounds Of Love album, and therefore does not include anything from The Sensual World, such as her breathtaking classic, This Woman's Work. For what it is, and the time period it covers, it cannot be faulted, and is definitely well worth the money. Enjoy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|For anyone who has not heard anything of this record. Or even heard any music from Radiohead. You will not be disappointed if you get this album for yourself. Another musical odyssey that stands as one of the best albums of the 90's and one of the best ever.<br />It starts off with &quot;Airbag&quot; which really gets this album started. This is one of the coolest starts to an album ever. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; takes you through high and low vocals and through slow and fast rythyms a song not to be missed. &quot;Exit Music(for a Film)&quot; is a great slow song that appears on the new Romeo &amp; Juliet movie with DiCapprio and Danes. It's cool. &quot;Karma Police&quot; by itself is the best song on the disc. And it's very nicely put together by the guys. &quot;Electrionnering&quot; is another great song that delights in many ways. Especially with some nice guitar work here. &quot;No Suprises&quot; is another slow type song that musically is simple, but yet captivates you at the same time. &quot;The Tourist&quot; is an appropiate and fitting conclusion to the album. The best way to listen to this album though is from start to finish with no interuptions. It provides the best listening experience this way. There is one minor complaint about this cd, and it is that the second half I think is not as powerful as the first half is. It stands stands great, but it almost takes away from the start of the album.<br />By the way, if you like Radiohead let me recommend a band that is a little less known than them, but sounds a lot like them at times. The band is called Delirious?(the question mark is part of their name) They are a really good band. Check them out, and buy OK computer today.
0062502182|1.0|Sure, life is tough, and we all welcome some advice on how to live it better. But ANY advice? Beware! This book will lull you in a false sense of revelation. It's a story so sweetly told you will tend to forgive its annoying repetitions and feel you have seen the light.<br />Far from it. Yes, it's alright to `follow your dream', as the book espouses. But that can't be the meaning of life?... What about `love the ones close to you'?... In the book the hero, a boy shepherd from Spain, leaves the girl he has fallen in love with to pursue his quest of finding a treasure in Egypt... Some moral, especially from a book that purportedly extols spirituality!<br />But this fixation on following one's dream to the end (Hitler had a dream too) is not the sole flaw of this shamefully acclaimed book. The author's blatant rip-off of Arabian Nights and The Little Prince is the base insult. Another is his attempt to treat us like fools by claiming in the most nonchalant terms that we should take alchemy seriously. A nonsensical prologue that has no connection whatsoever to the rest of the book is yet another. And so is a maddening notion of fatality prevailing throughout. This is by no means an exhaustive list.<br />The people who made this required reading in a number of US educational Institutions ought to be dismissed. Dear reader, please, do yourself a favour and steer clear of this inconsequential book. But, if, like me, you have fallen prey to well-meaning folk and read it, THINK before succumbing to its lure. Surely, you deserve better.
068484267X|5.0|What really sets Mr. McCourt's story apart from any other memoir, or the rather dramatic (and appalling) childhood he led - what really sets it all above the rest, is simply the style.  The lack of punctuation, the run-on sentences, no quotation marks; all give us a truly genuine sense of his thought processes and the swirling madness that was around him.  I felt miserable at times, particularly at any point involving going to the restroom in a little hovel outside the McCourt home.  Not that it will change anything, but Americans need this kind of literature more than anyone else.  We have it so easy, and that is so rarely the case elsewhere.
B00001PE4D|5.0|i admit im a teenager but my views are strong on this movie. everybody except people that like those arthouse films will likely like this. my friend bought it over one day and i loved it.  absolutely loved it. it starts off with ryan phillipe and sarah michelle gellar making a bet that he cant get the headmasters daughter in bed. the only part i didnt like was the end.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is an extravaganza of sight and sound and frenetic action.  An effort, or so we are told, to bring the musical, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, this work relies on sleight of hand, action and technical wizardry to ensnare and captivate the audience.<br />On the whole, it works.  Critical supporting elements are in place to a sufficient degree to allow this experiment to succeed.  There is a base story, and, if it is not exactly intellectually stimulating, neither is it overly embarrassing (a phenomenon not unknown in the musical format).  Moreover, it is emotionally accessible, at least sufficient to the needs.  The stars are attractive, compelling and engaged-they have obviously bought into the concept and are quite visibly giving it their all here.  And the set and costumes are beguiling.<br />The deficiencies in the film are directorial and post-production related.  There is too much outright emotional manipulation related solely to change in action-frenetic action and excessive sensory stimulation cutting abruptly to dark, quiet, bleak desperation.  A bit of that is OK-it's a device seriously overused here. There are also editing issues-at times one suspects that film was randomly chopped up by scissors and then randomly spliced back together.  To say it's uneven is to understate the situation.<br />Those may seem somewhat cosmetic issues, but in what amounts to a cosmetic exercise, the effects are amplified.<br />On the whole this reminds me of some of Robert Altman's efforts prior to MASH and Nashville.  The talent shows through, the concept is valid, the technology works-yet the whole thing has not quite come together into a unified whole.  <br />On the bright side, this film has achieved such a level of commercial and critical success it's likely that the time and money is bound to be invested in making the concept and technology achieve what quite clearly would be a wonderful entertainment experience.  I look forward to seeing it.  <br />In the meantime, Moulin Rouge will certainly whet ones appetite.
8186939008|4.0|God of small things is a brilliantly crafted novel that combines scintillating prose with a devastating commentary on the state of Indian society. The author, however, in my estimation, takes on too much in one bite, and her critique of the culture, while it strikes true, leaves a bitter after taste...there is no redemption or goodness that one can draw upon in the end.  The novel left me feeling that things were hopeless. It is true that the very power of the novel lies in the devastating criticism of a society mired in senseless tradition, but I was left with the feeling that the author used every tool at hand to shock and disgust rather than understand.
0679731377|5.0|I'm not quite sure exactly what universe it is that Julien Barnes inhabits, but I must say that it is an unusually interesting place to visit.  Having been blown away by another of the authors books-Flaubert's Parrot-I decided to try another of his novels to see if the substance and style of that books could be repeated.<br />It turns out repetition is not one of Mr. Barnes apparent life goals.  In The History of the World in 10 ½ Chapters Mr. Barnes once again blows me away in a manner absolutely at odds with, but just as mesmerizing, as Flaubert's Parrot.<br />If Barnes has one unifying aspect to his novels it's that he can take the arcane  and use it as a window to the world.  In Flaubert's Parrot, the oddity of the  parrot became a metaphor for the oddity that was Flaubert.  In History of the World, Mr..Barnes latches onto an array of arcane and esoteric symbols to both analyze an historical epoch while concomitantly questioning the validity of historical analysis, within various arenas,  itself.  It's a nifty trick, an enlightening exercise, an entertaining expedition of epic proportions.<br />One of the particularly interesting elements of Barnes style is his ability to tackle \\"heavy\\" topics in a straightforward, serious yet light-handed manner that allows for the flow of the ideas, the flow of the text, and the flow of the story (or, in this case, stories) to march on without getting bogged down.<br />The man possesses a highly inventive and creative mind, a very off beat view of the world, an admirable craftsmanship with language and a very dry, very British tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.  It all adds up to a splendid reading experience.<br />This is a truly novel novel!
8186939008|4.0|God of small things is a brilliantly crafted novel that combines scintillating prose with a devastating commentary on the state of Indian society. The author, however, in my estimation, takes on too much in one bite, and her critique of the culture, while it strikes true, leaves a bitter after taste...there is no redemption or goodness that one can draw upon in the end.  The novel left me feeling that things were hopeless. It is true that the very power of the novel lies in the devastating criticism of a society mired in senseless tradition, but I was left with the feeling that the author used every tool at hand to shock and disgust rather than understand.

B00003CX8J|4.0|With most DVD's like this, the movie makes up for any shortcomings of the DVD extras.  This is not the case here.  The DVD extras will fill the new viewer into a lot of the X-Men lore.  While the movie could've been done a lot better, the extras save it from being a 3 star purchase.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Van Halen, but this cd is amazing! This was one of the cds that made me want to play guitar. Eddie is an amazing guitar player, but this isn't only for guitar players. Altough i think that if you don't play guitar, 1984 is probably a better cd. Anyways, back to this one. This was their debut, and in my opinion their best album. It starts off with Running With the Devil, a great opener, and a great song. Then comes Eruption. This blew my mind the first time i heard it. It's about a minute and a half of classic Eddie Van Halen riffs. Next is a cover of You Really Got Me, I forget who it's originally by, but i like Van Halen's version better anyway. Ain't Talkin Bout Love is another great song. I'm the One has some of the best riffs on the whole album. the bad news is, this album gets a little boring after this. With the exception of the last two songs(which are amazing!!!) the second half is just average.
B00005OCMR|4.0|... computers actually worked the way they do in TRON. Then again, the social and labour law implications might be rather daunting. Watching TRON as a child was enthralling and led to many a frisbee-tossing session on the lawn. This was a film which managed to ride the leading edge of the technological wave, before computers became ubiquitous and turned into furniture. Where the film succeeds is not in terms of its plot, which is appropriately as thin as that of any video game, but in the overall design and feel of the piece. The cast is splendid, with David Warner putting in an especially good performance as both the villainous executive Dillinger and his murderous computer counterpart, Bruce Boxleitner managing to keep the Boy Scout-like TRON interesting, and Jeff Bridges almost casually showing why he is such a tremendous actor (in that he doesn't seem to be acting). After twenty years any movie is going to seem a little frayed and creaky, but remarkably the most dated parts of TRON are those taking part in the real rather than the computer world. For interested fans (which is all of us) the additional material is excellently presented and even die-hard obsessives may well find a few new snippets in there to keep them amused. Newcomers to the film will find that the interviews and technical features help to put the film into context and explain why it has so many loyal devotees. The deleted scenes are interesting, particularly as the director gives his reasons for removing them. There are only really two here and a good case could have been made for keeping them, but the inclusion of the Light Cycle battle with Wendy Carlos' original music behind it is very instructive, as the version in the final cut, sans music, is far better. Too many DVDs have additional material tacked on, but here it is done properly and genuinely adds something... and there is a lot of extra viewing, making this two disc set excellent value. TRON was never a typical Disney film (thank goodness) and the interviews explain why. Whether reacquainting yourself with an old friend or simply looking to see what all the fuss was about, this anniversary edition will earn its place on your shelf.

0060934913|5.0|Bourdain explains that he's trying to write a book like the stories he'd tell you late at night after a few drinks.  About what restaurants are really like and how chefs really talk and think. And that's exactly what he does.  The book's crude, rambling, ego-centric, drug-addled, downmarket, egotistical, depressing, downright scary, and obnoxious, but also insightful, upmarket, generous, upbeat, and ultimately uplifting.  Bourdain may be annoying, but he knows he's annoying, and not only doesn't care, but uses the tone to good effect. This feels like the straight story, at least in part because Bourdain isn't concerned with making himself the hero of every story.<br />I particularly appreciated the author's soul searching on how he got where he is rather than becoming a world class chef, which he claims not to be. He attributes it to taking head chef jobs rather than learning more from masters early in his career.  The education and apprenticeship theme is played up as the focus of both Ruhlman's \\"The Making of a Chef\\" and Dornenburg and Page's \\"Becoming a Chef\\".  Although this is not corner diner food, in a typical self-deprecating aside, Bourdain points out that it's really the shallots and monte au beurre that lend the professional taste.  <br />Bourdain's respect for food and cooking is evidenced most clearly in the reverential tones reserved for Scott Bryan of Veritas (in New York).  He begins the chapter by asking the reader to forget everything they've read up to this point and to look at Veritas, where you can tell how good they are from the spotless side towels, the shallot brunoise in the mise en place, and the fact that everything is prepared a la minute.  <br />Although just about every aspect of running a restaurant is covered, I really appreciated the running discussion of creating menus and specials;  you realize every chef-owner is first and foremost a Garde Manger. <br />This book's strong medicine.  If you love food and need an antidote, try Ruth Reichl's autobiographically inspired \\"Tender at the Bone\\" which is as sweet as Bourdain's book is sour.

B00003CXXP|1.0|My wife and I had heard, from friends and family, that this movie wasn't very good but decided to rent it and see for ourselves.  As the title of this review states, we should have listened.  The only reason for 1 star is the great acting of Haley Osment, although I must admit that I kept waiting for him to say, &quot;I see dead people&quot;.  The movie is extremely slow (In fact, halfway through the movie my wife went to bed while I toughed it out through the end) and was basically Pinochio meets Terminator II........except Pleasure Island wasn't kids being turned into donkeys.  My wife and I kept looking at each other wondering when the movie was really going to start.<br />Do not waste your time (2.5 hours) nor your money on this movie, it is definitely not worth it.
0345403959|5.0|What a different view of the whole picture (Belgarath's the one telling the story, and so you get his hilarious point of view the whole way through)!  This book takes you back before the Belgariad even takes place, starting with Belgarath's childhood, and the earlier parts of his 7,000 year life.  This book has all of the things in the Belgariad and the Mallorean that you only briefly read about, such as the cracking of the world, Belgarath's story of becoming a desciple of Aldur, Zedar's treason, The meeting of Poledra and Belgarath, as well as many other stories that are finally revealed in all of their glory in this book.  This book is a definate buy for someone who has completed both the Mallorean and the Belgariad.  It also clears up a lot of confusion that you might have encountered throughout both the series. <br />WONDERFUL BOOK!
B00003CXQX|5.0|The Emperor's New Groove is such a funny movie!  I'm a college student and my friends and I love it.  The lines are hilarious and are very quotable.  I'm so glad that movies like this are made for all ages.
B00004XQ83|2.0|The idea is certainly an interesting one: A soundtrack featuring contemporary artists in authentic, &quot;old-timey&quot; renditions of old country and blues.  It's a fascinating idea, to be sure.  Someone should try it sometime.<br />Until this happens, we have the soundtrack CD to &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; which features mostly composed songs, from the Civil War period (&quot;Angel Band&quot;) to 1940's &quot;You Are My Sunshine.&quot;  This collection has gotten an enormous amount of hype in the media, yet it's hard to take it very seriously.  The barely-legible, aged-yellow-background liner notes, for example, claim that country music &quot;first flowered during the Depression,&quot; which is quite untrue.  By the most conservative estimate, country music appeared on sound recordings (and was selling well) as early as 1921.  Country fiddle recordings, in fact, were being made as early as 1910.  And the performances on this CD are anything but the authentic, period-sound renditions they are being touted as.  Alison Krauss, in particular, strays from any sound remotely associated with the Carter Family, or numerous other country duos, trios and quartets from the late 1920s through the 1940s.  Where, for example, comes the tradition of harmonizing a fourth below the tonic in two-part singing (&quot;Down To the River To Pray&quot;)?  And the first-inversion tonic heard on The Whites' &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side,&quot; to say nothing of the Countrypolitan slickness of the overall vocal sound, is one of many unauthenticities.  Third-above, second-tenor, songbook-style singing was the norm for the period this music purports to represent, and countless period recordings attest to this.  Lest these technical points seem fussy, believe me when I say they are essential to the overall sound.  The music contained herein conforms to a modern concept of &quot;old-timey,&quot; but, for the most part, the sound is more Nashville than North Carolina.<br />And what is going on with the composer credits?  Jefferson Hascall and European-trained William B. Bradbury's 1860 classic &quot;The Land of Beulah&quot; is credited to &quot;Traditional&quot; under the title &quot;Angel Band.&quot;  Bradbury, who wrote the music, is best-known for the tune material to &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; and &quot;The Solid Rock,&quot; among other classics.  And we witness Ada Blenkhorn and Howard Entwisle's 1899 &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side of Life&quot; being credited to A.P. Carter.  Certainly, the idea that &quot;America's music&quot; comes from the hills, that it is passed down through the oral tradition by banjo-playing relatives is more romantic than the reality of professionally composed tunes copyrighted in songbooks and hymnals.  But most of the songs here are not &quot;folk&quot; in any sense of the word.<br /><br />I am an enormous fan of genuine &quot;old-timey&quot; music but have little love for whatever this is.  It is well done, and it has every right to be what it is.  But it is not, to use the lamentable term, &quot;roots music.&quot;s going on with the composer credits?

B00000DGRX|5.0|I don't care if you owned the vinyl copy then bought the cassette,and then bought the first cd copy this is by far worth every penny you spend. The sound is amazing and everything you hoped for if you have a decent sound system. The remixes on disc two are the icing on the cake. Do not deprive yourself any longer and buy this cd.
0671027344|5.0|Let me just start out with a cliche, I was changed after reading this classic.  I consider it the optimy of coming-of-age books.  So few books can affect the reader on several levels but Chbosky accomlishes this with grace with the innocent anticts of high school freshman, Charlie.  If any part of you has ever felt like an outsider, an instant connection with Charlie is made.  It deals with the real complications of teenage life.  This book is truly unforgetable and a must read.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I had read some interesting reviews...and decided to buy this my first Robin Trower cd. Excellent. If you are into Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn this is for you. It is easy to see why Trower was compared to Hendrix and it is very obvious Trower must have been a big influence on SRV. This has some excellent Blues-Rock on board and played with a ton of style, with the guitar and feedback not attacking you like a sonic barrage. Although the bonus live tracks are ok they could have been left out and let the original remastered album stand on it's own or better yet made a two for one and added another previous release remastered. At any rate I will for sure be scouring the Trower catalogue for more gems.
0446310786|4.0|If you want a book with conflict and suspenseful situatios then To Kill a Mockingbird is the book for you.  There is mostly racial conflict and childhood problems that Scout and her brother encounter.  <br />I think the author is trying to show you how couragous Scout and other characters are throughout the book.  I love a book with diversity in a character and Scout is very diverse.  She can be caring and amazingly brave all at once.  She shows bravery when she dares to run up to the Radley house and touch it even after hearing all the stories about Boo Radley.  The suspense is at its greatest point when Scou gets stuck under the fence at the Radley house when her and her brother sneak to the house one evening.  The shows the suspense and excitement that the book has.<br />Throughout the book there are many different conflicts.  One of the major conflicts is between an innocent black man falsely accused for rape of a white woman.  He goes to trial and the jury is completely white, the judge is white, and Scout is the only oone that believes in him.  Also there is a conflict with Boo and the neighborhood kids, including Scout.  They're afraid of him because of all the rumors heard but none of them ore ture.  Boo turns out to be nice.<br />In conclusion, I liked the book.  I would recomned this novel to anyone because there are other aspects of the book besides good conflict and great suspense that help it fit my defintition of good literature.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a great book with diverse characters, an outstanding plot, and a controversal steeing.  I would definetly read it again.
0790744295|3.0|I hate bare DVDs. I want that on record right up front. This disc comes with a trailer and virtually nothing else in the way of extras and I hate that, knocking off at least one star right at the top.<br />That said, this is a cool movie for Stephen King fans or fans of the classic EC Horror comics. King, unabashedly a fan of those very books, uses a comic book framing sequence to tell five unrelated tales of horror with a dash of comedy thrown in as well. When else will you see Ed Harris, Ted Danson, Leslie Nielsen and Hal Holbrook together? Not to mention a sequence with King himself carrying an entire short film practically solo (and 20 years before Tom Hanks, I may add).<br />All of the stories would have felt perfectly in place in the pages of \\"The Crypt of Terror\\" or \\"The Vault of Horror,\\" and in fact those same comic books would later inspire the HBO series \\"Tales From the Crypt.\\"<br />If you're a fan of the Cryptkeeper and his ghoulish gifts, this flick can be viewed as an immediate predecessor -- check it out.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is an awesome album, further establishing radiohead as one of my favourite bands.  one thing that caught my attention is what a dark album this sounds.  the album art is cold and dark, yet it is an absolute beautiful album.  it's very different from their earlier, more rock-based albums, but it's a great change.  i personally enjoy ok computer better, but in a way i think kid a symbolizes something better in music.  the fact that radiohead can keep changing their music from pablohoney to the bends to ok computer to kid a is just amazing.  word of warning though: this music has very many electronic elements in it.  i am actually a big fan of electronic music so that may have biased my tastes in the album, but if you're expecting lots of guitars you may be disappointed.
B00005RFAI|5.0|You've got the tightest, smoothest mix of different music sounds that nobody can leave this album in the dust. Rock lovers will find about 60% of the tracks to be for them. There's fast rock, like &quot;Don't let me get me&quot; and &quot;numb&quot;, ballad rock (&quot;lonely girl&quot;) and so forth. Pop lovers will also find alot of tracks on here that will drive them crazy, and the catchy &quot;Get this party started&quot; is the main pop song. They will also like &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;Dear diary.&quot; There's also songs for the RnB crowd like &quot;Family portrait&quot; and &quot;M!ssundaztood.&quot; But be aware, this time Pink does more mature soul RnB rather than the pop RnB she covered on her first cd.
B00005RFAI|5.0|With this album, Pink takes another step away from her pop peers.  It's writing is meaningful, it's melodies catching, and it's style unnamable.  Undoubtedly the best song on the album is Misery, a duet with Steven Tyler.  It's down home blues is something I never would have thought Pink could do, but she pulls it off.  I think Pink will be with us for a long time, growing away from pop and becoming a great rocker.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This is an album that not only stands the test of time, but sounds better to me now than it did upon orignal release. It catches the ears of youngsters who were not even conceived when this first came out. Don't think about it any longer, just get it now; it's a &quot;best value&quot; for your time and money spent.
B00000IQC8|4.0|This is really one of those movies that you really have to see to believe.  Technically it's a cult classic, I am a little more skeptical.<br />As the title implies this movie is strickly about clerks at a New Jersey convience store and Rental Place.  It's about how they spend there day at work on a Saturday.  From there we meet ex-girlfriends, perverted old men, gum salesmen, Drug Dealers, and smokers galore.<br />It is really unusal, for one thing it's in black and white which really added to the tone, it made it better.  Also it's funney, but for whatever reason I was not laughing.  I could kind of relate to some of these clerks mostly because they deal with ideot customers, I have been there and anyone who has held a job at Fastfood, Convienvce, or rentals knows this as well.<br />Over all it's a cult hit because it mostly explains the truth, to an extent.
0792845730|5.0|This movie is quite violent.  It has a good story.  It is interesting to watch someone deal with being turned into a robot.  I like the stop-motion animation of the ED-209 robot.  It also has some interesting Christian symbolism.  There's some gross stuff like when the guy gets the toxic waste dumped on him and starts melting, and Verhoven likes to make things over-the-top bloody.
B00003CXI1|5.0|It was good to finally be able to see and understand fully about the Quidditch, doesn't matter how many times I've re read all the books, I still found it unbearably hard to get a grip on it, even though I got sea sick watching it. hehe, was still a great movie and perfectly tied into the book!! :)
0553573403|2.0|I ALMOST gave up on this book about halfway though. I was thinking to myself, \\"where is this book going?\\" Towards the end something DOES actually happen! Wow! I don't see how people can say WoT books are so boring then say this is great? There is so little action in this book, I truly believe there is more [harlets] and [intercourse] in this book then anything else. Believe me, this book isn't terrible, but if you don't read it, you're not missing all that much.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This c.d. was not as bad as I thought it would be from the cover. I listened to \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" at a record store, and didn't like it, so I didn't buy the c.d. But recently, I was at a friend's birthday, and she chose \\"Britney\\" to listen to. Listening through, I discovered it wasn't half bad.<BR> #1. I'm a Slave 4 U - This is my least favorite song on the cd. The groaning makes it sound like Britney is standing over a toilet throwing up.<BR> #2. Overprotected - A great song. This is a song you can just get up and dance to. It also has better lyrics than most of Brit's lyrics.<BR> #3. Lonely - A good attempt at R & B. This is also one of the songs in which Britney Spears shows off her songwriting skills.<BR> #4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman - A beautiful song. Reminiscent of Britney's old music, it is a truly gorgeous ballad, and Britney does a fabulous job on it, not going beyond her limitations.<BR> #5. Boys - This song is okay. It's certainly not a song Britney's young followers should listen to, but it's an okay song.<BR> #6. Anticipating - This is a good song. Sounds like a Spice Girls song, but the tone is completely Britney's.<BR> #7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll - I really like this song. It has a good beat to dance to, and like #4, doesn't go over Britney's limitations.<BR> #8. Cinderella - Kind of a boring song. There's not much to it. <BR> #9. Let Me Be - This is a pretty song, and goes back to Britney's old style of music. <BR> #10. Bombastic Love - This is a fairly good song, but it sounds a lot like Cinderella.<BR> #11. That's Where You Take Me - This song is really pretty. The lyrics are good, and the music is beautiful. Britney shows her talents well in this song.<BR> #12. What It's Like to Be Me - This song goes back to electrofunk, like #1, 3, and 5. Justin Timberlake is allowed to show off his songwriting talents in this song, and Britney sounds like she's having a great time recording it.<BR> This c.d. is not my favorite of Britney's; there are too many songs I don't like. But the songs I do like on \\"Britney\\" are far better than the ones I like on her previous two c.d's.
6304539258|5.0|Another great film from the STAR WARS TRILOGY, with adventure and great special effects.<BR>It starts when Luke Skywalker, a young boy who never remembered his mother, and believed his father is dead, finds two delightful droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO.  He fixes up some stuff on R2-D2, and then goes out into the ouskirts of his village.  There he is knocked out by the Sand People, but is rescued by the 'thought' dead Obei-Wan-Kenobi, or Ben Kenobi, as Luke calls him.  Obei-Wan tells Skywalker that he knew his father, and that he wanted Luke to own his blue lightsaber when he was old enough.  They suddenly find out that the Imperial Empire knows that they are there, and Luke races back to his village, only to find the worn skeletons of his uncle and aunt. The evil Darth Vader has sent some of his Imperial Troops down to Luke's planet, Tatooine.  After a close encounter with some of the troops, Obei-Wan leads the group to Han Solo and Chewbacca, the Wookie.  Just before they leave Tatooine, Han encounters Jabba the Hutt, for the money that he had to pay.  Soon they escape from Tatooine, and find out that Darth Vader has constructed the Death Star.  Before long they find Princess Leia captured by Darth Vader, and they fight their way toward her.  Obei-Wan goes his own way, and fights with Darth Vader face to face, with his lightsaber, but he dies, and Luke and the princess leave with Han Solo.  They go to their hidden base, and get X-Wings to take siege upon the dreaded Death Star.  Luke Skywalker gets a vision from Obei-Wan, and destroys the Death Star, and Darth Vader blasted away in space inside his Imbound Squadron, twirling around in circles from Luke's shot.  <BR> I like this movie for the great special effects in space, and for the cool fighting of lightsabers.  And so all of you out there, see this movie, it is good!
B00003CXXP|1.0|I saw this in the theater. Now I'll admit, I'm normally a pretty easilly entertained audience member, but this was terrible. I get angry just thinking about how bad it is. The plot dragged on forever and there was barely even a climax. I would have walked out, but I kept hoping it might change and suddenly be good. That time never came. I wish I could tell you there was one good part, but that would be lying! The whole thing [was terrible].

I think it is the beginning of Madonna's major stretch into artistry and relevancy - \\"Bedtime,\\" \\"Ray of Light,\\" & \\"Music\\" were the followups and she just keeps getting better & better. This is one exceptional album. Skip all the ...controversy about her silly book and concentrate on the music - SUPER! Such a conceptual winner! I love Madonna in every way, shape, and form and I think she has great integrity - this cd shows why she's a keeper - noone can top her. Don't pass it up.
0790729342|5.0|Post-Apocalyptic action thriller stars Mel Gibson as a loner who takes on a bloodthirsty road gang.  Very popular action film takes awhile to get moving, but once it does hang on to your seat!  The final car chase, a fifteen minute tour-de-force sequence, is the best of its kind in movie history.  Overall, this is exhilarating, top-notch entertainment.<BR>**** 1/2 out of *****
B00003CWOL|1.0|I saw this movie on a college chior tour and i heard that it was great, having seen Clerks and considered it a great movie, i had no doubts as to the quality of this flick.  Well i was wrong, let me tell you. This movie was a boring and vapid &quot;exploration&quot; of religion. It's crude humor was annoying, and the acting was not as good as Smith's previous films. This films takes shots at organized religion, and that's okay, but ,  Smith could have done a better job with the quality of the film.
B00005R2IS|3.0|Often cited as the one that started it all (Which could be reference towards the sequels, Gibson's successful career, or the numerous rip-offs), this low-budget actioner stars Mel Gibson as a cop pushed to the edge.  With its dark tone and brutal violence, this is probably the first movie of its kind to de-glamorize car chases.  Several such sequences are thrilling (Particularly the opening car chase, one of the better ones in film history) but well-crafted as it often is, the pace is snail-like, and the dialogue and scene transitions are sometimes rather silly.  Still a decent set-up for the superior sequels, though.
B000002IQW|5.0|This album from Bach and the boys is simply awesome, if you love hard rock, then this album is for you. I can honestly say that i have never heard a better singer (screamer?) than Sebastian Bach. His vocal ability is unbelieveable! he has incredible range, how he doesnt run out of breath on certain songs, \\"Darkened room\\" \\"quicksand jesus\\" is a mystery. Apart from that, the Music and songs are awesome ranging from the deep hard hitting songs, Darkened room, Wasted time and Quicksand jesus to the more \\"party anthems\\" of Monkey business (listen for bachs opening scream...awesome!) and Riot act. This is one of those albums that you can just listen to all the way through, no tracks to skip, just hard rocking all the way through (with a couple of ballads of course). Each member of the band is superb, excellent heavy riffs that will stay in your mind all day, awesome drumming from Rob Affuso and a cool base line throughout the album. In short this is one of the best hard rock albums ever created, right up alongside the likes of Guns n'roses, appetite for destruction and metallicas \\"black\\" album. if you havent got it......go get it now!!!!
079213690X|5.0|Mel Gibson stars as William Wallace, a Scotsman who leads his people in revolt against the conquering British.  Gibson's second directorial attempt is a towering achievement, with the bloody battle sequences and rousing speeches standing out.  Other outstanding accomplishments: James Horner's score is superb, Mel Gibson gives a powerful performance, and Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau are gorgeous beauties. A stirring epic that works on every level it aspires.

B0000509C4|3.0|Three tales of terror abound in this sequel to the popular original anthology.  They include a story about a statue coming to life, a group of teens stuck on a raft with something in the water picking them off, and a hitchhiker who just won't stay dead.  The first story is completely routine and lacking in any sense of menace or fun, but The Raft is a surprisingly scary segment (And the best of both Creepshows) and The Hitchhiker is pretty suspenseful, too.  Kinda cheesy at times, but this is an enjoyable anthology.
B00005JKED|3.0|First of all the acting performance of Denzel Washington is very good in this film, But that doesn't justify a good film. First of all they never give any proof that Denzel is actually a police officer. You never see him in uniform. You never see him going to the police station. So what's up with that?...!... This film is badly directed and written. Flat out! Denzel doesn't make it any better saying the \\"N\\" Word over and over again. What I kept asking myself is what was his motive for doing the stupid things he was doing in this film. I was embarrassed as an African American male watching this film. All he does is ride around in a car playing mister bad guy. Ethan Hawke had a couple of good scenes. The director did a bad job and the screenplay could've been better. Flat out. Now u see film isn't getting nominated for anything. Only Denzel's performance. Geezz.....
B00005JKYS|5.0|War in itself sucks but this war story was so beautifully told  by the soldiers, the wives and even the enemy's perspective.<BR>Mel Gibson, of course, carries the movie with the many expressions on his face.  Many times, he was just silent but you read all that you could from his expressions.   What an actor!  The supporting cast were all wonderful from Barry Pepper playing the journalist.  He too gave such a touching performance of the pain he felt.  The Sargent Major played by Sam Eiliot was great and the chopper pilot by Greg Kinnear was the best I've seen him play.  Madaline Stowe was beautiful in the part of his wife.  She showed the feelings of her love for her husband and what he had to do.  The action scenes were the best I've seen equal to \\"Private Ryan\\".  And, the musical score was so outstanding, the best yet, that it really touches you.  It's about time the Nam veterans were given a fair shake, instead of always showing them to be crazy people in prior movies.  Colonel Moore portrayed by Mel Gibson and all the men under his command were heroes in the true sense of the word.   I recommend everyone to see this film.
0812550706|4.0|In Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, the reader enters a futuristic universe where human beings are engaged in a struggle for survival.  Having twice survived alien attack, the humans, fearing a more powerful invasion, have developed a program to breed and train a warrior who will lead them to a final victory.  From the scores of children, a young boy of six, Ender, exhibits the traits needed to assure that victory.  And therein lies the story of Ender's Game.<BR>Orson Scott Card is prophetic as he takes the reader into a future where a young child, property of the government, endures a lonely, isolated existence as he plays endless hours of games designed to prove his ability to lead and to win.  There is, however, another reason Ender must play to win.  His own destiny depends on it!<BR>Ender's Game is an enjoyable, thought provoking read.  Orson Scott Card does a wonderful job of displaying a cold, calculating, world where the value of a child is based on his/her abilities to fight against the aliens.  Card also does a wonderful job of drawing the reader into the story and allowing the reader into the mind of a special young boy with a greater purpose than defeating an alien enemy.<BR>If you enjoy science fiction, you must read Ender's Game and the other books in the series.  And if you are not a fan of science fiction, you may still find Ender's Game a thought provoking story that will leave you contemplating the possibilities of a future world and the role human beings will play in the universe.
0671027344|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I could relate to so much of it. I think most people could easily see a piece of themselves in the main character.  The author is very talented and I definitely recommend this book!!!!
B000056H24|5.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told has made a great portrayal of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. It starts with His birth and ends with His ascension. It is guarenteed to touch the hearts on non-believers and increase the faith of believers. It makes you feel like your there with Jesus,listening to His words through this movie. It has inspired me to be more like Jesus. The Holy Spirit has moved through this movie. God Bless the actors and makers. I advise it for anyone who is confused and wants to find the truth,for this film will touch your heart and lead you to church and the Bible and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. And I also advise it to all believers who just want to watch a great film centered around our Lord Jesus. Jesus Loves You!
B00005QXDD|4.0|This is some of the funniest stuff I have ever heard. It's like a really long slapstick comedy musical movie without a point. I love the way this album sounds like the hilarious Jack Black and Tenacious D's guitarist Kevin Gass just sat in a recording studio and messed around for not much longer than the album took to record. This may be true, I don't know. Only a few of the songs actually start in with music, and msot of them have some hilarious intro that gets one the impression that Jack Black is jsut sitting around and decides he wants to record something (see \\"One Note Song\\"). The music on this isn't bad, it's pretty actually pretty good thanks to people like David Grohl. Things in the songs like the awsome drums (Grohl) in \\"Rock Your Socks\\" or the above average chors progressios of Gass on songs \\"Kielbasa\\" and \\"Kyle Quit the Band\\" actually impressed me, a musician. It's nothing most experienced musicians coulldn't play, but Kevin Gass shows here that he's somewhat an experienced musican, or a fast learner. However, the music is definately not this album's strong point it simply ties together Jack Black's hilarious bits of comedy. Things like when jack Black buys about 5 different Jr. items at MacDonald's because he's \\"watching his figure\\" are just hilarious. Other funny moments are \\"C*** Pushups\\",\\"Play the greatest song in the world or I'll eat your souls\\" and when there's a music break and Black shouts \\"Arigagugu Rigagugu\\" and \\"Fligoogageegooogooogee\\". These all crack me up. This album is well worth your money, there's bits of this album that you, like it or not, will hear and will not get out of your head for the rest of your life. As annoying as that may sound, this album is much more hilarious than annoying and, at this sad time in music, is some of the best stuff out there overall. If your looking for something hilarious or some pretty good music, or both, I suggest this album.
B00005MG2Y|5.0|Do not skip over this one. This is one of the best CD's available today.  There is not one bad song on this album.  I guarantee that you will play it over and over again and never get tired of it. The added songs are hot. Buy this one, its worth it.
B000002O1Q|5.0|If you love rock and roll, you will not be disappointed with this soundtrack! This one is my favorite of all time, and I am certain you will love it from the first moment you pop it in the player.<BR>The movie was very stylish (see it if you have not already!)and the music was the perfect compliment. I have lost my original copy and am going to buy a few extras to keep in different places around the house so I am never without it.<BR>Buy it!!
1878424319|1.0|This book has very little to say and spends a lot of time saying it.  It is vague and wanders.  If you like a book where you can derive any meaning you desire, this is it.  If you are feeling bad about yourself and are looking for an excuse to avoid personal responsibility, you will be able to find it here.  If you feel in control of your life and you want guidance and, perhaps, inspiration, don't waste your time on this.  I would have given this zero stars if I could - there is no redeeming value - although the cover is not unattractive.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is one of the best movies to come out in awhile. Simple wonderful!!
B00000BKDW|5.0|In Metal history there have been bands like Judas Priest, Metallica, Megadeth and Motorhead which gave direction to the future of where the genre was headed. But none of them have been as heavily influential and revered, feared, and respected as Iron Maiden. The reasons are not hard to find. Listen to \\"Powerslave\\" and you'll know why. Each track explodes with sophisticated, precise guitarwork, drum and vocal symphony that has been worked on, fine tuned and crafted to perfection. Smith and Murray are arguably the finest guitar duo to ever walk this planet. Steve Harris' bass playing is some of the finest you've ever listened to in the history of metal. Not to mention the incredible vocals of Dickinson and the maniacal drumming of Nicko Mcbrain. I listened to this album for the first time when I was in high school and till date I've not found a single record, disc,tape or performance that rivals this from any artiste. My only regret is Maiden hasnt announced any plans for a tour of India. We've had Purple play here and the Scorps. I dont see a reason why the Masters themselves shouldn't descend on my land.
B0000033OZ|4.0|I know I was only 4 when this came out, but ELP were still a staple on the radio when I was a kid and teen.  And then one day, I found this record in my folks music collection.  I realized that there was more to this band then the few songs played on the radio ie Lucky Man and From the Beginning.  They epitomized the bombast that was/is Prog rock, god bless them.
B00000ICN5|5.0|TEXAS FLOOD is STEVIE RAY VAUGHN'S first album and every song on this album is a hit. Now that it is remastered, the songs are fresher and sound better, and we have some bonus live tracks that show where SRV really earned his reputation, and that is by playing live back in Austin. We have classic tracks such as LOVE STRUCK BABY, PRIDE AND JOY, MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB,I'M CRYIN, which are uptempo blues rockers, and we also have the slower tempo blues classics TEXAS FLOOD,and DIRTY POOL. LENNY, TELL ME, and RUDE MOOD are classic blues instrumentals that are a must listen to. This remastered and reissued album is great and we be enjoyed by all fans of the blues and will be a great way for new fans to be introduced to SRV music
B00005YW4H|4.0|Wow! Great cd. I rate it up there with Natalie Coles 'Unforgetable' cd.
B000002TIK|5.0|The Grand Funk Railroad was a band that constantly reinvented themselves, almost with each album. At the beginning there were considered a Heavy Metal band (White Noise) of course even that part of there career has been reclassified as classic hard rock because of what Metal music has advanced too but it cannot be said that GFR is at least not a grandfather of Heavy Metal. GFR's first two albums On Time and Grand Funk (what we GFR Fanatics call The Red Album) were extremely heavy and somewhat simplistic (also GREAT). So when Closer To Home Came out it singled a change. Now this &quot;heavy Metal Band&quot; is showing the ability to change and showing versatility and more sophisticated lyrics. Closer to home is more of a blues based album there GFRs pervious efforts and It also contains GFR magus Opus (Best song) in my opinion I'm Your Captain Closer To Home. Its wonderful song and singer Songwriter Mark Farner said it came to him in a dream and that he believe God gave him this song to be meaningful to people. It has been meaningful to me for over 20 years now and to millions of others as well. The song is just a beautiful blend of melodic Guitar chords (Mark Farner) a great lead bass line (Mel Schacher) and wonderful drumming along (Don Brewer) with great lead vocals by Mark and wonderful Harmonies between Mark and Don, take all that and include a great orchestra blended and you have an all time rock classic. Closer to Home is worth the price just for I'm Your Captain Closer To Home alone, but that is not all. This album is great from start to finish. Sin's a Good Man's Brother is a hard rocker with an infectious groove. Aimless Lady a cool Bluesy rocker. Nothing is the same showed more sophistication in lyric writing for the young band and it rocks as well. Mean Mistreater and is slow down for the band a bluesy song crying out for lost love. Get it together is a fun (mostly) instrumental a nice grove provided by the rhythm section and some nice guitar chops at the end. Hooked On Love has that Gospel feel that influences much rock n roll from the 60s and early 70s, a typical we got to have Love song and a very good one. And Finally I'm Your Captian/Closer to home which is GFRs magus opus as I said previously. IYC/CTH is one of rock n rolls classic songs and its simply a beautiful songs. Coming form GFR such a heavy band at the time it was a big surprise. This album shows GFR still with gritty power but also shows striking maturity for the three young man, Mel, Don and Mark. This is one of Rock N Roll's classic hard rock album by one of Classic Rock's best bands. I would recommend this album to any hard rock/rock fan and any metal fan who wants to see the beginnings of modern hard rock and metal.end.

B00005K9LM|5.0|Not wanting to give up on their new-found momentum after the superb, fast and hard-hitting SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, Judas Priest released DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH in March of 1984. Sporting a darker, more violent side than SCREAMING, it nevertheless continued the same tradition of fast, rat-a-tat-tat drumming from Dave Holland, K.K. Downing/Glenn Tipton twin-Stratocaster guitar solos that intertwined with each other at blistering speeds, and high-pitched screeching courtesy of Rob Halford, the greatest heavy metal singer alive both then and now. I became a die-hard fan when I first saw their video for the speed-metal opener \\"Freewheel Burning\\". The song is fast, furious, yet still very melodic. It's also my favorite on this CD. Even at their fastest, Priest always retained their melodic sensibilites; they were never just noise. \\"Jawbreaker\\" continues this dark speed-metal sound nicely; although not great like \\"Freewheel Burning\\", it keeps the momentum going. \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free\\" is a great racing-as-metaphor-for-life song like \\"Heading Out To The Highway\\" and \\"Freewheel Burning\\", but is mid-tempo in rhythm with a high-pitched tandem guitar tune that sounds like the perfect theme of a teenage life-story. \\"The Sentinel\\" burns up the air; it's a fast, burning, and violent song which could have been made into a movie. It's about a supernatural (and apparently immortal) sentinel who takes out an entire army with his scabbard of 200 daggers, which \\"fly out like bullets, upon their deadly course.\\" Quite gory, but nonetheless an excellent Priest song with a memorable bridge. <br />The second half of DEFENDERS also rocks, although not quite as hard. \\"Love Bites\\" is Priest's metallic take on vampirism; it begins memorably with some slow, forboding bass guitar chords from Ian Hill before kicking in with Halford growling \\"When you feel safe/When you feel warm/That's when I rise/That's when I crawl\\". It was the perfect song to open all of Priest's live shows on the \\"Defenders\\" tour--I know, I saw them twice on that tour--although it's not quite as great of a song to hear whilst lounging in the comfort of your living room. \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is pretty self-explanatory <wink>; its true meaning not fully revealed until Rob courageously came out of the closet in 1998. It's an okay speed-metal track, a bit too repetitious; it's probably the weakest song on the CD. But then we get to my second-favorite track on here, \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\", which became widely played on FM hard-rock stations. It's about \\"the power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth\\" and gives us a great lead guitar solo trade-off between Glenn & K.K. The next track is a haunting power-ballad called \\"Night Comes Down\\". It's dark, emotional, and fits the mood of this CD perfectly. Closing out the original DEFENDERS set is \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith\\", a slow-paced but pounding two-part heavy metal anthem that serves as a tribute to the legions of Priest fans everywhere, and for all those who want to be rocked till their \\"Metal Hunger's fed\\". That's a fake audience cheering on this studio version, but it reminds me of when I saw them do it live, and I was part of a REAL screaming crowd!<br />But wait; there's more! With this Remastered version, we now get a studio bonus track called \\"Turn On Your Light\\". It was written \\"during the early years of our career\\". Like most of the bonus tracks on Priest's Remastered CDs, it was recorded in 1985 during the sessions for TURBO. It's an unusually slow song, with both acoustic guitar and keyboards (very unusual for a Priest song), although it does contain a fuzzy lead guitar solo and does get pretty heavy towards the end. It's not a great, standout track such as \\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\" (from the Remastered SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE), but it's not bad either, and it is good to *occasionally* hear Rob Halford sing without screaming. Finally, the CD closes with an appropriately live version of \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith.\\" It's rendered faithfully, and extended to five-and-a-half minutes with Rob leading the real screaming crowd on a minute-long \\"We are Defenders of the Faith\\" chant.<br />DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH still remains one of Judas Priest's strongest albums ever. It's earned a special place in my heart, and it still rocks me till my Metal Hunger's fed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0792164903|4.0|Well first of all the art direction of this film is marvellous.there's not a single ray of sunlight in the movie ..every scene has a dark &amp; cloudy look which just adds to the excitement .and a good story on which this film has been based upon .the only flaw seems to be the ending which has been rushed into its conclusion . the secret is revealed in a matter of fact way .and the reason for the witchcraft seems cliched .maybe some kind of a flashback scene would have helped .<BR>but overall a fine movie with good performances by johnny depp &amp; the boy .
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life was such an amazing movie it's beyond words. Any individual interested in Philosophy must see this movie. The ideas and concepts discussed are superior to any discusses on paper. This movie will go down in history as one of the great works. I loved this movie and wish there were more like it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|For all lovers of Spielberg movies, this is a must see piece of cinematography. The story is a futuristic Pinnochio story, a young robot who wants to become a real boy. Its well worh seeing for the acting alone. Spielberg has done justice and deserves credit for finishing Kubrick's work.
B00005A3KS|1.0|I bought this dvd at a local store because I do like the film.<BR>unfortunatly the video hangs up at the layer change.<BR> I exchanged it twice for a grand total of three copies and always had the same problem...<BR> So I cant recommend it till its remastered, (SE etc...)
B00005U1YO|3.0|This Chemical's cd is very strange, and sometimes a bit slow. Come with us, the track, really rocks, but Come with us, the album, just don't delivers. I'm not going with them, after all...
0553106635|3.0|What a disappointing way to continue this great sequel.  All of your favorite characters are wiped out.  And the occasional spatter of sex takes a raunchy turn.  This is the last book of Martin's that I will read.
B00005RYLE|3.0|I don't think a whole lot has to be said about the movie itself, it's been covered already.  An incredible, classic movie.<BR>The packaging is pretty darn cool.  The look, the feel, the way it looks on your coffee table...<BR>But, I was extremely disappointed with the \\"wide-screen\\" aspect of this dvd.  The Elite dvd, an awesome dvd in it's own right, was full frame, and I was pretty sure that if the movie was wide at all, it was only slightly.  It seemed full frame was the best way to see this movie.  So when I was watching the disc, I couldn't believe how wide this dvd was.  I had to investigate.  Playing both dvds side by side, my suspicions were correct.  Yes, the book of the dead dvd is slightly, and I mean slightly wider.  But boy oh boy, did they chop off the top and the bottom to give it a phony wide-screen look.  I just don't understand why Anchor Bay would do that.  It's just silly.<BR>So should you buy this?  If [you like] packaging, then yes.  If you're not, then look for the Elite version of the dvd.  The picture is superior.  The only extras this dvd has is a couple of useless documentaries, that aren't particularly interesting and don't add anything to your viewing experience of The Evil Dead.
B000050FEN|4.0|The film itself is excellent.  One of the best thrillers.  It<BR>of course isn't something you can watch over and over and be<BR>as entertained as the first time around.  So the extra<BR>features sounded very cool and probably worth the money.  <br />The packaging is again, very cool with an eye to detail.  The<BR>content of the extra features is quite lacking.  For instance,<BR>it claims to have two alternative endings to the film.  Well<BR>it really does not.  It has a different partial filming of one<BR>that isn't much different at all.  It has another that is a<BR>storyboard that is different, but not much more different, and<BR>it is only a cartoon storyboard.  That's it.  So great packaging<BR>but lacking some substance.
0201633612|1.0|Somebody told me that you have to already know the subject matter to read this book..TRUE! Padded with \\"run-on\\" monologue about things known to the author. See page 166, \\"With parent references, it's essential...\\" ...The author is in a world of his own. Why was the book popular? <BR>(1) all there was for a while<BR>(2) there is honor among thieves AND elitists
B00005QDW1|1.0|At first listen, this latest No Doubt effort is nothing like the other stuff I've heard from them. Of course, it's also nothing I wanted to hear a second time either. Gone is the sense of peppy punk energy that thrust Tragic Kingdom to the forefront of edgy girl pop. Instead it seems that front woman Gwen Stefani has fallen completely into her hip hop girl-power diva mode. <BR>The opening track \\"Hella Good\\" has an infectious groove that does have my head bouncing a bit. Single \\"Hey Baby\\" is the best track on the album, but would be a lower third track on their earlier efforts. It has a great beat, but sounds like any one of a dozen other electro-heavy dance tunes out there. \\"Making Out\\" is the first of many totally forgettable dance/pop tracks. \\"Underneath it All\\" has a sweet pop sensibility that has later single written all over it. (But at five minutes, it's at least twice as long as it should be.) \\"Detective\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"Start the Fire\\" are utterly forgettable tracks plunging this album further into the mid-disc abyss. \\"Running\\" shows off Stefani's voice nicely in a mostly forgettable, sappy pop-friendly tune. \\"In My Head\\" gives us a late reprieve with its catchy beat and haunting vocals. \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" is actually the second best tune of the album but would be more at home on a Garbage CD. It's not enough to save the album, but it is head and shoulders above the other stuff on this disc. Don't get too excite though as the final two tracks nose dive greatly. \\"Wailing Room\\" sounds like a Janet Jackson reject and \\"Rock Steady\\" can't end soon enough for my taste. <BR>I have to admit that on third listen, this CD isn't as bad as I thought when I heard it the first time. Still, it's nothing I would recommend, especially for fans of No Doubt. There are two or three good tracks and a whole lot of stuff that's just a waste of time.
B000002G23|5.0|I have had this set for about 6 years now and I still play them all regularly.  It was the best 25 dollars I have ever spent on any piece of music (I bought the set at a used CD store).  This set captures the true essence of their music and how it evolved over their short history together.  I personally love the 2nd CD, although each one has something about it that I love.  It is amazing to hear each song and just hear all genres mixed into nearly 100 beautiful songs....reggae, new wave, a little punk.  The Police ignited  a love of music for me over a decade ago and I will always see them as one of the best bands in music.  It's sad that their career together was so short.  The box set is an essential for any true Police fan.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I am not a real big fan of Nicole Kidman, but this was her best work. I love the way the movie took modern songs and made them fit into the era of the movie setting. The singing and dancing were awsome!!! I have a lot of favorite movies, but this one takes the cake.
B00005RDRO|5.0|A favorite movie since I was a child, I was thrilled to finally have this movie on DVD.  Featuring excellent performances by classic actors at the top of their craft, the smart dialog, and amazingly detailed hilarious sequences are all performed effortlessly by such giants as Maggie Smith, Peter Falk, Eileen Brannan, James Coco and Peter Sellers, amongst others.  A classic must-have for anyone who loves excellent comedy (and while I love the movie CLUE as well, they obviously had seen this one first and the original is better! ;-)
B00004XMTH|5.0|I love it. My sons and I watched the tape until it wore out and then bought the DVD. My only complaint is where is GrowlTiger? The whole story of Gus the Theatre Cat is incomplete without it. &quot;I once played GrowlTiger..Could do it again.&quot; I have a suspicion there may have been a bit of ethnic embarrassment, but they were other moments that were kept in.<br />Play the Jellicle Ball all the time.
0451203933|5.0|Black Hawk Down is simply an amazing read.  It's easy to see why it became a movie: studio reads gripping novel and instantly recognizes that this story is must bound for the big screen.  I read the book prior to seeing the movie; I didn't want to be biased against the book having been \\"visually influenced.\\"  <br />From all that is presented to the reader, it appears that Mark Bowden has done a fantastic job piecing together what had to be a difficult story to write about.  Bowden was granted an unbelievable opportunity to get first hand information from the people involved in the ill-fated mission.  His access to Delta Force operators, Rangers, Somali citizens and clan fighters leaves very little unturned.  He also reports that he had access to communication tapes and videos from the actual event.  All of this material adds to an already gripping story of men who paid the full price for their chosen vocation.  <br />In the post-September 11th world, this story is one that doesn't play to the emotions as a ruse to rope in readership.  Bowden plays all sides equally; I didn't finish this book feeling ill-will toward Somalia, but rather, felt for the loss of our men, Somalia's people and the world that such military events are necessary and needed.<br />Bowden's narrative flashes between several of the groups; at times it is almost overwhelming, but he does a good job of conveying the scope of over 140 men descending on this city.  The pacing is tight and the storyline taut with apprehension and fear.  Even though I already knew the outcome of the totality of events, reading it in such detail gave me a greater respect for many of these men who choose harms way for their careers.<br />Lastly, I want to mention that I am not a huge war history/fan/buff.  Other than Band Of Brothers, I can't say I have read a military themed book in years.  In spite of this, it is a testament to Bowden that he is such a capable writer as to make the story compelling and interesting to readers outside of the core of that genre.  I have had no problems recommending this book to many of my friends, as I do now to anyone reading this review.  You will not be disappointed.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|forget all the box office blockbusters that u sit through and come out of feeling empty. this movie is what cinema should be about. it will have you guessing, wondering, THINKING. what a concept, a film actually getting you to use your brain. this is not insipid entertainment. this is gripping and puzzling. u will find yourself talking out loud to your friends attempting to figure out the next step in the movie will be while puzzled about the previous step in the movie and figuring how it all connects. but dont talk too loud or for too long, youll miss something else! dont get up to go to the bathroom, dont get up for a snack, or be sure to pause the movie when u do. if u miss even a bit of the movie, youll be out of it to say the least! anyways, this movie is amazing and awesome and what film should aspire to be! 5 stars!

0812550706|5.0|At first all too confusing, the reader is drawn into the unusual future of a \\"third\\" named Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggins.  In this strange and twisted world the government has placed sanctions on the number of children on is allowed to have.  The planet Earth is under constant attack by a race of alien called \\"buggers\\".  The government weeds out possible soldiers and the fated leader who will ultimately destroy the aliens, monitor the children closely.  Much like the heroes of science fiction fantasy Ender is a good child, one always tormented by his choices.  He is afraid of being the \\"killer\\" like his older brother, but he finds himself in situations where he must defend himself.   Ender is a \\"golden\\" child that is popular in the science fiction realm, a hero who doesn't realize it yet.  That's what draws the reader to Ender, and makes them semi-hate Graff.  Graff is the hard nose teacher, the one you love to hate and hate to love.  He is attempting to push Ender into his true destiny but it truly makes you wonder, what are his true intentions.  Ender's Game is fascinating look at what the human race would do to it's own kind to survive, and how cruel we can be to someone who is different or \\"better\\".
0375707972|1.0|Maybe it's the translation, but what was the point of this book?  It struck me as entirely superficial.  The one interesting point raised is how the generation after the Nazis felt, and how they coped, and it is glossed over and dropped.<BR>Don't bother.
B00005B36H|5.0|The people who are saying this album is stupid are the type who want to hear the mainstream.  This isn't meant for the mainstream.  This album is meant for the people who want to search deep inside the music; who want to explore everything.  These are the dreamers.  This CD is beauty, from the packaging to everything else.  People who compare it with AEnima are losing touch on what Tool sets out to do; create something different, all the time.  Every song on here is different.  A lot of songs will take some listening to enjoy.  For me, I despised The Patient the first half year that I owned the CD, but now I love it.  The songs grow on you.  But then, there are songs like Lateralus that are simply phenomenal.  Anybody who can't understand how beautiful Lateralus is, is closed-minded.  Has to be.  Did you know that Lateralus was originally named 987, because of the way the measures are drawn, starting around 1 minute into the song?  I have a certain lust for strange time signatures, and this is certainly a killer.  I can never get those chords out of my head.  It's beautiful.  Don't try to force yourself to like any of the songs immediately, but don't give up on them, either.  Oh yeah, and I agree indefinitely that Schism has been overplayed.  It's a wonderful song, but the radio pulls all the beauty out of it.  A more radio-fit song would have been Ticks and Leeches.
B000003TA4|5.0|Perfect CD <BR>I think the greatest ever. period.
0062502182|5.0|Together with his sheep the Andalusian shepherd Santiago travels from place to place, he reads books and thinks of a beautiful merchant's daughter in the next village. But his life changes when he has the same dream two nights in a row. He meets the old king of Salem who tells him to trust the signs, live his own legend and that he will find his treasure at the pyramids of Egypt.<br />Santiago sells his flock and takes the boat to Morocco. Whatever he does - and these are often humble things- helps him to gain a deeper insight into life. In an oasis he meets the girl of his life. He considers abandoning his quest, but she encourages him to keep going. Together with an alchemist he attains his goal after a number of adventures.<br />The Alchemist is a short, well written and above all wise novel that stresses the importance of doing what your heart tells you to do because that is the only way to attain real happiness. It also shows that not only big events lead to wisdom and that sometimes one has to travel far to find the treasure that is nearby.
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 is a masterpiece for the beggining to the end of the CD, 2112 is one of the best writen songs of all time, the others songs are really great. If you want to start to know Rush, I recommend this cd and Moving Pictures
B00005B1W5|5.0|This Concert is the best performance of Yanni. This DVD, have an exceptional quality of image and sound. The musicians are very professional. The idea to play beside \\"The Taj-Majal\\" and \\"Forbidden City\\", was Great!!!. <BR>It's the best concert in DVD in the last years.
0783222955|5.0|One of the few films that is able to stand up to the text it is based on.  A great piece of cinema that appropriatly and accurately captures the drama and lessons from the novel.  And like any movie that withstands time, it keeps getting better with every viewing.
059035342X|4.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is part of a series of books which are all being made into movies because they are excellent fictional books. <BR> Harry Potter, the main character, lived with humans or \\"muggles\\" for the early part of his life. Until one day when an owl delivered him a letter telling him to go to \\"Hogwarts,\\" which is a school for wizards and witches. From then on Harry was an excellent, well known wizard. <BR> This book is for people with imagonation since there are many akward situations in it. For example a \\"three headed dog\\" or \\"invisibility cloak\\" which made Harry invisable whenever he put it on. That is why i believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great book. I would recomend this book to the younger aged children because it sparks their imagination.
0805053883|5.0|This is my son Tyler's (17 mos) favorite book.  He loves the colorful pictures and loves it even more when Mommy tries to make all the animal noises for him!  (Ever try to make a yelping peacock or fluting flamingo noise??)  No matter how many times I read this book to him, he wants to hear it just one more time...ok, maybe two...or three...  I especially love the fact that it is about more unusual animals - peacock, flamingo, walrus, as opposed to your everyday dog, cat, cow -type animals.  I highly recommend this book, it's a must have!
0375507507|5.0|Evokes images of childhood and Africa that are at the same time luscious and abhorrent, but that draw you into the life of this young girl like few other early childhood biographies have achieved. Miss Fuller is completely unapologetic about her parents and accepts them for who they are are and doesn't try to excuse or blame them -- how refreshing!<br />This is hardly an objective review, as I like Ms. Fuller grew up in the white farming community of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe and I'm also a survivor of the pink prison (Arundel School) and now reside in the US. But unlike Bobo, I grew up a wealthy farm with relatively normal parents in a very abnormal world of the white colonialist in black Africa. I resonate strongly with her images which are dead on. I still wake each morning listening to hear the &quot;work harder&quot; doves and the &quot;go away&quot; birds. Thanks Bobo for giving me a couple hours to relapse into a world that no longer exists but was home for some of us. Looks like those &quot;Use of English&quot; classes taught by Mrs. Twiss at Arundel paid off....
B00005YT8U|5.0|If you have never purchased a Chieftain's CD, this is the one to pick.  If you have almost everything the group has ever recorded, this is still a good purchase.<br />The CD includes a variety (17 tracks) of favorite Chieftain recordings from over the years.  With only two new tracks, some might think this just a rehash.  But, the tracks included include some great work by the Chieftains (Live from Malloy's Pub, The love theme from Barry Lyndon, etc.) as a group AND most of my favorite collaborations from over the years.<br />The strength of the Chieftain's 40 years started with their amazing ability to reach back and preserve/refresh traditional old Irish tunes in danger of being forgotten.  Not content to master the body of Celtic work from the past, they composed on their own and then moved on to work with world class artisans from other genres - bringing a Celtic sincerity and energy to each work.  I love these guys and this CD is an excellent choice for anyone interested in reliving music history.  You get to hear collaborations with The Rolling Stones, Joni Mitchell, Sinead O'Connor, Ricky Skaggs, Sting, The Corrs, Van Morrison, Art Gunfunkel, etc.  For pure star power alone, this is a good buy.<br />The new cuts deliver all we have come to expect from a Chieftain's cut - fresh arrangements of Celtic themes impeccably adapted by the group.<br />Let's all hope there is more &quot;new stuff&quot; from the Chieftains left in their bag of tricks.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|For some reason, I decided to check out Moulin Rouge.  I don't know, maybe because it had the beautiful Nicole Kidman in it or something.  I just don't know.  But when I first viewed it, I was mesmorized! This is a musical unlike any I've seen before.  It surely captures your heart and gettting into the songs.  Of course, no one in my family understood Moulin Rouge.  I mean, what's there to understand? It's a tragedy waiting to happen.  It's about love, &quot;overcoming all obstacles.&quot; I like watching musicals is because of the singing and the actors.  It's like pure Disney magic! Usually when the actors can't express their feelings with words, they burst into song.  There are three great songs that were performed by Nicole and Ewan, &quot;What May Come,&quot; &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; and &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away.&quot; Those songs have captured my heart and kept them in my memory.  Another reason I love this musical is because of it's comic moments in it.  It keeps you entertained at the beginning, making you wanna know what is going to happen to the characters.  And then, when we get deeper into the film, it begins to become more of a drama, beause of Satine's (Nicole Kidman) sickness.  But the one thing that I didn't understand about this movie, was the cause of Satine's sickness.  Maybe she was jelously in love, and couldn't handle it any more, and caused her to get sick.  It's a tragedy, so I guess you don't really need an explanation for it.  But one thing is certain, Moulin Rouge is a must have for you DVD collection. It's filled so packed extras and more.  The sound and picture of it all, is fabulous.  If you're one of those people that are into musicals, than &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is the one for you! It's deinatley one that you will not be disappointed in!
0140177396|5.0|I enjoyed this book and i think that most people would enjoy reading about the hardships, struggles, hopes and dreams of two men during the great depression. After reading this book I felt a greater appreciation for the people who lived during this time. The book was very inspirational tome. I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched. They made the events believable which causedmany emotions to stir inside you anger, fear, suspense, sorrow, and happines just to name a few. You really connect with the book. That's why I highly recommend this book.
B000059XUI|3.0|This film was Donners film and it was ruined! <BR>All those cheesy slapstick moments it makes me cringe. <BR>And look what Lester did to the Villains....in Donners version they were pure evil and in Lesters they were comedic baffoons. Watch the film carefully and you can see the difference in the Donner and Lester footage.<BR>General Zod looks pure evil in the Donner scenes....<BR>We also need those Marlon Brando scenes to be reinstated in the film, it suffers too much without them (believe me folks read the original script and you will see what I mean!) If not done in the form of a re-edit they could at least include them as deleted scenes. <BR>Richard Donner has said that one day he hopes to put those scenes back in and I truely hope he does!<BR>As for this dvd it isnt very good......no 5.1 sound, picture suffers and no extras.....very poor!!
B00005U16N|3.0|The folks that put this together did a nice job.  They captured an era and a lifestyle very well while telling their story.  They signed a terrific lead actor, and a great supporting cast that reminded me dead-on of several people I knew in college.  Very watchable, and a good biography.  <br />What keeps it from a higher rating is partially the bad luck of it being released around the time of the far superior \\"Traffic\\".  But besides telling you that one man was more responsible than others for the explosion of cocaine in this country 25 years ago, there's not much else.  While the movie certainly doesn't portray George Jung as a hero, it is asking for sympathy when things important to him are finally taken away.  <br />However, here is a person who did NOTHING but deal drugs for a living all his adult life.  Now I can buy the arguement that he was just supplying what the people wanted, and the purchasers are just as guilty as the supplier.  But there are two problems I have with this.  First, the movie goes to great pains to show that he wasn't necessarily a violent man, although he did carry a gun and threatened people with it.  But his close association with Pablo Escobar, who was a merciless killer, puts Jung big time in guilt by association.  For this I have no sympathy for the man.  <br />Second, this guy did his second swing in prison because he was under surveillance for his first pinch.  He knew very well the cops were watching him, yet practically sets himself up for the bust.  With all that, and knowing that the government was REALLY observing him after his second visit to prison, what does he do?  Goes out and becomes part of another big deal. Like Henry Hill in \\"Goodfellas\\", it never occurs to him that there are other ways to get money, albeit not as quickly.   I think society sometimes has to lock up stupid people to protect them from themselves.  <br />Overall, I did like the movie, and recommend it.   But for someone who has lived totally for himselfall his life, and in his forties all of a sudden has a child, this doesn't make you a nice person.  Yes, prison is bad when it takes away the things you like, but then that's the point.
6301661737|4.0|If Akira Kurosawa had not made Ran, Kagemusha would probably have been considered his last great film.  However, not only is Ran so incredibly good - one of Kurosawa's best, if not one of the best films of all time - it also deals with the same time period and uses some of the same techniques and actors as Kagemusha, but all in a better and more sophisticated way.<br />But I digress.  Kagemusha is based upon a real story in 16th century Japan about a clan whose leader had a double or shadow warrior ('Kagemusha') and which was wiped out in a battle with another clan.  Kurosawa focuses on the double and his attempts at acting as Lord Shingen for three years: both the original Lord and the double are played by Tatsuya Nakadai ('Yojimbo,' 'Ran') in a masterful performance.<br />Indeed, the double's experience as the Lord is really the heart of the film, not the battles or clan rivalries per se.  As in many Kurosawa films, class plays a subtle yet important role: the double was a thief who now must impersonate a Lord, and ironies abound thoughout the film (but especially at the end) about the way the double is in many ways more noble than the original Lord.  Besides class there is another subtext to the film, namely the construction of identity itself: in perhaps the best scene of the film, the double has a very scary dream near the end where he is confronted with the original Lord - perfectly embodying the double's doubts about his own identity.<br />As for the basics of the film, the viewer can hardly be dissapointed.  The cinematography was spectacular - the battle scenes of course, but also many beautifully constructed scenes near or on the sea as well.  Kurosawa's use of traditional Japanese instruments, especially the drum in the final battle scene is awesome, and the costumes and art direction were outstanding.<br />The only serious fault with Kagemusha is its length: it could have been cut by a good 20 minutes and not lost anything.  Yet that is really the only criticism I have here - all the rest is great.  See it.

1568490119|1.0|What's proven here? That if you can convince youself you have something to live for: you will continue to live for it. So? If after getting hit on the head with a lead pipe 100x one is to receive ten million dollars, I suppose there are some who will endure that pain, too, in the hope they will survive. They won't.<br />Perhaps the real question is if there is *any* reward for enduring the brutality of life that is worth the suffering. Most, if not virtually all, love relationships are based on a thinly or not-so thinly disguised basis of psychology mercantilism, if not outright economic dealmaking. Other higher pursuits: art, philosophy, philanthropy, so-called spiritual attainment are arguably better, but, really, are little more than panaceas not much different, in their ultimate purpose, than devoting one's life to developing the perfect tennis game, for instance. They absorb one's attention and distract one's focus from the pain &amp; dissolution to come, or even occuring, &amp; keep one, perhaps, from ending it all at the very moment. In this manner, we all buoy each other up, but for what? The question remains unanswered. Life is a concentration camp and we are all going to the gas chamber in the end. What do we do in the meantime. Is it worth it?<br />Frankl, like any reasonably intelligent person, delineates the central problem well: Why live? But like every other professional philosopher or psychologist, he comes up with a reason (altho in this case the reason boils down to *find a reason*) because, well, what else is he going to do? The biological imperative compels us to go on with life at any price. The alternative: that there is no reason to do so--that is simply too terrifying to contemplate, would violate species survival, and be considered unpublishable. Just once I'd like to see a thinker have the courage to face the ultimate question and not flinch, escape to a flight of fancy, take a leap of *faith* or otherwise dissemble.<br />Life is not worth living. Don't blink.living. Don't blink.
014028009X|5.0|Literature is filled with &quot;anti-heroes&quot;.  Main characters who have flaws, or anti-establishment leanings that sometimes adds to their likeability, sometimes not.  But these character traits are usually window-dressing to more fill out a character that is doing SOMETHING ELSE to further the plot. <br />This book is wonderful in that the whole purpose of the book is to not only mention the flaws, and highlight the flaws, but make them endearing, and the whole purpose of the story.  For all of us who have ever made an excuse not to go to the gym, or why we haven't given up a particular vice (fill in yours here), or can't put an itenerary together to save one's life, here is our how-to-do-it manual, written by the expert.  <br />Yes, the movie does have a chick-book story of which guy will she get, or will she get one at all.  We see how the workplace is such a contributor to one's social life.  And how one's family competes with work as a stabilizing factor.  <br />But this is all just ordinary plot to hang on what the book is all about.  Which is, her hilarious, carefully laid out plans for self improvement that never quite seem to get accomplilshed.  Even more hilarious is the fact that some of them never even get started.  The device to list weight, calories, drinks and cigarettes, then put them in perspective in her own mind are a riot.  I never knew a drinking binge could be so good for you!
B000002J1S|2.0|Two things:  (1) There is more 'filler' material on this (still!) 2-disc set than is contained in a queen-size goose-down<BR>mattress.  (2)  The best thing that ever happened to both Peter<BR>Gabriel and Genesis was him leaving.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Although the people above may criticize this masterpiece, do NOT be drawn in by their mindless drawling. This is an EXTREMELY exhilarating movie, full of color, humor, and tragedy. Although quite different from what one may normally see in modern movies, I can confidently say that this movie will pave the way for future musicals to come. Baz Luhrmann does an excellent job of creating a character to audience relationship, drawing us to comprehend and sympathize with everything that occurs in this movie. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performances and bring so much character to the roles that they play. Although quite flashy and unconventional in the beginning, the love story and that hardships that it endures makes up for it. Along with the music and the intricately weaved plot, I would definitely put this as one of my top 5 favorite movies. &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return&quot;.
B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol was one of those rockers I always admired, but never got around to buying his albums.  Then one day, it hit me that I should run and get this CD.  It rocks!  All the hits are here, and, even better, we get the album versions of these songs and not the edited single versions.  Even a track from the misunderstood \\"Cyberpunk\\" release surfaces here.  Pop music has really been suffering a slow death in the last 10 years, but if you want to check out a compilation by one of the most vivid rockers of the 1980's, then you can't go wrong with this excellent release.  It'll only make you long for Idol's return with a new studio album.
B000024D4R|5.0|Okay-so I'm just trying to come up with a good title, yeah, but it IS one of the most visually arresting album covers of all time.  But - BUT - the music!!  Troubled Waters' slowly simmering ego melt-down aggravating the rest of the band into their finest studio playing ever.  Everyone always, without fail, comes up with &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; when asked what might be Dave Gilmour's best work; I gotta go with &quot;Dogs&quot; - that first guitar solo rips right out of the speakers and tries to tear your throat out.  <br />Quick!  Think of a short list of all-time great rock keyboardists!!  Wakeman, Emerson, Lord, Moraz (giant egotist that he is, not withstanding!). . .  How often does the name Richard Wright come up?  Listen to this album; again on &quot;Dogs&quot;,<BR>my GOD!! one of the GREAT synth solos of all time!  And equally superb work on &quot;Pigs&quot; and especially setting the mood on &quot;Sheep&quot;, luring you in with that ever-so-laid-back electric<BR>lounge piano sound...  so that Roger can lead you to the slaughter.<br />So, we get to Mr. Rogers neighborhood:  not the cheeriest of places but at least on this outing he's still got enough self-<BR>control to remember that he's IN a band, not leading a bunch of<BR>...   hmmmmm, sheep?  The guy is a great bassist; his main problem is he thinks he's a better social commentator.  Stick to the music, man (you TOO, Paul McCartney!!).<br />Nick Mason's drumming is - as always - so subtle that you HAVE to listen to it a thousand times before you realize just how perfect it is.  Neil Peart he is not, thank the gods.  Or try to imagine &quot;Dogs&quot; with Mike Portnoy manning the oars (Wow - I hope I'm not giving anyone any ideas...)<br />This is still my favorite Floyd album, even after &quot;The Division Bell&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot; and everything else before or since, mostly because it's basically just good old fashioned thinking man's <BR>progressive rock and roll.
0887309372|5.0|I have read a few books written by Ries and there are two ideas that are emphasized again and again, that is, to focus and to place a word in the prospect mind. This book is no exception. The laws of branding built in this book are based on these two concepts.<br />&quot;Marketing is building a brand in the mind of the prospect&quot;. I totally agree. People are exposed to an over-communicated environment, to place a word in the prospect mind can surely lead your company to success. In fact, in customers' mind, there is no difference between your products and your competitors'. Only by building a brand can you differentiate your company from its competitors.<br />I also agree that brand building is not just for marketing department but for the entire company, as a brand is not only composed of its name but also of its product, service, environment, communication and behavior of the company. Everything a company does is related to brand building. Therefore, apart from the name that includes the logotypes and the color, this book also provides us with a lot of ways to do with the brand. For examples, to focus in its scope, to achieve it with publicity and maintain it with advertising, to promote the category rather than the brand, to distinguish it from the company, to avoid using subbranding etc. <br />This book is clear in the format and the content, illustrated by plenty of examples of what not to do and lessons on how to brand in the customer's mind! I can get a lot of insights from it.<br />This book is worth reading! I highly recommend you to read it!
1577311523|5.0|Enlightenment and Presence are often little more than words, as far as our daily lives are concerned. They're like any other words until we've had experiences that give them personal meaning. <br />We can talk about puberty, heartbreak, childbirth or chocolate. We can talk about car accidents and broken families, funerals and flying, but the words and the actual experiences they describe are not the same things.<br />Stories we hear in our lives about any of the above may lead us to think that we know something about those things, but we know nothing real until we experience the realities to which those words point. <br />Although I've read and enjoyed other books that provided insights into presence, none have addressed the subject for me as well as this one.  <br />Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings on mindfulness have touched and inspired me, and made me want to understand being present. I felt recognition of my own life when I read his examples of how I am no more than a ghost to my daughter if while she sits with me and tells me about her day I am thinking about a problem I had at work that afternoon. His book, the \\"Miracle of Mindfulness\\", was one of my first exposures to what was meant by the concept.<br />Pema Chodron helps us learn to soften to our own lives and heal our hearts by practicing feeling those lives in every moment. Her book, \\"When Things Fall Apart\\", is one of the most appreciated books in my life. <br />There many others, of course. Another wonderful book is Stephen Levine's \\"A Gradual Awakening\\". Many friends list \\"Be Here Now\\", by Ram Dass, as a key experience in their journeys to awakening. Krishnamurti said all of these things, too, and some will say that's all you need. Others will say Jesus said it well enough. Just heed that message, but each person hears as differently as he or she speaks, and different messengers catch us at different times, in different places, with different abilities to be open at those times. Teachers of every faith andnationality have shared the power of presence, mindfulness or the Now with others for centuries. In recent years, the frequency and clarity of that message seems to be increasing. <br />It reaches a new and helpful clarity in the words shared with us by Eckhart Tolle.<br />In reading this simple book you will likely find, as others have mentioned, that you have to pause frequently to consider what you've read, because it is full of thoughts so simple you can barely hold them in your mind long enough to recognize how familiar they are. The practical truth embodied here opens the heart to an opportunity to finally 'get' the things we've been reading and discussing and wondering about much of our lives. A chance to stop thinking about presence and talking about presence and just try being present...<br />This is a book about awakening, about living in the now instead of being lost in our thoughts about past and future. <br />Perhaps more important, it is a practical guide, presented in a way that turns lights on all around us, enabling us to see a simple path to living an awakened life. <br />A life empowered by our own Presence.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie, I can't see how anyone could say otherwise. It was very imaginative and it was also incredibly lush the setting was something out of Wonderland! Nicole Kidman was WONDERFUL! The story line was intriguing and I loved how the play clashed with the true movie's storyline! This is a movie everyone should come to see. Nicole Kidman was truly absolutly WONDERFUL!!!!
1587990717|5.0|Anyone who holds any doubts in regards to the validity of this book must read Edward Chancellor's 'Devil Take the Hindmost,' which provides a history of financial markets from the dawn of the Roman Empire up to now.  After reading such a sweeping historical account, one sees the financial markets for exactly what they have always been: one vast bubble machine where people have even invested in, according to Chancellor, a company that refused to explain anything about what it did but simply assured the investors that it had a great idea for making money.  Sounds rather similar to some of the dot coms in recent years.  Through a compliation of both antecdotes and thoughts, Taleb provides an explanation as to why the markets work in this way, why so many fail to realize this, and how these issues are mirrored in our everyday lives. He addresses many issues that everyone should understand in order to view the world in a realistic manner. Evolution is not a one way road to nirvana but rather the process through which those adapted to the current situation fare better, and they may not be best adopted when things change. When judging the validity of any strategy in business or in life one must consider that the winners write the history books; you can only talk to survivors of war but that certainly doesn't mean that everyone survives it.  When deducing anything from viewing a sample you must consider the forces that created that sample: should you consider yourself unintelligent because you're behind your classmates at a top law school?  Are a good outcome and a good decision the same thing, and likewise for a bad outcome and a bad decision?  And the list goes on.<br />While Taleb does not fully dive into this issue until later in the book, the primary conjecture of the piece is that human beings are psychologically prone to misinterpret random events.  We need to explain things, whether it be in the social sciences, art and literature, or the natural sciences, so we find ways to explain them.  Considering the infinite quantities of data at our disposal, no statistician denies that extremely powerful correlations will occur simply out of chance.  Certain aspects of an author's life will be almost identical to passages in his or her novels, certains stocks will share perfect correlations, and we are creatures in need of explanation, and whole industries have been created to mine the data and tell us why things occur.  <br />Prior to this book, Taleb had already written 'Dynamic Hedging,' considered by many, including myself, to be one of the best books ever written on exotic and vanilla options.  That book is not for anyone who has not spent years studying (or preferably practicing) options, but in 'Fooled by Randomness' he illustrates his ideas in terms that anyone could understand.  In 'Dynamic Hedging' he provides more insights into his trading strategies than he would have done had he been solely profit motivated, and likewise, as the boss of a fund that profits from other people's misconceptions of probability, he cannot have any reason to try to increase people's awareness of how the world really works other than a genuine desire to play the role of the teacher.  Many have attacked the book as arrogant, but it must be remembered that anyone who goes against the common ways of thinking is essentially suggesting that he or she understands things better than do most people and therefore cannot help but come off as arrogant.  Several times in the book Taleb specifically states that he falls victim to the tendencies that he condemns, and that the main difference that he sees between himself and others is that he is at least aware of it.  <br />Considering the fact that Taleb blatantly argues that many who consider themselves the rulers of the universe were in fact a group of lucky fools, it is inevitable that many will come away from it with a sense of anger and a refusal to believe it.  I am therefore almost surprised that the book has not drawn harsher reviews than it has, for Taleb was certainly not seeking to make friends through the publication of it.  I suspect that those who rate the book as poor fall into two general categories: those who were troubled by the thought that a considerable portion of their success may have resulted from luck, and those who are attached to their current views on the workings of the markets and are hostile to any new views on them.  These two categories naturally overlap quite often.  An important thing to remember is that even if you work very hard, not only are the outcomes of your projects the result, to varying extents, of chance, but chance also played a role in getting you to the position where you can work hard and actaully see it pay off.  Considering the complexity of the world we live in, and the infinite forces that push and pull on our lives, this book is critical to anyone who desires an objective veiw of how things come to be...
6305165912|5.0|I first saw \\"The Big Lebowski\\" when it was in the theatres.  Being a die-hard Coens fan, I was ready for inconsequential lunacy, esoteric characterizations, and dangerous obsessions with style and substance.  Which is what I got.  Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.  Having revisited \\"Lebowski\\" recently, I now understand why.  Ill prepared to deal with the rambling narrative, I felt cheated by lack of structure.  Which, I now see, is precisely the point of the film.  So, my advice to first time viewers of \\"The Big Lebowski\\": never mind the plot machinations, this one's all about watching (and listening to [and learning from]) The Dude.<br />Remember that stoner guy in high school, the one with the flashes of wit and insight in between spaced-out ramblings about his favourite rock band?  Well, then you are on your way to knowing Jeffrey \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski.  Mistaken by collecting thugs for a richer, more married, other Jeffrey Lebowski, The Dude gets caught up in a kidnapping caper when all he really wants to do is bowl and own a urine-free rug that really holds the room together.  His dialogue belies years of smoking jay and downing endless White Russians.  But The Dude is no Spicoli retread, and he'd never be caught dead with Bill and Ted.  Surprisingly, he's a man of substance.<br />His history, missed by me the first time around, plays a terribly important role in his character.  There's the scene where he's in bed with Maude Lebowski (daughter of The Big Lebowski), where she point blank asks him about his past.  Obscure references are made to the Port Huron Statement and the Seattle Seven, which indicates a fair measure of radicalism in Jeff's student days.  But he also casually tells Brandt (The Big Lebowski's manservant) that his university days were spent, \\"occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick [and] breaking into the ROTC\\".  So a social conscience was never far from young Jeff's thoughts.  But now, some two decades later, he's burned out.  It's the yearning for the casual lifestyle, free from stress and, quite frankly, thought, that is the main theme at the core of the movie.<br />Standing in The Dude's way are a series of supporting characters that make up a Raymond Chandleresque menagerie of society's oddest oddballs (a group of nihilists with a defined sense of fairness; a trust-fund performance artist; an old-school pornographer; a bowling child molester; a seemingly endless parade of carpet pissers).  But they are less characters than roadblocks to The Dude's ultimate goal: a life of leisure.<br />Jeff Bridges, so adept at playing tormented angst (\\"The Fabulous Baker Boys\\", \\"The Fisher King\\"), proves that he has a deft comic touch, without ever being light.  His Dude is a scruffy sloth, impatient with the world around him, but unable to figure out a viable way out of it.  Bridges is truly hilarious here, never more so than with a simple expression near the end, when one character literally gets in his face.  Assisting Bridges on his quest for leisure nirvana are John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.  Goodman's Walter Sobchak is, if possible, even more over the top than The Dude.  A conspiracy minded Vietnam vet, Sobchak is the raving id to The Dude's laid-back id, which makes them fast friends, and a terrible team.  Buscemi, in what may be the most thankless role in the entire Coen canon, brings enough humanity to the eternally dim Donny that he becomes less a cipher and more an important friend.  The rest of the cast is a fine mixture of Coen regulars, recognizable character actors, and even a couple of my favourite musicians in small cameos (look closely for Flea and Aimee Mann as two of the Nihilists).<br />But it's probably Sam Elliott who makes the most undeniable impression here, as a smooth talking cowboy enigmatically called \\"The Stranger\\".  His thick southern drawl, bushy moustache, and constantly twinkling eyes brighten up the few brief scenes he's in.  Ostensiblythe narrator (and who else but the Coens could dream up a narrator who loses his train of thought?), Elliott appears once at the beginning, once in the middle, and once again at the end.  He offers low-key charm for The Dude to play off of (one of my favourite jokes in the film:<br />THE STRANGER: One of those days, huh?  Well, a wiser fellow than myself once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, well, he eats you.<br />DUDE:  Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?  [Mike's note:  Oh yeah!  The whole Eastern philosophy thing is a great, subtle undercurrent throughout the film.  The Dude abides, indeed.  Catch him doing faux Tai Chi when he needs to mellow out more than the marijuana can handle.]<br />THE STRANGER:  Far from it.).<br />Ultimately, I suppose, \\"Lebowski\\" is a product of the Coen Brothers' minds, and its laced with their particular obsessions, stylistic devices, and eclectic musical choices (imagine scoring a tense bowling moment with a flamenco version of \\"Hotel California\\").  If you've enjoyed the Coens' anti-filmmaking in the past, and are prepared for an even more extreme example of it, take a quick trip with The Dude and Co.  You'll surely enjoy the ride.<br />(The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features, except for a nifty 30-minute interview with Joel and Ethan Coen.  It's a rare treat, offering a trip into the brothers' witty, eccentric, but thoughtful filmmaking minds.  Their anecdote about an interview they gave to a magazine called \\"Floor Coverings Weekly\\" is priceless, and it shows their playfulness and willingness to mock anyone not in on the joke.)
B000056C6L|4.0|Thus begins that experience known as Gong.  Perhaps Radio Gnome Invisible is the mohter of all concept albums.  Essentially these pothead pixies come to earth in a flying teapot to spread love.  There are also these Octive Doctors who spread good feeling so such.  Much has been said about this band, and whether it is justified is a matter of your personal judgment.  This album did not come across very strongly to me at first, and it still doesn't.  Daevid Allen (one-time member of the Soft Machine before their first album was ever released) just doesn't have that extensive of a vocal range.  His style is very comparable to Richard Sinclair of Caravan.  Gilli Smyth's voice, however, isn't.  Her willow-wisp style delivery is one of the winning points of Flying Teapot-if anything her presence (which, if you like, you should check her out on The Owl and the Tree album-even more smokey and surreal!) on this album inspired the others to rise above the helium mentality that seems to pervade throughout.  This is not to say that the album doesn't have its moments.  \\"Witch's Song\\" is great.  \\"The Octave Doctors\\" is downright futuristic and haunting, albeit brief.  And of the course the title song, should go down in legend.  It's relentless and driving; if only Gong had done more of this kind of fushion-progressive rock and less of the, well . . . \\"Pothead Pixies\\".  Ah, but then where would be that Canterburian whimsy?   By the time of the You album, however, Gong seemed to have gotten their instramental game down.  Vocals for the most part have been cast to the wind and emphasis is more on tight playing.  If there is an international equivalent to Gong and the maniacal (but often brilliant) shifts in rhythm and tempo, it would be in Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention.
6304493681|4.0|I consider myself a good fan of anime and I can safely say that this is a good one. The story is confusing the first time you watch it, but the more you watch it, the more you can appreciate it. The animation is great. Great details and buildings. This is one to add to your collection if your an anime fan. Get the subtitled one though. So if your a fan and you liked Akira, Princess Mononoke, Vampire Hunter D or Cowboy Beebop, Its a good bet you'll like this. This is one of the first anime's that really made me think. It has a good plot full of deep and developed characters. So go pick this one up.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Combine the genius of the late Stanley Kubrick (probably the best director of all time) and Steven Spielberg and you get the must moving piece of story telling ever.  This movie will outlast all the dumb criticism thrown against it.  Truly a masterpiece.
B00000JCB2|2.0|Ok, first off I only gave this cd 2 stars because I happen to like 4 songs, which are \\"Nookie,\\" \\"Rearranged,\\" \\"Break Stuff,\\" and \\"Just Like This.\\" I hate getting cds where only half of the songs are good, and this is a major dissapointment. Whatever they did on 3 Dollar Bill Y'all$ they should've stuck with it while making this cd. \\"N2Gether Now\\" is by far the worst song on this cd, but there are more like it on it unfortunately. I like Limp Bizkit and all, but I think what happened is that ... Fred Durst prolly decided that he was going to be in charge of everyone else and tell them what to do and how to do it, it's no wonder this cd came out so [bad], and while Chocolate Starfish was a huge step up from this cd music-wise, the lyrics are much much worse on this one. Fred Durst should either get off his pedestle and stop thinking that no one is better than he is, or just quit the group entirely, which would be better for all of us in the long run. DO NOT BUY THIS CD, and after they get that new guitarist and come out with a new cd, do not buy it either, because I want Limp Bizkit to break up, since I highly doubt Fred Durst is going to just leave.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Presumably if you are thinking of purchasing this 5-Star editition of the Sound of Music, you have a pretty good idea of the plot.  It is based on the true lives (but in an accelerated time frame) of an Austrian family that sang together as a folk-musical group.  Julie Andrews plays the governess who wins the hearts of the children and their widower father, while teaching them how to sing together.  As such, the excuse for spontaneously bursting into song is reasonably logical, and the tunes themselves are catchy and well-performed.  <br />The performances, from the unknown (at the time) child actors to the veterans Christopher Plummer (as the patriarch) and Eleanor Parker, are consistently great.  Robert Wise lends a sure hand in his direction, filming in and around Salzburg and the Austrian Alps, but without allowing the scenery to overpower the actors and dialogue.  The quality of the video is very good, and the sound is certainly better than on my old VHS copy.<br />The DVD has a good deal of useful extras.  Most interesting is the discussion from Lehman (the screenwriter) on the search for a director.  He also discusses the differences between the stage version and the film version (rearrangement of songs and scenes).  There is a fairly long making-of feature that is very interesting, but could have been improved with more information on the real von Trapps, as opposed to focussing mainly on the making of the film.  Interviews with a number of the principles, from Andrews, Wise, and Plummer, through the costume designer and a few of the actors portraying the children make it a well-rounded and informative set of extras.  In a very nice touch, the length of all the extras is displayed on the menu, so you can arrange your viewing schedule easily.<br />All-in-all, this is a fantastic DVD, with lots of extras and good quality transfer.  The movie itself is one of my all-time favourites (certainly my favourite film version of a Broadway musical), so I was very pleased to get this DVD edition.
6304169558|4.0|Twister was written to bring light on the subject of storm chasing.  Now, everyone who actually does this knows that not even the most expert storm chaser can run into 150 tornadoes in one day!  Let alone are there any stupid enough to set the cruise control on their brand new, self-repairable Dodge Ram pickup (unless you're a Ford fan, that is) and let one of these monstrous storms eat it up.<br />Helen Hunt made for an awesome \\"Jo.\\"  I think that she was incredible in this movie, going after what all meteorologists do, finding out what makes tornadoes tick.  While getting ready for one of those chases that will take them half way through Kansas.  Bill Paxton (as \\"Bill\\") shows up before Hunt's chase day begins with his new fianc&eacute;e, Melissa.  Hunt is still in love and not letting go, having been married to Paxton, she still wears his ring.  Covering it with her class ring, she signs divorce papers that Paxton has asked her to sign; deliberately \\"forgetting\\" one page.  Storms are a'brewin, and the chase team takes off.  Melissa asks Paxton if Hunt signed the divorce papers, realizing that she didn't, Paxton and his fianc&eacute;e take off chasing after the team to get Hunt's signature.  The rest it nothing but chasing twisters, etc.<br />I do believe that if this hadn't made out to be a love story (like Titanic and Pearl Harbor), it would've actually been fun.  Of course, there are obvious traits this movie follows (flying \\"stuff\\" everywhere, incl. cows, combines, semi's, etc.), and you can tell when stunt doubles come in.  Yes, there was even a stunt double for the Dodge Ram (or it's got some sort of cloning device allowing it to repair its own windshield in a span of nanoseconds).<br />But, for us weather geeks, there's not a whole lot of other movies out there for us to watch and be happy with.  Maybe next time?
B00003CXI1|4.0|Let me be honest. When the fourth book of the series was released and people went wild, I had no idea who Harry Potter was. I did my research, saw the trailers for the film, then actually went and saw it a few days after it was released. I was less than impressed with the film.(Take into account I had not read the books up to this point.) Don't get me wrong, the idea, the whole concept behind the film was great, but it the whole movie to me was, well, boring. After seeing the movie I decided to read the books. The sorcerer's stone is a fantastic book. Very enjoyable reading, and as I was reading it, I could picture the scenes of the movie in my mind. I have just about finished the second book, having started it only yesterday, and am actually looking forward to the Chamber of secrets in theaters. I'm going to give the movie a second chance when it comes out on DVD, because now I understand more about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon.
0689815816|5.0|This is one of my three-year-old daughter's favourite books. The repetitive, sing-song chorus (\\"We're going on a bear hunt, we're going to catch a big one...\\") and the sound effects, as the family passes through tall grass, mud, a river, a forest and a snowstorm before reaching the bear's cave, will delight any pre-schooler. (For even more fun, use your child's teddy bear as a prop when the bear in the story finally makes his appearance.)<br />This book is great fun for both parent and child. It's one you won't soon tire of reading.
0684833395|5.0|I'm the 357th person to review this book.  The average rating so far is 4 1/2.  Why are you bothering to read my review, isn't that recomendation enough?<br />You want more? Fine.<br />I give this book 5 stars because it is the most ingenious, funny and entertaining book I have read in a long time.  It is not so much a novel, but a collection of stories about a squadron group in WW2 which somehow all tie in together.  Each character has their own foibles, and each is described in amusing detail.  At time it does repeat itself (how many times is Snowden's death referred to?), but this doesn't detract from the great wartime yarns that are being told.  All in all, a very funny read that 9 out of 10 people will love.<br />There, now what are you waiting for? Put it in your shopping cart, NOW!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is truly a superb masterpiece! Kylie Minogue, is unique like Madonna who has blended the latest genres of futuristic dance music. It's such a surprise to finally have her album released in the US. Ever since songs like &quot;Breathe&quot; from her Australian 97' release, &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, she has defined the genre of dance music. This CD has a bit of everything. From the synth-pop classic &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;, to such beautiful ethereal lyrics with a sort of a trance/ambient feel in the song, &quot;Fragile&quot;. By the way, if you're a fan of TRANCE as well as KYLIE MINOGUE, do check out her remix album which was released in Australia and Europe, titled, &quot;Impossible Remixes&quot;,which is truly mesmorizing containing remixes by Todd Terry, Sash!, Trouser Enthousiasts,and Nalin and Kane...
B00005RHGK|3.0|Jeepers Creepers is one of the better recent horror films. If it's director and writer, Victor Salva, had been able to sustain the mood he created in the movie's first third, it might have been a great one. Shortly before production began, he was informed that the picture's budget had been slashed. The result was the cutting of the shooting schedule from forty-five days to thirty-one and a lot less money for the art department, which is the one that creates special effects. In light of these constrains, he probably did the best he could.<br />Trish and Darry [Gina Phillips and Justin Long] are returning home from college. Trish, who was recently dumped by her boyfriend, wants to take the long way home, a decision that takes the pair down a lonely country road. In the middle of nowhere, an ominous, rusty old truck roars up behind them and nearly causes them to crash. It finally passes them, but a few miles later, they spot it parked by an abandoned church. They see its occupant tossing something large wrapped in a blanket down a big drainpipe. In a decision which could only happen in this kind of movie, they go back to investigate. What they find there is scary enough, but what put it there is much more so. And it knows who they are.<br />Horror movies come in several forms and often spill over into other genres, such as the psychological thriller. Jeepers Creepers is in the old-fashioned monster movie category, with shades of the occult. It's a cut above most recent efforts of this type. The music is quite atmospheric, and the photography and lighting are very professional. Salva knows how to set a scene up to maximize the effect on the audience. <br />Salva is a good film maker who needs to polish his scripts a little more. He does a really excellent job of making his main characters more interesting and believable than those we usually encounter in such fare, but this makes the dumb things they do seem particularly unlikely. Still, I liked Trish and Darry more than most horror movie main characters. After Darry sees what lies at the bottom of of that drain pipe, he goes into shock. I think this is a much more likely reaction than the emotionally dead, macho reaction you usually see. <br />Justin Long and Gina Phillips are quite good. Many actors seem to get their starts in horror movies. Jack Nicholson comes to mind. You can often spot the good ones, because they consistently give a fine performance whether the material demands it or not.<br />Some people don't like horror movies. For those who enjoy them, this is a good choice, especially considering how thin the selection has been recently.
B00005JKEC|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Denzel Washington.  He has brought so much magic, comfort and love to the silver screen and has become a wonderful role model of what it is to be a man and a powerful actor.  Every role he has played, particularly as Malcom X, has shown us strength and an ever present honesty and decency even when he is playing a man with slightly tarnished morals.  No matter what, you always love Denzel and know it's him!<br />When TRAINING DAY begins, we are introduced to Rookie Officer Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and his wife; a very boring couple.  The pace of the movie is slow for the first 7 or 8 minutes as we meet them and find out our rookie is beginning his first day in the narcotics division of the LAPD; a really nice promotion.  And he must go to meet his supervisor for this training day at a local coffee shop.  And there he is.  In all his wonderful glory - Mr. Denzel Washington sits at the booth, looking fine as wine in all black, reading a paper.  You are in love again, as you were in every one of his movies <BR>UNTIL....<BR>he opens his mouth to speak.<BR>And you suddenly realize THIS AIN'T DENZEL!!!<br />From the very first line spoken by Officer Alonzo Harris, you will be uncomfortable, frightened, intrigued, amazed and stupified.  His deliciously evil way of speaking, looking and acting will have you spellbound and scared to death.  He is beyond mean.  And you immediately wonder how poor rookie Hoyt will ever survive the day with this crazy man.<br />I found TRAINING DAY to be inventive and incredibly disturbing.  Yes, it has formulaic car crashes, violence and dialogue.  And the stereotypical latin and black criminals would seriously get on your nerves IF it weren't for the powerful performances by Denzel and Ethan.  This is a movie designed to showcase their acting ability and it does so in a powerful way.  But ever present is the underlying message that says this is how things actually are in many large urban cities.  As Alonzo says, \\"To catch a wolf,you have to become a wolf\\".  And that drives this movie and keeps your heart pumping at a mad pace till the very last line.  Halfway into the credits you'll suddenly realize it's over and stumble around wondering what kind of world are we living in.  YES, it will affect you like that!<br />In TRAINING DAY there were many lines of dialogue that stuck in my brain; some funny and some wild.  But without doubt, the most powerful one came after rookie Hoyt discovers he has been played by Alonzo all day.  That Alonzo has been planning Hoyt's destruction from the beginning and he accuses Alonzo of this fact with such naivety and surprise.  Alonzo turns to him and says, \\"[Expletive], this ain't no checkers!!  This is CHESS!!\\".  Meaning, nothing in life is about fun, it is calculated and each move done to advance the desired end result.<br />At the end of this movie, you will be wishing for - praying for - Officer Alonzo Harris to DIE!!  You will want that evil to be destroyed and for the rookie Hoyt to somehow get out of the web of evil spun for him by Alonzo.  You will throw popcorn at the screen.<br />And you will know, without the tiniest doubt, that who ever that evil guy is... it darn sure ain't Denzel.  THAT is the very discription of an actor who DESERVES A BEST ACTOR OSCAR!!!<br />I VERY HIGHLY recommend this movie.  PLEASE buy it.  And prepare to step outside your comfort zone.<BR>Dr. Braxy :o)
B00005RYKU|2.0|The problem with titling a movie The Glass House is that it tempts critics and viewers to throw verbal stones at it. I will try to avoid that temptation, as the movie already has plenty of cracks in it. <br />Strong thrillers are generally those in which the events are fairly plausible -- or at least they are believable enough for you not to question them until after the movie is over. A decent one is one in which the plot is silly but so much fun you put up with it. A mediocre thriller, such as The Glass House, is marred by plot holes so big that they bug you. You can't stop thinking about them. You begin to see the characters' actions as simply responses to the script's absurd demands. The actors start looking like people just working for a paycheck. <br />Sixteen year old Ruby [Leelee Sobieski] and her brother, Rhett [Trevor Morgan], who is twelve, are orphaned when their parents are killed in an auto accident. Their parents' will leaves the kids well provided for, but their choice of guardians is not good. They picked Terry and Erin Glass [Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane], supposedly their best friends. The couple moves Ruby and Rhett into their vast, ultramodern house in California's chic Malibu. The house is all glass, stainless steel, and cold blues, never a good sign for movie orphans. The first weird thing the Glasses do is to house the children together in the same room. Ruby immediately picks up on the strange vibes, while Rhett remains clueless throughout the movie, apparently having suffered permanent brain damage from too much Nintendo. Terry puts the moves on Ruby, while Erin, a pain management doctor, spends her time off shooting up drugs. Could they be after the kid's inheritance? Ruby tries to get help, but nobody believes her. They don't believe her either because the script tells them not to or because she frowns and mumbles all the time. <br />That part about having the same bedroom, which occurs early in the movie, was the first plot hole that threw me. The reason the Glasses do this is never addressed. It's not like there aren't a dozen bedrooms in the place. If the couple is plotting to do away with the kids, wouldn't having everything appear to be normal make sense? Why start off by alarming them? When Ruby goes to the family attorney, he points out that, if they are taken away from the Glasses, they will be made wards of the state. Why? Ruby and the audience find out at the start that she has an uncle in Chicago. Sure, until the funeral, he hasn't been to visit in ten years, but it's obvious he's a nice, caring guy. Best or worst of all is why the parents would entrust their children with the Glasses in the first place. They're obviously fruitcakes, good friends or not. <br />Sobieski, a young Helen Hunt look-a-like, is a fine actress, but she is lost in this material. The pain on her face looks as if it came from long fights with the director over her character's motivation. As the Glasses, Lane and Skarsgaard are great in their quieter moments but are laughable in the scenes where they must be over the top. Bruce Dern has a nice cameo as a sinister lawyer, as does Kathy Bates as a social worker. <br />The photography is first-rate and is the movie's strongest asset. The music is properly chilling. The plot's basic elements have successfully worked in other thrillers. It's too bad the writers' didn't think to watch them first.
B00003CXXP|1.0|There have been many praises for this movie's visuals. I think the visuals were horrible.  It does not contain the same visually stunning 'dialogue' that BladeRunner had, not even close.<br />The special effects were poor.  So what if they spent millions of dollars on special effects?  It certainly didn't look like it.  And sorry, I don't an FX degree to appreciate how hard it is to do something.  It's incredibly hard to make perfect steel spheres for ball bearings, does that mean I have to ooh and ahh at it? No.<br />And what about the junk yard scene?  It looked like the Thunderdome scene from the MadMAx series.<br />The visuals of this movie were about as bad/good as Waterworld.<br />In fact, if you want to see a good movie about robots. Please, go see BladeRunner again.  It deals with Love, Self-identity, memories, and just a whole lot more. And does it well.<br />If you want to see another robot movie that deals with jealousy, go see Saturn 5. If you want to see something campy, go see ShortCircuit If you want to see something really bad, go see this movie.
B00005R87Q|3.0|The Fast and the Furious is a good example of a trend that is fashionable in Hollywood these days -- taking a grade 'B' concept, idea or script and dressing it up as a grade 'A' movie. ...The movie revolves around the latest craze in street racing. Young people are taking the lowliest cars, such as Honda Civics, and converting them into lean, mean street machines. These vehicles are incredibly fast, their power often enhanced by nitrous oxide injectors. They look to be both dangerous and expensive, but that's a lot of their appeal. Frankly, I'd like to drive one myself.<br />The movie opens with a bang, a visual adrenaline / testosterone combo rush in which several guys and a girl in supercharged little black cars attack and rob a semi truck as it roars down an interstate highway. The scene reminds me of the old Westerns where robbers attacked a moving stagecoach. It's a silly scene because it's so obviously impossible, but it's also totally exhilarating to watch. In real life, if you absolutely must rob a semi, try one that's parked. <br />The plot involves a not-so-bright ...[man] named Brian [Paul Walker] who infiltrates a group of street racers led by the charismatic Dominic [Vin Diesel]. The group may or may not be the thieves. Along the way, Brian must prove his worth as a racer, and these scenes involve some rather amazing races along the streets of LA. He also manages to fall in love with Dominic's sister, Mia [Jordana Brewster]. Incidentally, the plot seems ... <br />Vin Diesel dominates the cast. He was also appealing in two movies in 2000, Pitch Black and Boiler Room. He is probably our next great action star. Paul Walker, who sounds like Keanu Reeves and looks like the young Rob Lowe, makes a good white bread kind of hero. Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez are great to look at, but this is a guy flick, so it's hard to gauge their acting skills here.<br />The Fast and the Furious is one of the most visually interesting movies of 2001. Director Rob Cohen keeps everything, well, fast and furious. The movie is in constant movement. The photography is outstanding. The colors and lighting create an LA that is appropriately dreamlike, since we know that all the things we are seeing could only really happen in a movie. This is street racing and crime as a fantasy. <br />This movie may be all style and no substance. It's a guilty pleasure, trash mixd with class....

0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan tells an ancient, yet meaningful story about four mothers and daughters. The mothers all come from China as immigrants to America, in the hope that they can forget their sorrowful pasts and plant their future hopes in America. The four daughters grow up as Chinese Americans, their hair and faces look Chinese, but inside they are Americans. To their mothers, they have lost the Chinese spirit. The four families meet each week to play mahjong and have meals together; they call it The Joy Luck Club. However, when one of its members is dead, Ying-ying, the daughters is asked to replace her mother's position in The Joy Luck Club. At a weekly gathering, a secret of Ying-ying's mother is revealed. Through the members of the Joy Luck Club, Ying-ying could finally trace her mother's Chinese spirit back. The way Amy Tan tells the story is really unique, the whole book is made up of numerous short stories by the mothers and the daughters. The author does a great job on narrating the struggle and pain behind each woman's back, and the misunderstandings between the mothers and the daughters waiting to be solved. As mentioned in the book, the mothers hope that their daughters can be raised in American circumstances with Chinese spirit, but their American born daughters seem to forget their roots. I can relate myself to the daughters in the book, because our mothers all have the same hopes and thoughts for their children to be successful. And sometimes her intentions put me under a lot of pressure, and I feel that my mother just wants to criticize everything I like. But after reading the book, I somehow realize that it's my mother's way of telling her own story and her spirit given by her mother. On my way reading the book, I actually get  confused by the characters because there are eight of them, and it is hard to keep track of all the names though I enjoyed it a lot. I highly recommend this book to everyone who's interested in Chinese culture and traditions, or anyone who has been struggled to understand the mother-daughter relationship.
B00004U8P9|5.0|how many campy cult classics do you know of which reigned supreme at the midnite cinema for nearly a decade or longer? here is a perfect example of a musical which has never left our heads and seems to do well with each new generation. probability suggests that rocky horror picture show will never go out of style and purchasing this dvd is the next best thing to seeing in in your local theatre on halloween night. HAVING BOUGHT SEVERAL ROCKY HORROR VIDEO TAPES THROUGH THE YEARS, none of the vhs tapes look nearly as good as this what with all the extras you are getting here and few had the deleted scenes many of us have been after for ages. if you are going to purchase rocky horror, this is the collector's dream come true. for those of us who haven't had the experience, you obviously don't know what you've been missing through the years. tim curry gave the performance of his career as the mad dr.frank-n-furter from the planet transylvania who has discovered the spark of life. in the early portion of the film, we find a young couple out for a bit of evening fun who end up stranded in the middle of nowhere with a flat tire. with nowhere to go and desperately trying to get out of the rain, they find themselves in a nearby castle surrounded by transylvanians weirdos. i won't bother telling you the rest because you really do need to see it for yourself to believe it but i say you are in for a real treat.  rocky horror is without doubt the greatest sci-fi horror spoof ever masquerading as a musical and certainly the most beloved film of it's kind. don't dream it.... be it !!!!
0553573403|5.0|George RR martin has really outdone himself, this is the most riveting and the best written fantasy i have ever read. The characters are done so well it's hard to beleive that this is an epic fantasy and not a history. the entire story is real to the reader, the plot is perfectly crafted with unexpected twists and turns. i would STRONGLY recomend this book to ANYONE, you don't have to be a fantasy reader to enjoy the song of ice and fire series.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I'm a big fan of &quot;failed&quot; Speilberg movies. I thought &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was brilliant. That &quot;Always&quot; was a great romance film. That &quot;1941&quot; was hilarious. So mixed reviews of AI didn't put me off.<br />Nonetheless, this film left me cold. The biggest problem for me was that the main character was a robot, and no matter how Speilberg tried to frame the audience's sympathies, I couldn't emotionally connect. To me, Osment's character had more in common with a mixmaster than with a human.<br />Speilberg's homages to Kubrick also got in the way more than once. Particularly in the last third of the film where the music, structure and direction were clearly meant to invoke the final 20 minutes of 2001: A Space Oddysey.<br />Two more off-putting elements: Robin William's completely dissonant cartoon/Einstein voicing of &quot;Dr. Know&quot; attempting to add comedy to a scene which should have been played much straighter. And a third act that is, well, out of this world. (I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say the plot twist belongs to an entirely different genre of sci-fi.)<br />That being said, Osment's performance is remarkable. (He never blinks in the entire film.) And the special effects, particularly the &quot;Super Toy&quot; teddy bear, are eye-popping.<br />&quot;AI&quot; is Speilberg's &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, but you'd be better served by his &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (&quot;Hook&quot;) if your in the mood for a fairy tale. Or &quot;1941&quot; if you want to see a Ferris wheel collapse.
B00005UEAR|5.0|great music, great lyrics, great mix, great artwork and great PROGduction!!!!
B00003CXXP|4.0|This is an ambitious, visually stunning, thought provoking, ultimately disturbing film.  I haven't been so moved by a film is quite a while.  Flawed?  Yes.  Lengthy?  Absolutely.  But I'll be watching it again!  <BR>Spielberg has the edge when it comes to pulling at our heartstrings -- I couldn't help but be reminded of Empire of the Sun.  Haley Joel Osment is a REMARKABLE talent and should have had an Oscar nomination for this role!  <BR>I was so moved by the themes in this film -- humans searching to fill emotional voids, mechas striving to serve a purpose, the ugliness and irresponsibility of our culture, the beauty of perseverence.  <BR>Most of all I was moved by the child's unrelenting desire to be truly loved by his mother.  It reminds me of so many children, neglected, abused, even abandoned, who hold out hope for the Blue Fairy. <BR>This is a parable to teach us about humanity and our responsiblity to the life we create.
0553573403|5.0|I bought this off the shelf of a bookstore that was closing out its inventory. This was about the only book left on the shelf. I opened the cover, started reading and fell in love. Martin has a way of making you feel the cold wind blow on your neck as you walk the wall with Jon. The only drawback is waiting for the next book. This is the only series I will buy in hardcover w/o even looking at the price. I feel the characters pain ,triumphs, fears and laughter.  I am truly impressed by this series and am constantly checking for the 4th book...I had also read the other author. So if you are looking for a great book, read this series, but I warn you.... the wait for number 4 is a killer!!!!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I think that this movie is great!!! Except for that some of the ideas and settings in the book don't happen in the movie. But other than that I thought that it was an excellent movie. I would recamened this movie to anyone who likes mistery and whole lot of fun!!!
B00005RYLE|5.0|These are three of the best horror films of all time, if you have never seen one of the Evil Dead films, then you are in for a real treat. The first film is more intense and scary than the last two films but they are a lot funnier (The scene in the second film with the laughing deer had me on the floor laughing). Bruce Campbell's one-liners are hilarious and the gory special effects are a delight to horror fans everywhere. A great series to put on DVD.
B00005S8FC|5.0|A beautiful marriage between tango (replace the syllables TAN-GO, hence the name GO-TAN project)and electronic music, this CD represents the finest example of chillout/lounge music stream. Both Piazzolla and Buddha-Bar/Hotel Costes fans will not be disappointed. Highly recommended.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|I bought this CD without knowing too much about Aphex Twin.  I am a fan of Radiohead's latest stuff, and I heard Aphex Twin was an influence.  Upon a first listen, the parallels between this album and Radiohead's tracks such as 'Everything in its right place,' and 'Kid A' are obvious.  Its pretty amazing to think the songs on this album were recorded over ten years ago.<br />The more you play this CD, the more you want to listen to it.  Its very strange.  Some songs which seemed to go on too long on a first listen, suddenly don't last long enough.  There is beauty in its simplicity.  The contrast of a thumping bass with a quiet, delicate melody just works for some reason.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is brilliant! Baz Luhrmann has successfully reinvented the movie musical genre, one that has been untouched for quite some time. Everyone in the cast (especially Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor) is wonderful! The huge amount of acclaim and awards that this film has received should speak for itself.<br />Get ready for the most spectacular and elaborate circus of a movie ever filmed!
068484267X|5.0|A heartbreaking but warm and funny tale of an unfortunate Irish family, told through the eyes of a child. Despite miserable poverty, an alcoholic father, and the death of three siblings, Frank manages to work his way towards a dream of returning to America. Major hardships are the backbone of the novel, but the author's use of colloquial language and religious symbolism adds lightheartedness to the suffering. A novel that can make you laugh out loud and choke with tears in the same chapter is definitely worth 5 stars, if not more.
B000005Z0E|5.0|A young 2pac releases his 1st classic album names 2pacalypse now.<BR>An awesome cd with old school beats and impressive lyrics from a young boy soon to be the greatest rapper of all time.<br />It starts off with \\"YOUNG BLACK MALE\\" one of my favourites on the cd, he raps fast with a nice beat.At this age 2pac was angry and agressive and showed it through the song \\"WE DONT GIVE A ****\\", this is also one of my favourites on the cd.Another favourite is \\"IF MY HOMIE CALLS\\" i enjoy this song with a great beat and good lyrics.Everyone knew this kid had talent and the <BR>DRAMATIC song \\"BRENDA'S GOT A BABY\\" shore does show it.It is a sad story and what is even more sad is that it is true and does happen, this song no doubt is a CLASSIC.The last song is \\"PART TIME MUTHA\\" which is another sad story, have a listen and you will know why, it has some good lyrics also.<br />2pacalypse now is a must have CLASSIC in your rap collection and 2pac collection.With some CLASSIC songs that still make an IMPACT now, be shore you dont miss out on this SUPERB album.<br />HIGHLY RECOMENDED
B0000035E7|4.0|Let's get it out the way straight away. Bleach is not better than In Utero or Nevermind, but this doesn't mean it isn't a fantastic album. It was made cheap and while this would usually constrain it instead comes through perfectly in the fuzz and dirty feel of the sound produced.<br />1) BLEW - Classic slice of rumbling grunge as the song balances not only the growl of Kurt's voice but a spiked guitar and thudding bass, which brings the song in perfetly with it's unearthly grumble. Already Kurt shows his voice to be very distinctive and impressionable.<br />2) FLOYD THE BARBER - Dirty and abrasive. While you may not be always able to tell what Kurt is saying he puts across a lot of character with a growl melting into almost a coo at points. Sounds very muddy.<br />3) ABOUT A GIRL - Classic. Rolls along a prickly guitar and Kurt's tempered tones. Lovely song about (whatelse) a girl.<br />4) SCHOOL - Lovely angsty number that stirs up the fury if you understand some of the pains of school. Its also kinda cool how's it jokey by reducing school trauma down to the lack of recess ie; the lack of getting a break from school. Really demonstrates the passion Kurt could put into his lyrics through his vocal style.<br />5) LOVE BUZZ - Gnarly piece, thats a little love ditty but put over with \\"buzz\\"ing guitars, clashing drums and a strangely jingling bass. Really cool when everything starts going a little crazy at the end.<br />6) PAPER CUTS - Lures you in with a hooked guitar sound, thumping drums and a jagged voice that flips between smooth and sour at a flick. Well deserved name as the guitar and voice combo feel like a quick little cuts at the audience in their tempered bitterness.<br />7) NEGATIVE CREEP - Racuous grunge number that most fans can simpify with, haven't we all felt a Negative Creep at times. Kurt is at his most ferocious here and the guitar wails along with screams. One of their most biting numbers. The Machine Head cover is pretty cool, check it out.  <br />8) SCOFF - Similar to school in it's pace. Simple thumping background sound. One of the more average numbers on the album I'd say.<br />9) SWAP MEET - Lovely aggressive guitar running through, running fluidly with the roar of Cobain. The background buzz here spikes and lashes out. Nicely underscored number.<br />10) MR MOUSTACHE - Picks up the pace nicely after the slight meandering of Swap Meet, with everything paced up and racing. As always the most destinctive thing here is the guitar rangle and the growling vocals.<br />11) SIFTING - Again we slow down again for this extended number. As ever the great thing about the sound is how heavy, thick and muddy it appears. Its also good how they follow up the fairly samey rift and sound in the previous by having one that goes out on tangents with the guitar soloing halfway through etc. The meandering tone though an grate if you've paying attention to the progression.<br />12) BIG CHEESE - Lovely the intro sound here. Drums are calmer here where elsewhere they'd been thudding and despite the bile poured into this number everything rattles along with leisure. Kurt's voice eases up in parts a little here, although he's never far from the next growl.<br />13) DOWNER - Ain't no downer! Paced number clocking in at under 2 minutes at they rattle through this fiery number, everything raing for the end of the album. This is a great ender, although 13 tracks? Purposeful?<br />So in all, a firey, aggresive slice of grunge dripping in mud and thick in fuzz. Some bits feel like they've holding up at time and some songs ain't Nirvana firing on all cannons but this contains numerous classics and some great rollickers!
B00005BF9Z|5.0|When Manu toured the UK recently he was billed as 'an out of control office party in Cuba'. This just shows the ignorance of the PR team. Although Manu loves Cuban music its influence is not that obvious on this album. Far more evident is the influence of Mexican Rock. Listen to the radio samples and you can't help but think of the El Gran Silencio album 'Radio Poder'. Listen to the guitar rift on 'Me Gustas tu' and you are reminded of 'Pez' by Cafe Tacuba. The lyrics of 'Me Gustas Tu' made me think of the end of 'El Borrego' also by Cafe Tacuba. Of course, there are other influences too numerous to mention- reggae, jazz, etc. It seems Manu has drawn inspiration from all over the place. I'm prepared to bet that the song 'Le rendez-Vous' came into his head whilst he was watching the third part of Eric Rohmer's film 'Le Rendez-Vous a Paris' with English subtitles- on the subtitled English version of the film the words 'Stop it' as a translation for 'Ca suffit' strangely make their appearance on the screen before the French dialogue- a fact which clearly stuck in Manu's mind. This album is more up-tempo than Clandestino, more varied but seems less personal. I have given up trying to decide which album I prefer but please Manu: less songs in English (make the English learn your languages). My favorite songs on this album are 'Mi vida', 'Vaca loca' and 'Le rendez-vous'. The version of 'Denia' is a weaker version of a song he recorded with Algerian singer Idir which has a fantastic French lyric about women's rights in Algeria.
0793518326|5.0|...When I saw anounced this book in here I think it was too expensive, but I read the recomendations and I found it very good. So I decided to buy it. Finally it arrive, and I FELL IN LOVE with it. It was just.....perfect. Has all the songs (exept Free as a Bird, and Real Love) And well, I think it has only the notes for guitar, but also has notes for the 2 guitars,the bass and drums. I mean you can make your own band. So it´s the best inversion if you are a really fan of THE BEST BAND EVER.<br />PS. They have to be THE BEATLES
0345409671|5.0|You're probably wondering why I titled my review, &quot;Disturbing in a way I cannot articulate.&quot; and then gave the book five stars.  The answer is simple, really.<br />It's incredibly well written and imaginative.<br />Anne Rice is famous for pushing the envelope with what society thinks is acceptable.  That's one of the reasons I love her work so much.  She has the courage to write what she envisions, social morays be damned.  I respect that.<br />Her imagery and descriptions in this book are haunting and unnerving, yet she presents it with a poet's grace.  This book made me think.  Actually, it made me think about things I didn't want to think about.  Things I found disturbing and frightening.  That's why I cannot read it a second time, as I do with most of her books.  But she did it with her charateristic elegance and brilliance - which is why I gave it five stars. It's beautifully written.<br />A remarkable book for those open-minded and intellectual enough to read it.  For me - it caused nightmares of the most vivid and horrific kind.  Your average vampire story just can't do that.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is a very absorbing novel about a super-genius preteen, Ender Wiggins and his militaristic growth and training to become mankind's savior in the interstellar war against the enigmatic buggers, a reticent, ruthless, mysterious race of ant/ human hybrids. The majority of the story follows Ender's training at Battle School, the \\"basic training\\" for all soldiers and commanders in Ender's futuristic, war-threatened time. At Battle School he faces manipulation and ostracization at the hands of both his teachers and fellow students, but, despite the odds Ender always seems to emerge triumphant, overcoming bullies, loneliness, isolation, and the incredible pressure of being the world's only hope for survival.<BR> The diction in Ender's Game is dogmatically simple and succinct, making it a fast and enjoyable read. At times, however, it becomes difficult to relate to Ender for readers uninitiated or unfamiliar with the military, or for those not proficient or uncomfortable with scientific theory. Also, the characters, especially Ender and his siblings, have a certain ability to distance themselves from the reader, as it may become hard to completely empathize with children who possess the intelligence to manipulate public opinion through subtle, clever \\"internet\\" editorials or with pre-adolescents with the ruthlessness to kill remorselessly. However, despite this fairly unavoidable distancer, Ender's Game is still definitely a page-turner.
B00005B36H|5.0|Let me just say I am not a fan of metal or even really heavy rock. I'm a prog-rock girl, and my favorite album ever is Yes' CLOSE TO THE EDGE. A funny thing happened though. My husband was playing this album and although I thought it was heavy and abrasive at times, I was intrigued. It almost reminded me of a heavier, surreal kind of King Crimson. The drumming was unbelievable, and the depth and texture of sound was entrancing. I'm amazed that this band gets on MTV. LATERALUS isn't anything like what you hear on the radio. As my husband played it more, I liked the songs and started playing the cd on my own. The heavy parts I once disliked became powerful enhancements to the song's philosophical lyrics. Maynard James Keenan is one of the most powerful vocalists I've heard. He can sing so many emotions it rivals anybody. My favorite songs are &quot;Schism, which has a weird ambient middle and a powerful ending. And &quot;Reflection&quot; which has amazing percussion and hypnotzing vocals. It's also the longest song on LATERALUS. This is a cd I would have never expected to like, but it's one of my recent favorites. We might have to buy a second copy because we each need one in our cars.
B0000009XP|4.0|I am amazed at Frank-John Hadley's snobby dis of \\"I Smell A Rat.\\"  In fact, I think that \\"Rat,\\" which is essentially an excuse for a killer 9-minute guitar meltdown, is the ONLY reason to buy this CD!  The rest of the CD is fairly ordinary. <br />And I must say that this Hadley fellow sounds like a boring super-anal blues purist, the definition-oriented type who \\"frowns on distorted guitar\\" because Robert Johnson didn't have a stompbox. Guess that Muddy Waters wasn't \\"allowed\\" to pick up that electric guitar, eh?
0399134204|4.0|Reading The Joy Luck Club is something I will always remember.  Amy Tan unfolds the Chinese-American culture right before your eyes as she develops eight complex characters.  The book tells of mother-daughter relationships in four families.  Each mother writes 2 stories and each dughter does the same.  The daughters' stories deal with the hardships of being a first-generation Chinese-American while the mothers' stories deal with the pain of watching their daughters forget their Chinese heritage.  I would recomend this book  to any female it would be a great read for a mother and daughter to share together.
1573222038|4.0|I'm in the middle of this book now, so bear with me.<br />First off, discovering Sarah Waters was the most exciting thing to happen to my recreational reading life in years.  I'd rate Tipping the Velvet at 10 and Affinity at a slightly disappointed 7.<br />As I get to about the halfway point at this book, I have to say I like it slightly more than Affinity but less than Tipping.  SW seems to really get into the complicated plot twists - and I'm talking more about the not-really-believable surprise-switcheroo kinds of twists found in Affinity, not the \\"ooh, now the heroine is embarking on an unexpected adventure\\" ones of Tipping.  Also, less sex (than Tipping) and more cerebral angst (life Affinity) make it a less joyful reading experience than it probably could be.<br />Anyway, I'm exaggerating with the nitpicking here - there is plenty of (good) melodrama, great characters and description.  Had serious trouble putting it down to come to work this morning.<br />I hope this one has a happier ending than Affinity.
0385505833|1.0|This book shows the worst side of people.  Even the protagonists were not admirable in any way. A truly boring and odious story.  I forced myself to keep reading it because I thought Grisham might have some redeeming message to send to the reader. Alas, it was a terrible read right up to the last page.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Well hear it is:<BR>If you don't know what the movie is about please read...I only want to say that if you like special effects in movies this one was great. <BR>DVD features:<BR>They have a version of the movie with some deleted scenes (9 minutes longer) which is better then just having the deleted scenes seperate. <BR>A commentary of the special effects guy is included within the normal version of the movie. It is well worth listening to. very entertaining. <BR>Good Documentary and well worth the price for just the extras.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This film began with the collaboration of Spielberg and Kubrick and the result is less than the sum of the potentials of the two directors.<br />The film fails to convey the potent acuity and complexity of  Kubrick.  The moral issues and dilemmas of a robots capacity to love and be loved could have been explored more deeply (as the opening scenes seems to suggest), but instead the film becomes an exercise (not surprisingly) in special effects ...(re: Planet of the Apes-esque post apocalyptic New York & ET/Close Encounters/Abyss aliens effects).  Unfortunately the special effects without substance becomes tiring and ultimately boring. <br />On the otherhand Spielberg's panache and strengths in presenting wildly exciting and humorous entertainment seems to almost have been \\"held back\\" by his concern to pay hommage to Kubrick's more serious vision and ideas.  <br />This film bears some similarities to Bicentennial Man released a few years earlier with Robin Williams.  It may have been more comic book-ish, but it certainly had more emotional impact and is more memorable than AI.<br />One thing is certain:  Osment's performance is extraordinary.

0451196716|5.0|This was one of the greatest books ever written by Richard Bachman aka Stephen King. I very seldomly read books, but I've read many of Stephen King's, and this one is my favorite. The reason it was so great was the way we really got to know the characters, the surroundings/environment, and you knew what was going on all the time. What so scary is the fact that this is something that might actually happen decades into the future, as a rather sick way of population control, but this book was excellent, and the ending... well, read the book. That ending was something else.

0871137380|4.0|Before I started to read this book, i took some ideas in my head about what good literature is to me.  I came upon some good themes that I would like to elaborate upon.  One major theme that  I came upon was how intense the book was.  I love reading intense books becuase they keep me occupied and they give me a good visual aid.  Mark, the author, was a very good descriptive writer that kept the reader hooked.  I realized he was a good author because I kept a mental picture in my head throughout the whole book which helped  me to better understand it. I always had problems reading a book if I couldn't form an image to it, but for this story, I could easily develop a picture. The main conflict  was about the Delta Force's mission to transport the other men in and out fo the city and safetly.<BR>One way that the authour delivered  his message was through the main plot when the Delta Force entered the city under heavy fire.  I think that his main message to the reader was the act of heroism and how it affected everyone else, in a good way.  It began when the main character was under heavy fire at nght and he had to throw a flash bulb on top of the roof to show the helicopter where teh enemy was so they could take them down. The intensity of the guy and his actions were very exciting.  I could jsut imagine him in the nightime, running under heavy fire, bullets flying in the air, inches from his whole body and then he grabs the falash bulb, pulls the pin and throws it. <BR>The story was very good, and descriptive and I recommend it to anyone who likes intense, action pack books.  It had all elements of great literature.
0446364495|1.0|I too read it because of the hype. I was told that I wouldn't be able to stop the tears from falling. The only tears I experience were tears of boredom and frustration. I just couldn't seem to like any of the characters at all and in the end I gave up trying.<BR> Unless you like reading sentimental pap....don't bother with it.
080018789X|5.0|Tom Cruise is at the top of his game with this movie. He's perfect for the role of a sports agent, mainly because of his long-term star status, dealings with agents, and high school athletic background, enough said. Renee Zellweger comes across as the perfect [messed] up girl-next-door, loyal to a fault, but the character widens as the story goes along. A good point to bring up is the inclusion of Paul McCartney's \\"Junk\\" (there are two: \\"Singalong Junk,\\" and \\"Junk\\" both on the \\"McCartney\\" album and I suspect that \\"Junk\\" is the actual song used as I didn't hear the lyrics, maybe it's in the credits and I missed it. The movie is about a fired sports agent who is trying to hold on to his one client (Cuba Gooding, Jr.,) his girlfriend (Zellweger) and his new business. Cruise seemed to bottom out after \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" and bombed with \\"Days of Thunder\\" (which I thought was a good \\"Top Gun\\" on wheels.

Jerry McGuire is as much a classic as \\"Top Gun.\\"
B00005YU1O|5.0|I've seen this film four times now, and love it.  It is as enlightening as it is visually stunning, and fills the viewer up from beginning to end.  It's basically a very lengthy deep conversation with people who have a refreshingly grounded sense of reality.  It has a good message, without being preachy, and doesn't force any opinions.  The web site is also entertaining.
6305127689|5.0|Top Gun can be best remembered as a future star producer. Tom Cruise solidified his status as a leading man, Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, and Kelly McGillis rounded out an ensemble cast that today would be too expensive to put together. Sadly, Anthony Edwards (Revenge of the Nerds I & II) who showed so much promise fell to the B-List of actors. Tom Skerritt, in one of his best roles, turned into the same fate. I should add McGillis (Witness,) because she's a no-show at present and has been for a long time. The movie is by far one of the best aerial cinematography of our Navy planes in action, even to this day. The storyline appears at first to be a \\"run & gun,\\" high-octane splash, but the middle change in velocity is both saddening and a frightful reality of aviators. The inner selves of the characters begin to deepen and the ending isn't predictable. Top Gun is one of the finest movies that defined the 80's.&lt;P...

B00005QZWI|4.0|Howard Shore had a virtually impossible task.  How DOES one go about composing a score for a movie based on a book beloved by hundreds of millions of people over the last half-century?  Inevitably, some will approve, and some won't.  Does the music match the story as the reader can imagine it?  If so, the reader is likely to approve!  If not, then the reader is likely to disapprove.<br />This reader (text 20 times) and viewer (movie 3 times) feels that Shore did his job well.  I can play the music (as I am right now) and see the scenes from the movie in my mind -- and more importantly, the music has added to, rather than detracted from, my reading and re-reading of the book itself.<br />Even if you have not seen the movie, if you love the book, give the soundtrack a chance.  I don't believe that you will be disappointed.
0312932081|5.0|I don't want to say much, just that you absolutly must read this book, it's absolutely amazing. I haven't read the sequals yet, but I am sure I am going to, after I finish reading this one again.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Upon 1st listen to this disc, I was like, eehhhh. Its OK. After lsitening to it a 2nd, 3rd, ... time I found more and more to LOVE about this disc.<br />Wow. Just Wow. What a disc. Some of my favorite tracks : &quot;Firecracker&quot;, &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;Nobody Girl&quot;.<br />This is a MUST HAVE disc.
0399226907|5.0|I had this same book as a child, and now my two daughters are enjoying the life of this infamous caterpillar and his incredible appetite.  Both children are sitting here saying they love it, as I am writing this.  It is a fun book with its \\"holes\\" that have been eaten through the pages, and become a preschoolers introduction to science/biology when the little caterpillar turns into a beautiful butterfly.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Well, this is basically the \\"soundtrack\\" to the live DVD that was released earlier that year, and it's soooo nice to hear top-notch production on all these songs that until now was only available on bootlegs! :) We get a complete live rendition of Scenes from a Memory, plus a second live set featuring \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\", \\"Learning to Live\\", and \\"A Change of Seasons\\". They pulled out all the stops for this 7/30/00 Roseland show, including backup singers, a live narrator, and a soprano sax player on \\"Another Day\\". There seems to be a minimum of overdubs, as you can definitely hear a few sour notes here and there, but otherwise the performance is stellar.

B00002Z88D|3.0|...All right. Lots of bands have mixed rock & orchestra before (The Moody Blues, Deep Purple, ELP and Yes are ones that come to mind), but as far as I know, nobody has attempted it with heavy metal music. Can it be done successfully? Well, we don't know yet. But if any other metal band wants to make the attempt, here's a few helpful hints that can be learned from listening to this album:<BR>1. Get a composer who actually knows what classical music is supposed to sound like. In other words, anyone, ANYONE but Michael Kamen!<BR>2. Choose songs that actually go well with an orchestra. \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"Call of Ktulu\\", \\"One\\", and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" are good. \\"Fuel\\" and \\"Battery\\" are downright stupid. (Ironically, the two songs that sound best in this regard are the two new songs, \\"No Leaf Clover\\" and \\"Human\\", which I assume were written specifically with orchestra in mind.)<br />3. For heaven's sake, it is NOT necessary to have every instrument playing at full bore during every second of every song!! What did that guy from Amadeus say? Oh yes. \\"Too many notes!\\"<BR>4. Practice, practice, practice! This whole album sounds horribly under-rehearsed, and there are several moments where the orchestra sounds like it's playing a completely different composition from what the band is playing -- almost like they were performing in a nearby hall and the mikes somehow picked it up. But who am I kidding, to assume they intended this as some sort of artistic statement? They pulled this stunt for M-O-N-E-Y, nothing else!!<BR>And All you...FANS get the Deep Purple \\"In Concert With the London Symphony Orchestra\\" Cd and shove it in your ear. DP was one of the first band to mix rock & classical and NOONE does it BETTER!
630179513X|4.0|Filmed at the same time as Back to the Future II, this third-and-final movie in the series gets close to the level of fun found in the original. Once again, Marty and Doc are up to their old tricks. Marty is stuck in the 1950s, but is desperately trying to go back to the 1880s to save Doc's life. The special effects take a back seat in the Old West, but the film never loses much steam, as we enjoy seeing Marty adjust to life in a harsh -- but comic -- reality. One of the real and unexpected treats of Back to the Future III is Thomas Wilson -- who played Biff in the first two movies -- as &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Tannen. Of course, the film is incredibly predictable, but so were parts I and II. The ride in to the past -- and present and future -- is just a lot of fun, and it's worth adding the whole series to your home viewing collection.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer does a awesome job on his first released album into the music world.  I first heard the music through a reccomendation of this website, telling me to check out his stuff if I liked Dave Matthews.  It was a suprise to me when I heard his stuff.  It is a great mix of mellow music with a bit of upbeat songs.  A personal favorite is Love Song For No One and his more popular No Such Thing.  Both convey great music, he is a rising star that will be selling out larger venues in the near future.  See him live while you can in the smaller venues, he will be wider known in no time.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|How does one describe this movie?  In terms of strict genre, it is certainly a musical, and yet there is romance, drama, comedy, and to be sure it is certainly technically innovative.  Still, it is so much more.  The best epithet for Baz Luhrmann's new-age musical I can come up with is that it is a surreal, dreamlike work of art.  It combines and matches so many forms and genres, successfully and fully sustaining ALL OF THEM from frame one.  It is a very revolutionary break from the run-of-the-mill movie experience: the primary narrative is very stark, bleak, and cold, and yet there is so much color, sound, movement and plain vibrancy of life that it seems to all have been spontaneously generated as one enormously, unfathomable phenomenon.  Truly, one cannot use enough superlatives in describing this movie.  Baz Luhrmann does a masterful job in controlling the direction of the story that could have gone off on so many parallels.  The musical numbers themselves are astounding, both in terms of their aesthetic and technical values.  The picturisations of the musical interludes are astounding.  Ewan McGregor is first rate, turning in a performance that instills perfect doses of passion and naivete.   But it is Nicole Kidman who is the true triumph of the film.  No doubt, it will be Moulin Rouge that defines her career hence, and with good reason.  She is absolutely exquisite as Satine, the doomed courtesan who finds love too late.  Those with conservative sensibilties will surely find it jarring and untenable, but for the rest, stay open-minded and you will surely receive the splendor of Moulin Rouge!
B00005JH7D|5.0|Marcus is a jazz muscian to the core.  He is multifacited playing bass and several other instruments on this album.  He has a distinct style all his own- He is smooth jazz personified COOL.  I loved it...dare I say the Marsalis of Bass?!
B00005Y228|5.0|Although \\"Light Years\\" was never released in the U.S. making it a bit difficult to get, it started Kylie's career again over here.  \\"Fever\\" picks right up where she left off, but with more depth and less pop to it.  Indeed the songs are still full of the requisite disco kitsch, but there's a more serious tone to this album -- more polished and modern.  It's awesome and now the straight folks over here will know what we gay folks have known all along -- KYLIE'S BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!
B00004VW5A|5.0|This box set proves that Elvis did not steal one thing during his rise to the top.  He earned respect every inch of the way.  Disc 2 is probably the greatest all around early rock and roll I've ever heard.  His comfort level was growing and he was getting some really great songs.<br /><br />The real treat for the collector is on disc 1.  You get some of the earliest of the Elvis Sun studio recording.  His performance of 'Blue Moon' is simple but effective in conveying a sense of loneliness.<br /><br />Disc 5 ends with a long press conference conducted by Presley right after completing boot camp.  It's interesting to hear how he interacts with the press and how he was trying to set himself up as just another private headed to duty.<br /><br />These discs represent a piece of history the true collector must own.
0140340203|5.0|The Witches is a book that deals with how you can tell whether a lady is a witch or not.  In the story a little boy is told all about witches by his grandma.  She would explain how to watch out for witches.  After all the stories the grandma told, the boy comes face to face with the grand high witch and doesn't know what to do.  <br />A character that stands out in my mind is the little boys grandma because she stays all calm after finding out her grandson was turned into a mouse.  I think that the author wrote this book well because of all the details he added into the book.  I believe this book is a very good book because it kept me reading and it had a good ending, which you would have to find out for yourself.
B000002WNP|5.0|I bought the 50's masters first and put off getting this box set.  I so strongly associated Elvis with the 50's that I didn't think he had a lot to offer to the 60's.<br />Consider me corrected.  From the opening song on disc 1 I was just captivated.  These were his first sessions since leaving for the military (where the 1st box set leaves off).  Many wondered if he could still sing.  Did he have the same magic?  And if he had the magic did anyone care?<br />When Elvis left for bootcamp there was a the very real possibility that his career was over.<br />The first disc in this set proves that Elvis would not be ignored.  Armed with some very strong songs and an even stronger set of musicians he was able to climb right back up the charts.  And he stayed there for most of the decade.  One thing becomes obvious once you get to the 3rd disc: the songs were not as good.  Unfortunately, the people surrounding Elvis had made it all but impossible for him to get fresh songwriting talent.<br />But that doesn't mean that this box set fizzles out in the middle of the 3rd disc.  Elvis and the band played right through the weak material and managed to give the listener good performances.  He didn't seem to care what song was handed to him.  He sang everything well.<br />This box set is a testament to that time and to a man who loved to sing.  For the fan this is an essential purchase that will be enjoyed for a long time.
0671045865|5.0|After listening to the audio version of this book, read outstandingly by Anne Heche, I went and listened to it all over again - something I almost _never_ do.<br />IMHO, this is the best book Stephen King has ever written. I think it may well have been Anne Heche's bringing Tricia McFarland to &quot;life&quot;, but it held me enthralled just the same.<br />While he does go a little heavy on the cheesy phrases and cliches, which he does in ALL his books, maddeningly; I still thoroughly enjoyed this book - so much that I may just go out and buy the audio tape - to throw in when I cannot seem to find any good books to listen to, which happens all to often.  It is good for a week of solid, entertaining listening.<br />If you haven't listened to this book - try it -- I bet you'll be impressed!
B00005QDW1|4.0|First of all, i read alot saying that &quot;if you liked 'Tk' and 'ros' stay away from rock steady!&quot; <BR>... Don't believe it! i'm a fan of no doubt and i have there albums from tragic kingdom up til this album and i like them all. of course this one is SO different from the other two but it's still good and it's not bad as people here claim it is. It's just a change, and it's an intersersting one!<BR>There are many great songs here, and personally i think that you just have to have an open minded about music, and you'll like this.
B000002J20|5.0|Woulda, coulda, shoulda... Why debate it's too long? Tales From Topographic Oceans simply IS. It stands as a classic work in its' own right. If you're reading this, you are probably familiar with the album, or at least, Yes as a group. If not, I recommend it highly. Just make sure you don't listen to it once, then put it away. Remember the old days, when you got a new album, and it was on the turntable constantly? Give this one the same respect, and it will reward you. EXCELLENT ALBUM!!!
B000002H33|5.0|Unless distorted guitars nauseate you, there is no reason an objective musician or fan of music can give \\"Master of Puppets\\" anything below the five stars it deserves. Metallica display virtuosic songwriting, virtuosic instrumentalism, and virtuosic taste on a level never before displayed by a heavy metal band. <br />\\"Master of Puppets,\\" the third, final, and best chapter of the Cliff Burton trilogy, is also the best heavy metal album of all time. Even though there are band I like a lot better than I like Metallica (Slayer, Emperor, Blind Guardian), Metallica outdid themselves here.<br />\\"Battery\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"Sanitarium\\", \\"Leper Messiah\\", and \\"Orion\\" are six brilliant songs, to none of which I ever tire of listening. In addition, they provide a diverse song-style that proves Metallica wasn't just cranking out a formula. \\"Battery\\" thrashes as hard as anything they did on \\"Kill 'Em All,\\" while \\"Orion\\" is melodic and mellow. \\"Master of Puppets\\" (to this day Metallica's greatest accomplishment, both musically and lyrically) and \\"Leper Messiah\\" perfectly balance raw, impassioned fury and the brilliant dual guitar work of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet. <br />\\"Sanitarium\\" and \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" are both fabulous songs as well, though without the grandeur that comes with being eight minutes long. These two songs by themselves would easily make any album worth the money. On \\"Master of Puppets,\\" they're just two more gems in heavy metal's crowning achievement.<br />Sadly, Metallica went steadily downhill from here (although \\"...And Justice For All\\" has several memorable songs), <BR>but before beginning their decline, they released the greatest heavy metal album of all time, which has yet to be dethroned.
0380973650|5.0|this book is better than i expected, much better then the mediocre reviews i read. it is a relatively quick read, and though it does offer some of the same questions as 'the long dark tea-time of the soul' it is a completely different animal all-together. neil gaiman is sooo good.
B000001GAJ|5.0|These two youthful works of Mendelssohn's have only recently been rediscovered, and they put forth a fascinating glimpse into his early musical development.  More importantly, however, they're just good music.  Anyone who doubts the &quot;child prodigy&quot; status Mendelssohn has been given by historians should listen to these two works; how else could a fourteen-year old write music of this depth and virtuosity?  The opening movements of both works are intricate and tightly constructed, employing to great effect the fugal technique that Mendelssohn mastered like no other musician, save maybe J.S. Bach.  The middle movements are possessed of that airy transparency that characterizes so many Mendelssohn andantes; at the same time, however, they employ deceptively difficult virtuosic passages of the highest order.  The finales of both pieces pull out all the stops, with racing tempi, scale passages and runs like very few others I've ever heard, and fatalistic codas firmly entrenched in the minor.  Kremer and Argerich are up to the task, with an absolute mastery of the material and a particular emphasis on clarity; this is truly a &quot;hear-every-note&quot; CD recording.  In addition, they manage to capture exquisitely the mood of each movement, varying their technique accordingly.  The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra backs them up with a tight, powerful, expansive performance.  This is one of those CDs that ensures you'll never need another recording of the songs it contains, because it is, by far, the best.  If you haven't discovered these early Mendelssohn masterpieces, this is definitely the CD to get to do it.  If you're already familiar with them, listen to this CD for a new interpretation that will, in all likelihood, cause you to throw away the old recordings and keep this CD as the definitive performances of these two works.
0783235380|5.0|On the front cover of this DVD in big bold letters it says in quotes \\"Outrageously Funny\\" - I didn't think that this movie was particularly outrageously funny, certainly not something I'd die laughing over, but if there were two movies on, One that I know is Outrageously Funny, and Forces of Nature, I would rather watch this movie any day. It is true that this movie did contain some lines of good humor, and some traits and sequences intended to make the easily laughable laugh, and I can see why people would write \\"this movie is horrible\\" in their review, simply based on this humor. But that just proves my theory that the best way to watch a movie is to forget about what everyone else is saying, forget about the fact that The box the DVD came in is kind of odd, or that the Interface is somewhat pixelated and over active, and just watch the movie looking to enjoy it. This movie deserves a 5 rating because it is a movie that I can sit down and watch, mainly because of it's fun attaching nature, and the fact that while it may be touted as a comedy or a love story or whatever else the reviewers may write, this movie is a perfect conglomeration of all the elements of film making with a little bit of every style, with not too much or not too little of any. Get this movie and watch it, you won't regret it.
0671027344|5.0|This book is one of the few books that I read in a span of 3 days. It was very well written, considering the author had to escape into the mentality of a freshman in high school. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's entering high school or someone in high school, although I think that a lot of people, whether they're in high school or not, can relate to Charlie, the main character, at least in one way.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Here is the first movie created by director Kevin Smith who came on the scene and showed some good potential for making some great films in the future. Unfortunately Clerks was the first and last good movie he has created (with the slight exception of the Clerks Cartoon which was average).<BR>The story is about two young clerks, Dante and Randall, who are stuck in the mundane aspects of their lives and although they are obviously discontent they will not, or cannot escape this &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; mentality.<BR>The story is amusing the the conversations are (pseudo)inteltually amusing.<BR>My only complaint about Clerks is how Kevin Smith changed the ending. I think the original ending was much better than the one that he finally chose for the theater. It simply was the &quot;perfect&quot; ending to a &quot;perfect&quot; day.<BR>But as Kevin Smith has proven through his later movies, he's not really a man of high ideals.
0800177177|2.0|Terming this film version of Dracula as \\"Bram Stoker's\\" is patently ridiculous.  The love story that is one of the main plots of this film is not in the novel and simply does not work.  Instead of a dreaded monster of great power we are given a lover who will not die.  One of the elements of the novel that make it work so well is that the forces of good - Jonathan and Mina Harker, Van Helsing, Dr. Seward etc. - must summon all their bravery in a cause that has little chance of success.   There is a spirit of sacrifice, partly motivated by the death of Lucy and to save humanity that the characters of the book band together.  This is missing from this film, instead we have a lot of gore.  One is not supposed to feel sorry for Dracula; he is supposed to be evil and terrifying, not the world's greatest lover.<br />This Dracula is visually stunning but as far as adhering to Bram Stoker's novel, as I recall Francis Ford Coppola prided himself on, it makes a shambles of it.  Why didn't Mr. Coppola have enough courage to say this was his Dracula?
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is the unquestionably The Beatles' finest album. The inventiveness of the production, the quality of the songs, the coherence of the performances are all unsurpassed. There is no filler, and directness that the Fabs lost after Sgt. Pepper.<br />I think what makes Revolver the best is that John Lennon is still a forceful presence on this album. His work is on par with McCartney's for the last time. Harrison's piece is one of his best, too. Energetic, fun, and acerbic at the same time.<br />The brilliant mix of styles is limited by the length of the songs, and by the lack of overt concept here, giving each song the feel of a pocket symphony.  Timeless, urgent, and fun, Revolver stands out among the later albums, and among all Rock albums that followed it.
B00000JPH6|4.0|This film is very original and beautiful to watch I think the work the Hensen company did for this film is simply stunning.<BR>I only gave it 4 stars becasue I do feel the story does get a little lost at times but for the most part it stays on track.<BR>I would love to see more stuff like this from the Hensen and Co.<BR>Brian as the current head of his father's work has just as much talent and drive to do it. <BR>I love Kermit and the gang but this film and Labyrinth as well as series like the Storyteller are just so amazing to watch, I never get tired of them.
6305603847|2.0|I normally dont write reviews.....but seeing the amount of reviews heaping praises on this absolutely languid film, i feel rather compelled to ensure that people are not mislead. Of course it is my personal opinion but i think it is required of me. My contentions are that the acting is tepid, the concert scenes look corny (run like hell), and the pace is unnecessarily slow. There is no art here..for example, the scene where the school kids rebels is done stark(yet unpowerful) with no subtlety and when there is symbolism it isnt  very intelligent...(children going through meat grinders?). <br />i'm giving two stars for the animation which is visually stunning and conveys a very powerful message to the viewer....other than that...give this a miss....i wished i had a wall between myself and this movie!
B00005T30L|5.0|Anyone who gives this film less than 5 stars is a complete...  Ghost World is the best, most original, most surprisingly funny and moving film of 2001.  Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes are geniuses!  The entire cast, extras included, are brilliant.  Enough said.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The fact that the first three films were a overly simplistic is understandable because Lucas was new to film making and had a limited budget. They had potential but ultimately Lucas didn't expand the Star Wars Universe to satisfy people who want some depth in their movie experience. <BR>So what's his excuse now? Rather than grow up with his audience and create a prequel that would stimulate some brain cells he simply created a movie as an excuse to sell more toys. I mean come on, doesn't he have enough money to get some real writers and pay for some special effects that don't look like special effects? <BR>When I saw all the Star Wars fans getting so excited over the coming of this movie, (many of them going so far as to actually buy tickets for Meet Joe Black just to see the coming attractions for the Phantom Menace and then walk out) I was almost certain that Lucas wouldn't let them down.<BR>At this point if the next two movies are even remotely interesting I'll be very surprised.
0345448898|5.0|After becoming a fan of Harry Potter at the age of 24, I thought I'd try some more young adult fantasy and see what it was like.  I stumbled upon these books on this website and found them at my local grocery store and couldn't put them down.  I was desperate for the third book because the third wasn't in the grocery store.  The books are fascinating reads.  The creativity is immense, possibly more so than Rowling's because of the breadth of the stories.  And Pullman's actions and descriptions are so detailed that I feel like I'm right there.  They're wonderful!
B00005RZV4|2.0|This album was a fantastic collection of live music.  Sound quality is great, song selection is better.  One of my favorite of everthing he's put out.

B000001FTD|5.0|This is the best Anthrax album and it has some great classic songs such as \\"Caught in a Mosh\\", \\"I am the Law\\", and \\"Indians\\". This is Anthrax at their peak and they never got any thrashier than this. This is a thrash metal classic right up there with Slayer's Reign in Blood, Sepultura's Beneath the Remains, and Sodom's Persecution Mania. True trash metal here, this is only for true fans of the thrash metal genre.

0385335482|5.0|You can't help but like Becky Bloomwood, massive debt and all! Her cavalier attitude toward her finances does not mesh with her career as a financial journalist, but it sure does make for good reading! Becky is a loveable character, and her escapades make the reader laugh and groan at the same time, all the while racing to read what Becky has gotten herself into next. The section where she gets a part-time job as a retail sales clerk is hysterical! I've gotten through this book about three times, and I still find myself laughing and shaking my head at Becky's antics. This book is a must-read!
1878424319|4.0|After reading several reviews on this book, I wondered if I shouuld even write a review.  What can I possibly say that hasn't already said?  But hey, that thought did not keep RUIZ from writing an entire book.  (ha-ha)<br />I actually like this book.  I agree that it did not hold any surprising revelations that completely altered my life.  What it did do is provide a good reminder for ideas I should be practicing, but have been slacking on.  Most people with any self-awareness probably try to practice these agreements.  They are common ideas to any religion.  Ruiz just worded things in a slightly different manner, providing a little freshness.<br />But for some reason, I rushed through this book.  Yes, it's a light read, but was I looking for something meaty?  Those who buy this type of book are usually on some type of spiritual quest.  Having high expectations, looking for something profound that can solve all of life's problems is unreasonable.  This little book was just a reiteration of a lot of common sense.  But hey, with all the negativity in this world, I need that sometimes!
0345413377|5.0|I am nearly sixty years old, and I have never bothered to write a revue before. I have been reading all my life, and amongst the hundreds and hundreds of books I have read, not one has touched me so deeply. Mr Pullmans characters are enough to make your soul ache with their love, fear, and the shear intensity of their purpose.<BR>This is a work of absolute genius. It has so many levels that one can only wonder at the imagination of the author.<br />...In common with many others, I must admit I cried a little at the end of this book, but not for long. These two young people, who had come together, had their adventures together, loved and lost together. Are an example to young and old alike. They mirror in many ways the trials, happiness and grief that we all at sometime have to share, and to make the right choice can be the hardest of all.<br />This is a wonderful, wonderful book, and if such a thing were possible, it should not only have won the best book of the year award, but should continue to do so for at least the next ten years.
B00005QB9A|5.0|The writing, directing, acting, cinematography, music... everything about this movie is excellent.  The story is unique and so well done it is believable.  You can read a synopsis in the previous reviews to see what the movie is about.  I am not necessarily a fan of foreign films, however with films like &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Legend of 1900&quot; coming out of Italy, I may become one. Unlike &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, this movie is in English, but both movies share the story of a unique perspective on life. Anyone who enjoys quality movies will enjoy this one.

B00003CX9E|2.0|In its day ( Note: IN ITS DAY ), this was ground breaking<br />stuff. A young punk lashing into the newspaper industry<br />with such gusto and giving people a glipse of something<br />they may only have suspected.

0385503954|4.0|Thanks to graffitti artists of the 1960s, everyone's familiar with Nietzsche's quip that \\"God is dead.\\"  But commonplace as this line once was, almost no one ever went on to note what Nietzsche was really saying.  God is dead, he explained, because humans have slain God through indifference and cynicism.  On the one hand, that death is an opportunity for great liberation.  On the other hand, its enormity can paralyze us with fear and guilt, because now that God has been slain, who will forgive God's slayers?  Nietzsche's solution is that the slayers of God must take God's place and recognize themselves as godlike.  But this is easier said than done.  Divinity doesn't fit most of us very well.<br />This is the fundamental dilemma that Ian McEwan wrestles with in his new novel *Atonement*.  The primary character, a novelist, has spent her life inventing fictional lives and plots.  She feels herself possessed with a mighty power, the power of creation--the power, in one way of speaking, of a god.  But how can a god find atonement or reconciliation or forgiveness for a deed of hatred and destruction?  As the novelist-character says at book's end:  \\"how can a novelist achieve atonement when, with her absolute power of deciding outcomes, she is also God?  There is no one, no entity or higher form that she can appeal to, or be reconciled with, or that can forgive her.  There is nothing outside her.  In her imagination she has set the limits and the terms.\\" (p. 350)<br />The plot of *Atonement*, which revolves around the lives of a handful of characters before, during, and after WWII, is the stage upon which McEwan works through the dilemma he poses.  Appropriately, perhaps, he offers no resolution.  For his implication is that the dilemma is still being lived by our culture:  in a day and age in which we've taken ourselves as the ultimate setters of terms and limits, to whom can we possibly appeal for atonement?<br />This is a novel in the great tradition of philosophical fiction popularized a couple of generations ago by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus.  Good writing, provocative reflections.fiction popularized a couple of generations ago by the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus.  Good writing, provocative reflections.
B00005R87Q|3.0|I was disappointed in this movie. I've recently watched it and found it to be a 2 hour movie with a 1 hour( thats TV, not movie time) plot, lots of loud music, plenty of fast cars and some very interesting driving (I wonder how much of that was faked?)but not much else. I don't consider it to be a good value, it might not even be worthwhile for fans of fast cars and racing.

B00005QK3W|5.0|With the release of DRIVING RAIN, Paul McCartney has delivered three superb albums and hasn't been on a streak like this since the early 1970s.  Those who criticise McCartney for this album is beyond me.  As always, the melodies are excellent, and there's a real rejuvenation in the instrumentation.  This music is tight and muscular, and when McCartney does indulge the band, stretching \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\" to over ten minutes, it never feels successive excessive, though it does feel like jamming.  In this sense, the jamming is controlled and very much under McCartney's control, and the jamming fits naturally into the song's structure.  <br />Each song is classic McCartney, and you can tell he really cares about these songs.  Those who complain about the rather trite lyrics of the title cut with its counting chorus or the \\"Spinning on an Axis,\\" are just out of the loop and have been for years.  McCartney is, first and foremost, a pop engineer, not a lyricist.  <br />Let's look at Dylan and McCartney.  While both are from the same era and both released albums roughly around the same time, they serve as good counter-points toward one another.  Dylan has always had a much bigger scope and influence than McCartney, and his song-writing is both very diverse and incredibly complex.  Dylan's always had much more appeal both from the intellectual standpoint and the musical standpoint.  While I would rather have LOVE AND THEFT over DRIVING RAIN (I'm a big Dylan fan), the beauty of both records is you see two rock pioneers do what they do best.  While Dylan is deeper and much broader in scope in LOVE AND THEFT, he couldn't come up with a track to match McCartney in just good solid pop, and to tell the truth I wouldn't want him to try.  <br />Going with the Dylan conversation even further, Dylan's trouble with women show up in his work, and it is both visceral, bitter, rage at both himself and the woman, wistful, and hopeful, reminiscing over the good times and the bad.  The three albums McCartney has done since Linda died also shows the effects of loving his love.  <br />While the situation is much different, with Dylan going through a divorce and McCartney losing his wife to breast cancer, the point is his emotions escape in very poppy music whereas Dylan devotes whole songs to anger (Idiot Wind) or remorse or any of the emotions.  McCartney couldn't write a song equaling \\"Idiot Wind\\" to save his life, but the same could be said about Dylan writing a song that is both extremely good pop and still captures McCartney's emotion and heart about Linda (\\"Lonely Road,\\" \\"From a Lover to a Friend,\\" \\"It Must Have Been Magic.\\")<br />McCartney's doing what he does best.  This isn't deep music, it's not \\"analyse every word,\\" or a walk through America's musical history (or England's since McCartney's a Brit) like LOVE AND THEFT is.  <br />McCartney accomplishes what he has set out to do, being the best pop musician around.  DRIVING RAIN is great pop and no one can touch him.
B00005JKYS|3.0|Back  in 1992, when they brought out We Were Soldiers Once, and Young, Hal Moore and his collaborator Joe Galloway said, \\"Hollywood got it wrong every ...time.\\" As it now appears on film, Moore's story , portrayed as We Were Soldiers, (director Randall Wallace) is a story that is appropriate for our present time, when we want to celebrate our heroes, but unfortunately, got it wrong. <BR> Hal Moore proclaims We Were Soldiers the best Viet Nam film. I disagree. For beginners, compare Mel Gibson's interpretation of Moore as a blood and guts WWII commander, with Robert Duvall's surrealistic Colonel Kilgore, another Air Cavalry Battalion Commander, from Apocalypse Now and ask yourself which one does a better job of telling the American public what Viet Nam was all about. <BR>      We Were Soldiers does justifiably honor the young men who fought in Viet Nam, but the battle portrayed in the film was not typical of the Viet Nam combat that countless thousands of soldiers had to deal with. The battle for the Ia Drang Valley, November 14-17, 1965, was fought early in the war, when military discipline was still high, and it was possible to be a good soldier in Viet Nam, a stand up confrontation between two big units of the US Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, fought in the wilderness of South Vietnam's Central Highlands, away from population centers. Change the date and mise en scene and this film could have been in Korea, North Africa, the Pacific or Europe in World War II. It was a far cry from the village war, that was so frustrating and morally confusing, fought in the midst of Vietnamese civilians who could be innocents or adversaries, that was the signature of Viet Nam War Combat, the kind that Hal Moore so detested (see Moore's comments about his experiences as a Battalion Commander on the Bong Son Plain, several months after the Ia Drang, at pp. 342-343, of We Were Soldiers Once and Young, 1992). Hal Moore is a man of impeccable integrity but his honor is in part,intact because he was in and out of Viet Nam early in the war. <BR>     Undoubtedly, Moore and Galloway lost control of the script once they signed away the rights to film the story, so the final shape of We Were Soldiers rests with the film makers. This is a time for heroes and that's what the final product is about.  Although the content of the battle as portrayed in the book contains enough heroism for any film, the producers contrived heroism  by dawdling for an inexplicably long time in the pre-battle environment of Fort Benning Georgia, rousing speeches and  wives coffee-claches. Also,  the final twenty minutes or so of the film imposes a theatrical charge by Moore's troops into the enemy lines, creating a crisis of  suspense and release for the spectator, when what looks like a heroic fatal charge is transformed into a brilliant maneuver, when an obviously coordinated and finely calibrated  air attack ambushes  the enemy soldiers just as they are about to annihilate Moore's battalion. These editing choices in fact invert the true ambush by North Vietnamese forces that is the rest of the story:  As American Forces were withdrawing from the battle field on November 17, 1965, regrouped North Vietnamese forces  fell on an American Battalion (Not Moore's 1st of the Seventh Regiment, but the 2nd of the 7th ), in an ambush that left 155 Americans dead (Twice the total of the first three days) and hundreds of others wounded. Depiction of this horrifying and spectacular ambush  could have elevated the film to a classic of the tragedy of war,  a story riddled with horror and ambiguity,  much closer to what the War in Viet Nam was about. <BR>     The Ia Drang battle, including the fatal ambush, is now seen by historians like Colonel Moore and Colonel Harry Summers as crucial to the remainder of the war.  The North Vietnamese, unaware of the potency of the air-mobile warfare employed by Moore's battalion, quickly understood that they could not expose their Army to modern American technology. They regrouped and changed their tactics. The Americans didn't. General Westmoreland, seeing a 10-1 kill ratio in favor of American forces, thought this was the strategy to win the war. Poor Westy never got it, and seldom ever again had the luxury of confronting the NVA and Viet Cong in head-on big unit combat. Secretary of Defense McNamara, briefed by Colonel Moore, was smart enough to see the writing on the wall. To his credit he warned President Johnson that it would be extremely difficult to win the war and would require a force commitment that could stretch American power to the breaking point. And of course it is McNamara's cross that he kept his insights and dissent within the Administration.  <BR>     Most of all, when it was fought the American government and its military leaders kept the fatal Ambush of November 17, 1965, a secret. Hal Moore's collaborator Joe Galloway dates the rot and corruption in the American effort in Viet Nam from that deception. Ironically in its choice of content and theme We Were Soldiers perpetuates that deceit. The American Soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang campaign and the Viet Nam war generally are honored by this film, but the history of the war is not well served. Too bad. Better luck next time...
B00005KFUN|3.0|It begins in true cabaret style, with some silly Nutcracker-style piano theatrics, before tearing your face off with a huge RATM-covering-Led-Zep's-\\"Black Dog\\" riff. This is 'New Born', and it shows that prog-punk (think King Crimson covering Sparks) is alive and kicking.<br />'Bliss' manages to up the ante even more, its beautiful synthesisers bubbling through the loud, vibrant power chords before delivering a magnificently urgent chorus. You think this is record of the year. You think it's the Pumpkins but with more life and ambition. You then hear 'Space Dementia'.<br />This particular song is just mediocre, granted, but it predicts the rather fuzzy quality control on the rest of the album. For every brilliant 'Hyper Music' or 'Plug In Baby' you have an appalling 'Micro Cuts' or desperately average 'Screenager'. Muse have shoved all the great songs (mainly the singles, it has to be said) in the first half of the album, leaving the *experimental* (read: tuneless) numbers till the end.<br />Bellamy's voice, let's face it, is rubbish. He wants to be Jeff Buckley so bad it hurts, and his lyrics scream adolescent acne rage (destroy this, destroy that, you broke my heart and left it to rot in its black gnarled juices, etc). <br />Coupled with the pomposity and directionless rambling of such songs as 'Megalomania', you'd think Muse would be out of the picture.<br />But I have to say, despite the overwhelming negativity of this review, the brilliant tracks on the album manage to measure up to the mediocrity of the others. There are some classic riffs on this cd, and some great melodies...it all depends on whether you care about consistency.<br />Whereas Muse's first album, \\"Showbiz\\", pootled along nicely, with a nice consistent batting average, this album explodes with vitality, delivering on both the *brilliant* and *highly despicable* extremes of the scale.<br />Half-and-half this album may be, but these days, you'd be hard-pressed to find better.

B000003TAR|5.0|With pop bands and commercial rock like Linkin Park corrupting music and the industry these days, I listen to this, to take me back to a time where music wasn't something you play to make money, but something you play to express your feelings. Serve the Servants is an autobiography of Kurt's life, from his parent's divorce to \\"teenage angst\\" this song covers it all. Scentless Apprentince is one heck of a weird song, with a freak chorus. I think it is based on a book. The song's drum riff found me tapping to it during class many times whe this album came out. Heart Shaped Box is where the emotion starts flowing out. HSB tells how Courtney Love was pulling in Kurt and using him, but there wasn't anything he could do. Rape me, lyrically, is the weakest song on the album. However, the tunes and the riff of Smells Like Teen Spirit, which was reversed in this song, is probably the best riff on the whole album. Frances Farmer is an absolutly underrated song. This is another song showing Kurts distress, as the chorus says, \\"I miss the comfort of being sad.....\\". I love that song. Dumb must be one of the saddest songs I have ever heard. It can make you so sad, that you feel like you're gonna cry. It talks about the relationships between ignrance and being happy. Very Ape and Milk It are two songs that I really don't like, the weakest on the album. Pennyroyal tea is another great song, and shows what Kurt must have felt like before his all to soon demise. The lines \\"I'm so tired, I can't sleep\\" echo through your head like a shuot in the Grand Canyon. The screechy noises in Radio Friendly are SO annoying, but after teh first 30 seconds, this song is one of Nirvana's BEST, so it is totally made up for. I feel like I wanna stomp my foot to the chorus. Tourettes is a fast, energy pumped song which means nothing. Kind of good, because you need a stop-gap before you enter the best song and saddest song of all time, All Apologies. This song only gets sadder every year. From the first few notes, you can already feel something churning. Kurt's gentle lyrics in this song make this song touch you in a way no other song can. All Apologies is the hidden gem of the album. It reads like a suicide note today. All in all, In Utero is   a great album. Although a majority of it is full with emotion, there are stop-gaps, like tourettes and Scentless Apprentince, which keep this album a little upbeat. If you do not buy this, you are missing out on a timeless classic. However, if you are a teeny bopper and like pop stars without talent, without meaning to their songs, like Britney Spears and NSync, don't buy this. If you like commercial rock, like Linkin Park, at least give this album a shot. You may like it, and you may just see what all music can offer, which is a walk inside somebody's head, in this case, Kurt Cobain's.

B00000ILDE|5.0|The first Alien movie was great as we all know, but its sequel was even better and remains one of the finest sci-fi films ever made and one of the few cases where the sequel tops the original (another is Terminator 2, which was also helmed by Aliens director James Cameron).  Where as the first film used its claustrophobic quarters and eerie atmosphere to make it shine, Aliens trades that in for gun toting shoot em up action that surprisingly works and in my opinion would not have worked without James Cameron as director.  Sigourney Weaver was even nominated for an Academy Award for this, that alone tells you how good she is, as for the supporting cast, including Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Paul Reiser, and Lance Henriksen all give knockout performances as well.  The special effects and creature effects are still decent by todays standards, and the 17 minutes of deleted footage only add more to the film's greatness.  Sadly though, the two following sequels couldn't hold a candle to the original or this classic, but if you haven't seen Aliens, I strongly suggest picking this up.
6305171769|4.0|It's been twenty years since Michael Myers went on a bloody rampage while stalking his sister, Laurie Strode. Laurie faked her death in a car accident and has been living as Keri Tate, a headmistress at a posh prep school in northern California. She has a son who just turned seventeen a few months ago, the same age Laurie was when Michael came home. Something wicked this way comes.<br />HALLOWEEN H20 was the perfect movie to end the HALLOWEEN franchise. If fits as the final installment of a trilogy with HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN 2. Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie and she brings just the right amount of soul-weary, grim determination to the role. In the end Laurie refuses to live as a victim and takes things into her own hands by going into battle with Michael. In the end, she is redeemed and goodness is restored. That's how it should end. Unfortunately, there's another HALLOWEEN film coming. Why don't they ever learn.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|To my fellow Beatles diehards who are complaining that this collection of their number one hits is ill-equipped to represent the best of the immaculate foursome or that the tracks were remastered in stereo (Doesn't give off the same air of nostalgia as mono, huh grandpa?), I urge you to lay off. This CD obviously was not compiled for us. In a time when so many young people have mistaken Linkin Park for good music, there must be an affordable, technologically updated introduction to the Beatles so that new fans can get their feet wet and picking songs for such a collection because of their position at the top of the charts is as good of a method as any other. Considering the impressive sales of The Beatles 1, I would say it is doing its valiant job. Just let it be, folks.
B00003CXXP|2.0|When Spielberg isn't rewriting World War II, he seems to be trying to resurrect the insight, heart, and imagination he brought to his early, wonderful movies like ET. But when it's gone, it's gone. AI is watchable only for the remarkable Haley Joel Osment (who isn't seeing dead people in this movie, but he might as well have been) and the always splendid Jude Law. Hey, even the Teddy (as in mechanical teddy bear with functional intelligence) was good. The first half of the movie isn't terrible; the second half sinks like a stone. No amount of acting talent could rescue this turgid, overlong melodrama. Not even the return of those onion-headed, big-hearted stick people (from Close Encounters. Remember them?) could rescue this story. It's worth seeing for the special effects, and for Haley Joel and Jude Law. It has few other redeeming features. The Pinnochio theme gets worked to death; the adults are all dolts and so are most of the kids. Only the mechanical people have hearts. Duh.
B000003S0I|5.0|Since the first wave of punk rock left its mark, the infusion of popular and classical music has been largely scoffed as pretentious, ridiculous and outdated. Although that is a pretty hard claim to debate after listening to a pomp-classical bands like Kansas or Electric Light Orchestra, there are a few instances in which some solid, classical influence has bonded very favorably with blazing rock and roll. Such an instance is undoubtedly King Crimson's Larks Tongues in Aspic.<br />Larks' Tongues marks the debut of the second incarnation of King Crimson, featuring bass-player and vocalist, John Wetton; former Yes-drummer, Bill Bruford; percussionist, Jamie Muir; violinist, David Cross and guitarist, founding member and overall leader, Robert Fripp. Each band member was of a traditional background and had technical talents somewhere near virtuoso. Each would seem better placed among symphonies and experimental jazz groups rather than a relatively rock-based project like King Crimson. So what were they doing in the rowdy world of hard rock?<br />Obviously they had something to contribute. If geared towards traditional symphonic music, part one of the title track would be pretty average. Given the grinding, hard rock girth of Mr. Fripp's fuzzy guitar, though, it becomes dynamic, extraordinary and delightfully menacing. With only occasional interludes for the surreal, elegant words of lyricist, David Palmer-Jones (sung ever so sweetly by Mr. Wetton), fascinating interaction between the graceful world of classical and the intense realm of hard rock reverberates through Lark's Tongues in Aspic. Sometimes the genres seem to be at war (The title track part one, the crashing \\"Talking Drum\\") and sometimes they seem to be in wistful harmony (The title track part two, the stunningly gorgeous \\"Exiles\\"). Either way, King Crimson show the spectacle and strange beauty that can come from skillfully integrating these two, almost opposite species of music. Please do not ignore this remarkable album because other such efforts have embarrassingly flopped. The majesty and magnificence of Larks' Tongues in Aspic is nothing to scoff at.
B000003S5H|4.0|Air is a rather inventive Fench techno duo.  What you have on this CD are luscious ambient melodies with some deep disco grooves.  Great music to ponder the night away or snuggle closer to that special someone.<br />Track #2 is a bit reminiscent of 80s euro porn soundtracks.  But it's fun to groove to, anyhow.  Tracks #3 and #7 are two of my favorites and they both feature the commanding vocal presence of Beth Hirsch.  Smooth, jazzy, soulful.  <br />This is a great CD for romantic nights or just for the downtempo/ambient aficionado.  Remember to set the lights low and breathe.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Words cannot describe how great this album is.  You just have to buy it and listen for yourself.  I received this album in the mail today, and it was great after a stressful day to listen to songs that groove, but also say something positive.  It is so rare for an artist to write songs that are excellent both musically and lyrically.  India.Arie is one of the rare artists who is able to write such songs.  The first time that I heard &quot;Video&quot; I was in my car and completely taken aback.  The song really spoke to me and about me.  I can't say that about most of the music that I hear on the radio these days.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This film is very powerful. It put to the viewer questions about being a human being and our responsibilities for our creations. If your looking for a big action sci-fi you will not find it in A.I., but if you open your mind (and heart) to what the story is saying then you will find yourself at the end of the movie wondering about what our actual future may be like. Whatever you do, open your mind when watching this movie, otherwise you just won't get it...<BR>Highly recommend this film ! 10 stars !
B00004Z459|5.0|Wow.  I first bought this CD to get the great songs that I had heard on the radio (Crawling and One step closer).  I wasn't sure if the rest of the CD would be good, and if I would be dissapointed or not.<br />I have grown to like all of the songs on this entire CD.  I only at first liked Crawling, One step closer, and In the End.  Since then, (months later) I have gotten to like ALL of the songs on the CD.<br />I have bought almost every other rock album related, from bands from Creed, Fuel, P.O.D., Nickelback, Adema, Matchbox 20, etc. and have found that I still love my LP CD way more than all of these different artists combined; even though I still do like all of these other artists.  This band has put together a new sound that has perfected the rap/hard rock combination, and is finally getting recognition.<br />This is honestly the best CD I have ever listened to, which for some reason hasn't gotten old for me has my other rock albums have.  <br />I could say that this album is nearly perfect.  The 11th song is just a bunch of DJ scratching, but is still a pretty relaxing/nice song.  Probably the worst on the CD, though.<br />BUY THIS CD.  Period.  This is that (nearly) perfect CD you are looking for.

B00005T33W|3.0|I missed _Ghost World_ in the theatre.  At the time I was sorry, but after seeing it on video, I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it on the big screen.<br />_Ghost World_ is essentially the story of the summer after high school graduation experiences of Enid (Thora Birch), a young woman who spends most of her time keeping a picture journal and complaining about how stupid people are.  Early in the movie she answers a personal ad placed by Blues collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi), pretending to be a woman he once met in an airport.  After she follows him home from this false blind date, the two become friends, after a fashion. Enid makes it her mission to prove to the world that Seymour is not so much of a dork as she first thought by fixing his non-existent love life.<br />Though the performances are quite good, I found it very hard to relate to the characters, who seemed one-dimensional and passionless.  Enid is supposed to be some sort of misunderstood societal misfit, but we know this only because we are told that it is so.  Her actions seem pointless and even cruel, making it hard to sympathise with her.  She suffers a lot and is obviously a quite unhappy person, but her unhappiness is inaccessible.  She hates her stepmother, but we never are shown why.  She is made to attend a summer art class where her work is denigrated as irrelevant, but we never hear her defend herself, or understand what her point of view is.  Mainly, the world is stupid and awful because Enid says it is so, but without hearing her perspective on what she values and what life means to her the message loses its meaning and takes on a tone that is self indulgent and even whiny.<br />Enid's friend, Rebecca, seems mainly to exist to be uncomfortable at Enid's various schemes and to attract attention from men who don't even realise Enid exists.  But Rebecca is also dull and wimpy.  She goes along with things that she disapproves of and keeps hoping that Enid will turn into something that she's obviously not.  The friends' big fight is a let down;  not enough is said and the conflict is too easily resolved.  I would have liked Rebecca to have had more to say for herself, but she just seemed to float through the movie never evincing any real personality.<br />Seymour, the inhibited collector of Blues '78s, is remarkably without feeling, even about his hobby.  He resists Enid's attempts to convince him that he really is an interesting person to the point where we just want to cave in and say, \\"Okay, you're dull.\\"  He becomes involved with a woman who shares none of his interests, but the relationship, if it can be called that, is so much of a tangent to the rest of the action that when he ends it we don't feel anything at all.<br />_Ghost World_ offers no sense of progress or change.  It's easy to believe that these people will continue forever in their pointless lives without ever coming to terms with themselves or the world around them.  I found it really boring to watch, and when it was over I felt cheated.he's obviously not.  The friends' big fight is a let down;  not enough is said and the conflict is too easily resolved.

B00005JKHP|4.0|The extras are great, lots of material there.  Most of the revisions in this version are good additions, too.  There are just some moments where I think the original cut was better.  Particularly the formation of the bridge between the Enterprise and V-Ger.  The new version is just too long.  Most all the other additions were good, though.  I'd like an original version of the movie on DVD all the same.  But that's just my two-cents, and I'm the only guy on the planet that hates every &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie...
B00005RDRO|5.0|Perhaps the most classic, comedy masterpiece ever made.  Peter Sellers is a riot and the supporting cast is no joke.  The one liners as well as the story leaves the viewer wanting more and needing to watch it over and over.<BR>A must have for the classic movie collector.

B00000IAU3|4.0|I bought this album just before the hype with Eminem. I heard a sample of Thank You in a tv program and decided to check out who it was. After I found out that it was Dido, I purchased the album No Angel. This album is pretty good. There is a lot of variation in the songs, but they all have a kind of triphop feel. I don't care much for the lyrics, but Dido writes songs with a good hook here and there, and they will be stuck in your head for some days. Her voice is indeed as the Amazon review tells, a mix of those three singers, and she doesn't come close to each one of them. But that's not the point, because she sings in a whole other genre.<br />My favourite songs are:<br />1. My Lover's Gone: a very quiet song with a lush atmosphere;<br />2. All You Want: Great powerhouse ballad with some of the best  lyrics from the album;<br />3. Honestly Ok: A slow song with dubbed vocals by Dido;<br />4. Slide: another vocal highlight with a great hook;<br />5. Take My Hand: begins very gently, but builds up to a great  trance-like song, with keyboards played by Faithless' Sister Bliss.<br />A good debut, but I am very curious about the development this artist is going to make the next years of her career.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Believe it or not but this is a movie everyone will love.  It's got some slight innuendos only adults might catch and funny moment kids will love.  I highly recommend this video in everyone's collection.
B000002JOH|5.0|Here's a REAL METAL ALBUM<br />If any band truly fits the definition of...\\"heavy metal\\" it has to be Pantera. Double bass volleys, thunderous bass, dynamic call to war vocals and one of the best guitar players you'll ever hear. This album contains, in my opinion, the ultimate metal riff of all time, Walk. Dimebag's guitar sounds like it's on fire throughout the entire song especially during the blazing solo. Some of the songs fall into the familiar lock-step groove while others are just plain fast (F'ing Hostile). Phil Anselmo is a great metal front man showing off his excellent range on the album. Hoarse yells and some genuine singing on some of the songs give you a break from the intensity but never for long though, they always turn back to blast-your-head rock. This is how metal is done and I don't know if it will ever be done better after this album.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon turns in a wonderful performance as a person whose worth is determined by her hair color, but it's the whole person that matters.  Reese plays someone who is dumped by her boyfriend and laughed at because she considers going to Harvard.  Once there she is not taken seriously by anyone except a fellow student who supports her.  After receiving a reality check she becomes serious and proceeds to turn harvard on its ear.<br />This movie is not a classic, but it does show how appearance can affect the way people view you.  There are many funny scences throughout the picture and some serious ones also- it was a nice blend.  This movie was carried by Witherspoon and it was a great role for her.  I would watch this movie again and I recommend to anyone who likes a nice old-fashioned movie.
B000002LR6|5.0|After learning that Ministry used to be a synth dance outfit it's hard to imagine how they completely changed their sound for this album (and it's predecessor Twitch).  Lightining fast drum beats slam away over Rammstein-esque guitars that are absolutely unrelenting.  Some of the songs contain vocals while others use samples.  Of course there's Jesus Built My Hotrod which contain absolutely off the wall vocals from Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers.  <br />One of the things on the album that appeals to me so much is the sense of humor that runs through it.  Al Jourgensen never takes himself on the album which is evident in the above mentioned track, Psalm 69 which features samples of a something that sounds like an choir in the church of Satan, people yelling \\"praise Jesus\\" and a priest speaking before turning into a mind numbing speed metal groove.  <br />This album really insn't for everyone and definately not something you can play just anytime.  But if you'd like some ... kicking industrial with a twisted sense of humor, then you'll love this.
0748662529|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith deserves praise for not only writing a great mystery, but for writing several. <br /> And I don't just mean multiple books. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is a top-notch series of mysteries with clever, sometimes hilarious resolutions. Whether it's read all at once or in pieces, it plays perfectly. Almost every chapter stands on its own as a great mystery with an intriguing set-up and a satisfying wrap-up.<br /> The main character, Precious Ramotswe, runs the titular organization with only the help of a secretary. It's no mean feat for her agency to be number one, since it is the only ladies' detective agency in Africa. Competition is slim but when she opens up shop, she discovers that demand is high. People all over the city are in need of feminine detective work. No one expects a female private investigator, though a little girl who she is trailing for her father spots her while being followed.<br /> Precious is a remarkably appealing character. We are given her background history in rich detail and it explains quite well why she feels and thinks the way she does. She's had it rough and wants nothing more than everyone else to have it much easier. She is trying to change the world for the better. And best of all, she has a tremendous wit. Her methods for solving problems and dealing with difficulties utilize both ingenuity and comical deception. She pretends to be a witness to an accident, a nurse, a seductress, and a policewoman on her separate investigations. She gets to shoot an alligator between the eyes as well as demand a blood transfusion to prove the identity of a parent. Within the context of the story, these unexpected twists are jarring and highly memorable.<br /> The persistence of one of her friends, Mr. Matekoni, to get her to marry him is hilarious and makes for a funny, unexpected ending. It shows her iron will throughout the book and lets the reader into her head about her true feelings and why she feels compelled to lock some of her emotions away. Precious is deeply textured and her actions are never predictable.<br /> One funny, involving mystery after another plus characters with genuine heart make this a real winner. Smith's Agency is number one, all right.

0440219078|5.0|The Giver related the story of Jonas, a child growing up in a world where \\"sameness\\" is the order of the day.  All actions, events and behaviors are well defined and regulated by \\"the leaders\\".   The \\"leaders\\" believe they have created a Utopian society of general comfort and well-being, good health and absence of fear. <br />The fact remains, however, that this is nevertheless a human society and there are complications.  The basic animal urges of the human species must be managed. There are \\"communities\\" beyond this one's border with different practices and customs.  There are unforeseen events to be dealt with.  There are old technologies and practices that must be avoided to maintain sameness.  How to do that is managed through the office of The Receiver of Memory, a lonely and solitary member of the community who has been imprinted with all the historical, emotional and other human \\"memories\\" that need to be kept alive (for those who forget history are doomed to repeat it, a scenario definitely not in the game plan for this community).  He is a figure of great respect within the community whose role is to use his memories to advise the \\"leaders' in times of crisis and/or confusion.<br />Jonas' world is turned upside down when he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory.  He not only experiences the pain and grief of all the long forgotten, yet stored memories-grief, starvation, war, hate and so on-but also learns the cruel tradeoffs and the intrinsic hypocrisy that the \\"leader\\" engage in to maintain their Utopian society.  And as he continues to train, Jonas eventually is faced with a situation that forces him to choose whether he personally can be part of the hypocrisy and deception that maintains that system.<br />A thoughtful, well written, extraordinarily moving story with lovingly created characters, the Giver is a book that can-and will-offer philosophical challenges to readers of any age.<br />One of the best books for younger adolescents I've ever read.
B00000JPHD|1.0|We recently ordered what we thought was the original Dracula movie. We'd had a copy before, but had loaned it out and never got it back. It was an all-time favorite. Well, the one we received contained a new \\"musical score\\" that is obtrusive, distracting, and poorly, poorly done. It was the biggest disappointment. This was a classic! The music not only is too loud, and inappropriate -- but it obscures the already-muffled dialogue. Old movies often have fuzzy dialogue, owing to the limited technology at the time -- I understand that. But this musical score adds nothing of quality to the picture. I only wish we'd known this when we ordered it...
0452282152|5.0|I didn't want this book to end. I don't usually read fiction, but this was such a sweet, intense story. If you like art and are familiar with Vermeer, I think you'll enjoy the book. Chevalier takes us right into the life of a girl in the Netherlands in the 1660's. Religion, class structure and art make up the protagonist's existence.  She learns how to mix paints in a rather clandestine situation and then sits as a model for Vermeer. She learns about the cruelties of social divisions and the pain of love.  Great little book.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Criteria for a horror movie should be different than for other films. They can lag in other areas, but if they deliver chills, shreiks, winces, gags (I mean the kind you make with your throat, not the kind you play on your friends) and a sense of, well, the creeps, that runs the whole film, you know you're on to something. \\"Creepers\\" does this and does it well. It's a short, well-crafted, brutally compact horror movie that uses storyline and atmosphere rather than buckets of the red stuff or an enormous kill-count to get your fear glands pumping. The story revolves around two sibling college students taking their ancient 1960s-era beater home on spring break via what looks to be the worlds longest and most desolate highway. On the way they spy a sinister-looking man dumping what appears to be bodies down a drainpipe, and here they commit their first \\"Horror-Movie Mistake\\" -- they investigate instead of getting the hell out of there. Turns out there is an extremely nasty surprise on the end of the pipe (think Sistine Chapel as designed by Dr. Lecter), but it's not until the two finally decide to split the scene -- and who wouldn't want to stay in a sewer pipe  -- that their troubles begin. Seems the mystery guy is on their scent (literally), and wants something from them, which he intends to remove without benefit of anesthetic. That's his gig, and he does it pretty well (hint: hiding in the police station will not help). \\"Creepers\\" is not a perfect film -- horror movies usually aren't -- but its flaws are the flaws of the genre and don't do much to detract from the tension. My biggest gripe is the design of the Creeper himself -- fully revealed, he is ugly but nothing you haven't seen trading barbs with Patrick Stewart on \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" ; and the movie ends so abruptly and brutally that my initial reaction was that somebody had forgotten to put the last half hour in. But better an abrupt ending than a predicatble one, right? Simply put, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually creeped me out. Definetly worth a watch.eepers\\" was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually creeped me out. Definetly worth a watch.
B000000Y27|5.0|I owned this recording long before ever hearing a lick from the likes of Grant Green, John Scofield, Pat Metheny, Andreas Pettersson, or Peter Bernstein (just to name a few of my axe heroes aside from Wes), and I don't think I ever fully appreciated it until reading an interview with Metheny in which he names Montgomery as his all-time guitar influence, in terms of Wes's phrasing. It then dawned on me that this record not only sounds great, but it represents an *original* work that set a standard that has influenced thousands of jazz guitarists over the past 40 years. The simplest way to describe this recording is that throughout each track (and they all sound great) Wes makes his guitar sing in a way that few at the time thought possible. Moreover, he shows a very diverse range of melodic capabilities, from the ballad &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams&quot;, to the jam &quot;Four on Six&quot;. The rhythm section also seems superb here (how can one go wrong with Tommy Flanagan and the Heath Bros.?).<BR>Most impressive about this recording, however, is the feeling I get that Wes is not breaking much of a sweat here. The notes just seem to flow out in a very natural way and the music seems very unpretentious. If I could afford it, I would buy the entire box set representing all of Wes's Riverside recordings.

B00005A1PR|4.0|This is a wonderful cd.  India.Arie is one of the few new artists of today who truly has a style all of her own.  Her cd is by far more original than Alicia Keys.  Unlike Alicia Keys album title, &quot;Songs In A Minor&quot;, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is true to the title.  India.Arie's voice is smooth....soothing, and you can hear the acoustics on all of her tracks.  This is truly a beautiful cd.  If you want something different....a breath of fresh air, try &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;.

The eerieness of reading about a person who is basicly perfect, turning into suicidal chemicly imbalanced loony bin drew me in completly.  Though it is not clear when Ester Greenwood really looses it the path she takes is very interesting .  My only wish is that Sylvia Plath had lived to write another masterpiece like the Bell Jar.

It's awful, almost as bad as today's music. Skip \\"The Crunge\\" and it's outstanding
B000063V8R|5.0|This is the season that started it all, the year a half-hearted imitation of a legend began building it's own legacy.  From the feature film quality episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" to the mind blowing cliff hanger finale of \\"Best of Both Worlds\\", the third season of TNG had it all.  It turned my friends and I from occasional viewers into die hard fans.  You can shell out the money for the first two seasons if you have to be a completist, but you really only need to start with this set to have the best of what sci-fi on television has to offer.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Well, it has been said that Apocaclypse Now is one of the all time greatest war movies ever made.  It has also been said that it may be one of the greatest movies ever made.  Well, I believe that to be true as well.  With the late 2000 release of the re-edited and extended REDUX version, you can pretty much chalk that one up indeed one of the greatest movies ever made.  Put that on a single-sided double-layered DVD and you have one hellava movie.  Crystal clear picture and sound.<br />REDUX goes where the original didn't.  It expands on character development and restores some scenes, such as the French Plantation scene and the Playboy Bunny medivac camp scene.<br />If you want the definitive version of this classic, you must pick up REDUX.  The chapters are well laid out which singles out the added scenes so you can \\"skip\\" those scenes if you wish to view the movie as the original.<br />kiran david asked:<br />\\"While I really enjoyed this version of the film what worries me is that the aspect ratio seems to be 1:1.85 instead if 2.35 which was what the original apocalypse now was. Is this a transfer error or did the director use 1.85 as the aspect ratio, though the trailer on the dvd seems to be in 2.35. Can someone please enlighten me on this one.\\"<br />Well, that's kind of funny.  I could have sworn my old Widescreen VHS copy seemed to be in 2.35:1 as well, but the new REDUX seems to be in 1.85:1.  However if your DVD player and TV are capable of using 16:9 enhanced modes, the picture can be compressed down closer to about 2.0:1.

6302794331|2.0|Something is just not right when you mix &quot;muppets&quot; and &quot;drama&quot; together. The dark and dreary setting only enhances the unsettling mood of this movie.

B00000K19E|5.0|I saw this movie 9 times in the theatre, and watch the DVD weekely.  If I can do that, you can see it atleast once.  Keanu shines as Neo, Laurence Fishburne brings intelligence and depth to the roll, and Carrie Ann Moss has a great future in films based on this performance.  &quot; What is The Matrix?&quot; One helluva movie.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This &quot;review&quot; is coming from a person who doesn't usually write reviews, but I was flipping through the section for this movie and was struck by some extremely negative reactions.<BR>This movie is amazing... Amanda Root is amazing, her portrayal of Anne is touching, as her character is able to develop throughout the film. It is presented very well; characters are real, their various motivations human and real, which all add to make a colorful, beautiful movie.<BR>I am not recommending &quot;Persuasion&quot; to everyone: one must be extremely patient, as the plot ambles along at its own pace. However, for those who appreciate richness in story telling and charming characters, this movie is amazing. Enjoy!
B00005JKED|5.0|This movie shows the acting strengths of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, has a great plot, and a scene that was worth the 5 stars I gave it alone.

Once I finished this book I could not belive how Philip Pullman ended this sad story.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I went to see this movie with great expectations, I mean Kubrick/Spielberg two of the greatest directors of out times. But I was really disappointed with it. It was too long, I almost fell asleep, the whole Kubrick's idea just disappeared in too many plots. Soemtimes it seemed like Spielberg didn't know what to do in some moments, especially in the end with the &quot;aliens&quot;  I think it's really the worst of Spielberg's movies to date
B000002AVF|5.0|Excellent album - consistent all the way through.  mariah's voice is a great as ever and the music surrounding her voice is better than ever.  pretty much what you would expect from any album of mariah, but at her best.  my personal favourite song on the album is Forever...it's like taking a step back in time a couple decades or so.  unfortunately, the next song is a horrible dub remix of Fantasy, which just pops out of nowhere, but it's just a small glitch on a very well-crafted album.

Of course, by that time, they're back on the island, grinding out more pap.<BR>If managers weren't either too lazy or too stupid to do the job they're paid to do (manage), it would mercifully exhaust the market for this entire genre of stuff.

B000002NHN|5.0|I adore that McKennitt is aware of the worldly origins of the Celts and incorporates that into her music.  Beyond that, her music is beautifully, wonderfully, sublimely celestial and uplifting.  The album's finale, &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot;, is worth the purchase price all by itself.  McKennitt wrote much of this album while traveling on the trans-Siberia railroad.  Inexplicably, her music transports me there, to Tuscany, to Celtic Ireland, to &quot;kiss the face of the stars&quot;.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face.<br />Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle.<br />A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge.<br />But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare.<br />There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson)<br />remark on the M16. \\"It's a good rifle.\\"<br />Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to<br />abuse and missuse. The perellent was dirty and it had to be clean ever fifteen minutes, whole platoons were found with there M16 broken down and cleaning kits out.
B00005QFHG|5.0|Chocolat is an adorably subtle film about the sexual awakening of a small, parochial French town. Juliette Binoche portrays a liberated, never-married mom who blows into a tiny village on a \\"sly north wind\\" and manages to cause scandal with the simple act of opening a chocolate store during Lent. She slowly wins over the women of the town by providing the perfect ingredient--chocolate--to ignite the fires within. This isn't an intellectual film; there are no serious character studies or brazen revolations. However, the simplicity of the plot and the inclusion of life's simplest pleasure (whether that's chocolate or sex is up to the individual, I suppose) makes it a fun little treat.
B00003CXTG|3.0|All I have to say is:  why was Cuba Gooding, Jr in this movie?  He played no important role.  The director easily could have edited him out of the movie.  Now, I'm not putting down African-Americans, but what did he add to the story?  Nothing.  You never would have missed him.  If you wanted to do a movie set in Pearl Harbor about a cook, good for you.  If you want to do a movie set in Pearl Harbor about 2 pilots and a nurse, good for you, but none of them even interacted with Cuba Gooding, Jr.<br />And that's another thing; the whole love triangle just disgusted me.  I think you have enough plot prepared with WWII going on, you really don't need the added tangle of a love triangle.  If you wanted to do the triangle, good for you, focus on that, use WWII as an excuse to why Rafe is gone.  If you wanted to do WWII, good for you, focus on that, and experience the war through Josh Hartnett's eyes, or through the friends' eyes.  You'll just make it too complicated if you do both.

As for Harry and Marion, it made me think that they had the world by the hands and that there really wasn't anything wrong with doing drugs of the nature they were doing... However, as those of us who watched this movie know, it doesn't quite turn out the way these boys dreamed, and they saw their lives go down the drain.  <BR>As for Sara, Harry's mother who had an empty life similar to many old people, she made me feel like I knew what going nuts really feels like.  As I was trying to go to bed at night, I couldn't stop thinking of the things that were going on with her character, and how her pitty dreams of being on TV and having a successful son drove her to insanity.<BR>Aronofsky's camera work is amazing.  We see many of the same techniques used in Pi, which I also loved.<BR>In conclusion, every person that took part in this film (especially Aronofsky and the actors) helped make what in my mind is a masterpiece.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie!  The songs were great - it was a big mish-mosh - an organized mish-mosh, but definitely ingenious.  How can you not enjoy them?  And how can you not laugh at two men singing &quot;Like a Virgin?&quot;<br />All of the scenes were lush and vivid and saturated with color.  Nicole Kidman was outstanding, and Ewan McGregor was awesome as the starry-eyed writer.<br />It was a great movie, a sad movie, but you don't want to miss it!
B00005JKYS|3.0|I found We Were Soldiers to be entertaining, but I found it falling far short of my expectations. Saving Private Ryan (which I consider to be a masterpiece on film) has raised the limbo pole, if you will, of what combat should look like on film. I did not see the look of horror I expected on every soldier's face when the Vietnamese soldiers were firing AK-47 rounds only inches from their faces.<br />Over and over again the film reminded me of the old John Wayne movies, where the heroes shoot up the bad guys while only the extras are killed or wounded on their team. The Vietnames soldiers were about twelve feet away, yet they scored zero hits on US soldiers in fight after fight. Also, the enemy had zero artillery. Not even so much as a mortar round landed on the American positions. I'm pretty sure that at least some form of artillery would be standard issue for any North Vietnamese division (or any division in the world, for that matter). As cramped as the US solders were in their position, a single mortar crew could have killed them all.<br />Despite this, the film is decent enough for a single viewing. I was glad that I went to the early show.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Back Back people! All of you so called old school No Doubt fans should stop your whining and enjoy the music ND is putting out for you. Who cares if the new album is pop? You should be glad they have another album for you to hear and you should support them and be proud of any efforts they make or any collaborations and music they make. Rock Steady is so awesome! Once again No Doubt has impressed me by living up to my expectations of another great follow up album. All of the songs are great. and this time it's a more happy ND sound to show that they are really enjoying life and having fun now a days. The only part that's a bit sad and down in the album is they lyrics about Gwen's insecurities like on &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Dont Let Me Down&quot; but they are awesome songs. My favs tend to be the more mellow and slow &quot;Underneath it All&quot; and &quot;Running&quot;. But to put me in a great mood I listen to &quot;Plantium Blond Life&quot; &quot;Hey Baby&quot; &quot;Hella Good&quot; &quot;In My Head&quot; and &quot;Making OUt&quot; Also i love the unique sounds of &quot;Start the Fire&quot; Rock Steady&quot; and &quot;Waiting Room&quot;. Trust me this album is a must have! Especially for every No DOubt fan!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is about a kid whom is 12 years old and finds out he has magic. His name is Harry Potter and he goes to magic school.<BR>This movie is really good because it has a lot of interesting and funny things that happen in the movie. This movie is really recommended for all ages.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I love Radiohead. They are one of my favourite bands. I just love them and everything they put out is great. They are inspiring musicians and this album is evidence.
B0000042MY|5.0|If I had to pick my favorite 10 CDs to take to a desert island, the soundtrack from &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; without question, would be the first packed.  Stirring, romantic, absolutely one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever written.<br />I discovered this soundtrack when I was in law school, and despite being a broke student, tracked it down and bought it.  I studied to it, outlined my notes to it, wrote term papers to it.  I now keep it at work, where it rarely leaves my CD player.  Listening to this soundtrack gives me a wonderful energy boost and lifts my spirits without totally distracting me from whatever I'm working on.
B00000IAU3|5.0|When I first heard her voice featured on Eminem's LP, I had a good feeling about this artist. I immediately purchsed her album the moment I knew it was available and I was completely satisfied. Well-written lyrics and music. Songs that make you wonder. I love it.
B00005QZWI|5.0|As my only real exposure to Howard Shore's film work was the low-key grimness of his \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" score, I was unprepared for the scope and reach of LOTR.  I love John Williams, but in someone else's hands this could easily have become a bombastic, ersatz-Williams exercise.  What Shore does instead is so subtly effective you may not notice it on a conscious level when you see the film.  Without doubt the finest orchestral score by an American movie composer in 2001.  My only complaint, and it's a doozy, is the CD is much, much too brief.  Shore composed nearly three hours of score for this film; Warners gives us less than 90 minutes.  Will this be another \\"Phantom Menace,\\" a ploy to get fans to plunk down ...after which the company will go ahead and release a 2-disc set?  Few movie scores deserve a second disc; this is absolutely one of them.
B000002WYT|5.0|This is the kind of album that most music lovers like to purchase . . . something that you can play all the way through without having to skip tracks. Every song has a bittersweet messege in it that you can't help but vibe to. I love Dave Matthew's Band and this album proves why.
6305499365|4.0|After a breif run at the theaters, Office Space has found a renewed and vibrant life on video tape.  It seems that everyone I talk to -- no matter what their age, background, or current job -- considers this film to be a personal favorite, a film that they can especially relate to.  The reasons are pretty obvious.  Everyone hates their job.  Everyone feels that they're working for idiots who fail to understand just how special and unique their neglected employees truly are.  This is something that we all have in common, whether we work for a retail chain or a fortune 500 company.  This is also a feeling that Office Space manages to perfectly capture.<br />Taking place in Houston in waning days of the 20th Century, Office Space stars Ron Livingston as an affable computer programmer who has found himself stuck in a dead end job that requires him to spend countless hours looking over a code to make sure that various computers are Y2K compliant.  Its a job that makes little sense to him but one that he's expected to devote his life to.  His coworkers are all incredibly (and realistically) annoying.  Who hasn't had to deal with someone like the \\"Look's Like Somebody's Got a Case of the Mondays!\\" woman?  His boss's (a hilarious Gary Cole) blandly friendly manner brings new meaning to the term \\"corporate evil,\\" while over in the next cubicle, pasty-faced Milton (Stephen Root, also hilarious) mutters about burning down the building.  Finally fed up, Livington first seeks help from a hypnotherapist, pursues a relationship with a waitress (Jennifer Anniston who is sweetly likeable here but doesn't have much to do) at a generic Chili's-like establishment, and finally engages in a plan to embezzle money from the company.  <br />Obviously, the plot is a little bit ragged and at times, it seems as if director Mike Judge and his actors made up the plot as they went along.  But no matter, the film's quality is not to be found in the plot as much as in how it captures the small, realistic details that makes everyone hate their job.  From the pointless memos to the corporate stooges, Office Space captures them all and sends them up in such a savagely hilarious way that the film serves as a wonderful catharsis for anyone whose just finished a hard day at work.  Office workers will especially appreciate the scene in which Livingston and two recently laid off co-workers take revenge on an irksome xerox machine.  (If not for the fact that children might be reading this review, I'd quote the rap song that plays over this scene but let's just say that its impossible not to cheer as our workers get their revenge.)  <br />Judge, best known as the creator of Beavis and Butthead, directs in an offhand, almost casual manner.  There's a relaxed air about the whole affair and you get the feeling that everyone involved in the film was having a good time.  Luckily, the feeling is infectous.  The film is also well-acted by everyone involved.  Along with Cole, Aniston, and Root, good supporting work is given by Deidrich Bader who plays Livingston's redneck neighbor.  Ron Livingston is the perfect everyman lead for this film and gives a totally winning and likeable performance.  <br />With its portrait of mindless office jobs, Ikea-furnished apartments, and overly intelligent people struggling to find some way to establish some sort of individual identity in a corporate culture, Office Space at times plays like the gentler, slightly more juvenile cousin of Fight Club.  Whereas Fight Club battled modern culture through violence, Office Space battles modern culture through practical jokes and whoppee cushions.  Both films are must sees for anyone who has ever hated having to make a living.

0345451325|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Fall of Reach\\" maybe an hour ago. I started it earlier this afternoon. It's a great book, and even better for die-hard, hardcore HALO fans like me. <br />If you've heard about HALO, but haven't played it, get this book only if you have enough money to buy an XBOX and a copy of HALO, or if you have the willpower to not do that. If you've played HALO, this is a must-have book.
B000002B7U|2.0|As a person that truly appreciates classic and hard rock, and owning a copy of nearly every release in Ozzy's catalog, it isn't easy for me to give a scathing review of The Ultimate Sin.  I'm sure I'll get lambasted by fans, jeered by heavy guitar gurus, but here goes anyway!  The Ultimate Sin is without a doubt Ozzy's most dreary, watery, and ultimately boring release.  The first stake through the heart is Ron Nevison's horrid production.  All the tracks sound so damn grungy, and I'm sure this wasn't a calculated decision.  It's difficult to differentiate between tracks when they all sound so similar, not only in production values but in sonic drone as well.  Second sore point is Randy Castillo's drumming, which comes across as blocky and fairly unimaginative (it would be much better by the time \\"No Rest\\" came along).  Third, is the sheer lack of good songs.  I mean just listen to \\"Secret Loser,\\" \\"Thank God for the Bomb,\\"  \\"Never\\".... yuck!  Again, I feel like I should apologize, but really the band should have been the ones with regrets.  With talents such as Jake E. Lee and Phil Soussan on board here, such lackluster material is especially disappointing.  And poor Ozzy, this is without a doubt his most ambitious lyrical statement to date. Lamenting throughout \\"Sin\\" about the sad possible fate of our modern war-torn existence.  But with such mediocre song structures his lyrical points are rendered about as emotionally moving as watching paint dry. All slagging aside, I will admit to liking \\"Fool Like You\\" about as well as anything off No Rest for the Wicked.  Another positive: the last track does give us some true insight, this turned out to be a \\"Shot in the Dark\\" indeed.
B00005JKES|5.0|I had been waiting for a quality release of this series for some time now,the British release of the series was taken from poor prints and reduced the enjoyment to say the least.Also some shoddy editing rendered certain aspects of the series even more confusing than David Lynch would have liked.For example the Sarah Palmer flashback to someone digging up Lauras necklace was completly missing in the show but did feature on the reprise!Also the first glimpse of Bob in the living room mirror was also trimmed...it took me 10 years to discover it existed.This release has not only filled in these annoying gaps but included a wealth of features which after two weeks I am still enjoying and discovering!The show was never fully appreciated in Britain and it is reassuring to see that a worldwide market has realised the importance of this show.Apart from the crisp quality and superb sound,the features contain alot of input from the &quot;Wrapped in Plastic&quot; squad,again a magazine very hard to pick up in my part of the world.Their love of the show shines through and I often wish such fan involvment could be utilised across more cult shows.Highlight for me was the interview with the lady who owns the RR diner,such a matter of fact lady really brought a personal perspective to the entire proceedings.Again I cannot recommend this release enough,roll on Season2.
B00005NWM3|3.0|I have been a fan of Nickelback ever since The Stare came out, just like a lot of us up here in Canada. The State is a much more intense, meaningful album, with songs that ACTUALLY SOUND DIFFERENT!!! Okay, I am demeaning Silver Side Up a little. But is just doesn't seem as enthralling as their first album. I would hate to come off as one of those people who dismisses other fans for \\"jumping on the bandwagon\\", but can you blame me? They were Canada's best kept secret, and now they're EVERYWHERE! Silver Side Up does have some very moving music, and insightful, reflective lyriocs, but it just doesn't seem like the rock that Nickelback used to be. I've heard about a million people say tht Silver Side Up is the besy CD they've ever heard. Well, go get The State and prepare to be moved. It's kind of tiring after \\"How You Remind Me\\" was Numder 1 on my local rock radio station for aobut 8 weeks, and this was 3 months before the record even came out. And then, when the single finally starts to die down, every adult contemporary, light rock, and top 40 station has it spinning 20 times a day. A good album, but it could and will get much better.
0385486804|5.0|Interesting to read what other people got out this book.t I think the only two people who undersood Chris McCandless were the name changed stepfather candidate and author himself. <BR> Having come from 100 km below the Arctic in Finland and then working 3 years in London (recession) made me quite a Chris McCandless.<BR> The line between a madman and a celebrity is ever so thin...
6303443192|5.0|This is one of the greatest vampire movies that I have ever seen.  There are a number of vampire flicks out there (Bram Stoker's Dracula, Lost Boys, and Queen of the Damned, to mention a few).  I may only be fourteen, and I may not have seen as many movies as some of you people out there, but I can say with confidence that this is the best movie of its genre.  With an allstar cast including Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and a young Kirsten Dunst, it will blow you away.  It begins with an interview talking with a person who claims to be a vampire.  The whole of the story, however, is a recollection of the vampire played by Brad Pitt, which takes place about two or three hundred years ago.  This is a movie for people who like horror, vampire, or sci-fi movies.  It's also a good movie for anyone up for a good scare.  If I could give this more that five stars, I would in a heartbeat.  A great movie, but not for kids under 10.
0441003257|5.0|Mixing Pratchett's sense of outrageous parody with Gaiman's morbid humor, Good Omens comes up trumps as a laugh-a-minute novel staring the good guys, the bad guys, a gang of kids and a devil dog.<br />For me, a long time Pratchett fan, it was easy to spot the joins between the two authors ideas, but that did not lessen my enjoyment of Good Omens, as it romped from the sublime to the truly ridiculous (always with a sense of gentle mockery about the state of human nature as a whole). And, as with a high percentage of Terry Pratchett's works, the underlying religious question always presnts itself... a sort of Small Gods parody.<br />Good Omens should carry a public health warning... laughing out loud can seriously improve your health.
B000000H7I|5.0|This is one of the best death metal albums I have ever heard.  For some reason this band never got the respect they deserved.  Forget crappy Cannibal Corpse.  These no frills little guys put forth way more brutality then dressed up fakes such as Slipknot or all the black metal bands.  These guys can really play their instruments.  The drumming of Mike Smith is simply phenomenal.  He belongs in the same category as a Sandoval, Lombardo, or Hoglan. Cerrito and Hobbs create some awesome riffs that will have you thrashing in no time.  Although largely undecipherable Mullens voice adds to the rhythm of the song and is like another instrument.  Unlike other...bands like Cannibal Corpse the lyrics are much more intelligent and varied.  This is a technical masterpiece that should be in the collection of every death metal -no let me take that back-every metal fans collection.
0385503954|5.0|Ian MdEwan quotes a paragraph from \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in the front of \\"Atonement\\" which is in effect a messaage to his character, Briony, warning her about the poisonous consequences of unfair judgments and suspicions. I might add another quotation from the same Jane Austen novel: \\"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.\\"<BR>I would not only concur in this statement, but apply it to this novel, which I found an enchanting, kaleidoscopic picture of an English family just before and during World War II, with a brief astonishing addendum in 1999. McEwan uses a broader brush than in \\"Amsterdam,\\" entering into the inner thoughts of a wide range of characters with such skill and imagination that the reader feels intimately involved with their lives.<BR>It is amazing how McEwan is able to delve into the feelings of a 13-year-old girl - and her vivid imagination - and periipherally into the thoughts of her older sister and mother, as well as the emotions and fears of Robbie as he flees the French countryside to reach the Dunkirk beach for evacuation back to England. Then McEwan moves on to Briony as a student nurse with powerful images of injured and dying soldiers. Here and, in the short afterword, with Briony a woman in  her 70s, he captures her with unusual verisimilitude.<BR>McEwan's descriptions of people and places are striking and believable. This is one book I really hated to see end - and I found it hard to stop reading at any point in the narrative. I have been talking about it with friends and my Book Club members - and we'll want to read it as a group and discuss all its ramifications. This certainly should be a Booker Prize winner!
B00005JKYS|5.0|Hollywood has finally been able to present a story of the Vietnam War that shows the tragedy,heroism,pathos,pain and the sadness it brought to the soldiers and families who sacrificed their futures for their ideals.Superb acting,superb script,superb cinematogragphy combine to present a film guaranteed to hold interest and touch the deepest recesses of the heart.Expect Mel Gibson to be a contender for Best Actor next year.
0812550706|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that after the first chapter of this book, I could not put it down. Each chapter melted into the next as I was vaguely aware that I was even reading a book. Orson Scott Card has an amazing talent for inviting you right into the life and adventures of his lovable protagonist Ender.<br />Ender Wiggin is a special boy with genius talents. He finds himself in a schol for other such children where he sticks out as special even among these most gifted students. There he finds himself locked into a game where he is trained to be the ultimate fighter. Torn between being a killer and a boy, Ender is forced every day to wonder if he even wants to play their game.<br />Though Ender is talented to almost superhuman levels, the reader can still identify with him. They are reminded that he is a child and find themselves asking the same questions as Ender. Card does a superb job of creating this world for the reader. He creates all the right questions to ask, and when the reader finishes the book, they are left wondering: what happens next? Its an excellent start to what promises to be an exciting and intriguing series.
0790743507|5.0|This is one of the best musicals there is.  I have loved this musical as a teenager and now my twin toddlers cannot get enough of Singin' in the Rain.   Gene Kelley is master of tap and Donald O'Connor is lovable as well.   Singin in the Rain is pure happiness ..at its finest.     You just can't get tired of this musical.   I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone, and even very young children will get their kicks out of the songs like Moses Sposes...as well as Good Mornin, Good Mornin!, with Debbie Reynolds alongside singing and tapping away.   A real treat again and again.
0064471837|5.0|I had heard good things about this book before I read it, and all by adult friends of mine.  So I was suprised to see this categorized as Young Adult when I purchased it.  I just finished this book today, and I can safely say that this book would be enjoyable for adults of all ages, with such a captivating story, and being so well written.  At 22 years old I never once felt like this book was \\"too young\\" for me.  I highly recommend this book, so much in fact, that I am off to purchase the sequel - Lirael!
0425173895|4.0|\\"...Roger Ackroyd\\" is, like the Orient Express, famous for its conclusion. It has a twist which few readers, if any, could have guessed beforehand. For that alone I'm giving it 4 stars. Not 5 because even though the story is good, I dont think it deserves the full 5 stars. <br />Its a typical English countryside murder which Agatha Christie is famous for. There is something about the English countryside that attracts crime writers to it. Perhaps it is the chilling fact that the genteel and peaceful facade of the country sometimes hides a hypocritical and evil nature of some of its populace. You'd expect this in the cities but not in Warmsley Heath or Meadowbank or wherever. \\"I wouldnt have thought that nice Mrs So and So down the street poisoned her husband. Gosh! The very idea!\\" <br />Well, a woman did poison her husband. Someone found out and is blackmailing her. Roger Ackroyd knows who the blackmailer is. Roger Ackroyd is found dead. Enter Hercule Poirot.<br />This book has been equally praised and criticised. It is praised for its audacity and ingenuity in fooling the reader and criticised for its mediocre style of writing. I do agree that Agatha Christie is not really a good writer per se but she is a good MYSTERY writer. She may be accused of writing poor dialogue and filling her books with one-dimensional characters, but she makes up for it by giving her readers damnably tricky conundrums. I suppose she can be compared to Tom Clancy. Clancy's prose makes the reader roll his/her eyes sometimes but damn it, he can write a battle scene! As can Christie when it comes to a murder mystery.<br />This novel is one of her greatest conjuring tricks and is worth subsequent reads to find out how Christie deceives her readers. The story is straightforward enough but it is the twist in the end that leaves the reader going, \\"Well, I'll be darned...\\"
0060506989|5.0|For a long time I have been biased towards reading only WW II histories and therefore thought that no book could describe war better than MacDonalds 'Company Commander'.  Well, I was wrong, and this is the book that convinced me of this.  This is without a doubt the harshest, most vivid picture of war I have yet to see between the covers of a book.  Moore describes, literally, every moment of the most ferocious battle in Vietnam.  And unlike the movie, which only shows you half the battle, he tells about the second big NVA attack that decimated the Americans.  In this book you will see war in all of its horrific colors, like you have probably, never seen before.  In fact it almost makes a war historian not want to study war any more.  There is no glory here...only bravery and terror and horror and pain.  Pleasse take time to read this book that is oh so different from the movie...you will not be disappointed...
B000000LZV|5.0|This recording is, along with Husker Du's Zen Arcade, among the best recordings of the 1980s.  Hands down.  Jagged shards of punk and jazz, dada, country music, warped 70s rock fused into a cohesive whole.  While you can't call the music beautiful, you can call it amazing.  The music takes hold of you and alternately shakes you by your shirt collar, screams in your ear and makes you want to dance like a complete fool.    It's too bad that CDs came along and ruined the great cover art which included scary cartoons by Raymond Pettibone.
B00005B1FY|4.0|I remember when I was a lad of maybe 12 when I first listened to my first Led Zeppelin album.  Then I listened to it again recently and found myself reacting the same way I did years back- Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Misty Mountain Hop and Stairway to Heaven, despite getting played more on the radio than Howard Stern, are gems in the rock world, Battle of Evermore is a slight yet sweet treat, and the other three tracks are good along the lines of a rock enthusiast and appreciator.  Not for everyone, but for those who want to listen, at best they won't be dissapointed, not by a long shot, and at worst they can try II.
B00004WG28|5.0|I hated the original version of &quot;The King and I&quot; when I saw it in 8th grade, so when my mom took me to see this one in the theaters, it was a breath of fresh air compared to the orginal.<br />I liked this movie a lot! Jodie Foster is one of my favorite actresses, and although I can't say much for Chow Yun-Fat, He was impressive as King Monghut. And the scenery was very pretty.<BR>and I love movies that are based on true stories!<br />I'm really glad I have this movie!
0425173755|5.0|Ah, yes. The world famous case of the \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (MotOE). It is so famous, even people who have never read Christie know who did it. I first read it 12 years ago even though someone had already revealed to me the identity of the murderer. I've never forgiven him. But I read it anyway to find out for myself how Agatha Christie constructed the story in order to fool her readers.<br />Christie was probably inspired by the true story of the 'Lindbergh baby' kidnapping. Charles Lindbergh (he who flew across the Atlantic alone) had an infant child who was kidnapped and murdered even after the ransom had been paid. <br />The background to MotOE is also similar to the Lindbergh case. The victim is revealed to have been involved in a kidnap-murder case a few years back and got away with it. Was he punished for his crimes at last? Was he murdered for something totally unrelated? Or was he a victim of mistaken identity? <br />The usual suspects remind one of the typical English drawing room murder mysteries: an English colonel, a Russian princess, a count, a beautiful mysterious woman...they are all here. And Hercule Poirot has to discover who the murderer is and why, all by using his \\"little grey cells, mon ami.\\" <br />The revelation in the final pages will surprise the reader yet it will not strain belief too much. MotOE has been accused of being incredulous and downright silly but I disagree. Those who feel that way probably forgot that they are reading a fiction novel. I am sure one will find it a lot of fun if only to find out who from among the varied cast did it. You'll be gobsmacked, I assure you :)<br />The solution will also show the reader why MotOE is famous in its uniqueness and has never been copied (no writer dares to).<br />Another Agatha Christie mystery that features an incredible revelation and giving an \\"I would never have guessed that\\" feeling to the reader is \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". Both the Ackroyd and the Orient Express booksshould be in the Murder Mysteries Hall of Fame, if there is one.
0316236535|5.0|My son is 2 years old and his teachers read this book to his class at daycare.  All of the kids are obsessed with it and beg for it to be read.  They can't get enough.  I bought it for my son so we could read it at home and he carries it everywhere he goes.  It brings a smile to his face every time we read it.  He can identify each part on the monster face and point to his as well.  All I can say is BUY THIS BOOK!
B00005ARDC|5.0|As everyone said, you definitely got your Mary Chain attitude,  combined that with old school production and some noisey guttermouth guitar playing. Artfully sloppy. The vocals also go back to JMC, in a good way, and I even hear a hint of Lennon on a couple tunes.  If you like Brit Pop, even Brit Pop out of California, you'll definitely dig this.  A familiar throwback with some refreshing elements added.The BRMC definitely paid dues to some greats, and you can practically pick their influences song by song.  I grinned through the whole record.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Outside of tracks 3 and 5 on disc 1 (not that they are necessarily bad songs), every song on this uber-compilation from the stones is exceptional and enjoyably listenable in multiple playings.  The spirit, the coolness and utter virality of the Stones is captured on these 2 CD's (originally released as an LP back in 72) and should be part of ANY rock fan's music collection.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I had heard bad reviews about this movie but they were quickly extinguished. The movie is a tad slow at first but gets very good in no time at all. The special effects & music score makes the movie worth watching by themselves. HJO's acting is light years ahead of most adult actors. The viewer is completely engrossed in David's journey through centuries to find love and \\"the blue fairy\\". Also the movie raises deep moral questions about mankind and the creation of A.I. which I'm positive we'll deal with in the near future. A must see on DVD which does justice to the beauty of the movie. A future classic!
B00005JKYS|4.0|if it werent for that zzzzzzzzz part with madelien stowe and her new lips(who gave her the bright idea,melonie griffith?).only 1 scene was needed to show her HEROICALLY pass out death slips.i guess it was politically correct to show what ever part women play during wartime,HOWEVER,we got the idea after the 1st shot.and what the heck was with that womens group meeting?(more zzzzzzzzzzzz's)mel did a little bit of grand-standing pacing back and forth on the battlefield.sam elliots charactor was a wee bit unconvincing.overall,this is the 2nd best vietnam movie,and high on the top 10 war movies in my ever popular opinion.
B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is a phenominal film, easily the best war film since \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and definitely the best movie about the Vietnam war movie ever made.  This film celebrates the actions and the sacrifices of American soldiers in the Ia Drang valley, the trials of their families at home, and the perspective of the VC soldiers and their leaders.<br />The first 30-45 minutes firmly establishes the soldiers in the film as regular people, it wonderfully shows their faith, their doubts about their abilities as leaders, and their struggles as husbands and fathers, but still men who deeply care about their families.  One of the most memorable scenes from the film was when Moore's daughter asks him what a war is and his response to her question as he tucks her into bed.<br />Of course, the battle is the primary focus of the movie and the pace really gets going with the landing of the first helecopters.    The battle is a violent, realistic view of the events in the Ia Drang valley, on par with the battle scenes of \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"<br />This movie really strains the emotions, we watch men that we've come to know killed while trying to save their friends, and in a scene that really brought tears to my eyes, we see the yellow cabs delivering the government telegrams informing wives that their husbands are dead.<br />The film is respectful to almost everyone involved, American soldiers, Vietnamese soldiers, and the families of both groups.  The only people put in a disapproving light are some of the leaders involved in making deployment decisions, and the American press corps that comes running onto the battle field after the action is over.<br />I highly recomend this movie in every respect, it paints a very realistic, very human face on the first meeting between American and Vietnamese forces. (I actually liked this movie even more than Saving Private Ryan)
B00003CXXP|5.0|Next to Memento, A.I. is the greatest film I saw at all last year.  This is a great DVD with several fantastic special features that enhance the viewing experience the second, third, even tenth time around.  This film, however, is not for weak movie-goers.  Only true fans of film for the art will be able to understand the testing and outgoing attempt this film made.  Don't listen to the people who told you it was no good.  These are the people who think a film's realistic qualities should be dumbed down to please the less risky crowd.  A.I. must be seen with an open mind and understanding for real human nature.
B000002O4X|5.0|If you are like me, then you probably love music. This CD is one that you can listen to while doing other things or just relaxing with your eyes closed on a quiet afternoon.<br />John Barry is a remarkable composer and conveys a great deal of emotion in his music. This collection from the movie Out of Afrca is only one example of his talent, but a good example at that.<br />Hghly recommended!
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton's  Sleepy Hollow is not exactly the Disney version that you remember  as a kid, it is very dark and dreary and although Johnny Depp is great;  he plays Ichabod Crane like he's Sherlock Holmes. Depp  still brings much needed humor and charm to the film though. My favorite  scene is the two on one sword fight that might remind you of the one  in the Phantom Menace since Ray Park (Darth Maul) plays  the Horsemen. Ray Park shows once again why he's one of the best stunt men as the Headless Horsemen, the guy's movement is incredible. Christina Ricci has fine chemistry with Depp and gives her best performance  as well. Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) is marcho and a little cocky as Bron and seems very fitting in  the role but his character doesn't have as much of a role as he does in the original story. Tim Burton  was the perfect person to bring this story life although it's not exactly faithful to the original story much at all. Still though Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a new Horror classic that could be compared to the original Frankenstein and Dracula movies. Tim Burton wasted his talent with Planet of the Apes, making films with dark atmoshires like this are more his style and what he's best at. Sleepy Hollow is probably his best work to date and I wouldn't mind another film from him like it.
B00005214X|5.0|This is a great album. I feel the need to bow down to its greatness. The reason it's so great (of course) is its abormally huge concentration of GREAT songs. The greatest of the great on this album consist of 4 songs. The first, \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" also the obvious title track of this album is one of the greatest songs of all time and the best of the best. No other solo Beatle wrote a song nearly as great as this one song. Then it maintains its greatness with the gorgeous masterpiece \\"Isn't it a Pity.\\" The sheer heartache in that one is enough to bring a tear to your eye. The upbeat \\"Apple Scruffs\\" is a great song, perhaps the most catchy on the album (along with the two excellent hit songs from this album, the beautiful \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and the triumphant horn-influenced \\"What is Life\\"). It's (apple scruffs, that is) is a very folky song, with an acoustic guitar and harmonica that remind me of a certain Bob Dylan. To top off the masterpieces is the heavenly song \\"Beware of Darkness\\" with one of the sweetest guitar solos on the album and some of the best lyrics that you'll find in an ex-Beatle. Whew. But then again there is also the rockin' tune (reminiscent of \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" from the Beatle days) called Wah-Wah. That song SCREAMS White Album era and is yet another fantastic song. More great guitar work comes in \\"Art of Dying,\\" a unique song with a unique subject matter that is also quite a rockin' tune that I absolutely love. \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" is an exquisite piece of music that reminds me of Harrison's other classic ballad, \\"Something\\" from the Beatle days. Throw in \\"I Live For You\\" and the sweet, melancholy \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (let it roll)\\" and you've got the greatest Beatle solo album and at least one of the top five albums of all time, hands down. No argument. This is the holy grail.

B00005U1YO|5.0|oh my god, finally.<br />the chembro's have found their beats again. while i loved their first album &quot;exit planet dust&quot;, i just really like their 2nd, &quot;dig your own hole&quot;. Songs such &quot;as setting sun&quot; or &quot;blockrocking beats&quot; still stay in my head after not having listened to it for a long time. Then came surrender. a total let-down for me. i like 2 or 3 songs on the cd, the rest i could not stand really.<br />but now, the chembro's have found their beat again. thank you so much, this cd is everything i ever asked for from you. it has such a nice layout with songs, perfect. this is a cd you can listen to anywhere, and always love the music...just like moby's &quot;play&quot;. <br />songs such as &quot;my elastic eye&quot; or &quot;the test&quot; in the end are probably only beaten by &quot;pioneer skies&quot;, &quot;hoops&quot; or &quot;star guitar&quot;, which happen to be on the same cd. so get it...<br />5 stars from me for the best chembro album there yet. listen to it, you will never loose these beats again.

B000EQ5TSI|4.0|I think people are too hard on this film. Yes it's the worse of the 3 films but I still really like it. Tom did ruin the Mission Impossible though franchise by making everything about just one guy instead of a team like the tv series. Like I said in my Mission Impossible 1 review, he's a pure ego actor that made everything about Ethan Hunt who he happens to play. I don't even think Ethan was in the tv serries. Jim was the main guy and in the first film they made him turn bad.<br /><br />  While the first was all brains, this one hardly has any. It's a pure\\" look at me I'm Tom Cruise film\\". It's just him showing off for 2 hours. If you saw the maing of part 3 on Spike TV where Tom talks the making of all 3 films, he basically takes credit for everything! While talking about part 2 he says \\"it was my idea to have the knife come extremely close to my eye because that was never done in film before\\". He's such a know it all that's so into himself. Mission Impossible is supposed to be about teams working together in secret missions and since he produces the movies eveything is about him.<br /><br />  Tom wants each Mission Impossible to be different with a different director each time. That's probably the only idea of his I really like. Here John Woo directs and yes he made a bad Mission Impossible movie but managed to make a fun stunt show of a movie. The whole plot is basically about Tom falling for a women who's going to be used for a secret mission. They wanna use her since she used to go out with the main villian. The whole movie is basically about him trying to save her....so they can hold hands at the end to some sweet music when you know he'll just have a new g/f in part 3.<br /><br />  Dougray Scott (Heist, Dark Water) at least adds some coolness to the film as the villian. He probably should've chose playing Wolverine in X-Men instead of doing this though. Instead he was replaced by Hugh Jackman and it did wonders for Jackman's career. While Dougray Scott is barely seen in a movies and his show Heist was cancelled already. At least he was one of the better things about Mission Impossible 2. It's nice seeing Anthony Hopkins in the film too as Ethan's boss eventhough he's sorta wasted.<br /><br />  John Woo wasn't the best choice for a MI film since his direction is either too stylish with too much slow motion and close-ups. Brian De Palma at least focused on the plot. Woo and Cruise here just care about action shots and what looks cool. I can see why people hate the film but I still I find it hard to. It's a not a bad escape movie. You wanna get away from your problems, you can throw it with some surround sound and still have  a  good time. Like I said it's a stunt show and that's about it. I Plan on seeing part 3 today and hopefully that one has action and...a brain unlike this film which just has action.ely seen in a movies and his show Heist was cancelled already.

B00003CX5P|5.0|Leaving the movie commentaries aside, I consider this an excellent DVD set. <br />The video and sound quality are excellent, the second disc provides a considerable amount of extra material, including TV spots and theater trailers, deleted scenes, various documentaries, picture galleries, an introduction to animatics and how they were integratedd in the movie, the making of the movie, plus the fantastic and highly emotional &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; music video.  It is a very well organized disc, very easy to navigate and full of interesting goodies.<br />In the Making Of you can see George Lucas in action during various crucial moments of the movie's filming and producing, including casting, editing, plus inside videos of various crew and cast members.  It turns out to be highly educational for movie fans.<br />The movie disc together with the second disc makes this DVD set worth purchasing and that's why I humbly recommend it to you.<br />Enjoy this classic.

0062502182|1.0|Without meaning to sound philosophical, I have to start my review by saying I do not believe there is such a thing as absolute truth. Like beauty, it is in the eyes of the beholder. Case in point: is THE ALCHEMIST a good book, a bad book or an indifferent one? Rarely has a book generated such diverse opinions. Feelings range from one end of the love-hate spectrum to the other, so which is the truth? That, depends on you. Or rather, on who you are.<br />To me, THE ALCHEMIST is absolute trash. The story revolves around the determined quest of a young boy to fulfil his dream. Not a bad subject in itself. What renders this book dismissable is a rare combination of borrowed axioms presented in the shallowest way. Irritating too. The basic message of `you've got to follow your heart' is repeated over and over again. Duly complemented by the sub-dictum `if you do, the universe will make sure you succeed'. Do not look for substantiation to those grandiose claims, none is given. Presumably the answers lie hidden in the sacred books of the Alchemists (among which Mr. Coelho must be a prominent figure) and not in this book that you are supposed to buy.<br />But maybe Mr. Coelho meant his book for kids, where, given a kid's short attention span the incessant repetitions make sense. Aha, but what about the fact that the hero's motive for his journey was to find a hidden treasure? Do you really want you kids to grow up valuing material wealth above all?<br />So there you have it. THE ALCHEMIST is addressed to adults who will not misinterpret the treasure hunt moral. On the other hand it is written like a children's story, complete with desert battles and elements that speak (the wind, the sand etc). If you like it, it is fine with me.
0783244320|4.0|Galaxy Quest<br />  is about a former Trek like cast who's tv went off the air. Now<br />  all the cast has to look forward to is autograph sessions, well that<br />  is until a group of real aliens named Thermians need their help. The<br />  Thermians have the show mistaken for historical documents thus thinking<br />  that everything on the show really happend. Now the former cast find<br />  themselves doing battle with an evil alien named Sarris on a ship that<br />  has everything the ship on the series had, the only problem is that<br />  they're just actors that don't know how to use the real ship. Tim Allen, Alan Rickman<br />  and Enrico Colantoni are very good in the movie. I thought Enrico did<br />  a great job as the leader of the Thermians, he was very funny and kid<br />  like, he was very beleivable as a not too bright alien and I mean that<br />  in a good way. Galaxy Quest<br />  is the best zany Science Fiction film since Men in Black, if only movies<br />  like these were made more often. Star Trek fans with a good sense os<br />  humor will love this movie.

6305807086|4.0|I really<br />  like unusual films that you can't make much sense of them like Brazil<br />  or Fight Club and Being John Malkovich is right up there, it's about<br />  a puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) and his obsession for his partner<br />  Maxine (Cathrine Keener) who doesn't really like him much, her ways<br />  of making him feel like 2 cents are hilarious. Well it's not all about<br />  that, did I mention Craig finds a doorway to John Malkovich's head<br />  that allows you to be John Malkovich and that him and Maxine start<br />  charging people that wanna try it. Oh yeah and Maxine is in love with<br />  Craig's wife, well when she's in Malkovich. The result is a wacky, funny and very original<br />  film with unusual charactors. A really good start for Spike Jonze,<br />  he should have a great career behind him if he makes more films as<br />  original as this.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Before I saw this movie I new a little about John Nash, that he was schizophrenic.  I had also read somewhere that he and his wife had divorced.  I've read others' reviews about how the movie left out this and left out that.  It really doesn't matter.  What I got out of this is a man, a genius, who is paranoid schizophrenic and how it affected his life.  Why do we need to know about numerous affairs and bisexuality?  As far as the movie being too long, well as much as they are charging for movies I certainly don't mind a movie that is over 2 hours.  And last, WHO CARES about whether it is Oscar worthy?  Russell Crowe does a great performance regardless of some critics that go on and on about a terrible accent. When have Oscars been about who's the best? Anyway, I thought it was a very good movie and a great performance by Russell Crowe, much better than his performance in Gladiator which won him an Oscar when he really should have won for The Insider.
B000002MUW|5.0|Out of the albums I own buy Madonna: Like a Prayer,Erotica,Bedtime Stories,Ray of Light, and Music, this is the one I could get in to the most(this is not to say those other albums are bad, but this is the one I come back to the most). I love the oh-so catchy \\"Secret\\", such a good song, the sassy \\"Human Nature\\", The lush \\"Take a Bow\\", the soul-baring \\"Inside Me\\", the goovy \\"Survival\\", the carefree \\"Don't Stop\\", and the surreal Bjork penned title track. It makes for a diverse, yet cohesive album that saw Madonna stretching in to new musical territory, in this case soul music, which she has, sadly, never truly revisited, it was a great fit for her.<br /><br />  This is a lot different then her other albums, its more on the soulful side of things then her previous releases, and the releases after, it is very smooth and groovish, as well as very sensual, without being explicit like erotica, it is the beats and melodies, not the words that create the mood. This music is good, and the language isn't too explicit except on \\"Human Nature\\", but it is put to good use.<br /><br />  This may not have been the era Madonna is most remembered for, but her it both her most refined effort, and gives up glimpses of Madonna could have blossomed in to if she dropped the need-to-shock mentality and wouldn't have converted to Kaballah and went whole sell in to electro-pop.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Scary Movie is a spoof of recent  horror movies (I Know what you did Last  Summer, Scream, Scream 2, The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project)<br />  and it even makes fun of non-horror films like (The Usual Suspects,<br />  Titanic and The Matrix). When it's not making fun of movies though<br />  it's making fun of everything else, how this movie round up with an<br />  R-Rating and isn't NC-17 is beyond me because I don't think I've seen<br />  so many penis jokes, gay jokes, or racist jokes in one movie. Scary Movie<br />  offers alot of laughs but what got me giggling the most was the special-ed<br />  student and part-time security guardd Doofy, the retarted deputy who's<br />  obviously poking fun at Dewey from Scream. He was the showstealer<br />  for me because all his lines were just hilarious and were delivered<br />  great by Dave Sheridan. Also good in their roles are Shawn<br />  Wayans as a gay football player who slaps the butt of each player<br />  as they go by in the lockerroom, Marlon Wayans as a pot smoking horror<br />  film buff. Newcomer Anna Faris as Cindy gets alot of laughs as well.<br />  She has alot of funny scenes where she actually pokes fun at herself<br />  alot of times in the movie and is just totally natural about it which<br />  makes her scenes work even better. If you thought (There's Something<br />  About Mary, American Pie or Road Trip) were raunchy well then you've<br />  seen nothing until you've seen Scary Movie. Don't get me wrong some<br />  jokes don't work but most of them do. Scary Movie is the funnest time<br />  I've ever had at the movies, I can't recall the last time I laughed<br />  so hard. It's the first time I can actually say that I really enjoyed<br />  a stupid movie.

6305907145|1.0|I am amazed that anyone who claims to have read Ms. Austen's work and enjoyed it would enjoy this movie.  I am not such a purist that I cannot enjoy artistic license in a movie but this one completely missed the story.  It seems to me that the director and screen writer were more interested in being artistic than in telling the story of Fanny Price.  The movie leaves out essential parts of the story that explain how Fanny comes to live at Mansfield Park.  It leaves out the relationship between Fanny and her brother who serves in the military.  The time the writer spent editing important parts of the story he used to create pieces that never existed.  It is really too bad because the cast could have worked.  As it is, this movie left me with a bad taste and I had to reach for Pride & Prejudice to get rid of it!  If you want to know the story of Mansfield Park read the book.  So far nothing on television or the big screen has gotten it right.

B00000IP3S|4.0|I give four stars to this release because after the first 4 tracks the level of richness decreases considerably -excluding &quot;And the story ends&quot;, of course. However, this is anyway a very solid release, full of bombastic choirs and fast riffing and drumming. Those that found &quot;Nightfall In The Middle Earth&quot; interesting, probably will also like &quot;Imaginations...&quot;, although this one is a less mature and less majestic release, since it was delivered before &quot;Nightfall...&quot;. But I recommend it in any case to power metal, Blind Guardian and &quot;Nightfall...&quot; fans. You won't be disappointed!
6301442962|4.0|I mean the black and white version!  Don't get me started on coloration of classics!<br />But this movie has a lot of charm.  Natalie Wood is sweet and cute without being sickening.  Edmund Gwenn gives a wonderful and believable performance as Santa.

All very good performances and a classic that gets better every year!

B00003CXB7|3.0|The DVD's attractive packaging and the chance to see this important film in widescreen don't quite overshadow the fact that some of the extras here are nothing special.  There are two documentaries on the background of the film and much of the information is interchangeable.  Director Altman's audio commentary is disappointing; he seems uninspired, self-congratulatory, and what he says often has little apparent connection to what's on the screen.  Nevertheless, I don't want to sell this DVD short, again because it gives viewers a chance to view the film in a format that is close to what its creators intended.  Having seen old TV versions of the movie, I felt like I was seeing it for the first time.  Like many counter-cultural classics of its time, MASH doesn't always hold up well.  It is a matter of \\"you had to be there\\": first, the cast and crew were obviously having a hell of a good time, playing to each other and Altman, not to the audience.  In the context of Vietnam and free love, seeing this must have been exhilarating.  Now, some of it seems mean-spirited and no more progressive than the values its makers were mocking.  But, in the context of the current \\"war on terrorism,\\" the film has considerable power: its message is that war is a bloody farce in which every chance to get drunk or laid must be taken.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This is one of the two best movies I have ever seen.  It's a modern day masterpiece and will be a classic.  I am very glad I saw it originally on the big screen.  Film students will study this in college courses in the future.  Nicole Kidman ranks amoung all the celebrated actresses of yesteryear:  Audrey Hepburn, Marliyn Monroe, etc.  (It's all Tom's loss.  She outshines him as a star a thousand times over.)  Ewan McGregor perfectly fills his role as well and has an unbelievable voice.  I would love to see this as a broadway play!  <BR>In reponse to the bad reviews:  1) These people probably shouldn't watch musicals,  2) are not very cultured,  3) and/or [finicky].

The deleted scene \\"Finding Flamel\\" was a really funny sequence that shouldn't have been left out of the film. I personally wanted to find out more about the 3 little heroes played by Harry, Hermione and Ron, but it was still a delightful experience. The movie was nothing like the book as more people would say but the film had great moments just as well as the book did.<BR>I rated this film 5 stars because of the effort that was put in the story from the very beginning, and i CAN'T wait until the second movie \\"Chamber Of Secrets\\" comes into theaters on Friday November 15th, 2002.<br />Overall, I think the best part on the dvd was meeting the 3 little stars that made this movie possible, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint).<br />GREAT FILM!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|The film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is not based on the real Pearl Harbor.  This is a completely fictional story about a fictional War in a fictional place called Pearl Harbor; a place where American War Ships are docked.  Late in the film, this fictional place gets attacked by a fictional Japanese squadron of fighter planes.  It is silly to point out historical or technical errors this film may have. This film is not trying to be real. It is trying to be fiction, it is trying to be wrong, and is also trying to teach the younger generations not to believe their history books.  Its' point is to be as innacurate a portrayal of something that didn't really happen as possible.<BR>If you liked this movie, you are wrong.  You are not entitled to your opinion.  This movie is ALL LIES.  Infact the film shows no feeling for what happened and gave no sense of what it was like to be there.  But that is because Michael Bay didn't have any interest in the subject matter.  So he slept his way through this complete shame of a movie.<BR>NO ONE CAN LIKE THIS MOVIE.<BR>UNLESS YOU HATE EVERY AMERICAN WHO WAS AT PEARL HARBOR, WHICH THIS FILMMAKER CLEARLY DOES.<br />PLEASE DO NOT PRAISE THIS FILM EVER EVER AGAIN!
B00005U18E|5.0|While I'm trying very hard to not prejudice myself when a  movie strays too far from what the original book was about, I will definately admire a film more when it does capture what the author of the book had in mind.  This one does it, and does it very well.  <br />A lot of bad things could have been done to this film.  They could have tried to make her more likeable by cutting down on the vices.  They could have made her slimmer.  Or, with reference to the recent &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, they could have chucked England all together and put it in the U.S..  <br />But they recognized that somehow Bridget is somehow likeable IN SPITE OF the mess her personal life is in, and maybe because of it.  So they left it in England, and kept all the vices.  And while Kate Winslett seemed the logical choice for the role, I thought it was a big gamble to get Texan Renee' Zellweger plumped up.  The gamble paid off. <br />One thing the movie adds that wasn't apparent in the book (nor could it be) was with the Mark Darcy part.  It would seem that he is secretly attracted to her early in the story.  As the book was her diary, we are not privy to it, and this was an interesting addition.  <br />The two male leads are also very good.  Colin Firth seems to always come off as someone who needs a good bran muffin.  Well, he has that look here, but also shows a very human side.  And Hugh Grant does more acting just coming out of the elevator (showing his character's personality) in his opening scene than many actors do in an entire movie.  He does a great job playing a guy to does some scummy things, but isn't really a bad person.  <br />Kind of like Bridget.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again.  If you haven't seen this movie, well you are missing a master piece. And how could you not go out and buy this file, even if you don't like Tom Hanks? It's got history, great music and lots of tears and laughs.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Yes, I think Bruce Springsteen is everything rock and roll is SUPPOSED to be, and I love Bob Dylan for his serious lyrics.  But once in awhile it's not bad to relax, put tongue firmly in cheek, and enjoy the music.  The Ramones made a career of it, and somehow this album came out of nowhere to put all the pieces together.  <br />EVERYTHING in this album is done to excess, and it wouldn't have worked if they would have put more stops in.  The cover is outrageous.  The singer and writer weren't really rock people, they were actors and comedians.  And many aren't aware that E Street Band members Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg provide solid playing.  And one has to acknowledge producer Todd Rundgren for putting something all together that is frankly more interesting than any of his own albums.  <br />While subconsiously one has to have that tongue in cheek to get it, I discard that feeling while the album is playing and choose to get hooked, lined, and sinkered into what they are presenting.  This is the best way to enjoy the album.  Try singing the loud parts to empathize how Mr. Loaf blew out his vocal chords out from the material.  Try to ignore the punchline and realize that &quot;Two Out of Three Ain't Bad&quot; really is a sweet song. Realize that the singer of this song is honest, unlike the poor schmuck of &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot; who is given an offer he can't refuse, and (the song hints), goes for it to his everlasting regret.  <br />This one is a Top 10 of all time for me.
B000002BSG|5.0|This album flows so well, its sometime difficult to tell where one song ends and another begins.  The work on the &quot;Digi&quot; in the middle of the album is a fantastic taste of the instrament's vast and variable sound.  Overall the album rivals that of Pink Floyd's Dark Side, in its sense of moving... actually traveling from song to song.  This is the sort of record for listening to loud, with the lights off... or if you have the lights on... use lots of multicolored ones!
B00003CXXP|1.0|I really expected a lot from this movie, considering Spielberg's usual triumphs.  However, I was shocked to see a movie that was composed of every possible cliche imaginable:  robots replacing humans in the future, a couple whose child is in a coma \\"replacing\\" their son with a artificial one, the sibling rivalry that takes place when the comatose son awakes and meets his \\"brother\\", a Pinocchio-like boy desperately wanting to be real, the horrific vision of the earth in the future with a \\"Waterworld-like\\" environment where NYC is partically underwater, aliens reviving humans through the DNA found in a strand of hair left behind thousands of years earlier.  The list goes on!  <br />On another note, I found Haley Joel Osment's performance particularly disturbing.  Very much like his Sixth Sense character, he only stares at people and looks scared all of the time, over and over again repeating the same exact emotion.  You'd think that as an advanced \\"organism\\", he would have greater aspirations than to be loved by a \\"mother\\" whom he knew about a week before she abandoned him in a forest to die.  <br />Overall, this is one of the worst movies that I've seen in a long time.  The only good thing was the score and seeing the World Trade Center towers in their former glory, albeit partially submerged in water.
0393317552|1.0|It doesn't say much for the Pulitzer that this mendacious piece of garbage won an award.Diamond denies that the ideas of freedom of the individual,the insistence on technological,philosophical inquiry and scientific method that the Western world has advocated and practiced these last 2,000 years;instead he reaches back 13,000 years to find an excuse as to why the 3rd world today is in such miserable shape.Here's a clue:most of what we call the 3rd world has no tradition of individual freedom or scientific inquiry;most 3rd world countries have yet to grasp the concept of plumbing-maybe that has a little something to do with rampant disease and unsanitary conditions?Diamond ultimately takes the road of the Left in discrediting the achievements of the Western world out of some misplaced guilt over the 3rd world's BACKWARDNESS.Yes,the 3rd world is backward,that is why it is such a sorry state.To try and discredit the vast accomplishments that has sought to bring mankind out of the caves in order to appease the guilt over the 3rd world being so bad off is pure liberal guilt 101.Diamond conveniently overlooks the fact that there have been other civilizations that had fertile and abundant livestock and resources,yet did not come out their backwardness until they had contact with European settlers and missionaries.In no way do I believe that European civilization is necessarily the best possible civilization that mankind can achieve,but the most free,comfortable,luxury-stuffed well-off societies that exist today are not the result of a jungle culture of New Guinea but an outgrowth of the Western ideas inherent in Christianity,science,medicine,democratic goverments and belief in the individual as oppesed to the Authority of the State or King or Marxist-minded individuals like Diamond who would bring us to the noble savage kingdom on Earth like our pals the nazi's  and communists tried to do in the not so distant past.This book is absolute sewage and the Pulitzer is a joke.
014043786X|3.0|My first foray into the work of the most famous detective novelist in English literature was both better and worse than I expected it would be.  Doyle writes in fascinating detail, but ultimately his means of plotting \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" will slightly disappoint today's readers.<br />The best thing about this novel is the world that the author creates in and around it, a world replete with mystery and unidentifiable threat and foreboding.  Characters are drawn early and drawn well, usually via a pseudo-scientific narrative that presents visible traits or facts and then draws conclusions from there.  In so doing, Doyle fits himself snugly into the realist tradition going back at least as far as Balzac's earliest novels, but Holmes' pre-occupation with scientific method pushes this even further until he becomes a sort of storyteller within a story; each clue leads to a supposition that is just as often speculative fiction as it is right on the money.  The effect of this is one of the necessary components of great detective fiction: that is, we readers are presented with solutions that are not correct and that necessarily keep us reading until we get the correct one.  Doyle does this well.<br />However, it's another necessary component of today's detective fiction that is missing in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" and that this reader missed dearly: the right solution, carefully and mischievously tucked into the narrative along the way.  Part of why we read detective stories is to see whether we are as good at solving them as the detective in the story is, and Doyle refuses to allow us to do that.  I don't want to give the ending away, but I will say by way of complaint that it comes from left field, and in such a way that the reader never could have guessed it.  The writer of such a tale would today be accused of lazy emplotment.  The best counter-example to this is the masterful job done by someone like Scott Turow; the power of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" is largely that, when the mystery is revealed, we realize that we should have seen it all along, just like the protagonist did (although 99% of us DON'T see it all along, because Turow is that subtle).  We have been teased and held in the dark not just by Turow, but by the narrator we have come to trust.  When the plot is done right, the ending should feel like an ending to the story we've just been told, and not the introduction of something completely new.<br />Despite that fact--the fact that Doyle won't let me play detective--\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is an enjoyable read and offers insight into the earliest avatars of today's most popular type of fiction.gely that, when the mystery is revealed, we realize that we should have seen it all along, just like the protagonist did (although 99% of us DON'T see it all along, because Turow is that subtle).

B00003CX95|5.0|Another great American success story....Producers thought Mel was crazy, would not give him more money to finish this &quot;chef-d'oeuvre &quot;...He came up with the 20 million missing from his own personnal fortune aud see the result : 5 Oscars including best picture as well as best director...Nothing more to say .... Probably the best story ever told on screen and definitely my all time favorit movie.
B00005JKES|5.0|I was amazed by the quality of both film and DVD. The picture and sound (DTS &amp; DD5.1) is on par with the best DVDs available on the market!<BR>I watched first the pilot (Chinese DVD) - compared to the this box set the quality is awfull, audio has defects, etc but you must fisrt see the pilot and then go on to the episodes. I hardly made myself to stop watching a third episode in a row and leave it for tomorrow. Twin Peaks is one great movie of all times!<BR>Can'twait till the rest of the seasons will come out on DVD, so Icould continue my journey to Twin Peaks and watch FIRE WALKS WITH ME at the end
B00003CXPD|5.0|This film is a real surprise.  The adult characters each have their own objectives in life and are so focused on their own needs and their own environment.  Billy realizes he has a passion for dancing, particularly the ballet.  No, for all the twisted right-wingers, ....  In this blue collar coalmining town, his father and older brother are so stuck in their routine existance that they fail to see that there is more beyond their town.<br />Once the father realizes that his son has the passion for dance and a lot of talent for it, he becomes a real father who knows he must go beyond his own selfishness and put the needs/wants of his child first.  Once he starts supporting Billy's passion, the brother too realizes that he cannot deny his brother a life different than his own.<br />This is truly a family film showing what real parental and family love is all about.  Its a very excellent \\"feel good\\" film that you will watch over and over until your DVD can't take it anymore.<br />Get ready for some serious low English accents, big laughs, superb dancing by this young unknown kid, and lots of big tears!  I watch it when I need a boost to support my kids' passions for life.
B00005B36H|5.0|After much debating with myself on whether or not to get &quot;Lateralus&quot;, I decided to go ahead and pick it up.  Much to my astonishment this was nothing like I expected, and that is a positive thing.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is not like most albums that seem to go from song to song, instead every track blends together in an incredible musical experience.  It's almost impossible to pick favorites on album like this, though the infectious guitar work on &quot;Schism&quot; seems worth the price of admission alone.  Not only that, but Maynard's lyrics eerily seem to relate to one event or another in my life, which I know has been said before by other reviewers.  From the howling vocals to the impressive guitar/drum/bass work &quot;Lateralus&quot; is an extraordinary album that should be heard by every rock fan new or old.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first rule about the Fight Club DVD is you will add this to your DVD collection now.<BR>One of the best movies I have ever seen, and one of the best produced, standard-setting DVDs out there.  The commentary, top-notch; the extras, funny and detailed.<BR>If you liked this movie, you will like it even more after owning the DVD.
B00005UW7V|3.0|I believe the message that this movie is trying to get accross is that we are headed for a disposeable society which will include people. Also do not mess with GOD'S work as we will only make our life worse. The movie it self is good and Haley is an excellent actor in this movie. Really you must watch this and see what we are doing to ourselves slowly but surely.
6305470464|5.0|When I watched this movie, I was expecting some good highlights after all, two great actresses were starring (Anderson, Jolie) so I was really looking forward to it. But when I saw it, I was blasted away by such great preformance, it's great because in the end, when everything ties together, you're like &quot;Ahhhh..&quot; So I'd have to say, it was brilliant, and that extra music video in the end was a nice touch too. The song's pretty catchy!
0345440900|5.0|Tracy, you're a lifesaver. When my wife and I bought this book, our baby daughter was just a month old. We were still getting the hang of things, and although things were not really bad, there were times when we really didn't know what our little girl wanted.<br />The uncanny thing is that when I read this book two weeks later, I realised that almost everything Ms Hogg wrote applied to us. For example, the book made us realised that certain cries and actions meant our baby was NOT hungry, but was TIRED. This one simple fact, this one simple thing that Ms Hogg taught us to differentiate completely and utterly changed our lives - we found ourselves better able to predict and understand what our daughter needed, and so all of us benefited - or at the very least, got more sleep! <br />How can I further demonstrate this further? We keep a diary for our daughter, and on one particularly frustrating day, we found ourselves unable to satisfy her, and she kept crying and fussing. My wife and I recorded how we kept trying to feed our daughter, until she seemed to fall asleep out of exhaustion. When we looked back at this early entry, my wife and I were utterly aghast - every sign our daughter displayed was as Ms Hogg indicates: signs of tiredness, not hunger. We were so wrong, and we were so amazed by the power of a few pages of words in this book - it can literally change lives.<br />A few negative reviews of this book I've seen at Amazon give me the impression that these readers have taken Ms Hogg's advice literally and rigidly. Please bear in mind that the authors make it very clear that all babies are different, and that they are only giving guidelines and advice, not commands. Read the book with a pinch of salt, and see how it can guide you and help you. Parents trying to follow Ms Hogg's advice should only use what applies to them, and not follow blindly, or worse, employ her EASY and/or SLOW methods like formulae. They are not. They should only be used, as the author suggests, where it helps you. If it doesn't help you, by all means, don't follow. I'm just glad to say that I agree and have benefitted from 90%+ of Ms Hogg's advice.<br />Tracy Hogg and her co-author Melinda Blau write in a very personal, intimate tone, as if they are speaking to you exclusively. This made the book extremely readable - I finished it in 3 days. This is one of those books where almost every page taught me something new, and better, something helpful. And even if they didn't, or even if you don't believe or agree with everything Ms Hogg says, there are probably at least a few key things she teaches which will impart upon the reader the means to understand, communicate with, and soothe your baby. In the chaos of a post-partum home, how much more can a new parent ask?
1587990717|5.0|This is the first book of its kind to correctly analyze the randomness that is inherent in any group of supposed \\"winners\\".  No one before has written so eloquently about the subject matter.  A great book written for Wall Streeters and Main Streeters.  Critics that think Taleb is bombastic or arrogant have their own issues that aren't related to the book.  Very interesting and quite amusing read
0446525537|4.0|I just finished reading A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks,  which is about how everything changes when you find that special somone. Also Sparks sends an upliffing message to his readers that you dont have always need to be popular to find your true love.<br />Landon Carter had dated a girl or two, and even has been in love. The last person in town he thought he could fall in love with is Jamie Sullivan, a quiet girl who carries a Bible where ever she goes, and lives a differnt life then other teenagers.<br />Since Landon didn't have a date for the homecoming dance he asked Jamie to go. Landon had no idea he would forever be changed by Jamie and he would come to find out that being with her would send him on the road to manhood.<br />I would recommend this book because in life each of us may find one great love, or even a great friend that changes everything.
0385503954|4.0|One of the most eagerly anticipated releases of the literary year, McEwan's newest novel once again shows him to be among the most skilled users of the English language alive today. Structurally it is in fact a single story told through three distinct novellas and an epilogue, for reasons that only become apparent at the end, as does the reason for the reminiscences of Woolf. Characterization is another field McEwan excels in, and most of the book's players are superbly believable: Paul Marshall in particular displays a sort of casual venality which would have placed him in good company among those who inhabited McEwan's previous novel, &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. And just as he kept us waiting till the end before revealing why that novel was titled &quot;Amsterdam&quot;, McEwan makes us wait to learn the exact nature of Briony's atonement.<br />To some degree, the telling outweighs the tale: this book is a pageturner not because of breakneck action or cliffhanging suspense but because of the care and artistry with which the author crafts it. In the hands of a less talented writer the storyline might prove a bit thin; yet it is the power of the gifted to weave such color and character into a story that its reading can be a leisurely pleasure.
B000002JOH|5.0|I can't even start! There is this sheer heaviness on this record that is superbly executed. Pure Madness!!! \\"Walk\\" alone is worth the price, so why doubt it??

B00005221L|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger continues defining his well known style and reputation from 'Conan' with this 1987 hit that was ahead of its time. Schwazenegger is Dutch, a guerilla war fighter with a team of good-old boys packing just as much muscle each. Carl Weathers is a former military cut-out turned CIA, who drags Dutch and his team to a musty carribean jungle island under false pretenses. Their mission is to rescue political hostages captured by Cuban rebels, but they wind up getting in over their heads when they're hunted down by a phenomenon of the jungle...or so it appears. Sonny Landham is perfect as the 6' muscle-bound, full-blooded Indian who packs a badass attitude and a huge knife while his native heritage keeps him in tune with the land and his surroundings...when he turns to his men and says \\"We all gon' die\\", you just wanna stand up and chear. The Predator is an effect you have to see for yourself.. Arnold, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham and Jesse Ventura build the tobacco chewing, tough-talking, machine gun-firing and roof-rasing explosions around the story to make it a perfect 'Arnold' trademark movie. Unfortunately, the only thing missing is the topless woman...I guess with a movie this action-packed we'll be alright for now.
B000001E8S|4.0|\\"Very, very bad self-indulgent music.\\" This is not the judgment of an unimpressed critic. This is the band's own drummer speaking. Guess I'm a little more impressed by the whole endeavour than Larry Mullen Jr., because I find this collection of fictitious film soundtracks fabulous. Including the drumming. <br />Mega-stars like U2 usually put an album out about twice a decade, but with 'Original Soundtracks,' producer Brian Eno coaxed the band back into the studio for the third time in a roughly four-year span. He may have been on to something: it is as if, through sheer, prolonged immersion in music-making, the celebrity has been sweated out of them. Eno and the band relax into a very un-U2 experimentalism that would have you believe the guys had spent their whole lives playing ambient. Some tracks, like \\"One Minute Warning\\" and \\"Let's Go Native,\\" sound as if chunks of 'Achtung Baby' or 'The Joshua Tree' had broken off from their planets and gone into wholly new orbits. Others, like \\"\\"Miss Sarajevo\\" and \\"Your Blue Room,\\" are fully worked out songs -- and are as strong as anything this band has done.<br />At its best this album makes me long for what U2 *could* have been: all their prodigious skills and talent intact but freed for once from the band's exasperating ambition to be all things to all people. What they might sound like if they lived on a desert island. No audience to conquer. Only guitars and blank tape. And coconuts.
0452282152|5.0|I just picked up this book at a bookstore, and couldn't stop reading.  Had to buy it then, of course.  It's a great easy read, it's fun, and it's inspiring, and it's beautifully written.  Don't expect to re-read it over and over, but expect a very enjoyable read you'll want to share with your friends and family.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive captures the quintessence of film.  It is a picture that moves.  Go.  Sit down.  Watch.  Listen.  (Try not to let the people tactlessly and too loudly asking their significant others, \\"What's going on?\\" for the first 40 minutes distract you).  Plot and theme and everything else will come to you after you walk out of the theater.  Wait until then to think about those things.  Do this and be prepared to have something happen to you.  This picture is both sickeningly beautiful and sickening, meaningless and rife with meaning, distant but all about you.  This is why we pay [money] to see a movie-occasionally we come across something like this.  I'm positive I never have nor ever will come across something like this again.

0345440900|4.0|PLEASE...disregard the parents who say you \\"cannot\\" put a new baby on a schedule/routine.  HOGWASH!  This is most untrue.  Your baby will respond to the routine that YOU set.  It does take work and a serious commitment from Mom and Dad, but it can be done.  Don't try a routine for two days and then throw up your hands and say, \\"It won't work!  Babies can't be put on a schedule!\\"  Decide how your home will function and STICK WITH IT.<br /><br />I am a new mother of a wonderful 2 month old baby boy. I bought Tracy's book in a desperate attempt to find the secret to getting my son to sleep through the night. While it did not reveal the exact secret (he is now sleeping 9 hours at night), it did affirm most of the \\"old-fashioned-common-sense\\" baby raising strategies that my own mother shared with me. I found Tracy's methods to be balanced, loving and easy to do. I also found them to be fair to everyone in the household, not just the new arrival.<br />Attention New Moms! You don't have to give up your life to be loving and caring with your baby. Establishing a regular routine for your baby (and you) will benefit both of you. Try Tracy's E-A-S-Y method and put some order to chaos. Your mom was right!<br />----<br />UPDATE!  April, 2004: When I first wrote this review our son was 2 months.  He is now 2 years and absolutely thriving. Putting our son on a schedule, and keeping him on a schedule, has made for a happy and healthy home.  We've scarcely noticed that we're in the midst of \\"the terrible twos\\" as he is just a delight to be around. Holding steadfast to a routine saw us through some of those big transitions, including weaning, going from two naps to one and moving from a crib to a big boy bed. In a two-year-old's world, where everything is new and changing, a routine that is stable provides a tremendous sense of security. It also makes things easy for Mom and Dad who know exactly what each day will bring.
B000001FY9|5.0|If a test of good taste in music were to be introduced then surely Bob Marley would be part of it. How can you not like this? Great political messages sung in an uplifting and inspiring way. Fantastic rhythms and beautiful melodies. Bob Marley is as good as popular music gets. Usually with greatest hits albums you imagine what you would have included and end up excluding half the songs on the original. Here this is pretty much what I would have included (although 'I shot the Sheriff' was ruined for me by the absolutely dreadful Eric Clapton cover and perhaps 'Positive Vibration' and 'Johnny Was' should have been on here). If you want an introduction to reggae music (and everyone should have one) this is the place to start. If you do not already own this what are you waiting for?
B004BLTNM0|4.0|To date, Zarchi's exploitation classic is the film that all other revenge flicks aspire to be or continue to steal pages from. Even after all these years, people still have great memories of ISOYG and time has truly been more than kind to this brutal cult film. While many other films in the same genre have seemingly fallen off the face of the earth or the cult cinema map, Meir Zarchi's film will never suffer such a fate.<br /><br />According to the faithful wiki, The film's original title was Day of the Woman. It was also shown under the title I Hate Your Guts and The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill. The title was changed to I Spit on Your Grave for the 1980 re-release. Meir Zarchi dislikes this title.<br /><br />While I've never been quite sure whether ISOYG is merely a starchy exploitation flick or a trashy female empowerment story, it's compelling to say the very least and I do still find myself wanting to revisit Zarchi's cruel world from time to time. How about now?<br /><br />Jennifer Hills (played by the truly beautiful Camille Keaton) wants nothing more than to get away from the hustle and bustle of New York. In order to work on her novel and remain focused, she rents an isolated cottage by the lake in a relatively small town. Naturally, every man in town is attracted to this young woman including a semi-retarded Matthew, a gas station manager (and married to boot) Johnny, and two slackers who spend their afternoons just moping around town when not hanging out at the gas station.<br /><br />As one can probably guess, trouble is brewing and nothing good will come out of Jennifer's friendship with Matthew nor her initial introduction to Johnny, the gas station manager. Jennifer is captured by our motley crew of unscrupulous men while relaxing in her canoe. Over the next half hour, Jennifer is raped repeatedly in various locations by the four men and left for dead. Realizing that she can testify against each one of them, Johnny sends Matthew back to the cottage to kill Jennifer. Mathew, however, cannot bring himself to kill Jennifer but wipes her blood on his knife and then advises the other men that she is now dead.<br /><br />Over the course of a few days, Jennifer grieves and tries to pull herself back together while she works on the manuscript once again that had been previously shredded by the four rapists in her cottage. After attending church and asking for forgiveness, she plots to kill them off one by one beginning with Matthew.<br /><br />Although slightly less controversial with time, ISOYG is still not an easy watch by any means. Considered by many to be one of the essential cult classics loved by horror & cult film enthusiasts alike, there are scenes which will stick with you for the rest of your life. I still flinch each time I view the bathtub scene where Johnny's genitals are severed by Jennifer. While the scene isn't as graphic as my description might have you believe, it's nevertheless a scene which makes me extremely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the viewer will still root for Jennifer all the way after witnessing her ugly sexual assaults.<br /><br />So whatever happened to Camille Keaton? Well, that's another story entirely but I will go ahead and tell you that she's made one hell of a comeback with Fred Vogel's Sella Turcica and she has two other films which are in the works. Fingers crossed. I'm hoping that they will soon see the light of day. One of which is entitled The Butterfly Room that boasts performances by Heather Langenkamp, Barbara Steele, and many other great veteran horror actresses. It's sad that Camille Keaton wasn't given a great deal of work in the movie industry for some 30 years but I'm glad to report she's alive and well. Perhaps the new millennium will continue to show moviegoers that Keaton is indeed a talent to be reckoned with.<br /><br />I can also report that the much anticipated remake of the unrated ISOYG was released on DVD 02/08/11. Meir Zarchi serves as executive producer this time around. For those of you who still haven't seen the original, Anchor Bay has also re-released the cult classic on the same day for under $20. Grab it!he original, Anchor Bay has also re-released the cult classic on the same day for under $20. Grab it!
B00000AFFF|1.0|I love Burt Bcharach.  I still listen to his vinyls.  I have 25 records of his.  Elvis Costello has ruined this album of beautiful music.  HIs caterwauling, Tourette style, singing through his nose. (nasal register) usually used for comedic rolls, a vibrato in the nose, just unheard off.  I could not understand a word that he sang.  This was the worst singing I've ever heard,  I just cringed, on first hearing.   I tried to like this album. But the more I played it, the more I hated it. I wish this album was re-recorded, with a singer other then Elvis Costello, so we can appreciate the beautiful music of Burt Bacharach.  Meanwhile back to the old vinyls.
0140042520|1.0|Jack Kerovac's The Dharma Bums was reveiwed...as \\"Kerovac living his dream as a zen lunatic and rucksack wanderer on the fabled golden shores of west coAast America\\" I, however,think the book was poorly detailed and jumped from ideas much too quickly.<BR>   <BR>     The story was structured as a blog or diary of two wandering bums who basically lived the life of poverty and \\"mooching\\" off other people who were their 'friends'. Kerovac's 'friends' were people who were met at poetry 'slams'. They do nothing outside of drinking, reading poetry, mooching off of people and having sex. Any bum off the street could have submitted a journal to a publishing company and it would have the same affect on the reader. <br />     I would not reccomend this book to anyone. It was random rambling about nothing. If you like books that tell and interesting story and have charachters you can connect in a personal way to, then The Dharma Bums is not for you. But, if you like random blurts of stupidity, you will love this book.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie is truly amazing.  A astonishing sight to look at, a wonderful story told.  This is a challenging film.  Most people who like straight forward films fed to them, without any thinking probably won't care for this one.  A lot of people thought it went on too long, and the first time I saw it I felt the same.  But after viewing it again, I realized it was done the right way.  I mean, COME ON, it's a film from STEVEN SPIELBERG from a project orginally started by STANLEY KUBRICK.  That alone makes it worth the price of admission.  If you surrender your self to the cinematic beauty of this underrated film, then you'll find something truly wonderous.
B00004XQP4|2.0|I am a huge fan of green day and always have been, but this cd was an all time low for them. They tried a totally new sound, and it obviously didn't go over so well, all in my opinion, ofcourse. I say anything's worth a shot, but this wasn't exactly what they should have gone for. Good luck with your other long-time fans, Green Day! I still love the band, I was just dissapointed with the release.
B000002C1V|5.0|This is probably one of the best statements on war out there.  It is a tribute to Roger Waters' dad who was lost during the battle of Anzio.  It is also a statement on the Falklands War.  I'd have to say that the song that sticks in my mind is the Gunner's Dream.  It makes you wonder if we did in fact learn anything from World War II.  <br />The videos from this album are the best though.  They really clarify things.  Too bad they aren't officially released on anything.
B00003CXTG|2.0|marks the 60th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I wish I could report that the movie Pearl Harbor is a fitting retelling of that event, but it turns out to be pretty lame. It is also quite long. To paraphrase film critic Roger Ebert, it somehow manages to squeeze a two hour movie into three hours.<br />Rafe and Danny [Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett] are best friends from he hills of Tennessee who sign up for a hitch in the Navy and become pilots. Rafe is the stronger of the two, and, when he gets a chance to fight with the RAF in England against the Nazis, he tricks Danny into staying behind because he doesn't want him to be injured or killed. Before he departs, he meets Evelyn [Kate Beckinsdale], a Navy nurse, and they fall deeply in love. During a dog fight off the English coast, Rafe is shot down and is presumed dead. Meanwhile, Danny and Evelyn have been transferred to the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. They are grief stricken over Rafe, but three months later, they are in love with each other. In basic soap opera tradition, Rafe turns out to be very much alive and just shows up one day in Hawaii. <br />It takes nearly and hour and a half for this love triangle to unfold on screen before the Japs finally show up and change everything. Then the attack itself runs forty minutes. In this sequence, which is spectacular but strangely unmoving, Rafe and Danny seem to be everywhere at once. They dodge bombs and bullets to get to their planes in order to take out a few Japanese. Next, they are in the chaos-filled hospital giving blood. Moments later, they are aboard the capsized USS Arizona trying to free sailors trapped inside. After the attack, the movie has another hour still to go. Rafe and Danny get to go on Jimmy Doolittle's famed air raid on Tokyo. <br />The structure of this movie is awkward and puzzling. More competent film makers [or ones who weren't handed a 150 million dollar budget] could have told the story of the love triangle in half the time it takes Pearl Harbor to do so. It is, after all, a tried and true plot device. Then there is the last hour. The Tokyo raid is essentially a whole other movie. I think the idea was to tell the audience that we Americans didn't take the infamous day laying down. We fought back. But everyone knows already that. We know who won W.W.II. Any information about what happened after Pearl Harbor could have been handled with brief notes before the final credits. <br />Movies have never been the best tool for teaching history. It gets in the way of the entertainment quotient, it clashes with modern values, and/or it's improperly research. For example, nobody smokes in the film. That may make the movie's heroes and heroines more appealing by current standards, but it's also inaccurate. In the real Pearl Harbor attack, the airfields were attacked first, but this fact gets in the way of the movie's script, so it shows the attack starting with the ships. That point is minor compared to the other revisionist history involved. I promise you that the Japan of 1941 was as evil, ambitious and out of control as Nazi Germany. The atrocities they committed in China were horrendous. But the movie portrays the Japanese leadership as being merely upset because we were cutting of their oil supply, as if bombing Pearl Harbor would solve the problem. The reason for glossing over the facts? It's simple economics. Japan is now the second biggest market for Hollywood movies after the USA. The producers were trying to make sure it didn't bomb there.
B00005Y228|5.0|If you are the type of music lover that loves to listen to music with soul and emotional depth - this disc is NOT for you! I give Kylie's FEVER 5 stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do - make people groove! Kylie is all about dancing, having fun, and temporarily being care-free. Yes the lyrics are cheesy and the rhythms all similar, but it is fun to listen to (and that is the whole point). This album just screams \\"Let loose and Dance!\\" If you want to actually think while listening to music, I suggest a copy of \\"Under Rug Swept\\" by Alanis Morissette. Now there is some deep music! Kylie, though, doesn't go for that. The entire album, including my favourite track 'In Your Eyes,' is pretty level and there is not a lot of change in tempo. But heck, this music was created for your legs, not your brain. Fast paced and very sensual, Kylie's music is also a bit provacative. Steamy themes and in-the-bedroom words may not suit all, but that's Kylie's style. If your in the mood for a no-brainer music collection, FEVER is for you. The number two bonus track 'Butterfly' is originally from Kylie's 2000 international disc LIGHT YEARS. A very fast moving, fun and disco ready number. 'Boy' was originally available only on the first international single release of 'Can't get you out of my head' and the Japanese version of FEVER. Kylie is sure to earn some new young fans with this hot disc.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Sequels are a mainstay in the movie business these days. Studios call them franchises, and they can be extremely profitable. Entire seasons, especially summer, are built around them. Coming next summer, for example, are Men in Black 2, Austin Powers 3 and the fifth Star Wars. How frenzied has this trend become? Warner Brothers started filming the second Harry Potter movie before the first one even opened. New Line made all three Lord of the Rings books into movies simultaneously and will release them over the next three Christmas seasons. <br />This brings us to Jurassic Park 3. It's arguably the best in the series, an old-fashioned monster movie that gets straight to the point. It's as lean and coolly efficient as the dinosaurs it portrays. Everything its human characters do and say moves the story along briskly. It could be used in film schools as a model of commercial film making. Yet, because its a sequel, most viewers will have a 'been there, done that' reaction. The novelty of computer generated graphics has worn off. Seeing people interact on screen with giant and often dangerous creatures from the past is no longer so thrilling. Jurassic Park 3 still made a ton of money, but people went to it with naturally lowered expectations. <br />This time the action takes place on Isla Sorna, which was the one where all the genetic experiments took place. The project has been abandoned, and the place is strictly off limits to almost everyone. This doesn't stop Eric's [Trevor Morgan] stepfather from paying a crew to take them hang gliding over it. Of course, disaster strikes, and they get trapped on the island. Eric's parents, Paul and Amanda [William H. Macy and Tea Leoni], posing as wealthy tourists, trick paleontologist Alan Grant [Sam Neill] and his assistant, Billy [Allesandro Nivola], into flying with them over the island. The researchers are shocked and surprised when the plane actually lands on dinosaur-infested Sorna. Alan went because the couple wrote him a big check to refund his research back in America. He did not plan on being part of a search and rescue mission in a place he vowed never to return to. <br />The movie wisely introduces some new creatures, the most effective of which are spinesaurus, a dinosaur even larger, uglier and hungrier than T-rex, and some giant carnivorous birds. They also give the hideous raptor dinosaurs much more intelligence, which make them even more formidable adversaries. Still, after a while, once you've seen one bad-tempered dinosaur, you've seen them all. <br />Loving attention as been paid to recreating the look of these prehistoric beasts. For the most part, they mirror how many scientists imagine they look. In all three movies, how these dinosaurs behave is another thing. Maybe a carnivore would eat you, maybe it wouldn't. Would you risk finding out if you are on the menu? As in real life, every character in these movies instinctively runs away from them. Yet, all the herbivores are treated like they are gigantic puppies. That makes no sense to me. Wild elephants and rhinoceroses are herbivores. If you walked into their territory, do you think they would just stand there? Listen to me, kids. Herbivore does not always equal non-aggressive. If an animal is bigger and stronger than you are, show some respect.
B000002LIX|4.0|I remember going to my local record shop and getting them to unpack the vinyl album from the box the morning of its' UK release then rushing home to play it! Now the vinyl has deteriorated so much I've had (!) to buy it again on CD.<BR>\\"Nothing's Shocking\\" had been played so much and this album had been so eagerly awaited I think I was bound to be a bit disappointed at the time. It seemed a bit over-produced and maybe even a bit tinny compared to some of their earlier stuff, but maybe I just couldn't appreciate some of the deeper and more complex arrangements. Who knows?! Maybe I just wasn't playing it loud enough!!!<BR>I'm still utterly in love with 'Three Days' (Jane's Stairway?) and 'Then She Said', the latter being better IMO. Other tracks are up there - 'Of Course' and 'Obvious'; 'Been Caught Stealing' suffering from way too much air/video/play. But really all the tracks are excellent and you're left feeling some of the tracks should have been given the 'extended-mix' treatment of the better tracks - hence just the 4 stars.<BR>\\"Nothing's Shocking\\" is still probably better if you *had* to choose between the two, but when you can have both...????!!!! <BR>I would definitely rate this as one of the best rock/alternative albums of the nineties.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge doesn't only revive the movie musical, it reinvents it for the 21st Century. In doing so, it has stirred up quite a bit of controversy and debate, as well it should. Any artistic effort that throws convention out the window does this. Part of the public embraces it as visionary, while the rest dismisses it as a failure and a fraud. Many times the elements that turn some people on are the same ones that turn others off. I tell you this because, while it's one of my favorite films of 2001, I readily admit it isn't for everyone. <br />I saw Moulin Rouge twice in one week at the same theater, which is highly unusual for me. Obviously, as a reviewer, I don't have time to dwell long on any one movie. Both times the same thing happened. Some audience members applauded at several times, but others walked out disgusted. Those who stayed and enjoyed it were many times greater in number than those who left. <br />The plot is slim. It's mainly a device to attach the music to. Christian [Ewan McGregor] is a young British writer who comes to Paris in 1900 to savor the Bohemian lifestyle, which is in full swing. Much of this lifestyle revolves around the Moulin Rouge nightclub, where dancers perform the infamous cancan and where courtesans sell their favors to wealthy gentlemen, young and old. The star of the club is the glamorous Satine [Nicole Kidman], who is also its most sought after courtesan. Satine and Christian are introduced by the artist Toulouse-Latrec [John Lequizamo] and his followers. The couple falls in love, but her lifestyle and his poverty create an insurmountable barrier to true love's fulfillment.<br />The movie has little regard for time and space. The Paris it creates is a fantasy and a dream. The real city was never like this. Director Baz Luhrman, who first came to international attention with the remarkable Australian film, Strictly Ballroom, works with the idea that artistic or hip types a hundred years ago were not so unlike their counterparts of today. His characters don't sing and dance to music from their time, but from ours. In a memorable scene early in the movie, Toulouse-Latrec and his gang are agonizing on the lyrics to a song that's part of a musical they are writing. Christian, who has been commandeered to assist them, suddenly bursts into \\"The Hill Are Alive\\" from The Sound of Music. This is not the only time Luhrman uses a song from an older, more traditional musical. The movie is also filled with songs by such late 20th Century music icons as Elton John and David Bowie. It may be the only film taking place at the end of the 19th Century that rocks. <br />The editing is extremely kinetic. Few images last more than a few seconds. This will irritate some viewers because the process may give them a headache and because the lavish production numbers tend to be especially choppy and fast. I found this technique to be exhilarating. It gives the movie a look and feel that underscores the desperation and anxiety simmering underneath the festive air. Its the same emotional contradiction found at today's discos and rave parties. <br />The cast is brilliant. It's spectacular. ... [Nicole Kidman] can be dramatic, funny, beguiling, seductive and vulnerable. She can also sing and dance. Ewan McGregor is equally versatile. They make a dynamic couple on screen. Jim Broadbent gives and Oscar-worthy performance as Harold Zidler, the owner and MC of Moulin Rouge, as does the amazing John Lequizamo as Toulouse-Latrec. <br />I loved this movie, if for no other reason than that it broke the mold. It is bold and adventuresome. Most films follow formulas that seem set in stone, partly because audiences are comforted by them. Occasionally, though, it's good to have one that rattles your soul.
B00003CXB7|5.0|Probably no cinematic comedy produced by Hollywood in the last half of the twentieth century is as irreverent, disdainful of authority, critical of war and its effects, and, incidentally, as funny as \\"M*A*S*H\\", that 1970 comedic masterpiece starring Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Gary Burghoff, and Sally Kellerman; written by Ring Lardner, Jr.; and directed by Robert Altman, in his directorial debut.<br /><br />\\"M*A*S*H\\" is actually a very difficult film to review for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, it's darned near impossible to provide an adequate synopsis for readers who've never seen the movie. Because, unlike most modern films that contain a linear story line, an easy-to-follow plot, and well developed characters that one can either root for or vilify with ease, \\"M*A*S*H\\" is a film that can only be described as a series of loosely joined comic vignettes, featuring a set of very true-to-life characters that are all BOTH very likeable and flawed.<br /><br />\\"M*A*S*H\\" is one of the best comedies ever made, and for good reason. It is genuinely funny. It is artistically produced; it contains great writing and acting; and it proclaims an important social message to viewers.<br /><br />Having said all that, \\"M*A*S*H\\" is very likely NOT a movie that will appeal to everyone's tastes - even now, four decades after it was first released. How the movie was written and produced has a lot to do with that fact.<br /><br />As the story goes, the idea for producing a movie version of \\"M*A*S*H\\" got its start when literary agent Ingo Preminger referred Dr. Richard Hooker's famous novel of the same name to 20th Century Fox executive Richard Zanuck. Zanuck enthusiastically supported the idea, hired Preminger as the movie's producer, and set out to find a screen writer and director. Ring Lardner Jr. (son of the famous 1930s sports writer) was brought in to write the script. Robert Altman was hired to direct. (As Altman tells it, he was about the \\"13th choice\\" of the studio to direct.)<br /><br />Shooting began during the summer of 1969. At the same time, the films \\"Patton\\" and \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" were in production. Altman, eager to be successful in his first major film, decided to \\"hide out\\" on a back lot of the studio, where he would escape the watchful eyes of studio executives.<br /><br />As a result, Altman was able to apply many innovative techniques to the film. He wanted his actors to improvise as much as possible in each scene. He wired each actor with an individual microphone and encouraged them to talk over one another. He incorporated several bloody operating room scenes in the film. He tried to mask the fact that the film was supposed to be set during the Korean War. He wanted audiences to assume that this was a film about Vietnam, and he wanted them to understand his clear message about the monstrosity of war.<br /><br />(By the way, Altman's technique enraged Lardner, who thought Altman had basically thrown away the script. Lardner came perilously close to disassociating himself from the project, but in the end, accepted both the sole writing credit for the film... and the Oscar for Best Screenplay at the 1971 Academy Awards.)<br /><br />Because of Altman's innovative (some say crazy) filmmaking techniques, \\"M*A*S*H\\" succeeds as a brilliant film that achieves almost all of Altman's goals. The film is deeply imbued with a lifelike realism that allows viewers to \\"feel\\" what it was like in the fictional 4077th MASH. The actors speak like one would expect them to when confronted with the reality of war and the boredom of inactivity.<br /><br />Comedy scenes are uniformly uproariously funny, employing jokes and gags that range from subtle to coarse to borderline lewd. Interspersed with the comedy scenes are operating room sequences that are bloody to the point of horrific, but that bring home with full force the full brutality of war... so much so that, for a short time, the Defense Department banned \\"M*A*S*H\\" from being shown in military theaters worldwide.<br /><br />I've read some reviews of \\"M*A*S*H\\" in which a criticism is leveled that the movie's characters are not well developed. I disagree with this judgment. I found I was readily able to identify with all the characters, whether they were likeable or not. Hawkeye, Duke, Trapper, Frank, Hot Lips, Henry, Radar, and all the others were completely believable, and fleshed out in detail... no small feat since the actors who played these parts were directed to perform their roles in such a highly improvisational manner.<br /><br />\\"M*A*S*H\\" is one of those rare films that gives viewers everything they could ask for from a great film: wonderfully realistic acting; a great script; brilliantly funny comedy; superb drama, important social commentary; and artful, innovative filmmaking techniques. \\"M*A*S*H\\" has steadfastly stood the test of time for thirty years, never becoming outdated or irrelevant.

Brilliant, in a Spike Jonez sort of way.<br />&quot;Gouge Away&quot;. Song number 15. One of their greatest hits. And that's cause Kim's being Kim. Sure, Frank's screaming menacingly.

If you love The Pixies, well, then, you probably own this. Enjoy.
B000002GFT|5.0|In many ways this album was the high water mark of British folk rock. In many ways it was to be the pinnacle of the Fairports career though the latest version is still going bless their cotton socks and hopefully will continue the fine Chropredy festival for many summers to come.<br />Leige and Leif followed the excellent Unhalfbricking but with Dave Mattacks replacing the deceased Martin Lamble who had passed away in a car accident. The lineup was supplemented by the violin playing Dave Swarbrick, a mainstay of the folk tradition.<br />The album starts off with the joint Ashley Hutchings composition, Come All Ye and is followed by the Fairport arranged but traditional song Reynardine. Matty Groves, already a favourite at live shows, follows next. Again a traditional song given the Fairport treatment this is a showcase for all of the band's talents especially the interplay between Thompson and Hutchings. Many years later Rick Sanders was heard to describe this song as the chance to play like Pink Floyd as it assumed a wholely different role at gigs. The Deserter finds Sandy Denny in great voice with this traditional song, while the medley indicates the shift in direction which was to follow on the next album, Full House. Here Swarbrick is in his element with some virtuoso fiddle playing - a tradition followed to this day by Sanders and Leslie in the current incarnation. Tam Lin again returns to the rock side of Fairports with another traditional song highlighting Denny, Thompson and Hutchings and some really nice guitar licks. The album closes with an absolutely delightful Denny singing on the Thompson/Swarbrick collaboration, Crazy Man Michael.<br />After this album Sandy Denny left to form Fotheringay and to broaden her work in a solo career, Hutchings left to form Steeleye Span and would later create the Albion Band as his interest in traditional folk deepened.<br />Known to some in the US as Britain's answer to Jefferson Airplane, Fairport brought together traditional England and rock'n'roll in a way that no other band has been able to replicate. The band became an institution sort of like the Dead but without the masses of fans but throughout all of these years they have carried the torch of folk-rock despite personal tragedies and line-up changes.<br />In hindsight it is hard to see this album was so important but the songs have stood the passage of time and Simon Nichol has been able to adapt to changing conditions. Listen to this alum in the early morning or late at night. Superb!tional England and rock'n'roll in a way that no other band has been able to replicate.

B00005NTJK|4.0|People,<br />  This is one of the finest remasters of original analog material I have ever heard. I give it 4-stars simply because I don't give -anything- 5-stars.<br />  If Ian Anderson wants to bring the guys over to my living room and play, I'll give 'em 5-stars.<br />  On Teacher:<br />  Although the remaster is superb, the enhanced presence does alter the flavor of the original somewhat. The &quot;Teacher&quot; track retains the original tonal content that one would have heard if they were to play the -original- vinyl album on a pro-quality turntable.<br />  I loved it - This should answer some questions.

(I'm not an audiophile, I'm sure some of you will notice stuff, but considering prints of this video in the past, trust me when I say this disc is really nice.)<br />Sound track was remixed into a \\"stunning\\" DTS-ES sound track (That's that new Dolby Digital 6.1 with the extra rear center track) and is quite delightful to listen too.<br />Price blows, but if your a fan it's still worth it. Of course if your a fan with a tight pocketbook, I will tell you that I found a store selling it for less. I won't tell you where though, it would be unfair and kindda rude, buy it here.<br />Excuse me, I'm gonna go chop up my girlfriend now.<br />Oh yeah, Hail to the Chin, baby...

Great,great songs!
0375507507|5.0|I found that I couldn't put this book down. The author has refreshing insight into her own extremely dysfunctional family in a dysfunctional country. This is a touching survivor's story, but without sentimentality. The only drawback is that the author needs to tone down her descriptive language in order to be a great writer. A wonderful book, even more so because it's autobiographical. For anyone who loves reading about life in Africa, British colonialism and overcoming adversity in life.

B00005Q3KC|5.0|Well, what a wonderful collection of songs all bundled up neatly in one CD. All the hits are here, while most are in it's initial album version format, some are edited, some are remixed, some are live versions to provide variation. Withs songs from each and every album they have released contributing to this album, it's a very fair representation of the Corrs. Coming out of the their debut album \\"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\\" are \\"Runaway\\", \\"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\\", \\"Love To Love You\\", \\"The Right Time\\" and \\"Erin Shore\\" which is an unreleased instrumental track. From their \\"Talk On Corners\\" CD came \\"Only When I Sleep\\", \\"I Never Loved You Anyway\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"What Can I Do\\" and \\"So Young\\". Out of their \\"Unplugged\\" CD came \\"Radio\\" and their REM cover \\"Everybody Hurts\\". And from their last CD \\"In Blue\\", came \\"Breathless\\", \\"Irresistible\\", \\"Give Me A Reason\\" and \\"All The Love In The World\\". Along with this best of CD comes two new tracks \\"Would You Be Happier\\" the leading single and \\"Make You Mine\\". If you are interested, try searching for the Australian edition of this CD as you get an extra track titled \\"Lifting Me\\" which brings the total to 19 tracks. But this collection is good enough. Also watch out for the new \\"Live In Dublin\\" CD.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I am not the sort of person to listen to britney spears music,but i will hold my hands up and say i do quite like her uptempo songs and this is comming from a guy that likes the lostprophets,the hives and A.That said what britney needn't have done is spoil the whole album with bloody ballads.Quite frankly the it would be a far more enjoyable album if you just repeated 'oops i did it again' ten or twelve times over at least it would save you from pressing the repeat button on your cd player.also i don't agree with one persons comments about what music is,music may be about standing amnd listening to your band in the rain but to others its more a bubblegum fun pleasure such as dancing like a maniac around your room.i still don't like the ballads though.
0446677450|4.0|This is a very easy-to-read book that is designed to get readers to rethink their understanding of money.  Kiyosaki's examples, charts, and explanations are simple, although he points out that most people refuse to understand that they have missed an idea so simple.  For instance, he points out that most people do not understand the fundamental difference between an asset and a liability (asset makes money, liability costs money).<br />Like most self-help books, everything is not given to you.  Kiyosaki does not tell you specifically how to make millions of dollars.  He is trying to empower you so that you will understand.  This is essential since financial markets change.  If you can not learn to read these changes, then a specific plan will be worthless.  Think of it like this, you need to go to the basement to get something you want.  Self-help books, like this one, merely turn on the light for you and point down the stairs.  Only you can walk down there.<br />There are some good ideas on education.  The poor dad is his educated father (if I remember correctly, he had a Ph.D.).  He was educated for his job, and as times changed, he was too educated for the job he had, so he had to quit.  Kiyosaki points out that we do need education, but we need to be selective in what we learn, and we should never stop learning.  As mentioned before, things change and we need to be prepared for that.  Get skills that will help you in anything you do.<br />Towards the end of the book, Kiyosaki discusses donating money to charity.  This is the only spiritual aspect of the book, and I am not sure it really flows with the rest of the book.  Although I don't disagree, I feel that it undercuts the rest of this book.<br />I would recommend this book to someone wanting to work toward a better understanding of money.
0446608955|5.0|It took me less than a weekend to read this book...and it was a very busy weekend.  Somehow, I couldn't put it down.  The story of Jamie Sullivan, the awkward daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in the 1950s, and Landon Carter, the popular son of a US Congressman, is absolutely incredible.<br />They begin as absolute opposites...she's the shy, sweet girl who everyone makes fun of in school.  He's the guy everyone wants to be friends with.  They end up having the leading parts in the Christmas play, and their friendship begins to evolve.  It turns into love, but then a heartbreaking discovery may split them forever.<br />This is a walk everyone should take, but be prepared with plenty of tissues.<br />Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job describing the settings and happenings of the book.  I'd never read a book by him before, but now I'm contemplating checking out some of his other books.
B00000INEX|5.0|My 12 month old son has been something of a challenge since birth.  Early on we dicovered that Baby Mozart was a guaranteed quiet half-hour.  At two months he didn't mind watching the same video day after day, but the music became a fixture in MY head and I needed a break.  We were fortunate to have been able to borrow Bach, Mozart, and Einstein on DVD.  We never did get into Einstein, but Bach became a fast 2nd favorite.  Doolittle Neighborhood Animals came in a close 3rd for a while.  <br />Several months ago we returned the DVDs and I found I really missed the music from Bach.  It turned out, so did my son. Since he has  become a busy explorer, the videos (including Mozart to a degree)have not been able to hold his interest for long. In addition, he will not watch anything else on the TV -- no other shows capture his interest.  But when I purchased the Bach DVD for him, he was instantly captivated and has been ever since.  I know he remembered it.  While I'm not as thrilled with the content as I am with some of the others (Mozart and both Doolittles especially) I know that my son loves watching the little girls dance and play. I choose to believe that he will learn from their movements as much as he might from the actions of the toys and the music. <br />I highly recommend all of the videos, but Baby Bach and Mozart are by far the best choices for little babies.
B000001EXR|3.0|Older KISS songs like ROCK-N-ROLL ALL NITE, I WAS MADE FOR LOV-<br />ING YOU and STRUTTER would've sounded out of place on this album,<br />but they sure would've been welcome! CARNIVAL OF SOULS sounds al-<br />most nothing like KISS; it's their grunge metal album and is pro-<br />bably heavier than anything they've done before( with the possi-<br />ble exception of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT).  Which is not to say<br />it's a bad album! I actually like some of this alot and I cer-<br />tainly prefer it to most of their 80's albums. My two favorite<br />songs are GENE SIMMON'S &quot;CHILDHOOD'S END&quot;, which has some terri-<br />fic singing from GENE and a very catchy chorus; and I CONFESS,<br />which boasts another terrific and somewhat melodic vocal from<br />GENE. SIMMONS sounds more comfortable singing this type of music<br />than PAUL STANLEY, the latter whose singing style is nearly un-<br />recognizable throughout much of this album. The overall mood is<br />very, very dark and the lyrics may be KISS's most mature ever!<br />PAUL STANLEY's acoustic guitar ballad &quot; I WILL BE THERE&quot; is act-<br />ually very tolerable and quite melodic and not overarranged.<br />&quot;JUNGLE&quot; is also a pretty good song and maybe the most KISS-like<br />song on the album.<br />  While I'm glad they didn't continue in this direction music-<br />ally, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was at least an interesting detour for<br />them. Not very KISS-like, but very enjoyable and respectable.
0553208845|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent work in the tradition of many of the classics.  This is a short piece of work, really almost more of a novella and it reads quickly.  What is impressive about Hesse's work here is the depth of philosophy he delivers with such concise prose.  This is also a novel that is timeless in scope rather than being a period piece.  There are few trappings of any particular era which allows Hesse to deliver his message in a much more simple (and short) format.  In hindsight this story was a very effective method for introducing the reader to some of the basic tenets of the Buddhist religions.  This is the first of Hesse's works that I have read and I found it to be profound and powerful.  I look forward to reading more of his work.
6304712499|1.0|Special effects are good, and that is just about it. The screenplay--if you can call it that--seems like it was written by a prepubescent; the \\"plot\\" is ridiculous and incoherent, and the dialogue, well, I have heard better in saturday morning cartoons. The film's attempt at a profound meaning is naive. Please, do not expect me to deliniate the story for you--it is muddled and unfathomable. <br />\\"Spawn\\" left me thinking, \\"What kind of a film is this?\\". For example: In one particular scene, Spawn jumps into a fireplace (yes, a fireplace) and is transported to a hell-like dimension where he encounters an army of demons led by some kind of fire monster. If you want a good laugh, listen to the monster's farsical and cartoonish voice! It may be worth watching just for that!<br />I have never actually read it, but after watching the film, I cannot help but think you would be better off reading the comic book.
0156711427|4.0|I think this book was great.  It shows the way life was in India during the British control.  It was good. It couldnt of been more correctly writen.  Forester was a great writer that captured the essaence of india.
1587990717|1.0|While trying to pass himself off as Nero Tulip, the fictional protagonist of this annoying book, he comes across more as a simple...  His points are banal: that successful people are often lucky but don't acknowledge it, or that empirical distributions have fatter tails than predicted by normal distributions.  Further, he's inconsistent, one moment praising the truth and beauty offered by mathematical analysis, the next slamming simpletons who make assumptions in order apply those tools (e.g., stationarity).  Lastly, his pomposity would be only mildly irksome if it didn't also reflect an ignorance of why his insights are not that new, true, or interesting.  I wish I didn't wast time reading the first half of this book, and have no plans to read the last half.
0441172717|2.0|This book was so incredibly boring it was mind numbing.<br />The first few chapters kept me going, but to get to the end...good god. I literally had to force myself to read it! The only other book I had to trudge through like this was The Grapes of Wrath...and if you liked that book, well then maybe this one is for you...
B00000099Y|4.0|Under most circumstances, I wouldn't like Tool.  If their songs were condensed into about 4 minutes each instead of 5-8, I wouldn't like them.  But, they add a lot of weight to a lot of their songs.  Maynard James Keesan is a great vocalist, but he often is drowned out, either by his own choice with a low volume or just by the sheer noise of the other 3 guys, who are great in their own right.  While I can't say that his writing is meaningful to me, it shines on Eulogy and Hooker With a Penis.  \\"Songs\\" like Message to Harry Manback and Die Eier Von Satan are just filler, really, the former sounding like a answering machine message at VERY low volume, the other totally in German so it doesn't make any sense at all-a little too over the top if you ask me.  Useful Idiot is 40 seconds of a guitar getting louder before going into bass on the next song.  If they just got rid of that [stuff], they'd have a great album (and lo and behold, you get Lateralus).  When Tool rock (Stinkfist, Forty-Six and Two), they rock, and that's why this is worth listening to.
B00003CXZ3|4.0|MEMENTO's use of a reverse narrative structure to tell a murder mystery is very clever. As time goes on, the novelty of it all starts to wear at bit thin. However, don't let that discourage you from seeing this film. The performances are generally good and the piece is often quite engaging.
B000002H5I|5.0|I'm surprised that it's taken me this long to replace my cassette with the CD, but now that I have I know that it will once again be a staple in my car.  It instantly transports me back to the summer of '88 and the road trips I took with my best friend, Michael and all the singing along we did...some great lyrics here!  My favorites, along with the incredible &quot;Fast Car&quot;:  &quot;For My Lover&quot;, &quot;Baby, Can I Hold You&quot; and &quot;Mountains of Things&quot;...!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I can't believe I actually paid money to see this in the theaters.  Horrible acting, terribly annoying characters and a super digital feel.  Nothing about this movie is worth the money you'll spend.  Save your money for something more worthy like a bad haircut.
