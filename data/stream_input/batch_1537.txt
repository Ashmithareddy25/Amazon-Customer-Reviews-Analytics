B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book of this trilogy left so much to be desired that I was very much on the fence about whether or not to continue the series. I am so very glad that I did continue reading. The second book is much better than the first. I wish that the two were actually one book. The narrative arc and the development of the characters makes so much more sense if the two books were one. Instead, the books seemed to have been arbitrarily split just to generate more sales. I guess to that end, the strategy worked, but I feel like the split compromised the creative expression of the work.<br /><br />Did I really just say \\"creative expression\\" in reference to this piece of drivel? Yes. Despite the horrid writing and the pornographic subject matter, this still is a creative expression. It's a love story between two people. And in any compelling love story, there has to be an obstacle, whether that be feuding families, class differences, or triangles. In this love story, the obstacle is the fact that Christian is a sadist. But that storyline does not fully develop, reach a climax, or get resolved in the first book. It stops halfway, and only becomes complete in the second book.<br /><br />Why the gripe? Well, I'm particularly irritated because I could have just as easily not continued the series, and I feel that I would have missed out. The character development continues and the relationship develops further in the second book that makes the story as a whole much more fulfilling. I was left with so many complaints after the first book that ended up being resolved in the second.<br /><br />Is the writing any better? No, not really. The writing is still just as atrocious, but at least the reader knows not to expect good, or even half-decent, writing. Somehow the lowering of expectations makes it a bit more bearable.<br /><br />If you read the first book, you should definitely read the second. It is much better than the first and it completes the narrative arc. I do plan on reading the third book, but I still feel that the first two complete a single narrative arc.g the third book, but I still feel that the first two complete a single narrative arc.

034580404X|1.0|I think I lost 50 IQ points after reading these books.  I was annoyed after the first book but continued on as I did not think it would be fair to critique them all  without having read the series in its entirety.  I give the series one star because it was at least creative of the author to so explicitly explore and detail sexual pleasure from a female's point of view.  That is it, the end of the good I can find in any of these books.  Seriously, not just one but multiple orgasms during her first sexual experience followed by an orgasm or two or twelve each and every time she has sex after that (unless of course she wasn't allowed to because Christian was mad)? I felt the bile rise in my throat (to borrow an Ana feeling) every single time she referred to her \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"sex.\\"  I did not find anything empowering for women at all in any of these novels and found the ending hackneyed and utterly ridiculous.  And please, don't even get me started on the concept of rewriting the series from Christian's point of view because then my inner goddess might come out and not in a good way.

1609410416|3.0|You wanna read/listen to an amusing little time waster and you like Ellen DeGeneres' style of humor? This is your book. However, don't go into this expecting anything really substantial. Some chapters are a couple of words, maybe a sentence long. And while I adored some of the stories and was uplifted by the encouraging tone, that is where my biggest complaint is.<br /><br />I listened to this in 3 hours. This is the absolute shortest audiobook I've ever listened to--and this goes for almost $30 retail. You could go to the movie theater for nearly 3 hours and pay less--and probably have just as good or a better time.<br /><br />Of course, that probably sounds like I hated the book.  Not true.  Ellen is funny, in her own way, and she really is a good narrator. I cracked a smile quite a few times and laughed a few others (and I'm not a big one to laugh while reading or listening to a book). Ellen also doesn't just make jokes; she's inspiring and uplifting, encouraging meditation, recycling, decluttering, spending time with family, getting regular health check-ups, and more.<br /><br />But I'll admit, after awhile it got old. There are only so many uplifting messages I can take before it feels like I'm being lectured to--and there is nothing worse than to have someone tell you the life you're living (with which you are quite content and are not harming anyone) isn't nearly as good as X's. Some jokes however didn't do it for me--such as her joke on the 80% of graduates that are moving back with their parents because they are moochers (no, not all of them are, it's the lack of jobs). I also don't get the joke of hearing Ellen say things like \\"mememememeee\\". (\\"Really? I paid $30 to hear Ellen say 'mememememe'\\"?)<br /><br />As for talking about her own life--I know a lot has happened in Ellen's life. I know this from Wiki and the news, certainly not from this book. Sure, Ellen talks a bit about American Idol and her talk show and mentions Portia in passing. But those references are few and far between, so keep your eyes and ears open or you are bound to miss it.<br /><br />All in all, while there are some really good parts, a lot of the 3 hours just felt like filler.  To give a comparison, at the end of Tina Fey's [[ASIN:0316056863 Bossypants]], I felt I had learned a great deal about Fey and left wanting to watch 30 Rock.  After listening to this, I felt like I had finished eating cotton candy and was hungry for some real food.  I was super glad I had checked this out at the library; I would have felt cheated for spending retail price on it.<br /><br />My recommendation is: check this out from your library, see if you like it before spending nearly $30 on the audiobook or hardcover. Or you are likely to be VERY disappointed.<br /><br />And because this book was so terribly short, I'll do the same and keep this review short too.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

It didn't take long for me to receive.<br /><br />Thank you Seller
B002RKSXJG|5.0|If you are a Kindle user, this is a no-brainer purchase.  Buy this book (free of charge) and enjoy a wonderful trip to a different time, full of suspense and romance, richly drawn characters and a unique form of story-telling.  I won't give anything away, but it's a delicious read.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|If you like Star Wars or epic Sci-Fi films, you'll like John Carter. I love a good science fiction movie. I'm not a movie critic.

B0059WTMLW|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game. This is the second version of Sudoku that I've tried for the Kindle and this one is far and away the best. I haven't tried all the versions available or all the levels in each version, but doesn't that just show how great this game is? The one drawback that I've found, so far, is that I don't think there is a help in the game. Or maybe it's there and it's difficult to locate. Because of that, I haven't been able to determine the rules of some of the different versions that are included. I've been happily playing away at the two versions that I have totally figured out.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Okay these books are amazing. This is one of the first teen novels I`ve read since I transitioned from children`s literature. Now, I think parents should put some thought into letting your child read this series. Some kids might be thouroughly disturbed after reading the series. I loved them, though!<br />Many people have been telling me that Collins is a complete theif and she stole her ideas from a book called Battle Royale. I have never read that book so I wouldn't know. They say Collins had no orininal thoughts.<br />These books are appropiate for ages 12+. I'm twelve so I would say 12+ but most parents would say late teen. Its an escape from every day adventure to a completly different, amazing world. i recommend this to any and all readers, eager or not. i think everyone should read these books.
0307887448|2.0|The narrator would no doubt have me begin this review with a quote. How about \\"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here?\\"<br /><br />I by all rights should have loved Ready Player One, described to me as \\"a love letter to geek culture,\\" but it lost me quickly and never won me back. For starters, it's difficult to enjoy the simple act of reading Ernest Cline's plodding, lifeless prose; there isn't so much as a clever or eloquent turn of phrase in the entire novel. (At least, not one that Cline wrote himself.) Beyond that, a tremendous amount of the book is simple bald-faced exposition, dropped in so clumsily one half expects the narrator to acknowledge the fact (ie, \\"So why is it that you need every aspect of our society explicitly described to you? Where do you come from again?\\") The heralded pop culture references occasionally provide amusement but are used so indiscriminately that the effect is wearying over the course of a novel, inspiring fewer smiles of recognition than eyerolls of irritation.<br /><br />Looking beyond these issues, there are more deeply rooted problems. The characters are uniformly flat, from the narrator (a poor, overweight, socially awkward, virginal geek who yet can outwit and outperform everyone who comes near him--pretty blatant author wish fulfillment), to the love interest (whose run-of-the-mill qualities are, unsurprisingly, summarized by the protagonist instead of shown in action), to the elusive best friend (you'll NEVER guess what secret he's harboring! Actually, yes you will), to the villain (as one-dimensionally evil as a rival boyfriend in a John Hughes movie...which might actually be appropriate, come to think of it). Cline isn't interested in giving these people complex lives, he just tries to get the reader invested by setting up straw men for them to knock down, either assorted bullies and poseurs or the main antagonists.<br /><br />Which brings me to plotting. The antagonists are supposed to be wealthy beyond belief and completely unscrupulous, suggesting a third act full of danger and intrigue that never really comes; in the end the whole novel is just a string of puzzles (not particularly devious ones, either) obscuring a simple plot that resolves in pretty much the way you'd expect. Any little conflicts that threaten to become too interesting are quickly resolved, and not because of notable action by the narrator, but because of the ineptitude of the villains (who, again, have untold resources at their disposal and somehow can't crush this kid like a bug).<br /><br />The setting is by far the most interesting aspect of the book; who wouldn't want to explore a virtual universe full of thousands of fully realized planets and with real magic? Taken by themselves, the long expository passages reveal a thoughtfully executed world--unfortunately, they can't be taken by themselves. There's this kid who insists on pulling us away to tell us about how he's saving the world by being so great at being a geek. And you know what? He's kind of repellent.

160309007X|5.0|I was so very pleased when I finished Century: 2009. It gave a wonderfully satisfying ending to the \\"Century\\" trilogy. Easily the strongest of the three chapters, it has an immediate and compelling narrative (personally I found 1910 to be a little meandering, and 1969 to be a little chaotic). That doesn't mean Moore isn't afraid to be bold this time around, though. You'll be shocked and surprised by how he decides to end this tale.<br /><br />True, there are some minor problems. I don't think you get much of an idea of what Mina has been through, and Alan wasn't featured as much as I would have liked, but in terms of an ending: Wow!<br /><br />My one complaint comes from Moore's attempt to demonise Miss Rowling's opus. I would hope that he's actually read them all before he decided to portray her characters (last I heard, he'd only read the first book, and had been unable to continue -- probably being unaware that the reading level continues to mature as the characters do). Aside from that, this is a wonderful and fitting end to the trilogy. Poignant, inspiring, and fun.<br /><br />Well worth the journey, and a return to form for Moore!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I got this game as one of Amazon's daily free app,  While i like this sort of game, I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. The artwork is beautiful, but the plot is insipid, and some of the discriptions face palm bad--for instance, at one point you're asked to gather all the digital items, but you end up collecting analog phones, walkmans and radios.<br /><br />There also appears to be a glitch with the mysterious package--I can't enter the third code.<br /><br />Overall, it's okay. Not the best, not the worst, just okay.

0553582038|5.0|Don't really understand the dislike for this book. Yea, your favorite characters are no where to be found. But that is what makes this book unique. You get to get into the minds of Cersei and Jamie which is very interesting. Jamie becomes almost likable. George RR Martin continues to amaze me with his writing. 5 stars. Best fantasy series I have ever read.

B005LAIHPY|4.0|I didn't honestly think this would be good because of the fact it is a movie about the battleship video game and because the critics bashed it but in all honestly after seeing it, it was not bad at all as a matter a fact it was entertaining to me! Sure there isn't much of a plot or any real complicated writing of a script but it holds your attention and doesn't bore you to death.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A very well written book. Having known Adam and his family, I can testify that it is an accurate portrayal of his struggles and achievement in life.

This is a must see for everyone! Hope another Sherlock Holmes is in the works in the near future.

B0079J28NW|3.0|Did they remaster the Mod Oddessy special because the 1999 version was NOT remastered. Regardless, I don't understand how it is they took the film in 1999 and remastered it to add in the Hey Bulldog sequence only to take the 1968 version and remaster it for Blue Ray, presumably now again without the Hey Bulldog sequence. Also, why don't the extra's include both segments to show viewers the difference. Even more, the 1999 remaster went through P.Gabriel's 48 track set up to remaster the sound. Did they take the 1968 source and remaster it or did they take the 1968 remastered versions for the iTunes iPod and USB promos, or what? I mean, how many times do I need to by the soundtrack, the song track, and the film on DVD?  Stop messing with my childhood Apple Ltd., seriously. Pick a version, you're confusing the kids, those who grew up on it and those who will shortly.

B006VKKAXU|4.0|I found myself enchanted by Crossley's version of the Preludes this foggy morning. Regardless, I just received this box and wanted to share the content with other potential Debussy collectors. I will return and update my impressions as I progress through the well filled 18 cds. The Preludes make me feel quite optimistic about the collection.<br /><br />The packaging is quite good with a sturdy standard square box; the lid is opens like a book towards you and the 18 cds are stacked in a pile. You will need to remove them all in case you are looking for a specific cd. They look almost identical, but are nice color coded on the edges to indicate orchestral works, piano works etc. Each Cd contains the standard box image of Debussy as well as a tiny indication of content in the upper right corner. The upper left corner shows the number of the cd. The back of the sleeve shows the content, performers and time information (although no dates). The sleeve itself is a medium thickness paper (sturdy but still soft enough not to damage the cds). There is also a nice 32 page booklet (18 pages focusing on cd content [with dates] and three 4 page essays about Debussy in English, French and German). There is no discussion about the performers or the recordings in the booklet beyond the cd content.<br /><br />CONTENTS:<br />CD1 [72:29]<br />La Mer, Boston SO, Munch (1956)<br />Nocturnes, John Alldis Choir, New Philharmonia O, Boulez (1968)<br />Printemps, John Alldis Choir, New Philharmonia O, Boulez (1968)<br />Premiere Rapsodie pour clarinette et orchestre, Peyer (clarinet), New Philharmonia O, Boulez (1968)<br /><br />CD2 [72:06]<br />Prelude a l'apres-midi d'un faune, Boston SO, Munch (1962)<br />Jeux, New Philharmonia O, Boulez (1966)<br />Images pour orchestre, The Cleveland Orchestra, Boulez (1967)<br />Deux danses, Chalifoux (harp), The Cleveland Orchestra, Boulez (1967)<br /><br />CD3 [71:12]<br />La Boite a joujoux, London SO, Tilson Thomas (1991)<br />Fantaisie pour piano et orchestre, Douglas (piano), Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Janowski (1994)<br />Rapsodie pour orchestre et saxophone, Rascher (saxophone), New York Philharmonic, Bernstein (1961)<br />Petite Piece, Drucker (clarinet), Hambro (piano) (1970)<br /><br />CD4 [71:52]<br />Preludes -

B00742LLKU|5.0|If you are interested in a one-stop exposure to Debussy this set will serve you well.  If you are a collector this will probably fill in some minor gaps in your Debussy shelf. This an outstanding collection of very good to excellent recordings showcasing Debussy's major works.  You are likely to pursue other interpretations in addition to the ones you will find here if you become enchanted with Debussy's world of music. One of the advantages with these types of collection is that one gets exposed to music one otherwise would not have. E.g. I had never heard \\"Le Martyre de Saint-S&eacute;bastien\\" before and became quite enchanted with Ansermet's rendition of the piece. Magical and sublime music making!<br />In either case this is a bargain you cannot miss for a price of a little less than three dollars per disc.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome read.  I am really enjoying this book.  Once I start reading it, I can't put it down.  Each chapter makes me ready for the next one to see what happen.  I can wait to order and read the sequels.
B0018087TC|5.0|Well, of course it is. But moreover, Chet Baker creates an atmosphere, a mood, a memory. Few artists can transmit these things. It's his sound, who he was, how he lived, what he did. I don't want to sound sappy, but if this doesn't reach you then just go on to the next thing...
B0062HS03O|5.0|Very nice DVD. Never been to her concert. It was worth buying. Fun and it seemed short. Ok really they want you to write long reviews. Daaaaaa

B003E8P9G0|4.0|I thorougly enjoyed this book and I had to get the next one. That being said, the two first-person narrators threw me off constantly. I understood the chapter headers named whether a chapter belonged to Carter or Sadie, but if I had to put the book down in mid-chapter, I often lost track of whose head I was in. Plus, the ancient Egyptian mythology, while it is fed in at a good pace for readers unfamiliar with the myths, there is still a lot to grasp. The Percy Jackson series provides lots of Greek mythology, but most readers have at least a baseline familiarity with the major figures; however, most of us are less familiar with Egypt, so Riordan set himself a challenge here.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the kids, Sadie and Carter, are wonderful, and the cat is a hoot! She's my favorite character and my favorite line is hers: \\"I'm a cat, Carter. Everything I see is mine.\\" The chapter titles are as funny as we've come to expect from Riordan, and I recommend this book to anyone who loves a thrill ride adventure.
055357342X|5.0|Reading this book was quite interesting at certain times I was so bored I was falling asleep yet at other times I was on the edge of my seat reading up a storm  in a hurry to reach the next page. While not as great as the 1st two books still a pretty great read. Warning certain parts will shock you to the core, But come on people this series by no means is a fairy tale or the least bit of a happily ever after anything. We are all grown up and far from Disney type stories here lol Some parts are just gonna make you say OMG or WTF out loud can promise you that. I am anxious to start A Feast of Crows , even though the reviews are kinda horrible. Oh and for everyone complaining about the prices have you ever heard of a library duh lol
B00280LYHS|5.0|A top-notch finale for a wonderfully inventive series! New York's Olympus has to be saved by a rag-tag band of teenage demi-gods and centaurs because the gods are involved elsewhere in the war with the Titan. Percy and his friends come through in ways both expected and unexpected, with all their teen issues causing additional conflict. This whole series is a grand success!

0345803493|5.0|Read the reviews b4 I ordered and I was pleasantly surprised...great book.  I read #1 in 1 1/2 days.  Don't make the same mistake I did by only ordering #1...order all 3 so you arent left hanging like I was :(
0307887448|4.0|I just finished this book last night and feel like it was one of the better books I've read in the last year.  It's not great literature.  It has some plot holes and characterization problems.  I'm not even sure it would make a good movie.  But it read easily and quickly and kept me engaged.  And I thought the ending was satisfying.  That can be hard to find sometimes.  My main gripe with the book was the author seemed to be trying TOO hard to pander to the geek crowd by including SO many geek TV/music/game/hardware references.  Because the story is pretty good and he actually managed to make several scenes believable and suspenseful, I'm willing to give it the 4th star.<br /><br />But be aware that this is not too different from watching an episode of \\"Big Bang Theory\\" where the show has characters use so many geek references in conversation (in a way that no geek or nerd I know actually does) in an effort to \\"prove\\" its geek cred and thereby actually underscores its lack thereof.  Yet, in the same way that BBT is not necessarily less entertaining because of that (if the comedy is of your liking, that is), this book is does entertain.  It just starts to feel a bit much, as if the author has done a ton of research on what geeks love and regurgitates it all into this book.  I think the story would have been better served by a bit more subtlety, but the story is still good.<br /><br />In spite of that, it is kinda fun as a 30-something to have TV, movies, and games that I remember fondly from my 80's childhood play a prominent role in the story.  I couldn't help but feel some connection to it, as a result.  I do wonder if readers without personal knowledge of those things will find the references helpful or distracting.  It could very easily slow the story down for them.  But I think in the end, the book is worth the time spent to find out.
0345529057|5.0|I don't know if others who ordered this received books that were part of a bad production run or what; but, mine arrived in perfect condition...from the books' print (no cut-off pages, etc.) to the binding (nothing cracking or coming loose from spine) to the overall packaging.  I am thoroughly enjoying this read, and am a new GRRM fan.  It is a PERFECT summer read.  I have followed the series, and must admit that HBO did a nice job; however, NOTHING beats the detail and writing of the real thing.  I am truly loving every page I read...to the point that I'm now made its way into my dreams!
0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones (now on HBO) is the 1st of five books in the \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. I finished \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and I'm half way through \\"A Clash of Kings\\". G.R.R.Martin evokes J.R.R.Tolkien. Epic in scope, medieval in flavor, AND there might be zombies. How much better could it get? If you loved \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or if Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" series, you won't be able to put these books down.
B008JFUTFO|5.0|This is an intriguing Documentary of Neil Young as he returns home for a Special Performance and much more! This Amazing Artist performs with his guitars and keyboards from iconic hits to brand-new material. Also included is a portrait of his life, his homeland, and on-tour Entertainment. He always Rocked from the very beginning of his career and is still a Shining Star in the music industry. Stunning Performance, very Interesting and Enjoyable for all Neil Young Fans from the 'Oldies But Goodies' to a New generation. Highly Recommended!

0345803493|2.0|I read all 3 books, or at least scanned the last one. Not some of the best novels I've read lately. Obviously for the younger crowd who really seem to enjoy them. Found them to be a risque Danielle Steele type novel. Spent a lot of time shaking my head at the pig-headed, naive and immature female main character. I'd say borrow if you can and don't buy the books.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I can see the draw to this book.  I as a lot of women secretly fantasize over the possesive dominate male.  Hopefully women realize that fantasy is alot different than real life.<br /><br />This book needed some touching up, there was little description of the main characters.  I would have liked to know Travis' perspective.<br /><br />And if this was supposed to be a romance it failed because I like my male heroes to love WOMEN not just one woman.  A kind of guy that will open a door for any woman not just the one he thinks is above all the sluts he is sleeping with.  There is a scene at lunch where he sits down and has this girl sit on his lap and his friend says \\"I think I threw up a little...\\" and the girl calls her a skank.  He then stands up and dumps the girl on the floor telling her to apologize to his friend, he came off like a real douche, the girl was insulted and he then gets pissed when she responds to the insult?<br /><br />I guess like other posters have said at 35 I am just too old for this book.  I remember seeing guys like this in high school and again in college and looking back I am so glad I was never in this situation but I can see myself really liking this book between 17 and 19 years old.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the idea was kinda interesting but it got boring in places and the sex scenes as well as the ending sucked.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this app because it is very addictive and I love to play it when I am bored....definently reccommend it if you have the kindle fire.
1466401885|5.0|I began reading Beautiful Disaster at 10:00 o'cock at night and did not go to sleep until I finished the novel.  I could not part with the characters-- even to sleep.  I could feel my crush on \\"Travis\\" grow through every turn of the page.  His anger paralleled against his possessiveness was sensual to say the least.  A sultry and lush love story without being crude or raunchy.  Throughout the novel both characters seem convinced that their desires would be spurned, rejected to the point of destruction.  I could actually feel myself hold my breath while waiting for \\"Travis\\" to touch \\"Pigeon\\" and take what he so desired-- and fought to protect.<br /><br />The plight of both protagonists were well conceived and delivered with a current of realism.  At every encounter the author took me from the point of feeling satiated, and then catapulted me back down panting for more. The author left me on the edge, praying for a convergence of carnal pleasures, and love returned.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|It charges money for each game I thought you gotten to play the games free. so listen to the reivews before you get it.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a very good game and interesting. My kids love it and so does my wife. I would recommend the game to anyone.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I always love Jodi Picoult's books.  I'm pretty radical in my thoughts and enjoy the way she causes me to confront or clarify my beliefs.  As a strong ally of the GLBT community -- I enjoyed seeing her address this difficult subject.  When I moved from California to Florida, I remember that one of the biggest shocks was that my lesbian friends could not adopt a child. I never saw such heartbreaking anguish. Jodi's addressing the fertilized eggs issue and who we decide we can depend on - just took this book a level deeper.  I will always read every book this wonderful writer offers. Due to lack of space at home, I usually borrow the books from the library and I'm on the waiting list for her latest two.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I really only use this program for its widget, so my 5 stars only speaks to that. The widget is the best I've used.

A must have for anyone who lives by their calendar!
0316098337|5.0|Hello, I just went to the author's website to find other books she's written. It said that she loved hearing from readers -- so I just had to write to tell her how impressed I was with \\"Room.\\"  I spent an entire reading it straight through(although I had tons of other things planned) because I just could not put it down!  I was moved and curious about all of those involved in this story.<br />I kept thinking of Jaycee Lee Dugard and wondering to what extent her children are experiencing many of the same things that Jack experiences.  I wondered if reading this book would help her or re-traumatize her. The author really put life behind the idea of being kidnapped and away from the world for a long, long time.<br /><br />The book also reminded me of the book and movie, Being There, where Chance has only what he's seen on television to guide him through life. As a therapist, it is astounding how much influence one person can have on the mind of another when there is little to contradict it.<br /><br />I loved that Ma was not a saint -- she would certainly have her own problems after that kind of experience.<br /><br />Emma Donoghue has entered my literary elite space with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Erik Larsen, and Jodi Picoult!
B001MEJY8W|3.0|I purchased this movie seeking something. Not sure from the onset whether I was hoping for a revenge flick, an over the top torture circus or even a little lesbian psycho bitch fantasy or something completely unexpected. As I watch the credits roll, I get a little bit of everything rolled up in violent sushi roll. My only qualm is a lack of the character's POV during the transformation through the last third of the movie. No friggin' spoiler, I just wish I was given a little more insight leading into the coup de grace. Sure, I can make an inference & the film is fine as it sits, I just had to justify my 3 stars. It's solid, worth the dough, staying in my collection, just didn't deliver that 'gotta tell all me friends to check it out' factor.<br /><br />On the fence?

055357342X|4.0|Pros:<br />+ The world feels like a real place and the characters feel like real people<br />+ Very good character development.<br />+ Unexpected results<br />+ Martin is still not afraid to kill off a character or two or three.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Martin is still not afraid to kill off a character or two or three<br />- The pacing is very slow in the beginning.  I couldn't really get into the book till 400 pages.<br />- Book is riddles with moments of \\"I don't care\\" (pages and pages of them)<br /><br />If you read the first two books, you will know what you are getting into with this one.  One phrase I will never utter in connection to this book in day to day life: \\"Oh, this book?  It's just a bit of light reading\\".  If you want light reading, this book isn't for you.  But I digress; if you intend on reading it, you already know what to expect from a George RR Martin novel.<br /><br />The character development is extremely well done - especially for Tyrion, Jaime and Sansa.  Samwell gets a lot of pages devoted to developing his character, as does Jon.  Any pages devoted to Catelyn I personally didn't find overly interesting.  Without giving too much away, Catelyn does a lot of traveling in this book, most of which is fairly dull.  This eventually pays off though towards the end of the book.<br /><br />Unexpected results: There are several bombshells in this book that will completely blindside you.  These involve a few revelations concerning assumptions made up until this point, as well as some MAJOR shake ups revolving around some of the main characters.<br /><br />The only real negatives is comes from my perspective that George Martin is the puppet master - or better yet, a chess master, and SO much of this book is just the time it takes to move the pieces into position.  In the end it's all worth it though.<br /><br />If you liked the first two, you will like this one.<br /><br />4 Stars
B008FBMLRQ|5.0|If you r a fan of Duran duran do not hesitate.<br />This CD is well worth grabbing.<br /><br />I would have loved some diversity on some of the track selection.<br />That said, what they played they played perfectly.<br /><br />Standouts are: The man who stole the leopard, Girl Panic, Sunrise and the Reflex.<br /><br />Incredible energy at this concert. It just sounds so good!
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Before this year,those of us who've been fans since the band's early years had not hoped to hear from them again. Many of us kept track of Brian's career, and Al's work, and the Mike/Bruce roadshow was always out there somewhere; but after many years without a \\"reunion\\", we assumed that Carl's death had closed the Beach Boys' story.<br /><br />But Wait! Here they are, in summer 2012, riding the wave of a triumphant tour that is a powerful statement of what they were and what they are still capable of together. I saw them in Connecticut following their two nights at the Beacon Theater in New York - remarkable by any fair measure. Even before the hard work of cranking out several hours of fine live music night after night on tour with great supporting musicians had pushed them back together and tightened them up as a band, they crafted this mellow album.<br /><br />Though Carl's voice is missed, the sound is unmistakeably and authentically Beach Boys, and a genuine marvel for that, given the high mileage on the Boys. The disappointment is that most of the material doesn't reflect the wisdom of age. Some of the lyrics are formulaic, some of the lyrics just plain don't work for the Boys at this stage of their (and our) lives, and several of the better songs feel incomplete. But the album has inspiring moments, and there is audible energy and pride. We can't know whether Brian can or will create more remarkable music for his band. This heartfelt album, and Brian's new stamina, is cause for hope. Perhaps the awe and acclaim this knockout tour has rightly won will inspire him, and the Boys, and will be the catalyst for a last blast album which astonishes.<br /><br />But though we can now hope for a richer final statement, we can't be disappointed with this album. It is a kind of miracle. The phrase \\"Indian Summer\\" refers to those bright warm afternoons which sometimes appear late in the year, beautiful and perishable. Lets cut the Boys and ourselves some slack and accept this Indian Summer music from our old friends for what it is, an amazing surprise party, an occasion for thanks and for happiness.
034580404X|1.0|If Bella (from the Twilight Saga) never met Edward or Jacob and went off to college, she would be the main character in this book. The similarities between not only the main characters in these books (Anastasia Steele VS. Bella Swan), but the writing itself is a bit too much alike. Bella is the average girl who can't imagine why her hero (Edward) wants her ... wait a second, Anastasia is the same sheepish girl who can't figure out why \\"Mr. Grey\\" wants her.<br /><br />Both Bella and Anastasia blush way too much, I mean really? How often does an author have to express how bashful these girls are. Another similarity that was driving me crazy is the back and forth bickering between the actual dialogue and the subconscious of the main character.<br /><br />Both books are pretty much the same. Twilight = PG-13 fantasy. Fifty Shades = XXX Adult fantasies.<br /><br />Both books (I know I'm just writing about this trilogy, but they're just so similar) are written well apart from the obvious overuse of a thesaurus and repetition of the character's actions.<br /><br />Bottom line. If you haven't read the Twilight Sage, you'll enjoy these books. If you have read it, don't read these because you'll be irritated. If you haven't read either, I'd probably lean more toward the Twilight saga only because it's more of a \\"page-turner\\" than these.<br /><br />I just can't understand how this \\"romance\\" novel received so much publicity and hype.
0805095535|4.0|The beginning of Auster's Journal is a beautiful elegy on aging, memory and the relationship of body and spirit.  Auster recounts an intensely personal journey with painfully acquired wisdom and intimations of mortality.  He distills in words his \\"catalog of sensory data\\" as the book becomes a gift by a beloved author to readers who may be entering a similar stage of life.<br /><br />In the early pages of Winter Journal, Auster tells of childhood injuries; the scars of which he still carries.  What is striking is how well Auster renders the impersonal concreteness of events and suggests that the injuries that we unknowingly escaped may have been far more formidable than those endured. Also recounted are brief moments of remembered weather, illnesses huge and physical indignities small and the joy of playing baseball (\\"Never a dull moment, in spite of what critics of the game might think.\\") The car accident that represented his family's instantaneous transition from the quotidian to the cataclysmic is described as well (\\"as if Zeus had hurled a lightning bolt at you and your family.\\")<br /><br />As he moves deeper into the book, the author loses focus a bit from his intended \\"phenomenology of breathing.\\"  But whether listing memories from each of his personal residences, remembering the death of his mother or describing why the film noir movie DOA represents a touchstone for an event in his life, Auster remains interesting, engaging and personal.<br /><br />A journal can be forgiven for being a bit uneven and episodic.  But even with these shortcomings, this small book left me wiser  and more a part of my own life than I was when I opened it to begin reading. Its impact may have been heightened for me because of my age and a brush with mortality of my own just this year.  But for those readers who have difficulty identifying with Auster's Journal, I recommend carefully considering the deep truths implicit in the book's opening sentence: \\"You think it will never happen to you, that it cannot happen to you, that you are the only person in the world to whom none of these things will ever happen, and then, one by one, they all begin to happen to you, in the same way they happen to everyone else.\\"
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting story line about a topic I wasn't familiar with!!! Many readers will not put it down, others will put it down right away. It is escapism pure and simple.<br />Be sure to preview, for adult readers only.

0345536886|4.0|although this book is very funny in parts and the central story line keeps you hanging on, I find this a more thoughtful Grisham novel; the characters are fighting their own challenges (unhappy marriages, job dissatisfaction, addictions); it actually has some wonderful personality profiles where people are created that you care about and that develop as the novel goes on; don't expect a slam-dunk David and Goliath outcome that you've experienced in other novels; but I really enjoyed this book; in some ways more than the original Grisham novels that were like crack in print for me....I couldn't help but feel at the end that the book ended with the possibility of a sequel.. what happened to the blogger.. what are the consequences down the road to Big Pharma for things that came out during the trial...

0345803485|1.0|Admittedly, I was curious about this book. I also wanted to give E.L. James a chance. It didn't bother me that the book started as 'Twilight' fan fiction. I've read really good fan fiction before, but nothing could prepare me for this steaming pile of you know what. Once I finished the first 100 pages of '50 Shades of Grey,' I knew I made a mistake. This book is so poorly written and so terrible that I'm convinced this is a practical joke. Somewhere a publicist laughing their butt off. If you are that publicist then please contact me. I want to hire you. You are amazing. You could sell ice to Eskimos, as you sold millions of copies of the worst book ever written.<br /><br />The author herself is barely literate and doesn't seem to own a thesaurus. She also does NOT understand technology, American culture, plot, nor does she have the ability to write in legible sentences. The author's use of one word over and over again is particularly irritating. She uses the word \\"murmur\\" more than any person should be allowed to. In fact it should be against the law to use the word \\"murmur\\" as much as she does. It's on every page, multiple times. Murmur seems to be the only way these people communicate. They don't \\"talk,\\" they don't \\"yell,\\" they don't \\"say,\\" they don't \\"speak.\\" They just \\"murmur.\\" After reading this tripe I started to get delirious. I can't read that word ever again without cringing. Likewise, Ana seems to repeat the same phrases to herself over and over again. Hint: ** it starts with \\"Holy ....\\"<br /><br />Most importantly, the characters are awful and unrelatable. Perhaps if the book had been written in 3rd person instead of 1st person it would have been tolerable. Hearing the world through Ana's foggy haze of stupidity was torturous. Anastasia is perhaps the dumbest character I have had the misfortune of reading about. She's not just a typical naive coed, she's a complete idiot. Somewhere the author confused innocence with stupidity. She also has little to no self-respect and 0 common sense. Christian is a pig of a man. I don't care how good looking he is, any woman with an ounce of self-respect would run for the hills. Christian's character and actions are clearly the product of a male dominant fantasy wrapped in a bubble gum wrapper. Part of the reason this book was so successful is because the author plays into the delusional female fantasy that women can change men with their magical gold vajajay's. In fact, Ana's vajajay's is so powerful that it can change a sadistic man like Christian Grey. Yeah right?<br /><br />The book is maddening at best and a joke at worst. Unfortunately the joke is on us so DON'T buy this book. If your curiosity gets the best of you, go the Library. Don't put one more dollar in this woman's pocket. Please note: There's a reason the first book is poorly rated and the latter books are not. After reading the first one, most sane people threw the book in the trash and declined to read the 2nd and 3rd ones.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Okay, so I am guilty of playing into all the hype about this book. I caved and bought it for the Kindle. It was HORRIBLE! I ended up skimming through the last 200 pages, just to see how it ended. Couldn't stand the \\"erotica\\" and no I am not a prude. I just thought the story was not believable, and the characters were just so angsty. I will not be reading the other sequels to this book.

0345803485|2.0|I was lucky enough to get a PDF copy of this book, so I didn't actually have to pay for it (I would have hated myself). Unfortunately, that was the best part about this book. I understand that this was the author's first book, but there are so many issues in the writing, the verbage, the geography... Before I looked up anything about the author, I knew that she was 1) not American, 2) not young (or even young-ish), and 3) had read Twilight and said \\"Hey, I can do that!\\".<br /><br />I'm not sure why her publisher didn't say something to her about the fact that her \\"American\\" character speaks strangely like a British transplant, and her stoic standoffish dad deals with chaos by making tea (REALLY?!) which is the exact opposite of any American father, stoic or not. Additionally, in trying to appeal to the younger audience by using fasion, this author is devoid of knowledge of any designers, and I'm pretty sure she hasn't looked at a fashion magazine in decades.<br /><br />That brings me to the music. Oh the music. I can imagine the minutes it took to exact a playlist that would be deep enough for the Grey character who is \\"deep as a graveyard\\" (to put it in Rilo Kiley's lyrics). Additionally, there are many times where you feel like the author had a Word-A-Day calendar, and would feel \\"inspired\\" to challenge the reader with her expansive vocabulary.<br /><br />This book is so repetative. I hate that she calls the MacBook Pro a \\"mean machine\\" EVERY TIME. I hate that she calls her body parts \\"down there\\". I hate that she is always blushing, gnawing her lip off and rolling her eyes. And Grey? There is no way a guy like him would put up with the crap Ana tries to pull, and there is also no way that he would be dropping his jaw at the frequency that the author says he does. Don't even get me started on the \\"holy moses\\", \\"dios mio\\", and references to the inner goddes and subconscious (these two \\"characters\\" really bring a cartoon-ish vibe to an adult book and I find them extremely distracting. Like watching the Lizzy Maguire cartoon between commercial breaks).<br /><br />So very many things wrong with the writing, and still, this stupid book is impossible to put down. Now that there are 2 more books in the series, I have to finish it. Luckily, I am late to the Hunger Games series so I have one 50 book, and one Hunger book, which will leave me on a good note finsihing a book written for young adults, and written very well.<br /><br />I had to give it only 2 stars because if I had known that this book was so bad before I started it, I would have waited for the movie to come out, and left it with that. So if you absolutely must read this book, don't say that the many negative reviews didn't warn you!remely distracting.

B0071DJZZA|4.0|When I first ordered the Hunger Games, I was under the impression that it would be loosely based on the TV ratings war between several reality/competition style cooking programs. Think MasterChef, Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Swear Word, or Survivor: Cannibal Island.<br />Once the potential death of an impossibly resilient teen protagonist entered the frame, however, I began to suspect that I would learn hardly anything about good quality food, or why it is impossible to be a chef without being nasty and horrible to your staff or understudies.<br />Once the competitors in this deathly olympiad were taken to the capital to prepare, my faith was restored, for they were served slow cooked lamb, made in a tajine, with prunes and vegetables...a perfect dish for a winter's eve, which it turns out seasonally describes the eves we are currently enduring here in Sydney.<br />The result was that my girlfriend, a real up and comer in the kitchen, a former contestant on 'Survivor: Hassle Free Greek Island Holiday'; and lover of tween romance literature; took it upon herself to reproduce the meal in question. I consumed the meal hungrily, relaxing in the knowledge that afterwards I would be consuming dessert, rather than being pitted in a kill or be killed type scenario. Seriously, would you want a gutful of slow cooked meat if you were about to fight for your own survival?<br /><br />For all the above reasons, and many more, I give Hunger Games 4 stars and can safely say it is the best book I never read...apart from thousands of classics.
B000059POY|1.0|This dvd does not work, the seller only accepted to refund me the half of the price without shipping, so at the end i paid almost 50 dlls for a piece of crap. The dvd is damaged or simply has nothing recorded on it. Bad from amazon, in this time did not take the client best interest.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For those of us with the gift of appreciating a great story, I can honestly say I loved this book.  For those nay sayers who are looking for a work of literary excellence, you've missed the plot.  It won't appeal to anybody who likes candyfloss sex, however it does have a tortured hero and an innocent girl who teaches a tortured soul how to let go and live a different life.  I read all three books before they hit the news and the best seller lists and it has been interesting to see how these stories have been absorbed, distributed, reported upon and disected.  Boy, what a roller coaster of comment these books have garnered.  I hope whoever produces the movie does it right by the original story.
B004L03B3S|5.0|This film from South America deals with a very difficult subject....love between two boys....and later when they are grown, love between two men.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Odd Future member Frank Ocean shocked everyone by choosing to release his [[ASIN:B008CJ0KI8 channel ORANGE]] one week early exclusively on iTunes.  He surprised some by his openness in regards to his sexuality,  causing some industry prognosticators to question about career ramifications. Longterm effects take time to measure, but response to the early release was gargantuan, propelling Def Jam to distribute physical copies, urging retailers to sell immediately. Channel Orange is a very special `R&B' album; it is different from other R&B albums released in some time. Ocean's voice is a gem - soulful, nuanced, and commanding throughout - and throughout the seventeen tracks, Ocean never misses.<br /><br />\\"Start,\\" a :45 intro/interlude, gives way into the `alternative,' creative vibe Channel Orange subscribes too.  A rather random palette of sounds characterizes it, including text message alerts. The `underground' side from Odd Future transfers here.<br /><br />\\"Thinkin Bout You\\" is a tour de force.  Minimalist, yet soulful, simple yet complex, \\"Thinkin Bout You\\" showcases modern R&B sans the gimmickry of Europop crossover trends that have come to characterize it. Ocean shifts between chest and head voice (falsetto) like a pro, making \\"Thinkin Bout You\\" a vocal masterclass. Add the power of the pen upon the refrain and the hit is realized: \\"Or Do You Not Think So Far Ahead/Cuz I been thinkin bout forever...\\" \\"Fertilizer,\\" another odd-ball, :39 interlude follows, containing an old-school soul sound and some creative lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Sierra Leone\\" is clever, playing not only upon the country, but treats `Sierra Leone' as a lady. Ocean half speaks/half sings, in cerebral fashion, delivering some outlandish, though clever lyrics: \\"We're spending too much time alone/and I just ran out of Trojans/Horses Gallop to her throne/we're behaving like teenagers...\\" Highlights include soulful production, harmonized background vocals, and soulful lead by Ocean.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Life\\" continues to stroke the momentum, retaining soul and minimalism in tandem with one another.  With Pharrell Williams producing, the sound is epic, particularly when the full fruition of production enters on the refrain that deals with `the rich life': \\"You've Had a Landscaper and a housekeeper/since you were born/the star shine always kept you warm/so why see the world/when you got the beach...\\"<br /><br />\\"Not Just Money\\" is a :59 interlude, following up \\"Sweet Life's\\" accusatory points and preceding \\"Super Rich Kids,\\" featuring Earl Sweatshirt. Another noble cut, \\"Super Rich Kids\\" contains an interpolation of \\"Real Love.\\" Again playing on `money,' Ocean delivers a punch with his hook \\"Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends/super rich kids with nothing but fake friends...\\" Horns eventually are added to strengthen the production and overall sound while Earl Sweatshirt delivers a solid rap/spoken world contribution.<br /><br />\\"Pilot Jones\\" doesn't lack in concept, coming off as bizarre as everything else. \\"We Only had things in common/now the only thing we share is the refrigerator/ice cold baby/I told you I'm ice cold/You out here flying high...but fly alone...,\\" Ocean sings.  The vocal production is `spot on.'<br /><br />\\"Crack Rock\\" is what it claims to be, detailing breaking up a family because of drug addiction.  Ocean sports his low register with the results being exceptional.  The message is weighty, but the cut is enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"Pyramids\\" is epic for many reasons. Clocking in at nearly ten minutes, it combines two different songs, though both revolving around the same topic. The production is modern and well conceived with its array of synthetic sounds. Contrasting any and everything else, \\"Pyramids\\" is  interesting if for nothing else than Ocean references cheetahs, Queen Cleopatra, and love in one song.<br /><br />\\"Lost,\\" continues to exhibit sound songwriting, particularly on the refrain as Ocean sings: \\"Now You're lost in the heat of itall/Girl you know you're lost/lost in the thrill of it all/Miami Amsterdam Tokyo Spain Lost...\\" Vocally, Ocean continues to dominate.\\"White,\\" features John Mayer playing guitar, providing an interlude produced by Tyler, The Creator (drum programming).<br /><br />\\"Monks,\\" opens with an organ-like patch to initiate the cut. As he does throughout, Ocean shifts through vocal registers, ending up in his upper register for \\"I never ask for much/but please keep up lover...\\" With a change of pace (switch-up), Ocean keeps \\"Monk\\" from ever feeling predictable.<br /><br />\\"Bad Religion\\" is easily one of the efforts best. Opening with organ and eventually adding strings to heighten dramatic effect, Ocean sings his heart out here.  Ocean's voice is characterized by nuances including cracks and crevices that are nearly indescribably soulful. Topped off by killer lines in \\"...if it brings me to my knees/it's a bad religion\\" or \\"Unrequited love/to me it's nothing but a one man cult...\\" makes \\"Bad Religion\\" epic.<br /><br />\\"Pink Matter\\" adds Andr&eacute; 3000 to the mix, delivering another mysterious, captivating cut.  Ocean handles the first portion of the song, which is capped off by an intense second iteration of the refrain which finds Ocean belting in intensity: \\"...Giving me pleasure/pleasure... pleasure over matter...\\" Andr&eacute; 3000 seals the deal in usual `oddball fashion' and even manages a play on Ocean's name: \\"Well Frankly when the Ocean so...good\\"<br /><br />\\"Forrest Gump\\" satisfies as the final full length track, making overt references to the Academy Award Winning film.  \\"End\\" closes the album much like \\"Start\\" began, though it is longer in duration.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008CJ0KI8 channel ORANGE]] is quite a masterpiece.  The lyrics are quite intellectual, the songs themselves creative, and Ocean is a `force to be reckoned with.'  There are elements of traditional R&B, pop-rap, alternative music, and a number of influences.  Ocean puts the pieces together magnificently to create one of the best albums of 2012 so far.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Never in my life have I read a book that has made laugh till my stomach hurt one minute and cry like a baby the next. This book is the best I've read in a LONG time, possibly ever. The characters immediately get under your skin. I look forward to more books from Colleen! I am forever a fan.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|Another great album put out by a truly great band. To think these 4 guys from England are well into their 60's is amazing! I can honestly say after listening to Asia for over 30 years and seeing them 4 times in concert, they all are at the very top of their professions. Steve Howe shows once again why he is considered by many as a genius at the guitar. His solo in \\"Ghost Of A Chance\\" is spot on with the sound he brings to Asia, as well as his acoustic guitar solo in the \\"I know How You Feel\\" bonus track. Carl Palmer illustrates throughout the whole album how younger drummers should strive for his excellence with a band needing a strong, constant beat. You will have never known John Wetton was as good as base player until you hear this release. His voice is still strong and does not let you down here. Geoffrey Downes shows us on the keyboards yet again how to incorporate his style of play with todays progressive sound without sounding cheesy. All in all, if you want to listen to great musical talent, listen to this album. While not perfect, it WILL give you much appreciation vs. what you hear coming from many artists out today. If you like Asia, XXX stands not to disappoint!

B000JMKTLO|3.0|I have nothing bad to say about the story.  It was okay, if not a little generic.  My major problem was the writing.  Now, many people may laud the book for it's literary quality.  But me?  I found it boring.  Now don't misunderstand me, I don;t live on fluff books filled with five word sentences.  But this... this book was waaaay too polished for my liking.<br /><br />There was no flow.  There was nothing organic about the style.  It was first person, which should have allowed for something more natural, but the author took a first person and made her thoughts and descriptions and observations too perfect.  It was as if she sat and wrote the book with a dictionary in one hand, a thesaurus in the other, and polished each sentence to something that shone but was highly unnatural.<br /><br />This may be a little harsh; I won;t argue that point.  But I prefer writers that allow for some flow.  I am a huge King fan, and while he may be a little wordy, he just flows.  From sentence to sentence, page to page, his writing juts flows.<br /><br />The writing her was just too pretentious, as if the writer was saying: \\"Hey, look what I can do.  Look how I can write,\\" even if it all seemed unnatural coming from the main character (even if she is a reporter).  If that was the writers intention, fine, she is entitled to it.  And there are many, many, many people out there who probably love this type of writing.  And like I said, the story is not bad.  I just found the writing a little too irritating for my liking.
0307951529|5.0|I really do love this book because of it's practicality. Get this. You don't need an MBA or $60,000 to start your own company. Those were the authors words and from then on, I was hooked. There are many personal accounts of individuals who started their own businesses by accident. Sometimes it's because they've lost a job. It's such a good read, filled with ideas to help us be our own boss, whether it's for some extra money or to do full time. A friend recommended it and I'm grateful he did!
0670022411|4.0|I started hearing about this book about a year ago. Then, it was only whispers on the wind, telling those listening that this was a unique view on vampires, witches and daemons. That this is a modern Lord of the Rings set in our world. But I was still skeptical. I've read a lot of vampire books, and many many takes on the whole 'vampire lore.' So how many more 'unique' views can there be? Yet, the approving voices continued to grow louder and louder until a few months ago, I relented and started reading. And I was pleasantly surprised to find that the voices had been right. It was a very unique view on our favorite creatures: vampires, witches and daemons.    Diana Bishop is a young witch just trying to be normal. She has a doctorate in alchemical studies, and is working at Oxford in England. As she is working on her next presentation, she stumbles across a magical text called Ashmole 782. Not wanting to get involved, she sends it back into the stacks of the Oxford Library, hoping no one in the magical community will notice. But they do. Suddenly, Diana is a hot commodity. Everyone wants a piece of her, sometimes literally, and the only person she can trust is a vampire.  For the rest of my review, please visit my blog at [...].  Along with my thoughts and recommendations, I also suggest other great reads.  It will be worth your time.  Happy Reading!

1609611543|5.0|I stopped eating wheat completely a week ago. I know it is too soon to judge, but I can guarantee you this. After quitting wheat, I feel a lot less hungry!! I lost my visceral, unresistable urge to eat anything tasty. I can control myself very easily even in front of pizzas, pastas, and cheese cakes, which i loved so much. I don't need to deplore on my forbidden joys anymore. It was really true that wheat is a strong appetite stimulater. I think i will be able to lose my weight and regain my health, with much less efforts that i always had before. Losing weight has never been this easier to me!

B008JAGZDE|5.0|I loved all the original movies but was afraid this one would be raunchy or out of touch since it is an older series. It was surprisingly funny and tied in to the previous movies perfectly. I was very pleased. I almost died laughing at a few of the scenes especially the kitchen pan fiasco. Great movie for a ton of laughs!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Hard to believe that this series accounted for 20% of book sales last month.  Shallow characters, dialogue repetitive, predictable and stupid.  This author must have a hell of a promoter.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I began reading stieg larsson's books and became hooked after The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Although I love this series, and it is by far the best series I have ever read... I feel like nothing can compare to all the excitement leading up to this third book. It still held excitement but it left me wanting more and more. Regardless of my wanting I still love this book and would reccommend it to every reader I know.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app its easy and fast also has great features and its free best of all! I would regimens it
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Words can't even begin to describe how beautiful this album is. From start to finish and never once did I break from the trance to frown and skip a song.
0553573411|1.0|My expectations were somewhat high after the quality of the fist book. I was very disappointed at the lack adventure in this second book. There was a lot written on wall hangings and feelings and clothing - but just not much adventure, fantasy or plot. There was an awful lot of repetition - I mean near duplicate paragraphs about what had already happened. So I plodded through it with the excuse that it was just a bridge to the third in the trilogy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|At first it was a tough call with Bible.is, but youversion is very user friendly &amp; I really love the reminders. I don't always get them though so maybe that is a glitch? Nonetheless I love the app! It will serve you wonderfully!
B001TODCII|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  I found it on cable and got sucked in and couldn't look away.  Really fantastic.
B005FISC52|4.0|The quality was amazing! I finished the first disc and it didn't skip once! It arrived pretty much on time! So i cant complain!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hardly ever drop a book mid-way, but this was so boring that I stopped at 33% and just couldn't force myself to continue. One of the most redundant books I have had the misfortune of wasting time and money on.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|This was a really dumb concept. I feel like I lost all the time I spent reading this thing. Scalzi even admits that it is dumb late in the story. I don't understand why Scalzi doesn't go back to, and build upon the \\"Old Man's War\\" series.
0385737955|4.0|(Juvenile) Science Fiction of a futuristic society where kids have their memories wiped and are put in a maze to find an escape.  For two years.  Not the best written book, and the topic is a bit on the depressing side, but gripping and interesting for sure.
B0075KRFBU|3.0|Some if not most of these are not true first editions and do not say \\"first edition\\" on the copywrite page. They are later printings which to me is not a first edition.<br />I see some sellers are changing their descriptions to reflect this. If you are a collector looking for a true first edition, make sure before you purchase.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I thought I would love this book since I loved \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" by Bill Bryson, but I didn't. This book was well written but it was too sad/mildly depressing for me. It kept me mostly entertained but not my style. There are also some very weird parts that threw me.
1451683405|3.0|Harris has proven to be a creative and thoughtful writer. I have read a few of his books and found this to be the most interesting.<br /><br />According to Harris, we are not the conscious source of our actions and we could not have behaved differently in the past than we did. He says, \\"I, as the conscious witness of my experience, no more initiate events in my prefrontal cortex than I cause my heart to beat\\" (9). \\"In physical terms,\\" says Harris, \\"we know that every human action can be reduced to a series of impersonal events\\" (27).<br /><br />Harris rightly points out that there are three main approaches to the problem of free will and determinism: determinism, libertarianism, and compatibilism. He then says, \\"Today, the only philosophically respectable way to endorse free will is to be a compatibilist\\" (16). But if determinism were true, as Harris asserts, why would any position be philosophically unrespectable? After all, people are determined to hold their beliefs--whether compatibilist, libertarian, or determinist--by forces outside of their control. Why would he bother to critique other positions if the people who hold them couldn't have believed differently? In fact, his critique is just the result of chemicals moving in his brain, so why do they matter? What makes his chemicals more respectable than others?<br /><br />Here are some other brief comments in Free Will that puzzle me.<br /><br />Harris critiques the idea of an immortal soul as one of the cruelest concepts in history (p. 56). Yet if his deterministic views are correct then people who embrace the soul were determined to do so and could not have believed differently. Why bother to critique then? He might as well critique water for boiling at 100' C.<br /><br />He says that dispensing with the idea of free will allows us to focus on things that matter most--assessing risk, protecting the innocent, and deterring crime (p. 53). He seems to be implying that we ought to accept his deterministic views for the betterment of mankind. Yet again, if determinism is true then we can't change any of our beliefs--we can't freely follow his logic since our beliefs are already set. The very fact that he argues for his position undermines his stated belief in determinism.<br /><br />Harris offers a mild critique of conservatives who seem to have no compassion for orphans or those born with clubbed feet (p. 62). But if his deterministic views are correct they couldn't help it. Conservatives are forced to believe this because of their parents, genes, and environment (as are liberals). Again, why is he bothering to critique them?<br /><br />There are many more inconsistencies throughout Free Will, but the point should be well stated--Harris argues against free will, yet all of his arguments rest upon the existence of free will.<br /><br />Harris raises important issues related to the free will debate, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a naturalistic view of human behavior. But the problem is that he doesn't take his views far enough. For example, in the conclusion he says, \\"The illusion of free will is itself an illusion\\" (p. 64). He's right. If determinism is true, then the belief in free will is an illusion. But why stop at the belief in free will? It would seem to follow logically that all our beliefs are illusions if determinism is true. In fact, the belief that \\"the illusion of free will is itself an illusion\\" is itself an illusion...and so is the rest of the entire book.or the betterment of mankind.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I thought it was so well thought out. Wonderfully written.  Characters were so real I could see them in my head.  I haven't seen the movie. Not sure I will...I'm sure it's great. But I just dont' see it being as great as the book. Awesome job Suzanne Collins!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a little late on the Hunger Games bandwagon. But after seeing the movie, and liking it very much, I had to read the books.... and they don't disappoint. This is a great adventure sci-fi story set in a dystopian future. So if you are into sci-fi and adventure this is for you.
B0020NH94A|5.0|This book describes a stroke step by step. How can it be so thorough? The stroke happened to a brain scientist. She describes her mental functions deteriorating and then very slowing getting them back.  Out of fear and ignorance, I had always hoped it would be fatal if I had a heart attack or stroke. Now I know there is hope after a stroke but the caretakers must know what to do. I hope my children read it before I have one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Legions of readers have been closely monitoring Amazon for my review of Wool.  Yes... I know it has been a long wait, but cut me some slack... I've been in rehab.  Not that I wanted to be in rehab or anything... but at a certain point the law sort of orders you into rehab (or else).<br /><br />Nutshell = really good.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars though, not 5.  I did a little too much \\"skimming\\" over some parts to give it a full-blown-Moondonkey-hot-action 5.  The author did a good job describing things, but sometimes I just wanted to get back to the story and the dialogue.<br /><br />My only criticism is that some parts of Wool were like watching a Miss America contest.  The network tries to puff it up with stories and extra's, but you really just want to get past that stuff and get to the bikini part.<br /><br />In the end, I was impressed that the book didn't let me down by being predictable.  I kept thinking to myself that I knew what was going to happen and that it was going to suck if it did.  Well... that didn't happen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  I just can't rate this higher than some of the other books I've read in the last couple years - such as Ready Player One and Replay.  I also can't rate it as high as classic like Dune.  If Dune if a 5, then Wool really can't be a 5.  Well... I suppose maybe it could someday if the author expands the Wool \\"universe\\" some more.  It is not out of the question.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2/2012 - On second thought, I'm upgrading this book to a 5.  I find myself anxious for the next installment (Wool 7... I already read Wool 6).  I'm also inducting Wool in the Hall of Extra-Awesome.
0307474275|2.0|The following review is from my blog Cure My Writer's Block:<br /><br />  The publication of The DaVinci Code turned into a textbook version of a media circus. Specials on The Discovery Channel and History Channel tried to dive into its secrets and accuracy or inaccuracy. Churches put out press releases about their opinions regarding the novel's claims. A movie was made with superstar Tom Hanks playing the main character, Robert Langdon. Taking the time to summarize the plot would be a waste of time. Therefore, we will go straight into the review.<br />  Dan Brown has put together one heck of a gripping concept with The DaVinci Code. Secret societies, high-level plots, murder, intrigue, and discoveries that could change the face or history as we know it are all thoroughly researched and described in detail. Brown's research was meticulous and his logic compelling.<br />  Having said all of this, I must say that I didn't like this novel. Dan Brown has taken a very complex theory and made it more complex through his storytelling and characters. My copy of The DaVinci Code is 454 pages long, and it probably could have been 300 pages and told the same tale. His explanations begin to become overly complicated and oftentimes monotonous (if I had to read the words \\"Sacred Feminine\\" one more time, I might have had a book-burning!). In fact, his characters seem to turn into conspiracy theorists, seeing \\"signs\\" everywhere they look. Dan Brown also seems to display a distinct dislike for the Catholic Church. Hey, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but that doesn't mean I have to appreciate them.<br />  The DaVinci Code would have made a compelling scholarly work, and it could have made an even better novel except for the problems that I just mentioned. Am I being fair? Probably not. However, when you hear how a novel is the greatest thing since sliced bread, you have higher standards for it. I very rarely say this, but I think most people would be better off just watching the movie.<br /><br />Christopher Slater<br />author of Trapped in Shades of Greythe movie.<br /><br />Christopher Slater<br />author of Trapped in Shades of Grey
B002G7N6TC|5.0|My daughter's daycare had this book and she was constantly looking at it so we got a copy of our own.  Very cute story.  My daughter enjoys the rhymes and the different animals on each page.  The illustrations are beautiful.  The book is a cardboard book and very sturdy for toddlers and is a great size for little hands.  She loves the word llama and will go around the house saying, \\"Mama Llama!!\\"

B007CKNX28|3.0|I like every single Stripes' album, the exception being Icky Thump. I could never pinpoint what I liked about it... it just didn't feel like a White Stripes album. That feeling of... not quite right... carries over into Jack's first solo album. There are a few good songs on here but for the most part... not quite right. It feels really forced. It sounds like one long, boring song that is broken up by the occasional good song. I've listened to this album at least two dozen times and I have a harder time putting on each time. I hope the next one, if there is one, gets the ol' Jack back.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three books in 3 days straight. A book a day :) I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I was TIED UP (HEEHEE) in the well written story line. It was written in such a way that it mentally and physically put me in the book. It is not often that I laugh and cry and mourn for characters in books, but this one had me completly invold... AND I LOVED IT!!! This is a deff. must have. You will not be dissappointed, trust me.

B005J4TLN4|3.0|I've always loved science fiction movies.  I especially enjoy watching the modern day alien movies.  Though I somewhat enjoyed Attack the Block, I didn't understand it fully until watching midways through the movie and watching viewing the special features. The other issue I  had was that I normally watch movies on my playstation 2 which is in the livingroom. This DVD does not play on my PS2, only on my DVD player.
B004V5QWU2|4.0|Shortly after getting my Kindle Fire, I went looking for apps. And while I have some 'fun' ones, I stumbled across 'Sleepy Time'.<br /><br />As a chronic insomniac, I was intrigued and it didn't cost much, so I got it. I'm now calling this one of the best buys of 2012 for me. The customizing of sounds makes this personalized and I can create different ambient moods every time. I can control the sound level of up to three different sounds. And the selection of different sounds is amazing. I can even adjust the length of time for my created sounds to play. And when time is up, the sound fades away; it doesn't just stop. For a very light sleeper who can wake up over the slightest change, this is a well-thought of detail.<br /><br />I'm falling asleep much quicker. I have 'Sleepy Time' set to play for an hour before turning off. I bet I could set it for less because I NEVER hear it end. I'm lulled to sleep quickly and stay asleep longer. This app can also be perfect for just quiet ambiance sound during study, reading, etc.<br /><br />Only one small glitch, sometimes when I want to change sounds and add in a new one to my library of sounds, occasionally, the program will not respond to my request. That's the only reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5.
B007Y36K46|5.0|My children and I loved this movie. My son watches it at least once a week. I don't know why this movie didn't do well at the theaters. Everyone I know that has seen it really enjoyed it. I doubt there will be a sequel but at least I can have my kids read the books.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs was a very complicated character- infuriating a lot of the time and absolutely charming at others.  Walter Isaacson brings this out beautifully in his book . It is hard to think that he could have written so extensively with only 40 interviews over two years, but he obviously did speak to other  did speak to others around Jobs too.  The book is as entertaining s any novel, and illuminating too.

B001RHOJSE|4.0|While I do not agree with all of Arendt's positions or arguments, this is an important work from both journalistic and philosophical viewpoints.  While the reader expecting to understand Eichmann to the same degree that a reader of [[ASIN:0679768122 Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth]] will come to understand Speer (which is not surprising given Arendt's lack of first-hand access to Eichmann) will be disappointed, the reader is still left with a vivid impression of Eichmann's 'ordinariness' and 'thoughtlessness' rather than an inaccurate picture of a sadistic genius.  As an account of the trial, I find Arendt's account of the flaws in both prosecution and defence cases and the essentially fair-minded and objective conduct of the presiding judges in an (justifiably) emotionally-charged environment convincing and compelling.<br /><br />It appears, however, that Arendt could not completely make up her mind as to whether this trial should have been a narrowly-focused prosecution of Eichmann alone (a position which informs her best criticisms of the conduct of the trial) or a wider inquest into the Holocaust as a whole (which seems to shape her searching questions on the role of Jewish leadership and the relative lack or organised resistance).  Her views on the appropriateness of an Israeli court hearing the charges against Eichmann as opposed to an (at the time non-existent) international tribunal appear - from today's perspective, where almost a generation after the end of the Cold War the International Criminal Court is still of limited influence and effectiveness in trying cases of this nature. her arguments on this issue reminded me of Orwell's observations on HG Wells utopian plea to remove airpower from the hands of nation-states in the 1930's in ('Wells, Hitler and the World State', in [[ASIN:B005EJAS54 Fifty Orwell Essays [linked table of contents]]]) - whatever their merits, there was little prospect of at her proposals being adopted to deliver a satisfactory outcome.  In her postscript, (written some time after the original draft), Arendt  observes that states may at times be compelled to commit actions that can be regarded as 'criminal' to ensure the survival of lawfulness - I would suggest that submitting Eichmann to trial in Jerusalem (and for that matter, the trials of the Nazi leadership at Nuremberg) met that description, and at least secured appropriate outcomes even if not representative of the most desirable legal process.<br /><br />Perhaps the true lesson of Eichmann's trial and Arendt's account is not that evil is always banal, but that as Arendt states 'Justice, but not mercy, is a matter of judgement\\", and that civilised and decent people need to be prepared to stand in judgement of evil (and even better, continue to debate exactly what a more perfect justice should look like) rather than follow the temptation of simply granting 'mercy' as a means of dealing with the unthinkable.outcome.

B000MQC9H4|4.0|This big Hollywood romantic comedy is a real throwback to the golden age when they made these kinds of gushy films, replete with a setting around Christmas, as if the romantic emotions weren't enough of a hook. The four leads all do well, but it's a little jarring to see portly Jack Black trying to play a romantic leading man against Jude Law. Still, Black really ain't half bad here. The swelling music contributes to the overall throwback feel. They even throw in a dose of Hollywood self-glorification with Eli Wallach as the 90-year-old screenwriter rescued from oblivion by an adoring Kate Winslett. We must endure her in the throes of worship for the old films the old codger wrote. Ick. Get over yourself, Hollywood. My main quibble is that it drags on for 2 hours 15 minutes when it could easily have been cut to 90 and been a more taut work.
B005LAIGF0|4.0|A complex, difficult, amazing film with a convoluted history, Kenneth Lonergan's \\"Margaret\\" came and went, appeared, disappeared, was brought back long enough to garner more than 50 places on 2011's top-ten lists. But, other than enthusiastic critics, audiences were miniscule.<br /><br />To remedy that, the San Francisco Film Society ([...]) brought \\"Margaret\\" to the SFFS Cinema back in February, when I saw this challenging film of great artistic value.<br /><br />\\"Margaret\\" is living proof that the \\"thumbs up/down\\" school of reporting is idiotic at best. Not even the many arms of Lord Ganesh are sufficient here.<br /><br />On one hand, it's a 2 1/2-hour meditation on teenage angst, self-absorption, hysterics, and barely suppressed urge to cause harm. On the other hand, \\"Margaret\\" is a compulsive, engrossing, illuminating film.<br /><br />You may see it as an anguished tug-of-war between taking responsibility or being sucked into the bottomless hole of obsession. Or, the film can be seen as a landmark drama about the irresistible pull of a thoroughly unsympathetic, unlikeable character, not seen on the screen since John Cassavetes' sport with Gena Rowlands.<br /><br />If you think a Manhattan teenager cannot match the repulsion of Richard III, let Anna Paquin in the leading role change your mind. (Among the film's complications: Paquin is Lisa, not the title role; there is no character in the film named Margaret, but if you pay close attention to a class about poetry, you'll understand.)<br /><br />So now, we come to the task even more onerous than the business with thumbs: \\"what is it about?\\"<br /><br />\\"Margaret\\" is about Paquin's smart, affluent, confused teenager (and she is that, even if she was already 23 when the film was made in 2005) being involved in a fatal street accident. There - isn't that helpful? Not really, in view of the parade of characters and situations that follow.<br /><br />That parade, by the way, is an impressive list of names: J. Smith-Cameron as Lisa's mother, Matt Damon and Matthew Broderick among her teachers, Kieran Culkin and a bunch of young Turks among her classmates; also Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, and others, but from the moment she first appears, Jeannie Berlin makes everybody recede into the background.<br /><br />Apparently, a main reason for \\"Margaret\\" being held up for five-six years was Lonergan's refusal to cut the original three-hour running time. Now that a half hour of that is gone (and there are visible clumsy cuts), the film is still too long.<br /><br />Thumbs cannot express the difference between holding a film in high esteem and faulting the director for lack of discipline. So, on one hand, it tries the viewer's patience, but on the other, as Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Susan Graham sing \\"The Tales of Hoffmann\\" Barcarolle in the Met for the film's finale, you experience the conflict's partial, tentative resolution more fully than if it was the \\"right length.\\"r teachers, Kieran Culkin and a bunch of young Turks among her classmates; also Mark Ruffalo, Jean Reno, and others, but from the moment she first appears, Jeannie Berlin makes everybody recede into the background.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|There are definitely parts of this that make you feel like you're reading another trendy vampire love story, but it really does a great job of drawing you in and I loved it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the book--a good continuation of The Hunger Games.  I think it is well written and interesting.  I would recommend this for individual or book club reading.
B00846REIS|5.0|I would have to agree.  It is more intense than 50 shades.  Written really well too.  I found the story much deeper and intense then 50 shades.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|Love the writting, the description of the developing romance between Lena and Julian. How Julian opens hin heart and life and finds trust in feelings. Worth reading!!!
0307200477|1.0|I bought the plastic version, not realizing that that meant it was VERY cheap.  Everyone knows that a baby wants to grab/touch (isn't that the point of the book?) but this book doesn't hold up to that.  We JUST got it today and it was read once and the binding has torn and looks horrible. The bunny came off in large pieces...ahhhh.. not what I want to happen when my baby touches it and puts it to his face.  Also the mirror is horrible- he put it to his face but u can't even see clearly in it- puke.  Speaking of puke....the perfume smell is horrible.  I wonder if the hard cover is as bad?  I quess I will never know.  Cute concept, but poor construction.
B005I548B4|4.0|Very  intimate love story, full of past memories and random choices, and their consecuences. A look of life outcomes when you grow up.
B001HC8516|5.0|I am married, happily, to a guy that by all counts in this book is totally into me. That, first of all, is reassuring.<br /><br />I did not, however, come out of the womb happily married (duh) and TOTALLY wish that I had owned this book when I was single. Not to have AVOIDED dating the men that I did, because I think my whole life brought me to where I am today, but to stop myself from blaming myself when a guy didn't call because he was just not that into me.<br /><br />I think men should read this book too because if, as some reviewers have mentioned, one really IS so shy that he doesn't approach a woman, he should know that this is oozing the signal \\"I'm just not that into you.\\" Cause he is. Guys, if you want to be with her, \\"Hi.\\" is a great way to start. I'm pretty sure that is what started the first conversation my husband and I had, six years ago. It also started all of the other relationships I have ever had. \\"Hi\\" works wonders.<br /><br />But I digress. The book was well written and I was laughing out loud at the snark, wit and fun. The light manner in which it was written in no way detracts from the reality of the messages. It is an enhancement and in my opinion, helps soften the blow to the ego that one receives with such a realization. Laughing about it is in my opinion, better than crying about it. I again say that I wish I had had this to read when I was dating and am glad that my single friends DO!
0307951529|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have a copy of The $100 Startup fall into my hands just when I really needed it - divine intervention, I guess.  This wonderful, practical book has kickstarted me - and, through me, some of my friends - into action that's been long overdue.  The message is that we can all do what we want and need to in this world, that being beholden to 'The Man' is not longer a requirement for financial stability.  We can all be as radical as we want to be without being irresponsible in any way and that's incredibly liberating.  A gem of a book!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Lots of reviewers are reporting freezes or blank screen issues but I never had a problem.  I love this game and found it to be an excellent value.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|In this album Linkin Park continues to evolve and try out new and interesting things. Living Things has a similiar sound to their last album \\"A Thousand Suns\\". There's a mix of rock, rap, electronica, and lots of other cool sounds.<br /><br />Those that loved Hybrid Theory and Meteroa may not care for this new entry. That said, I grew up listening to Hybrid Theory and loved it. I was skeptical at first when they started going away from the hard rock. But as time has gone on, I've changed as a person and grown to appriciate all the new sounds. The more I listen to this and A Thousand Suns, the more I love their new sound.<br /><br />This is a awesome addition to their other great albums!
B00338QENI|3.0|A friend raved about this book saying she couldnt put it down. I was disappointed that it didnt live up to this hype, although it was very interesting to learn the story of Henrietta Lacks. I think her story is an important one to get out and make people aware of. I really enjoyed the historical and medical part of the book about Henrietta. The last third of the book or so is about the author's interaction with Henrietta's children and siblings as she researched and wrote the book. I found this part was hard to get through as I lost interest. Overall a pretty good read with some slow parts.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best app for my android, ipad and kindle.  free translations, easy to use, reminders, notes, audio...It is one of the first app on any new device I own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is toatally impeccable because it is never to hard or to easy.It has so, so, so, many really fun gsmes.
1439148953|1.0|I can't believe I wasted my time with this novel, I kept expecting something interesting would happen the main character didn't seem to have any depth she just went along with life and for a time when life would have been very difficult early years after the war she seemed to move through living fairly easy, everything came into place very easily. except when she had to make a decision at the end.  There could have been a very interesting character in the priest (why was he so helpful?). I am really glad it only cost me 1 cent not sure why but maybe I have an idea.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games and the challenges you get doing the games! I can't wait to play the other ones!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|All I can say is WOW...  I tend to do a lot of research before I purchase and my expectations where high.  This flashlight meets all of my expectations and then some...<br /><br />Cutting to the chase:  If you've come this far, you've already justified the $$$ in your mind.  Go for it, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Packaging<br />The manufacturers packaging is of good quality.  The light comes in a durable, protective plastic carrying and storage case.  Obvious they take pride in their products want to encourage the consumer to take good care of them.<br /><br />Flashlight Durability<br />Very sturdy and great job on the machining.  This thing should last years.  Also, it has a two year warranty which is nice.<br /><br />Batteries<br />8 AA Batteries.  I'm running NiMH Sanyo Enerloops.  They work great.  Haven't tried Alkaline or Lithium batteries and probably won't unless I have some sort of emergency.<br /><br />Usage<br />Easy to use.  Has two buttons.  One is an On/Off and the other cycles through the brightness modes.  A quick double-click of the on/off flips it into Strobe mode.<br /><br />Brightness<br />Very few people actually NEED a flashlight this bright.  Perfect, I'll take one.  Four modes seems about right.  The first two modes will be just fine for a nighttime walk.  High is very bright and will get anyone's attention.  The turbo mode is incredibly bright.  To put it in perspective, I can see the beam on a brick wall 100 ft away in the middle of the day.<br /><br />Strobe<br />Strobe modes are good. Mode one will keep you from getting run over in an emergency.  Certainly it will get someone's attention and won't blind them in the process.  Mode two is obnoxious (I say that in a positive way).  You know what those Police Cruiser lightbar \\"Takedown Lights\\" look like on the highway?  The \\"Safety\\" lights that are so bright you almost crash into the police car as you drive by because you are blind...  The strobe is something like that...<br /><br />Conclusion<br />If you need a solid flashlight with plenty of power and have ~ $120 to spare - Stop reading and go buy one.
B000UR9TPK|5.0|Super fast shipping, awesome blu ray. I was blown away by the band. Rock on Jimmy!!!!!!!!!!<br />Sounds great loud!! Will watch again and again
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|This game's ok if you're someone who likes \\"searching\\" games, but I found the \\"conversations\\" between the main characters to be tedious and not really helpful to the game.  It was ok.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can hardly improve on the previous reviews that detail the lack of believeable characters and depth; the writing truly is that of an adolescent girl.  The best thing about this book is the marketing...one thing that I must add is that I feel completely ripped off...this is not a complete story...it is no more than a badly written prologue, and the publisher and author are counting on the public buying the remaining two \\"books\\" of the trilogy to get the story...imagine if Wuthering Heights was written in three parts!  Tolstoy, Capote, Vaughn, Steinbeck...all gave us the story in one book...this marketing trap is a disgrace and I, for one, will not put one more penny into this scam!
006088732X|5.0|there is only one word for how much i loved this book it was awesome the book follows 4 girls aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna and each chapter goes into each of the girls lives through out the book i loved aria and Emily's story the best i loved how Emily was falling for Maya and how aria was falling for Ezra i loved when each girl got a new text or note from A it was intense and the suspense and thriller never stopped i am so happy i read this book next it was so amazing i highly recommend this book 5/5 outstanding book....
0345803493|3.0|(I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.)<br />This is the second book in the `Fifty Shades' trilogy. ** Warning - unavoidable spoilers for book 1 - Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />So, at the end of fifty shades - Ana leaves Christian, even though she tells him she loves him, because he has spanked her as hard as he ever would, and she knows that she can't live with that; they are just incompatible.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, it doesn't take long for them to get back together again, only this time Christian tells her that he wants her as she is, rather than as a submissive. He says he needs her more than he needs his kinky exploits.<br /><br />As with the last book, there are a lot of sex scenes in this book, but this book has a couple of other storylines too - the main one concerning an ex-sub of Christians - Leila, who seems to be having some sort of mental breakdown.<br /><br />If I'm honest I have very mixed feelings about this book. I really enjoyed the first book, and a friend told me that this one was better, so maybe my expectations were just too high, either way, I definitely didn't think that this was better than the first one. For a start the love scenes just felt like they had been cut and pasted from the first book, and other things started to get very repetitive too - Ana's inner goddess and her opinions, and Ana constantly being angry over one thing or another.<br /><br />This book was much more `Mills and Boon' than the previous one, and similarly very long! I'm sure loads of people will love this book, but for me, although I found some parts interesting, it was generally just a bit too repetitive for me, I constantly felt like I had somehow gone backwards in time and was re-reading parts that I had already read.<br />I also found some parts of the book laughable - Christian's never ending supply of condoms that he pulled from his pockets everywhere and anywhere like a prophylactic magician, and Ana's finding having herhair washed a sensual act and `groaning in appreciation'  - I mean what does she do at the hair dressers?<br />I definitely need a break from this before starting the third and final book, and I have to say that if I didn't already own the third book, I would not be buying it after reading this! Hopefully the third book will redeem this series for me.<br />6 out of 10.<br />(Book Length: 7853 kindle locations)
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe this is a best-seller. Honestly, I can't believe it ever made it to print. Read Kushiel's Dart instead.<br />It is very badly written, repetetive, poorly edited (if edited at all), boring ... the only thing I can think of, is that this was written by an illiterate for illiterates. It shows badly on our world and our education system that it is a best-seller. I suspect there is a higher literacy rate among the feral cat colony outside than among her readership. Still, she is laughing all the way to the bank, isn't she?<br />There are enough reviews that give details. I just want to cast a surprisingly minority vote for absolutely awful. I admit, I couldn't finish it. I did try, but this is god-awful.<br />I really don't get the appeal of badly-written, soccer-mom porn.<br />I'm going to feed the cats now. The back of the can of cat food is better-written than this.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|this is one of the greatest robot movies ever created.  it is about a robot that comes to life.  he changes his name to Johnny 5.  Johnny 5 can read a book when he turns the pages fast like when a person would skim for something.  fast reader.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|These books are the worst books in the history of literature.  It is extremely irresponsible of the media to give this book so much hype.  The book glamorizes the abuse of women in a major way.  The main character is controlling, abusive, and a stalker.  I feel extremely sorry for any abused woman who reads this book.  The book reinforces the myth that the more a man abuses and controls a woman, the more he loves her.<br /><br />This book has set women back 50 years.  In addition to the poor message the book gives, it is repetitive & poorly written.  The characters are unrealistic and unbelievable.  There are only so many sex scenarios you can read about before they start getting boring.  We get it---they had a lot of sex.<br /><br />SHAME ON THE MEDIA--SHAME ON ANYONE WHO PRMOTES THIS TRASH!!
B000002H1T|5.0|this is the good stuff from the 80's.  this is my second CD from the cars.  on this CD this has the songs i refuse, drive, looking for love and other classics.
0345803485|1.0|This book is pure trash.  The so called love story is nothing more than a poorly written, overly advertised, much-to-do-about-nothing porno.  I apologize--that is an insult to the pornography industry.  You would find much more realistic characters and a much better love story in a cheap boot-legged porno.<br /><br />I am BEGGING--anyone who has not yet bought this book Please save your money.  If you want a good laugh then borrow the book from a friend.  The characters are caricatures of humans that certainly could not exist in reality.  The love scenes are absurd and improbable.  So if you want a good hardy laugh read this book.  It is truly a joke!!
B00005LK95|5.0|in this movie Johnny 5 becomes golden at the way end.  this is as good as the first my opinion. FUNNY FUNNY.
0345803493|1.0|The second book in the trilogy is much better than books 1 & 3.  I still would advise customers to save their money.  I have been an avid reader my whole life and this is one of the worst book series of read.  I am slightly insulted when these books are compared to the Twilight series.  The Twilight series had a plot and was actually and surprisingly a very good read.<br /><br />These books are very poorly written.  The book is very repetitive.  You can pretty much guess how each chapter will go down.  There will be several fights, and several sex scenes per chapter.  The characters will have at least 3-5 climaxes per chapter.  It is the same thing over and over and its a waste of time.<br /><br />There are many books out there that are much more worthy of the popularity and press that this literary parody has received.<br /><br />Bottom line--learn from my mistake.  Please don't waste your money.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game with tons of stuff to do and buy whenever your heart feels. the need too.. that's it I think
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a very good book. I will be reading the other two books. I have read more sex phrases in other books.

0345529057|5.0|well \\"a song of ice and fire\\" are probably the best fantasy books ever nothing more to say.<br />the writing is a bit small but it's O.K

B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Entertaining and a great way to pass the time. The only thing I don't like is the expiring energy. Other than that it's pretty cool.

B004UID2LC|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. Easy to use and so much to find and watch on it.  I Eben found video clips of places I have lived and viited over the years. Saved a lot of music off of the videos also.
1401232590|5.0|By far, Batman the Long Halloween is my favorite Batman story. It's tight and compelling story kept me reading the moment I started. Batman Year One was what got me started reading Batman comics, but The Long Halloween was what made me hooked. An amazing detective story set at the beginning of Batman's career, it expands on Millers take of Batman from Year One. I would dare say, perfecting it. The art by Tim Sale is absolutely gorgeous as well as surreal. The way the Joker is artistically portrayed, with his massively long teeth to accentuate his smile is deeply memorable. Overall, Batman the Long Halloween to me is the best a Batman story can be. For every fan of Batman and comics in general, this is a must read in my opinion.
0345803485|5.0|so i have read all of the fifty shades of grey books the first 2 of the series are my favorite i know most people love the book or atleast the ones i know that have read it but there are many that dislike it and they always say for the same reasons and that is its repetitive i have to agree by the third book it is so much sex you skip those parts but the love story between anna and christian is what i read for and the story between them stay to the point where i consistantly turning the page if you like an easy read where rough sex and dirty banter are the guilty pleasure of the day (which i do) READ THIS BOOK
B0013O123Q|1.0|Very possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.<br />Nothing about this movie was good.<br />It took absolutely no talent at all  to make this movie.<br />No talent in writing.<br />No talent in acting.<br />No talent in directing.<br />No talent in camera work.<br />No talent in costume.<br />No talent in casting.<br />etc.
034580404X|5.0|Starting reading this trilogy and could not put it down.  Mr. Grey holds the answer to our wildest romantic fantasies.  E.L. James is quite the author and I hope she writes more along these lines.  Great escapism and far better than the norm!  :)
B00845PRDS|4.0|The movie was good. The acting OK. Lots of action. Watched it with a Navy guy and he filled in some gaps.
B007CEWR62|4.0|It must be said that once I heard Secret Garden music, I had to download several albums. I think Winter Poem has become my favorite. See the other reviews I wrote because they apply to every one I've heard. I find their music so close to perfect when I want to relax or be inspired in order to do my creative work that I keep going back to it every day at some point. Do yourself a favor and listen to one or two pieces. If it strikes you as it did me, it's a very affordable choice. And worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is kindda fun when my friend told me about this game I said sure I'll try so I found the game tried it out and I like it now I can ply with my friends!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh my goodness!!!!  Where do I start this book was so tantalizing I don't know what to say Mr.Grey is so dreamy and so interesting I've read all 3 book so if your having doubts please read the book first because if I would have listened to the other reviews I would not have purchased this book ...so get your copy now u will not regret it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! I can't get enough of it! I recently finished the series. Collins is very imaginitive! I recommend this to anyone who loves to read!
0345803485|1.0|This is the same old, same old.  The lead male is portrayed as a \\"mental defective\\" and the lead female is to \\"save\\" him.  It'd be really nice not to have negative stereotypes constantly replayed in the media.  It's sad that something of this caliber went viral and everyone who's reading it \\"just to say I read it because of all the hype\\" is getting a jaded story that doesn't reflect the normal reality of relationships such as this.

B0086700CM|4.0|this game makes u think about what you are doing bit after a while it comes naturly. its basted off of an Indiana Johns movie Im sure.
0380789019|5.0|I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. My only real criticism of the book was that I found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which I loved) to be a touch predictable. Really there was only one of two ways it could go, so I suppose that was unavoidable. BUT, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). The writing was stellar, as you would expect from Gaiman, and the story was quite original. It's like he mashed up The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, put it underneath modern day London, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. I absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. So well done, sir. Well done indeed.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I had just recently purchased the Biggest Looser: Boot Camp but I wasn't getting the results I needed my goal is to shed 20 pounds to be 125lbs. ! and let me just say the first 2 weeks with TDS I already lost five inches around my stomach and 4 pounds ! I love the feeling my arms legs and stomach is getting stronger and I feel it, I am usually not a big sweater but boy does this make me break a sweat and I love it because I know its working ! I can't wait to reach level 3. Since I loved the results the first 2 weeks i'm on my 3 week and I have been doing level 2 in the mornings and in the afternoon level 1 to see even more results and of course cut back on a lot of un-needed carbs and fats. I hope to be loosing even more weight and dropping the inches ! I totally recommend it for any one !! TRY it !!! you will see results if you commit to it ! The talking really bores me so i silence the dvd and blast some of my favorite music while doing it and it goes by faster and funner! DOOOOO IT ! :)))

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read all three books in the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  I originally started reading them just to see what the hype was all about.  These storylines went places I have never been in terms of bondage and S&M.  The books were filled with sex scenes and bondage, etc.,; but after awhile that gets tiring if there isn't a good storyline.  The second book in the series actually had the best plot which is why I continued on to the third book.  I did want to know how the story ended.  The third book:  Fifty Shades Freed was a complete waste of money.  It was so poorly written, rambled all over, and was shameless in the fact that it was so obviously thrown together just to make another dollar.<br /><br />While I will say I enjoyed the first two books, I cannot rave about them as some have done.  This is basically \\"romance novel\\" reading, spiced up with S&M and bondage, bordering somewhat on soft porn.  Ladies whom I have spoken with have told me that they were too embarrassed to let anyone know they were reading the books.  Some ladies in our Book Group were reading it or planned to, but it certainly was not a book club selection.<br /><br />This is not great writing - even in books one and two, simply sex scenes thrown together with somewhat of a plot.  If you like those types of books, I would recommend the first and second, but don't waste your money on the third book - just ask someone how the storyline ended.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|I took a chance on this title because I was looking for something different in the fantasy genre and Joe Abercrombie was an author I wasn't familiar with.  Having just finished it, I definitely liked it, and I just purchased the second book in this series, \\"Before They Are Hanged\\" and look forward to reading it right away.<br /><br />This is a pretty intense story with just some minor problems, the first of which is that there are entirely too many prominent characters.  There are essentially at least five or six protagonists, along with about as many sophisticated supporting characters, and while each one is artfully developed and none are neglected, what happens is the reader starts to feel pulled in a bunch of different directions.  From chapter to chapter (and sometimes even within a single chapter) the constant shifting from one point of view to another gets a little dizzying.<br /><br />The other problem is that this book clearly cannot stand on its own - it's part of a trilogy, and requires the subsequent books because the ending of \\"The Blade Itself\\" is abrupt and a total cliffhanger (in the sense that the narrative ends in the midst of furious action with no resolution, not necessarily that it's suspenseful).  Most volumes in a fantasy series usually have a self-contained story, as well as having a place in the overarching narrative of the series.  This book, however, seems to be a much longer novel that was just cut into three pieces at convenient stopping points.<br /><br />What I like about it so far is that, for the most part, it avoids getting lost in typical fantasy stereotypes, and the characters are each different and interesting in their own ways.  It's also interesting that when the point of view switches, the entire writing style shifts to one in keeping with that character's personality and background.  The story has some familiar themes, but is full of intrigues and surprising twists and turns that make it fresh and enjoyable.  Some of the deeper background material explaining the setting and the characters' motivations is slow to emerge, so the reader sometimes lacks context which might or might not be filled in or explained later on, but this is not a terrible handicap to what is an otherwise brilliant tale.er background material explaining the setting and the characters' motivations is slow to emerge, so the reader sometimes lacks context which might or might not be filled in or explained later on, but this is not a terrible handicap to what is an otherwise brilliant tale.

B006RUJST6|5.0|This review was first posted on Kids Corner @ Kindle Nation Daily.\\"<br /><br />Review - A...M...A...Z...I...N...G!!!!  5 stars!!!  7th grade and up.<br />If you like poetry, you have to read this book!  Not rhyming poetry but true to your thoughts and feelings poetry!!  It is hard to give a good review for this book because it would tell you all the spoilers!!  That is not right to tell you what is about to happen...SO, just believe me when I say \\"READ THIS BOOK!\\"<br /><br />Layken has moved from Texas with her mom and brother after her dad dies.  She is trying to be an adult and help take care of her mom and brother but she is still having a hard time getting used to being without her dad.  She was a daddy's girl and she misses him terribly.  She meets Will and they both instantly fall in \\"like\\" with each other.  He is totally into something called Slam Poetry and takes her to see a contest where she gets to see him perform.  It makes her like him even more!!  BUT then ...oops...can't tell you what happens next!  BUT they cannot date! No Way!!  It made me think of Law and Order - Ripped from the Headlines because you see this on the news or hear about it pretty often.<br /><br />Educational value - 5 stars!!  (If the teacher does it right...not babyish) We write poetry in school and a lot of my friends do not like poetry...maybe if they read this book they would like poetry better.  It doesn't have to be \\"roses are red, violets are blue\\"  to be a poem.<br /><br />Entertaining - One word - DEFINITELY!!  5 stars!!!<br />I read it in 1 day!!  (In fact, I forgot to do the dishwasher and got in trouble - but it was worth it!)
B007HC3LHS|4.0|If you've ever wondered what it's like to have an obsessive compulsive disorder, this book will show you a view into that world. The author definitely did her research and had great reasoning's behind why Cathy does the things she does. Her compulsions are so believable that I couldn't imagine a world where she didn't do these things.<br /><br />At the start of the book I was confused as to what was going on as each chapter moves back and forth in time. With the name change from Catherine (in the past) to Cathy (in the future) I didn't catch that they were the same person for awhile. Maybe if I had read the synopsis of the book more recently I would have known that, but because I read a digital edition I didn't have that handy, and I like to be surprised when I'm reading.<br /><br />When I was getting close to the end I was hoping and hoping that the author wouldn't take the easy way out - and she didn't, so I was totally pleased. There are a number of hard to read parts to the book - the abuse Catherine suffers is torturous, but reading it is well worth getting into her mind and feelings.<br /><br />This book is 611 pages long, but so easy to read, it flew by without me knowing how long it really way. (I honestly just saw the page count as I was typing the review.) Haynes is an author I will keep an eye on!<br /><br />ARC reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B005CRQ2IU|1.0|How disappointing! I read the book in the 90's and was really excited to download it to my ipad but it was not to be... I purchased and then asked for a refund (4 times actually). It just gives a download error - and it's the only book that has given me this trouble... so obviously there's a problem here. Any chance of this being corrected in the near future?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy! Could not put it down! Kept the suspense and the sex! I wish there was more!!!
0671027344|5.0|this a great teen book that I'm sure anyone would enjoy. it follows the strange life of a boy named charlie and his friends. its interesting, captivating, and worth buying. (i only buy a book if i know I'm gonna read it again and again and again, and i bought this one so...)
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It's easy to use except I don't like how you have to click discard each time you view a frame and don't want to keep it, I'd rather be able to see all the frames on my picture one after the other and then hit apply when I find the one I want.
0425263908|4.0|For fans who have read Fifty Shades I definitly suggest you read Bared To You. It carries the emotions and issues that Fifty seemed to lack at times and is very well written. I was drawn into the characters within the first Chapter.<br /><br />Eva is a strong woman with a dark past that she fought and survived through. I felt every bit of emotion she did as I read through the book. Her interactions with Gideon as well as her roommate Cary had be laughing and wantings to cry. Everything about these characters make me want more. Wanting to know everything about their history.<br /><br />I didnt want to put this book down and was sad when it ended and cannot wait for Deeper In You to come out in October!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After only 3 chapters of this book I was ready to throw my kindle against the wall, but I felt that before I could legitimately give this book 1 star I had to finish it (I really did keep hoping it would get better).  Now that I've finished I can sincerely tell you to please not waste time or money reading this drivel.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers I was extremely annoyed with the repetition of words and phrases. I didn't think it was possible for someone to blush, flush and have their cheeks turn every color of red you can imagine, so often. Don't even get me started on the number of murmurs (197 times) and whispers (195 times) being done throughout the book.<br /><br />If I didn't know better I would swear this was written by a hormonal middle-school girl. I truly find it hard to believe that this is a bestseller and so many women are going crazy over this crappy book.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Originally, I put off seeing this film, and believe it or not, it wasn't because I was afraid it would have elements of paganism in it.  I just didn't like the visual look of the film, from what I'd seen of the trailers, nor did I like some of the casting choices (although Anthony Hopkins as Odin is -fantastic.-)<br /><br />Well, if I had been worried about paganism, I needn't have.  They make it quite clear in this movie that Thor is merely a long-lived alien being with very advanced technology.  In fact, they make it much more clear than in the comics of the same name, and none of the characters ever refer to themselves as \\"gods.\\"<br /><br />Thor is a vain and arrogant warrior, who's spoiling for a fight, even as he's about to be crowned the new king of Asgard.  However, he soon betrays the trust of his father, risking his life and the lives of all his people, and nearly causing a war.  Enraged, his father Odin takes away not only the crown, but his powers and royal station, casting him to Earth in anger, and placing an enchantment on Thor's hammer, so that only those who are worthy may pick it up and weild its power.<br /><br />A fair part of the movie takes place while Thor is de-powered and trying to get his hammer and powers back, or else adjusting to his new life as a human being.  However, in the end, (spoilers) he attempts to sacrifice himself for the people he cares about, and is deemed worthy to weild the hammer once again.<br /><br />One drawback of Thor spending most of the movie without any powers is that it's a bit difficult to tell, if you've never read about the character, just what his powers are, exactly.  This is helped by a big fight early in the film, and another couple of fights near the end, but these are sometimes shot from imperfect angles, or happen a little fast, and it can be difficult to keep track of what, precisely, is going on.<br /><br />However, I was stunned by just how Christian this movie is.  It's not just that it's not a paganstory.  This movie tells the story of mankind from the Christian point of view.  Mortal man begins as a beloved son; an heir, and just as he comes into his inheritance, he makes a foolish decision, chooses to sin against his father, is cast out, and in the end, through self-sacrifice, virtue and the mercy of his father, he is admitted back into his birthright again, although some aren't so fortunate.<br /><br />That brings me to Loki; the villain.  I think he may be the best villain out of any of the movies that Marvel Studios has made.  He begins as not really evil, exactly, and even wanting to protect his kingdom, but as time goes on, and he discovers new things about himself and his people, he becomes desperate, and his good intentions begin taking him down a path of deep evil.  He's so much more complex than someone like the Iron Mongrel, who just wants cash, or Abomination, who's in it for a thrill and an ego trip.  Loki doesn't even go on a rampage, like so many of them do.  He has an evil plan, and he doesn't let on exactly what it is until almost the last second.<br /><br />In a way, I found it hard to get excited about the bad guy because of that last point.  It would be one thing if we understood what Loki was planning from the beginning, and knew what a nasty threat he was, but he doesn't make his evil plot very well understood until rather late in the film, which decreases the tension somewhat.<br /><br />There's a sort of interesting juxtaposition between Thor and Loki as the film progresses; Loki growing more evil and corrupt, and Thor learns the hard lessons that only real life can teach.  It's an interesting way to tell a story, and I was amazed by just how true it rang.<br /><br />I've been told by some that the romance between Thor and Jane Foster felt forced.  To this I reply \\"There was a romance?\\"  I mean, sure, they talk a lot, and they share a kiss at the end, but I wouldn't exactly call it a romance, since it's never terribly romantic, there's really nothing going on between the characters, and nothing of any substance comes of it.  Thor just came off as a decent guy who wanted to help her out, and he did.  That's all I think needs to be said about it.<br /><br />Finally, back to my initial point; by first worry; that the visual look and casting of the movie wasn't what I wanted it to be.  Was that as much of a problem as I thought it would be?<br /><br />Well, honestly, yes.<br /><br />I still don't think Chris Hemsworth is quite big enough to be Thor.  I still don't think Heimdall should have been black.  I still don't think Volstagg was -anywhere near- big enough.  Most importantly, I don't think the technology of Asgard should have looked quite as much like technology as it did.<br /><br />The moment Thor says \\"your ancestors called it magic, you call it science,\\" I groan.  As much as I may dislike paganism, it's not nearly as much of a threat as it once was.  Secularism is.  I'm fine with them -saying- that Thor is not a god.  They don't need to imply that nothing truly miraculous exists.  These things bother me through nearly every visually-impressive scene in the film.<br /><br />In conclusion, I did like this film.  Rest assured, you won't be drawn into paganism by it, and it might even inspire you to think a little more about the values of love and sacrifice, which is always a good thing to think about.  I wish it had distanced itself a little more from modern, secular skepticism, but it was certainly a better film than I thought it would be.
1594203334|4.0|Very interesting book. It's not a parenting book, per se, but the differences between French and American parenting philosophies can definitely be instructive.<br /><br />The idea of children, as a rule, going to day care from the time they are babies so that mothers can still have their own life is definitely contrary to my idea of what parenting is all about. It was suggested that American stay-at-home mothers have a self-sacrificing attitude akin to masochism. As though the more difficult we make things for ourselves, the better parent we think we are. I prefer to think that I am sacrificing a few years of my personal time so that I can be the one to teach and parent my children rather than paying someone else to do it. (Or in the case of the French crèches, the government paying someone else to do it.)<br /><br />Other than that, I found quite a bit to admire about the philosophies presented in this book. I see quite a lot of what the French refer to as \\"l'enfant-roi,\\" or the \\"child-king\\" syndrome where the children seem to rule the roost. Evidently, that is very uncommon in France. Parents respect their children's sense of individuality without disturbing the balance of parental authority. I also loved that French children are taught to eat what the adults eat, not default to boxed macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets. I wish I'd read this book before dealing with sleep-training. The author claims that the vast majority of French babies sleep through the night by the time they're two or three months old simply because French parents don't immediately jump up at the slightest whimper, but instead \\"pause\\" before going to them to make sure they are really awake, thus teaching them to transition between sleep cycles. One other idea I liked is that French parents don't really use the word \\"discipline,\\" but instead refer to correcting their children's behavior as \\"educating\\" them.<br /><br />All in all, a very interesting book. I found myself sharing snippets with my husband every day I was reading it. Recommended.
B003UYV08E|1.0|This is easily one of the worst superhero films I've seen in my life.<br /><br />I love superheros, because they're tough guys (and girls) who try to do the right thing, no matter what.  They do mess up sometimes (like Spider-man did in the second movie,) but soon they're back on their feet, sobered and ready to make their commitment again.<br /><br />I have to admit, this is what I liked most about the first Iron Man movie.  I found flaws in it, but Tony's commitment to getting the job done and making amends for some of his past sins made the film a likable experience overall, even though the main character still has a lot of problems which he's yet to overcome.<br /><br />This film contains none of the atonement plot of the first.  Instead, Tony Stark, whose identity as Iron Man is now public knowledge, dances, sings, brags, drives fast cars, womanizes, gets drunk, tells bad jokes, gets sick, gets in trouble, has a brief falling-out with one of his friends, and generally makes himself a nuisance.  The character (an irritant in the first film) comes across as merely a spoiled, hyperactive man-child in this movie, and no real consequences are brought against him for it.  He's given what he needs to solve his problems, he solves his problems, and can go back to being a jerk.  Hooray?<br /><br />Probably the worst aspect of the film, however, are the villains.  There are two; a lousy, jealous weapons designer named Justin Hammer, who's even more hyper, spoiled and pop-culture-infused than the title character is, and a psychotic thug/mad scientist named Ivan Vanko, who never displays any dimensions to his character other than \\"be evil,\\" while paradoxically and insultingly wearing a cross and carrying what looks like a rosary.  Right.  As if I didn't have enough reasons to hate this film.<br /><br />Come to think of it, the two-villain MO; one a goofy, silly wisecracker, the other a power-mad psychopath, reminds me unpleasantly of Batman Forever.<br /><br />The main plot of this movie is a lot skinnier than in the past.  Evil bad guy has technology.  Evil bad guy attacks.  Evil bad guy loses.  The end.<br /><br />To compensate for this, they stick in about four subplots.  The first is about the government wanting to take control of Iron Man.  The second is about Tony getting close to death from the chemical in the battery he's been using for his Iron Man armor.  The third involves Shield keeping an eye on him.  Spoilers; none of these first three subplots goes anywhere.<br /><br />That brings us to subplot 4; the war machine armor being stolen by Tony's friend when he realizes that Tony is too big of a jerk to leave in sole possession of it.  This subplot goes somewhere, but only in terms of helping to set up a team-up between Iron Man and War Machine near the end of the film; a hero/sidekick team-up, which is reminiscent, again, of Batman Forever.<br /><br />I didn't mind the first film so much, in spite of its shallow villain, jerky main character and so forth, but this film really has nothing to offer.  Its weak points are just as weak as in the original, and the strengths of the first film are gone.  On top of that, it has a bunch of additional flaws and insulting lines and references that bring it down even more.  About the only good thing I can say about it is that it introduces the character of Black Widow, but even this is only of interest to people who know about the character already.  To everybody else, she'll probably come off as a knockoff of Trinity from the Matrix.<br /><br />I had some hope for superhero movies when Marvel started making their own.  After all, Hollywood superhero movies have always been hit or miss.  However, this movie just goes to show that even non-Hollywood superhero movies can still be utter train wrecks.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|This is a very nice camera bag. Initially, I was going to purchase the DCB-304, but after going to Wal-Mart and examining it's size, I'm glad that I purchased the larger of the two. I bought this bag for my Nikon-P510 and it fits well. The bag accomodates the camera either lense-down, or lense-up with about 2 inches of free space left between the camera and the top of the bag. That cushion comes in handy if/when the bag gets bumped or something is put on top of it (it happens).  The side pockets are deep and the zippers are strong.  If I needed to, I could put 2 spare batteries and a wall charger in one side, but I seperate them to prevent them from being damaged. All-in-all, I highly recommend this bag, especially if you've got a Digital SLR with a logn lenes (55-200MM or better).
0091936985|1.0|First, the good news - I only paid £1.50 for this book in a charity shop, so my hard-earned cash went to a good cause.<br /><br />Now, the bad news.  I wasted some of my life actually reading this book (my excuse is that I was camping at the time and it was raining).  I endorse the criticisms you can read in the other one and two star reviews.  Uninteresting, one-dimensional characters and a plot that's been done better many times over in other books.  I think another reviewer is right - this so-called thriller was written by an evil program that stole Mr Harris's identity.  Not only that, it hacked into a load of book reviewers' PCs and wrote glowing reviews!!<br /><br />Conclusion:  Next time, I'll put the £1.50 straight into the collection box.
B0011KQSZ4|2.0|British humor is very much hit or miss for me and this is one of those misses. It's all about the death of a patriarch that brings his friends and other contacts together in a goofy, mismatched farce. Slow beginning big time but if you absolutely love British humor, well, it might be worth it.<br /><br />I watched this one for close to an hour simply because it didn't require my full attention and I was surfing the Web. I know some people out there think you have to give 100% to a movie to properly grade it but that's a lot of rubbish and just goes to show some people cannot multitask, especially when watching a film that is average or lower.<br /><br />Peter Dinklage has a supporting role in this but he isn't anything like his Tyrion character so don't go in with expectations.<br /><br />The budget was $9M and it made a bit over $46M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good books but don't need that much the sex parts.  If the author removes some of the sex parts and develop more the characters it will be an excellent book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found the books very entertaining and enjoyed the plot resolution. The writing style was simple, obviously that of a non-professional writer. I liked that most of all because it gives hope to me, an aspiring writer. I like the fact that this was a topic that many find forbidden or untouchable and she wrote the books with no apologies. I enjoyed the read and will begin reading them again here in a few days.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|By and large the best app downloader on the Amazon Appstore. Is extremely effecient and has a multitude of options pertaining to downloads, which are very easy to start. Would be perfect if it was a bit more aesthetically pleasing and the videos contained the description upon download. Other than that, no complaints. Good job Devian.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I'm in fairly good shape and workout 5-6 times per week but want to lose 5 lbs, so I tried out this video on two separate occasions (did the first level day 1, 2nd level day two etc) and after the 3 days had dreadful knee pain which I never get with any of my other work outs (I do various strength training and cardio DVDs).<br />To make matters worse, I didn't find her workout particularly challenging.  I barely sweat at all and just when it was becoming a little challenging, the time was up on that segment, so never got to the point of having to push myself. I'm done going back to this video, a big disappointment overall!
0375703764|1.0|I heard this was a good read and after seeing the various positive reviews purchased and read House of Leaves.  I wish I hadn't.  This book is a snoozer that will, sooner or later, have you desperate to finish so you can read something else.<br /><br />The author tries to be cute with a format and structure that is unconventional, with unusual page layout and style. It contains copious footnotes, many of which contain footnotes themselves, and some of which reference books that do not exist. Some pages contain only a few words or lines of text, arranged in strange ways to mirror the events in the story- presumably in a failed attempt to create an agoraphobic and claustrophobic effect. The novel also has multiple narrators, who interact with each other throughout the story in disorienting ways.  Despite these efforts at originality, at the end of the day it's a tired story that goes nowhere- literally.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good story, don't look here. And if you do, don't pay full price!

0345803485|4.0|Okay, straight up, there was a definite need for some grammar and spell checks.<br /><br />Aside from that, the book was pretty good. I was very, very hesitant to read this series because of my intense loyalty to the BDB. I ended up caving, and I was completely wrapped up in it and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />About a month before I finally ordered this on my Kindle, I read the reviews. The reviews were horribbbllleee. Now that I've read the book, I came back and re-read the reviews to try and understand what folks were finding so awful about this book.<br /><br />I don't know about everyone else, but I like my books to be as real as possible. Aside from Christian being Mr. Moneybags, this book was exactly that. Maybe folks just don't like admitting how predictable and repetitive they actually are. I've read quite a few reviews ranting on the repetition of phrases and actions. Hello, people, we are all like that. We all have certain body languages and phrases that we repeat over and over and over and over. That's just real life.<br /><br />All in all, this book was very enjoyable and quite addictive, although it does pale in comparison to the BDB.
B002ZG997C|4.0|This movie turned out better than I thought it would and I really liked the ending... I won't ruin it for you though!<br /><br />I get that it's apocalyptic, however it was looking like it was made in black and white or along those lines. At times, I felt like it was putting some strain on my eyes. I had two different people come downstairs and ask if it was in black and white. We were watching it on a projector.<br /><br />I've been told there's a lot of biblical stuff in the movie, but as I am not versed in the bible, I was not able to discern anything. I am curious however to what some of it is and will probably do a quick research as it may help me 'get' the movie a little better.<br /><br />Another great Denzel movie worth watching again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Awesome game right here. They r so nice to me and it is a whole lot better than &quot;Fashion Story&quot; GET THIS GAME!!!
1577314808|5.0|Granted the book is a bit dry... However I still read it over and over. I also have it on my iPhone. The message is clear and simple. Live for now, not the past or the future. Stay positive and just BE..<br /><br />Live in the moment and what is happening in front of you. Don't stress out about what has happened in the past, or what may never happen in the future.<br /><br />This books talks about positive and negative energy. I used to be an extremely negative person and found myself always saying, \\"Man, I am such a jerk Magnet\\". It's amazing how after I have trained myself to be more positive, how few of the jerks I am subjected to. The book talks about energy, how two forces are attracted to each other like magnets.<br /><br />I was the person that constantly lived in the future. I would say to myself IF only I had more money, then I could have this and then I would be happy. The book touches on living and being here now. After putting into practice what Eckert talks about, I am always at peace and I don't stress out about pretty much nothing.<br /><br />I recommend reading it multiple times and also listening to it. Especially when you start to feel the pressures of life. It's zen like.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are written superbly. For someone who doesn't read romance novels this was a wonderful beginning.  There is a wonderful story behind the romance and it ther is something in the book that just about anyone can relate to.  Once you start reading you can't stop. Thank you for brooding my horizons. I look forward to other works but this author.
034580404X|3.0|Reading this series was like eating doritos: no nutritional value but addictive, junky, and I was embarrassed for having consumed the whole thing. I enjoyed the summer escape, and there is much much much to discuss with gal pals, around feminism, gender roles, childhood trauma, and the endless descriptions of unrealistic sex.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I've read many hundreds of sci-fi books over the past 25 years.  This book was a fantastic find!  The story was very original and compelling.  The writing was tight. The character development was great-I really cared about what would happen to Jules and I found myself cringing every time I thought Howley was going to \\"off\\" her.  At several points along the way I thought I had the \\"mystery\\" figured out but I was continually surprised.  Great book, I really think this will be a classic someday and I HIGHLY recommend this.  It would also be a great read for non-sci-fi fans because the story is so solid but not bogged down by complex science or technology which some people (my wife) can find distracting. I've never reviewed a Kindle book before but I thought this was so good that the author simply deserves the positive feedback.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|The movie \\"The Tourist\\" with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie is a great adventure and needs to be seen several times to appreciate the story.  I am very pleased to be able to own this DVD. It is a great film!
B001AQO3Z6|1.0|This is not a review of an Amazon product!<br />Koyaanisqatsi has been released on BluRay in Australia, and I bought it along with Powaqqatsi from a local retailer, having been very impressed with the quality of Baraka on BluRay.<br />However, this release is awful, possibly the worst quality BluRay that I own. I have no idea where the movie was sourced, but there is grain, dust and white spots on almost every frame. The image is maybe DVD quality for sharpness, but not up to BluRay standards. The disc was produced by a company called Umbrella Entertainment.<br />I lasted 10 minutes before ejecting the disc.<br /><br />Let's hope that a proper release of the movie is worth waiting for!
1416972250|5.0|City of Glass is third book in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare. This was supposed to be the last book in The Mortal Instruments Trilogy, but the author decided to extend the series three more books. In all honesty I'm glad that there's going to be more books because I'm kind of addicted to Jace Wayland the world of the shadowhunters!<br /><br />Clary has finally found out what needs to be done to save her mother, all she needs to do is travel to Alicante (home city of the shadowhunters). The problem is that some people... mainly Jace don't want her to go, so she's left behind. Clary then needs to find her own way to Alicante because she knows that she's one of the only ones who can save her mom, and well she finds her way there. Clary and the rest of the shadowhunters then find themselves in the midst of a war that might change everything.<br /><br />I really don't know what to say about this book that would properly explain how much I loved it. This was the longest book in the series, but I didn't notice because of how compelling the storyline was. There are a few new characters introduced, some casualties, and a whole lot of Jace/Clary frustration. The \\"final\\" battle in this book was epic, and we finally get some much needed answers! The character development in this book was great, everyone has grown so much since the first book.<br /><br />This was my favorite book in the series, and I can't wait to read the next book, City of Fallen Angels. I really want to wait and read the next two books until the final ones released, but I honestly don't think I have that much willpower. I figure I have four Cassandra Clare books on my bookshelf left to read, and I think I can make them last awhile.

0670023329|5.0|To think that in this day and age such atrocities still take place in this world, is disgusting. A fantastic account of the cruelty of a lunatic leader, of a country, that get's away with what he orders his people to do. My heart went out to the author; his life ruined by his experiences since birth. I still wonder why the the leader is still allowed to rule his country through fear and oppression. I could not put this book down.

B0044DEAUA|4.0|I wanted to get a bluetooth device for my car after my mom got a car with Bluetooth. It is SO much nicer than a piece in your year.<br /><br />I was unsure of what to buy, so I went with this \\"SuperTooth\\" after reading the reviews.<br /><br />It is a great little product. It does the job needed, and here are my full ideas of what works and what doesn't...<br /><br />Pros -<br />The Battery lasts a LONG time. I have had it unplugged for a long time, and I hardly use it. But it's great to know that I won't have to scramble to plug it in.<br /><br />It is LOUD. There is pretty much no way that you can't hear this.<br /><br />The Buttons are easy to use. On, off...voice control, etc. Not difficult!<br /><br />Cons/Suggestions.<br />I still am not sure I understand the colors for the battery. I plugged it in to charge it, and the colors aren't what I was expecting......but I haven't had it that long. Still getting accustomed!<br /><br />I am not a lover of the placement of the charging port. I would have preferred to have it on the front. That way, you can charge it while you use it. I have a hearing deficit on my right side, so I can't easily place it on my right. If it's on the left, I can't  plug it in. But, that isn't a total issue.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great little product...makes it all so much safer!
B003O86FMW|5.0|So easy to order from Amazon..and so reliable too.  Thank you, Amazon!<br />And, this book was ordered from my Kindle
B0076UXKDG|1.0|This battery grip is ridiculously overpriced.  There are a couple other aftermarket grips that work just as well.  It's not like you're gonna use the grip all the time, right?  Should be around 100 bucks.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I had to give it three stars because I cant rank it with the likes of Kill Em All. However I will say this is better than everything since the Black Album. And way better than Load and St Anger. They have really raised the bar for intensity and any metal fan can respect a band trying to go back to their roots. That being said...Im not so sure if Metallica can go back to the old days. I mean this is the return to form album by the former thrash metal pioneers? Lets be honest James is lacking in vocals but you can still listen to him. I will give Metallica props for their staying power. Some riffs are good. For example, the opening riff from The Day That Never Comes is pretty catchy. But its just time to face the facts they dont have it anymore like the old days. Ill stay with Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning. I still love the band, maybe it is a new direction for them and I respect a band that tries to evolve while incorporating their past into their present status. Overall, this doesn't stack up to RTL but it mught be on the same level as the Black Album in my opinion. Overall, a good album by one of the biggest bands of all time. Not spectacular, not breath taking but a good release. Its way better than other music out today.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed book two in the series. Was glad we got more of his childhood backround. Also Happy Ana still has a backbone and stands up for herself.Looking forward to book three.
B0002EXH40|4.0|Youthanasia is one of Megadeth's most underrated albums, period. The sixth release by Dave Mustaine and company is an instant classic in the post thrash world of metal. This album contains a major throwback to the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal, matched with a hard rock/post thrash era sound that makes this album both accesible and enjoyable. \\"Reckoning Day\\" starts off the album with some power. The riff is catchy and the drumming is good (being Nick Menza you shouldn't expect anything bad) This track has some nice leads and the solo is pretty good. \\"Train Of Consequences\\" Another now famous riff starts off one of their best tracks of all time. Dave's vocals are pretty average now. Not extremely high or whiny on Rust In Peace, but still resemble the Countdown to Extinction style. A few growls, and snarls here and there, overall still a little more high pitched than the previous album but still, they are classic Dave. Friedman's solo is nice here. \\"Addicted To Chaos\\" probably the best song on the album. Menza sets the standard with the nice drum intro, followed by a catchy heavy metal riff here and there. This track is an instant classic. \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" Great song. Chorus is catchy, and the lyrics are great. Much better than the one on United Abominations, the classic is always best. \\"Elysian Fields\\" picks up the intensity from the first tracks off the album. Lyrics are great and symbolic. The chorus might wear you down a bit, but overall, a good hard rock song. \\"Killing Road\\" starts with another catchy riff. Lyrics are about the tours the band goes on. Lyrically, there isn't much to go on, but it is a fun track. \\"Blood Of Heroes\\" Nice intro and then becomes a mid paced heavy metal Megadeth track. I really like Dave's vocals here. Friedman's solo is decent here so don't look for any Rust In Peace material here. \\"Family Tree\\" starts this album down a darker path. Lyrically, its about incest. Its dark, its haunting, the riff is catchy. Its nice to here Ellefson in this album for once. \\"Youthanasia\\" a good title track. Slower than the previous ones the chorus is iconic. \\"I Thought I Knew It All\\" probably the worst song on the album (compared to others on here) The chorus will wear you down, but the guitar work cancels that out. \\"Black Curtains\\" a powerful track with symbolic lyrics. A mid-paced beat propels us to, \\"Victory\\" One of the best songs EVER. If you can make a song from titles off of previous albums, you are a lyrical genius. An all out fun track.<br /><br />Overall, Youthansia is a winner. Depending on how well you revieved this album, it can easily be a five star album. In my opinion, better than Countdown To Extinction. Think heavy metal with a Megadeth overhaul and you get Youthanasia. Its fun, catchy, serious, and addictive. Its a different album for a different time. And in my opinion, a must have.this album for once. \\"Youthanasia\\" a good title track.

B0089GQB28|5.0|MARGARET is and has been a troubled movie - sophisticated examination of one girl's post-traumatic transformation as part of a larger point about how one's notion of importance is dwarfed by the larger worldview. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and shot in 2005 as a three-hour film, the movie has remained on the shelves since its completion in 2007 over legal problems and finally is available for viewing in a 150-minute version. Though it has flaws it contains some of the most sophisticated dialogue and philosophical points about where we are in our society today that the editing glitches become secondary background noise in a compelling film. The title (no one in the film is named Margaret) references the Gerald Manley Hopkins poem `Spring and Fall: to a young child' which is quoted at the top of this review.<br /><br />MARGARET focuses on a 17-year-old New York City high-school student Lisa (Anna Paquin) who feels certain that she inadvertently played a role in a traffic accident that has claimed a woman's life, Monica (Allison Janney): Lisa was chasing a bus whose driver Maretti (Mark Ruffalo) ran a red light because of Lisa's distraction trying to discover where the Maretti bought his cowboy hat. Monica dies in Lisa's arms while asking for her daughter also named Lisa (we later learn Monica's daughter died at age 12 from leukemia). Lisa at first feels sorry for Maretti, thinking that if she tells the truth Maretti will loose his job and his family support. Lisa's actress mother Joan (J. Smith-Cameron) encourages her to not give accurate testimony to the police, a decision Lisa follows and spends the rest of the film regretting, and in making attempts to set things right she meets with opposition at every step. Torn apart with frustration, she begins emotionally brutalizing her family, her friends, her teachers, and most of all, herself. She has been confronted quite unexpectedly with a basic truth: that her youthful ideals are on a collision course against the realities and compromises of the adult world.<br /><br />The world that Lisa occupies includes teachers - played by Matt Damon (who crosses a forbidden line when Lisa seeks his advice as the only truly adult man she knows, Matthew Broderick whose class discussions over literature are brittle and acerbic and deeply disturbing - her introduction to adolescent needs and physical incidents at the hands of John Gallagher, Jr. (now of The Newsroom fame), Paul (Kieran Culkin) - her relationship with her needy single mother Joan whose newly dating Ramon (Jean Reno), her contact with the deceased's friend Emily (Jeannie Berlin - brilliant), and the deceased's only family - all in an attempt to somehow set things right but Lisa admitting that she is as responsible for Monica's death as is Maretti.  But the world outside can't cope with anything but financial compensation as the resolution to Lisa's angst.<br /><br />There are many other characters brought to life by some VERY fine actors and the stunning musical score by Nico Muhly includes moments at the Metropolitan Opera where we actually get to see and hear Christine Goerke as Bellini's Norma singing `Casta Diva' and Ren&eacute;e Fleming and Susan Graham singing the Barcarolle from Offenbach's Tales of Hoffman, allowing the opening and closing of the film to be accompanied by a quiet guitar piece, as well as proving Muhly's very highly accomplished music to underscore the moods of the film. The cinematography by Ryszard Lenczewski underlines the tension - form the imagery of slow motion crowd movement in New York during the opening sequences to the stabilization of important encounters between the characters.  A lot is said and screamed and the level of communication and actions by Anna Paquin's Lisa alienate the audience at times, but the film makes some very solid statements about how we are acidly interacting or not connecting in our current state of society.  That deserves attention. The film requires a lot form the audience, but in this viewer's mind it is well worth the time.  Grady Harp, July 12audience, but in this viewer's mind it is well worth the time.  Grady Harp, July 12
B000002IOJ|3.0|We start off with the title track and it is one of the bests on the whole album. The drumming isn't specatacular in this release so if you are looking for some killer double bass, look in the last two albums. The guitars seem stale only because of the production. Lyrically Testament takes on a more mature outlook with their music. Concepts include, the status of the greenhouse, global warming, and society. To say this is \\"a poor mans Master Of Puppets\\" is for one, a little downgrading to this effort. Sure it isn't their greatest album but it is good. Chuck Billy is more melodic on here than anyother release in my opinion. The bass work is actually audible which is really nice but the production, and the quality of some songs (both musically and lyrically) are lacking.<br /><br />Overall, I recomend this album. Some songs don't really register with me, but in my opinion the best tracks are: \\"Practice What You Preach\\", \\"Envy Life\\" \\"Blessed In Contempt\\", \\"Sins Of Omission\\" (killer riff and one of their greatest songs) and of course Nightmare is a classic as well. This is a good album, that has a few Great tracks. The production job didn't help its case either. If you like thrash check this album out but the tracks I mentioned will have you banging your head.
B008JAFXOQ|5.0|A movie made for mature audience who in this world of lies and deceit have forgotten what honesty means !!
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I've been a huge Megadeth fan for as long as I can remember. Endgame impressed me, I mean United Abominations was good, I didn't expect anything else from these guys other than 'good' albums. Endgame was a surprise. With its intenstity, speed, brutality, and shredding I was pumped up for the new album! Th1rt3en is a 'good' album. \\"Sudden Death\\" starts off nicely and does have some nice solos. It has a pretty good chorus as well and is probably the best song off the album. \\"Public Enemy No 1\\" Reuse and recycle Dave. Same riff as The Hardest Part Of Letting Go. I don't have a problem with a band reusing some older material, I mean it is bound to happen, but from the very album before? Megadeth is better than that. \\"Whose Life Is It Anyway\\" has grown on me over time. Its a good track and has a good solo. \\"We The People\\" belongs on UA or possibly Endgame. It is one of the better tracks. \\"Guns, Drugs, And Money\\" one of the two lowest points on the album. The musicianship is lazy. Riffs are too compressed and the drumming is horrible. \\"Never Dead\\" picks things up again! This is a track worthy of the name Megadeth. \\"New World Order\\" demo from Youthanasia era turned into a filler for this album. \\"Fast Lane\\" high energy track, even though it is lacking in the lyrical department, the double bass drumming and shredding picks up for any slack. \\"Black Swan\\" YES! Solo right off the bat. Good catchy riff, the drumming isn't technical, but Dave's raspy voice fits in well with this track. \\"Wrecker\\" the second low point of the album. The lyrics are laughable... David Ellefson, \\"So how about this Wrecker track? What are we going to do?\\" Mustaine: \\"Just throw random things guys own/do and then add She'll WRECK IT to everything!! Its full proof.\\" \\"Millennium of The Blind\\" Another Youthanasia song thrown in here just so the album can have thirteen songs. \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" Another great track, creepy, and catchy. The riff is pretty nice and you can hear the bass! The chorus is catchy and fun to sing along to. We finish with \\"13\\" A ballad about the number 13 and Dave's life how he got a guitar at 13, almost died 13 times. Its a good song but not as epic as people want to make it out to be.<br /><br />Overall we have two older, previously recorded songs (Millennium Of The Blind, New World Order) Two songs on video games (Never Dead, Rock Band) with \\"Never Dead\\" \\"Sudden Death\\" A reused track (Public Enemy No 1 from Hardest Part Of Letting Go) And the two worst songs: \\"Guns Drugs and Money\\", and \\"Wrecker\\" The tracks that are worth checking out: \\"Whose Life Is It Anyway\\" \\"Black Swan\\" \\"Deadly Nightshade\\" \\"Never Dead\\" and \\"13\\"<br />I don't see how this is a 5 star album at all...for those who ranked it that high: Rust In Peace, Countdown To Extinction, even Youthanasia is better than this. This is NOT for thrashers with the exception of a few songs. Hard Rock? Yeah this is for you all.d fun to sing along to.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|This App is so handy - that I use it even in church to make notes, such as book references etc.  Definitely a good pick
B000002HRE|3.0|Honestly, I hated Load, with the exception of a few songs. Re-Load follows the same program except for, the songs are more intense and have an attitude again, they are heavier than the tracks on Load, and overall, its a beter album than Load could be. Now I will say this album isn't even close to say...Master Of Puppets or even \\"The Black Album\\" but it is still a good album. Sure Metallica was in a low spot during this time in their career. (Load to St. Anger) but they were still striving to be the best.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best tracks are \\"Fuel\\" \\"Unforgiven II\\" \\"Memory Remains\\" and \\"Slither\\" (really like that track) other than those, the other tracks are still good. While Re Load is not a MUST HAVE, I will say, If you find yourself between choosing Load, Re Load, or St. Anger. Take Re-Load its the best of their worst three (depending if you count Lulu)

0061692042|4.0|Bev Parsons and his wife Neeva are a mismatched pair. He is a smiling gregarious six-foot tall retired Air Force bombardier from the south. The daughter of Jewish immigrants, she is an intense and aloof diminutive school teacher. A hasty marriage due to an impending birth brings these two together, and an equally hasty decision to rob a bank tears the entire family apart leaving their fifteen year old twins Dell and Berner orphaned. Neeva, anticipating an impending arrest, had arranged for a co-worker to intercept the twins before they could be placed into the care of the state, but the two still spend a few days adrift. Berner decides to follow her own path. Dell is transported over the border and into Canada and the care of Arthur Remlinger. Remlinger is an expat American educated and ejected from Harvard whose outward demeanor fools few.<br /><br />Told majestically from Dell's perspective Canada is his story. He is an unremarkable fifteen year old who's only wish is to start the coming school year by joining the chess club yet finds himself as far away from normal as possible.  Dell survives to convey a life lived and suggests the means to get there.<br /><br />Richard Ford has managed to bring the characters and the Canadian prairie to life. The story unfolds slowly with the introduction of the characters, but then the pages fly.  I do have a few issues with the novel. It truly is a slow go for about 100 pages, and the ending did seem a bit rushed, but overall Ford paints pictures with words and the time spent was well worth the effort.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is an excellent read - well written, with characters that are well fleshed out and believable. They also happen to be witches and vampires, but these attributes are secondary to their development. The author does not rely on the witch/vampire factor as the major focus of the characters, but instead builds them as multi-faceted individuals. I found that I could not put this series down, and ended up reading into the wee hours of the night several times. Highly recommend this!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow this book is amazing and touches on so many subjects.  I must say I didn't know what to expect when the young characters were introduced as I wasn't sure about reading a teen romance novel.  I am in my early 40s so high school seems like a distant memory.  Slammed is so much more than romance it's about LIFE and all the details, good and bad, that go along with it.  The story was captivating!  I was impressed with the writing and could not wait to read the follow up The Point of Retreat.  Do yourself a favor and read this book you will not be sorry.  Thank you Colleen I loved this book!

0439023513|5.0|Summary<br /><br />Picking up right where Catching Fire left off, Katniss finds herself in the middle of the rebellion in the once thought destroyed District 13.  Its leader, President Coin, with spies from The Capitol, have orchestrated a massive overthrow of The Capitol and Panem's President Snow.  Whether she likes it or not (and she doesn't for most of the novel), Katniss IS the Mockingjay.  Her face has become the impetus for demanding  freedom in all of the Districts, even District 2 where more Capitol proponents live than anywhere else.  Barely holding on to her sanity, Katniss agrees to be filmed in a series of propos to be used in televised breakthroughs masterminded by electrical genius, former tribute, BeeTee who was instrumental in destroying the Capitol force field in Catching Fire.  Unfortunately, every breakthrough inspires more violence from President Snow, with Peeta the center of his attention.  Even if they can rescue Peeta, Katniss knows that none of them will be safe until Snow is dead.  It is then that the real mission begins...infiltrate the Capitol via underground tunnels and execute Snow.<br /><br />What I Liked<br /><br />The Mockingjay costume and its maker, Cinna...I can't say much here bc of spoilers for the 2 people reading this who still haven't read this trilogy...but definitely a character to be remembered for a very long time.<br /><br />Haymitch - drunk or sober.  How can you blame him?<br /><br />Finnick - I disliked this character immensely when he first appeared in Catching Fire, but he grew on me by the end.<br /><br />No happy ending - there shouldn't be.  The ending is what so many people have not been satisfied with.  But, I get it.  If there had been a Cinderella, everybody walks off into the sunset ending, I would have thrown this book against the wall.<br /><br />What I Didn't Like<br /><br />The violence - vivid images - many deaths, some expected and some not - characters gave their lives in this book...gave their individual lives for the good of the future of the whole world and all the people.<br /><br />death by vicious beatings, being melted, vicious mutt creations tearing apart bodies, torture, bombs blowing off limbs - this movie, done well will be the most violent film for young adults in a while...I'm not sure how that will be accomplished without bringing in a firestorm of censorship<br /><br />The Peacekeepers - for some reason I kept getting the image in my head of Stormtroopers from Star Wars...?<br /><br />I also kept being reminded of the mindset of terrorists in comparison/contrast to our country's views...in Ireland I was blown away by the attention most everyone gave to the nation's history...even young children knew and participated in traditional songs/dance/sports of their country and its origins.  Most people can still remember the war and resulting violence of only a few years ago and so they appreciate the peace.  I don't get that same feeling in the U.S.  Quite the contrary I get the \\"so what\\" feeling anytime war or a difference of opinion is brought up in conversation and specifically from my experience, in the classroom.<br />\\"So what, that was way back then...that wouldn't happen today.\\"  While we do have a military full of the bravest men and women in the country, we also have those who enlist for the benefits but whine and complain when it becomes time to serve.  We also have many more citizens of our country who would never even think about giving their lives for the good of anyone, much less our country.  Generation after generation becomes more and more ignorant of our country's history and could care less about our country's future.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation<br /><br />Readers of Hunger Games need to go ahead and finish the trilogy no matter what you hear others say...it's worth the ride, every difficult word and scene...still worth it.  This one has so much action that it was announced yesterday that it would be split into 2 movies...a friend of mine was upset about that, seeing it as a money-making move.  I'm realistic enough to know that yes, that's part of it, but I can definitely see how this one could be two very disturbing movies.  I haven't seen the first one yet btw but have it on my auto ship list from Amazon.end of mine was upset about that, seeing it as a money-making move.

1451648537|4.0|I had the pleasure of reading the biography on the day it was out. I've read it a few times since then. I'm one of those who's had the good fortune (curse?) of sharing the space inside Steve's RDF many times. During my years at Apple I had many discussions with Steve, and I'm proud to say that for a time once he used to stop by my desk to personally inquire into some of the stuff I was doing. I can't explain the feeling when this happened - a mixture of fear and flattery might sum it up best, from someone who I remember to have both praised and trashed my work, unpredictably I'd add.<br /><br />Once I had developed a rather cool algorithm for audio enhancement which my colleagues had spent a lot of sleepless nights to put together into a demo. I still remember the day when Steve stopped by, listened to less than 5 seconds of our demo and instantly trashed it with words that dare not repeat here, and berated me for having wasted my time. It was one of my bitterest experiences, but in some years, strange as it is, I got to relish it - call me a masochist. I think I took pride in the fact that Steve took the trouble to actually check out what I was doing, even though he was totally [reworded the previous word :-) because my review would not be accepted otherwise] insensitive in his reaction.<br /><br />I know many colleagues who had similar experiences and I would have thought that incidents like these would make excellent anecdotal reading material for the book. I looked for them and couldn't find a single one in the book, even though I found many other anecdotes that were discussed in unwarranted depth which do less justice to the picture of Steve the complex man. There are also folks at Apple who I hold in very high regard and by who Steve was also influenced highly. But I don't find them in the book. And then there's Tribble (coiner of RDF) who's been at Apple since god knows when, and Steve trusted enough to assign to one of the most important early projects. He figures in the book in a few short sections, but is not mentioned in the cast of characters.<br /><br />I guess you have to be selective when it comes to writing a voluminous work like this. Its definitely interesting. Still I think it'd have been better if it was more inclusive and described all the juicy experiences that more of us can remember. I mean, if you're gonna write a big fat book, what's the problem with adding a few more pages?<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to everyone, whether Apple employee or not. It's worth many reads and for those of us like me, it brings back many memories, fond ones and not-so-fond-ones. But eventually the fond ones win over.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Don't waste your money on this book.  Character was violent and unlikable.  Plot was all over the place.  I didn't even finish reading this book.  Terrible and unbelievable.

Hooray!<br /><br />Good thing it came in good condition, because that hasn't always been the case, UNFORTUNATELY!<br />Even more tragic is that I had purchased a Xmas DVD in July (-back in 2010. Case in point: \\"The Gathering\\").<br /><br />I advise all of you: NEVER plan ahead for Xmas in the dead of summer* while shopping on one of these sites (it's as if they picked damaged-goods to be sold as \\"seasonal\\" items which they KNOW FULL WELL no one's going to open until whatever the season -Xmas, for example.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I didn't want to get this after all the bad reviews I read. Totally unfounded. I have EVERYTHING Radiohead has ever made. People who are still waiting for the Bends part 2 to come out? that Isn't Radiohead Anymore. Also, I LOVED Amnesiac AND Kid A, which a lot of people Didn't. Thome Yourke's Solo album, The Eraser, I've been listening to for the last year. I totally love it. This is a mellower version of that album. This could be The Eraser part 2. If your having doubts you can always listen to it on Youtube first. That's what I did. I'll be buying this album this Friday. I can't wait to own it.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I've got to admit, I wasn't the biggest Beatles fan until I watched this movie 5 years ago. I loved the interpretation of the meaning of these songs, often very close to what the Beatles said they had in mind when writing them. Listening the the Beatles will make you want to see the movie and seeing the movie will bring out all of those Beatles cds, or inspire hefty itunes bill.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  For those fans who enjoyed the band's previous albums, Hybrid Theory and Meteora, this album will not disappoint.  Ironically, for those fans who have enjoyed their newer material, such as Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns, you also will be thoroughly satisfied.  This album encompasses a wide spectrum of sounds, but unlike a Thousand Suns, there is a consistent and refreshing beat and rhythm throughout the album.  The first 8 tracks are hard-hitting rock with Mike Shinoda rapping with Chester screaming in the chorus.  The final 4 tracks are more experimental, but as stated previously, they are not executed with a cold-deadlike pulse like such songs as Iridescent and In Between.  I highly recommend this album to LP fans old and new!!!!
B001N3EZW2|4.0|This film defined the artistic design of sci fi for the 1950s.  It's like an old sci fi magazine cover come to life.  Props made for this film continued to appear in sci fi up to the 1960s.  This is a must see for any sci fi fanatic.<br /><br />The only weak point in the film is the Anne Francis character that was clearly inserted for a bit of cheesecake.  While she is lovely to look at, nothing she does drives the plot forward, and the entire film would be the same without her.
0452282152|4.0|SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />I read this book for the first time when I was 12 (sometime in 04) and I loved it then. It seemed so magical...a young Dutch girl called to work in the house of infamous painter Johannes Vermeer and his large family. While working there she shortly becomes the desire of a number of men who frequent the house or who work in the bustling town square, and eventually becomes the subject of one of Vermeer's better known paintings. It was a pre-teen's dream! Obviously, there were much darker themes at play in this novel; themes my little 12 year old mind didn't grasp upon first read and now have.<br /><br />I still find this novel amazing, with the long, beautiful descriptions of Delft and of Vermeer's paintings, as well as references to the religious and wealth divisions in the city, but eight years after my original read the character of Griet bothers me some. She is, for lack of a better term, a complete Mary Sue. Perfect in absolutely every way, while having a very cold and judgmental view of everything and everyone, she makes everyone else look bad by comparison. She cleans and cooks more efficiently than the older, more experienced maid right off the bat, and manages to mix paints perfectly on her first try. The real kicker is that she is able to mentally complete one of Vermeer's own paintings before HE realizes what the painting needs. Riiiight. And to complete her Mary-Sue-ness she is rescued by a well-off and handsome butcher (who loves her for no particular reason - just because) once she is tossed out on her butt by the Vermeer family. Yay!<br /><br />Still, it's a very good read and totally worth it just for the wonderful description of 17th century Holland.
B0006J28BO|4.0|I have always loved Studio Ghibli's animated films and have quite a few of them, including Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle and Castle In The Sky -- all of which are great movies. Since I am also a cat fanatic I thought it would be nice to own this movie as well.<br /><br />The concept of the movie was good and the voice-over acting was just as good, especially from Peter Boyle, one of my favorite actors! But the storyline was a little less than expected in my opinion. There were moments that it kept your interest, but not like in other works directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I find his works are a little more intense compared to Hiroyuki Morita's.<br /><br />Overall it is still a good movie and worth getting.

B0033QC0WY|4.0|I've owned this set and the \\"Carnegie Hall\\" remasterings (amazing!)[[ASIN:B001TIQT98 Mahler:  Complete Symphonies (Carnegie Hall Presents)]], but at the end of the day, I come away thinking that I've just heard Bernstein, not Mahler, especially in the DG remakes. There is no doubting his enthusiasm and commitment to Mahler, and the Sony set shows that he was really starting to understand the Mahler milieu and that Bernstein's need to stamp \\"Bernstein\\" like a librarian on everything he conducted had not yet emerged, but the playing and the interpretations have been bettered in the intervening decades since that historical cycle was recorded. What I still enjoy from the first set is the choral symphonies - especially 2 (both NY and London) and the 3rd (I've never been a huge fan of the 8th unless you remove the entire, extraneous \\"Faust\\" Part II)(and why was the \\"Salzburg\\" performance ever released - I doubt very much if Bernstein would have approved), and why was Bernstein so enamored with the voice of Jenny Tourel mystifies me. I appreciate she was a friend, but certainly there were better voices than hers and Marth Lipton's in New York at the time of the Columbia recordings. And I think his reading of the 7th was much the first time around than in Vienna. The DG sets includes a memorable 1st, 5th, and 6th, but none are nonpareil,and I've never enjoyed Bernstein and the 9th; I think it was better in NY, went off the rails in Amsterdam, and he almost got it right in Berlin (but not in very good sound). Parenthetically, someday I would like to know why Bernstein slowed down so much in his later DG recordings especially Sibelius, Tchaikovsky,and the the nortorius Elgar. Was it health? Had he lost his magnetic edge that had dominated most of his career, or did he really believe that every point had to be emphasised, stretched to the limits of his players abilities at the expense of the composer (listen for example to his Sibelius 2nd -- candidly, what a joke!). Anyway, I'll keep the 2 & 3 from the Sony set, 1 & 5 from the DG set, and look to other conductors to fill-in the gaps.I'll keep the 2 & 3 from the Sony set, 1 & 5 from the DG set, and look to other conductors to fill-in the gaps.
B007NR9WBG|3.0|Award-winning special effects genius Douglas Trumbull's \\"Brainstorm\\" experienced plenty of behind the scenes turbulence en route to the big screen: after having nearly completed filming, co-star Natalie Wood mysteriously drowned, leading its studio (MGM/UA) to file an insurance claim with Lloyd's of London in an effort to junk the film. (It's incredibly ironic this disc is being released right after the L.A. coroner's office newly designated the cause of Wood's death as \\"undetermined\\" as well). Trumbull - who produced and directed the film - fought to get the picture finished, and while he ultimately won (the insurance company gave him $3 million to complete post-production), the battle ended up driving him away from ever wanting to direct another feature.<br /><br />The finished film is a bit disjointed, as one might anticipate, yet retains enough of Trumbull's fascinating technical wizardry to warrant a recommendation for interested viewers. Christopher Walken stars as a research scientist working with Louise Fletcher to design what would be, today, seen as the first \\"virtual reality\\" device: a headset that records the images and thoughts of a human being, enabling another to relive their experiences. Devised for any kind of human interaction, the device naturally attracts the interest of devious government agents who want to utilize it for their own military applications; Walken, though, becomes obsessed with finding out what Fletcher experienced after she used the device to record her own death.<br /><br />Bruce Joel Rubin (\\"Ghost,\\" \\"Dreamscape,\\" \\"Jacob's Ladder\\") wrote the original story for \\"Brainstorm,\\" but Robert Stitzel and Philip Frank Messina were credited with the film's final screenplay. It's hard to envision that Rubin's original script wouldn't have been more compelling than the uneven dramatic situations that \\"Brainstorm\\" eventually throws at viewers, with limp dialogue and obvious improvisation on the part of Walken clashing with the otherwise dry performances of Wood, Fletcher and Cliff Robertson. Stories about Trumbull being unable to handle the actors and creating tension on set are unsurprising when you see the finished product, but much like \\"Altered States,\\" the film works best as a technical showcase in the first place. Trumbull's interest in human perception and experience - and ultimately bridging science with the spiritual - still comes across in the film, with a few affecting moments provided along the way.<br /><br />Trumbull initially envisioned \\"Brainstorm\\" as a showcase for a new technical process he dubbed \\"Showscan,\\" yet ultimately decided - for practical and economic reasons - to shoot the film in both 35mm (roughly 1.85) for its \\"real world\\" scenes and 70mm widescreen (2.35 with full stereo sound) for its \\"Brainstorm\\" sequences. The effectiveness of this approach naturally works best on a large theater screen, though Warner has opted to utilize a straight 2.35 aspect ratio for \\"Brainstorm\\"'s Blu-Ray release. This means most of the film is 1.78 in a 2.35 aspect ratio (with black on all four sides of the image) with the exception of the \\"virtual reality\\" sequences, which blast into 5.1 DTS MA and full 2.35. The effect isn't as potent as it would be in a theater, yet after awhile, the home viewer can still gain an appreciation of Trumbull's intentions.<br /><br />Some of the movie's visual effects and early CGI are interesting for their time - particularly during the movie's intriguing, if obviously compromised, ending, which seems to have been cut around Wood's death. James Horner's effective early score is a major plus to the film, which ended up underperforming in theaters upon its eventual release in September, 1983.<br /><br />Warner's Blu-Ray looks quite good with a satisfying 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA soundtrack. The original three-minute theatrical trailer is also included, featuring some interesting special effects footage that didn't make it into the final cut.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I will assume that the reason this book rates higher than the first book is because most people quit after book 1.  I decided to finish them so I could accurately give my opinion.  What a waste of time.  I'm going to go out on a limb and state that the author has had little or no real sex, has never seen a naked man, and just did 20 minutes of googling BDSM to write this story. Awful.  Just awful.

B008FBMLRQ|4.0|This is a pretty good album. Interesting choice of a mix with Wild Boys and Relax (yes, that Relax!).  They have so many classic songs that it's odd to see them putting a cover, but I digress. Many classics are here (although countless others are missing, I'll admit), but the versions are good.  I liked their latest album, which to me was their best since \\"Duran Duran\\"... but I especially like their version of Girl Panic! here,  a song that really reminds of a Reflex Part 2.
B005HEPWTS|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this episode. The principle of the story is excellent. The problem is that it forces the viewer to acknowledge one of the major problems of the Star Trek universe... that in virtually all other encounters with alien life, everyone speaks English. The Enterprise has encountered many alien species including quite a few first contacts, and yet they never have a problem communicating. The only way to get past it is to just accept that the show takes place in a version of reality where English is somehow universally spoken across the universe. But then this episode comes along and throws that out the window, and makes it look ridiculous that they can automatically communicate in English with every other new alien species they encounter.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was entertained. This is definitely fluff reading. I felt that each character was not fully developed but maybe that is what kept me reading. The constant sex got a bit tedious and felt as if the author was trying to \\"clean up\\" a pretty rough topic. At some points she uses pornographic language and in the next sentence she is speaking in Harlequin terms. I felt she should get off the fence and choose one or the other. This is big girl reading. Write it that way. Will I read the second book? Maybe.

Eric has written the amazing and inspiring story of Adam Brown, Navy SEAL Team Six Operator in his latest book Fearless published by WaterBrook Multnomah.  Adam's story is one of the most moving accounts I have read in quite some time.  I appreciate that Blehm wrote with such care to riveting detail and held nothing back.  After finishing the book, I felt as if I knew the Brown's personally and as if Adam Brown was a friend.  With so much controversy over the war our nation has been in for several years now, Fearless is a sobering reminder of the ones who are fighting this war;  right or wrong, they are fighting this war.  These courageous and fearless men and women that we sometimes forget about in the midst of our war discussions; they are fighting!    I am challenged to pray more and pray harder for these men and women who sacrifice so much.  Adam was not a perfect man (you'll read about that in the book), but he was a man transformed and carried by God's amazing grace; an unlikely hero and true warrior.    Thank you WaterBrook Press for allowing me read this book for the purpose of review.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I didn't care much for this movie after the first viewing. I thought it was hammed up and bloated with special effects that are hallmarks for most summer releases. However, after watching it a few more times the movie has grown on me to the point that I think this was, while not a great masterpiece, a very good film.<br /><br />Sure, there are plot holes and characters that aren't truly developed or fleshed out. Some scenes are down right ridiculous (the night time experiment that spawns Sandman). Yes, some of the CGI borders on cartoonish - the fight between Sandman and Spiderman in the subway comes to mind. And there are cliches, like the old damsel-in-distress scenarios that Mary Jane continually finds herself in. But this is a superhero flick and it's not supposed to be completely realistic. So like Steve Winwood says, just roll with it.<br /><br />What makes this movie rewatchable is the acting and the overall theme of forgiveness as it pertains to Peter Parker and Spiderman. Tobey Maguire, Thomas Haden Church, Kirsten Dunst and of course J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson rise above the hokiness and give great performances. Even James Franco delivers - he just plays a great jerk. And Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited role as Aunt May and gives a high quality performance.<br /><br />The final scene between Spiderman and Sandman was very touching and done so well. In the end, Peter learns how to truly forgive, an act that releases his heart from all of the pain he's been carrying around since his Uncle was murdered. Although I despised this final scene on the first viewing, thinking it was a little too tidy and contrived, I now realize that this was the culmination of the trilogy that finally rounds out who Spiderman truly is. The dark, vengeful corner of Peter's heart which the Symbiote latched onto was exposed and destroyed by the love he demonstrated after Sandman's confession. Peter saw what he would have become - Venom - if he did not confront his hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone. In all, one of the better superhero and summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen.hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|Whole family really enjoyed this one.  Reviewers who downgraded it for being scary should have read a \\"parents review\\" before taking kids so young.  That's why movies have a rating system.  A fantastic looking film that tells a great moral tale for children but funny enough to keep adults amused.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I purchased one of these upgrade kits for an old AA size Maglite flashlight on 07/12/2012 and was so pleased that I immediately ordered another one for a second flashlight.<br /><br />The light output is simply fantastic (like a mini-spotlight) compared to that of the normal incandescent light bulbs - truly a very dramatic night and day difference. The push-button on/off switch provided is also a great convenience.<br /><br />Since a brand new AA size Maglite LED flashlight costs about $20.00 here on Amazon.com while this upgrade costs less than $8.00, the decision to upgrade - if you already own one or more older non-LED Maglite flashlights - seems to be a no-brainer to me.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finished reading \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" with a huge smile on my face!  It's a 5-star, A+ quality novel as far as I'm concerned.  In my opinion, the story was addictive, captivating, romantic, and highly satisfying!  I enjoyed the main characters, Anastasia and Christian, and found them to be easy to become invested in.  I mentioned this in a \\"reading progress comment\\" but I believe that it's worth restating:  It's both satisfying and reassuring to see BDSM becoming successfully mainstream in popular romance literature.  For far too long, characters with a preference for responsible and consensual BDSM relationships have been labeled as crazy, deviant, or emotionally damaged.  Frankly, the content was authentic, refreshing, and maturely-written by someone who at least did their research into the BDSM community.  The level of eroticism in the novel was likewise satisfying and enjoyable.    As for the romance, it was palpable and believable, and I found myself rooting for this young couple to find a way around the emotional roadblocks they encountered.  Truly, I commend the author on the obvious emotional investment that she put into the characters to convey them in an engrossing and believable fashion.  I was dismayed to learn that some readers found Christian as too \\"screwed up\\" to be a viable lead partner in the story, particularly given his sexual preferences.  However, I challenge that, in the \\"real world\\" around us, we're all a little screwed up when it comes to our hang-ups, anxieties, and other emotional baggage that we haul around in our heads as we vie to establish long-lasting relationships with others.    I can't wait to read the next novel in the series.  As a fellow author who has written controversial topics related to non-traditional gender relations (and paid dearly for it via some scathing reviews), I'm SO VERY proud of E.L. James. She is to be commended for her personal sense of bravery in broaching controversial themes and for the excellent and creative novel that she has written!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As so many reviews have said very intriguing and thought provoking.  Well written and descriptive, felt like I was there.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is VERY addicting! And all you have to do to get out is go to menu, click settings, bottom right corner door looking button oor you can just press the home button. I like this game cuz you ddont have to use money to stuff you can actually make the money in the game. PERFECT!
B0058VW36U|4.0|this is a challenging, cute and fun game. You can change<br />the treat on the main menu. a simple and fun game.<br />keeps me busy.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting for this app to come on app for androids! i luv this app and i cant put my kindle down xD even tho i suck at it i luv it!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|my daughter loves this app for driving to vacation and its really fun for people to play when they want to pass time
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Just when you think its time to let go, the Beach Boys come up with a new way forward ... its a great basket of familiar sounds with new ideas ... this is one you have to have!
B0069SG4W0|5.0|Different takes of classic Door's tracks-the transparent nature of the sound on these tracks, takes you right there in the studio with the band: as 'you are there', that I've ever heard on vinyl(my preferred format).
B004XDYJRU|5.0|BBC streams are working properly again. Now locks on to live streams immediately instead of up to 10th minutes on the old version.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this was great fun and I cannot wait for the next installment. I have gone through every puzzle twice because I couldn't get enough.
0425263908|1.0|Very disappointed that the book is the exact copy of fifty shades. When originality goes down, sexy scenes dont even trigger anything.. I was shaking my head in disbelief while reading this book for I felt like I was reading fifty shades all over again,, I mean,waste of ink!
B008ALAHA4|3.0|I wasn't wild about the old T-shape MagSafe connector so I was glad when the whole line went to the L-shape connector a few years ago. Now we're back to a T-shape connector with MagSafe 2. The converter is actually bigger than I expected, and I find that usually when I pull out the power cord, the cord disconnects from the converter rather than the converter disconnecting from the laptop. Just weird and fiddly, but necessary since Apple hasn't updated the Thunderbolt Display to MagSafe 2 yet.    A note on price: Amazon's \\"suggested retail price\\" of $29.99 is laughable; it's $9.99 from the Apple Store and has been from day one. It's actually more expensive on Amazon.
B005LAIH54|1.0|I would rather be kicked in the balls for two hours than watch this movie again. The first one was ten times better and that sucked too.
1400082773|2.0|That he is a Socialist narcissist. Yeah. I read it. Sad that you are buying this crap hook, line, and sink us all. A good read for educational purposes on that front.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Came out 21 years ago and is just as exciting as it was on opening day.  This movie reminds me of \\"North by Northwest\\" on steroids.  While Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint stayed completely coifed and dressed to the nines.<br />Thelma and Louise is just the opposite.  The scenes of the vista of the northwest are breathtaking, even more so<br />than the Hitchcock movie.  If Sarandon & Davis did not win academy awards then they were robbed and I think they were for I don't remember them getting awards.  Simply put it is the story of two girl friends going for a night out without male permission and Davis becoming intoxicated and a drunk dragging her out to back of a car and fixing to rape her.  Sarandon shoots him and from then on, hang on to your hats, you are going for one hell of a ride never to be forgotten.  This movie is a masterpiece of acting and photography.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app adds to the convienience of using Ebay away traveling or when not at my home computer. Monitoring sales and purchases much better.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|This is a really good CD, I think one of the best they put out so far, They already have two hits off this CD.<br /><br />Denise
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book is full of heart. Even though there is a lot of killing, it is balanced with the right amount of magic and fantasy. Also, I really feel for Vaelin. It was really explicit in the book that he was struggling with his emotions but his brave self always emerges as the winner. I love the plot. I love everything about this book.
044024367X|5.0|Not top-of-the line-Child, but as good as most, and an attempt at something of a departure for this character, with its desert setting, three separate towns and three entirely separate conspiracies to unravel. And certainly nothing that deserved the vast amount of 1- and 2-star reviews it got.<br /><br />I notice that most of those poor reviews are coming from Fox-\\"News\\"-swilling non-vets and REMFs who find it impossible to so much as contemplate the possibility that the average grunt in Iraq and Afghanistan knows perfectly well that his officers are lying their a$$e$ off and sending him off to die for nothing. Just like the AWOL NG pilot and the dough-faced draft-dodger who got us into the whole thing.<br /><br />An \\"anti-american, anti-vet, pro-desertion, liberal/leftie\\" Jack Reacher? Give us all a break. He's just telling it like it is. Go look up some stats on the suicide rate in today's armed forces and then explain to me why we have NG guys serving FIVE TOURS in these hellholes. For what, exactly? The guy who attacked us on 9/11 is dead as a doornail. As another fictional military man once put it: \\"You can't handle the truth!\\"<br /><br />You clowns want to fight endless wars and not hear kickback, start another draft. See what you get. :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I could give this book zero stars!! It was written terribly and after I got about 10 chapters into it I deleted it off my Kindle.  If I would've realized it was pornography I wouldn't have downloaded it to begin with.  Next time I'll do a little more research before purchasing something and not just go by hearing people rave about it.
B001IF252C|5.0|If you notice most of the bad reviews are people using this product outside of it's intended purpose.<br /><br />I was very hesitant to try this product because of these reviews, however it worked perfect for me.<br /><br />I purchased this great 27\\" monitor from Korea that only had a DUAL DVI in.<br /><br />Using this adapter on my 2011 Macbook air and the Catleap monitor works perfect.<br /><br />So at least if you have this setup it will work for you!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun play it every day like how u can make your own land and make it how u whant :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it so cool and it fun game but I don't when your energy gone and you need to wait for 3min
B0034CNSFU|5.0|I was nearly 20 before I first heard a song by Jimi Hendrix. In less than a year he has become one of the most played artist on my ipod. The best way to look at Experience Hendrix is as a introductory to the legend of Jimi not the end all be all. It gets even better than this collection of songs. Are You Experienced ,Spanish Magic Castle, EZ Rider, Machine Gun (Live From the Band Of Gypsies) , Johnny B. Goode (Live At Berkeley), & Voodoo Chile are some deeper cuts that didn't make the Collection.<br /><br />  Every song that needed be on here is. The thing that makes This hits collection unique is the inclusion of First Rays Of The Rising Sun. The Album which Hendrix was apparently working on at the time of his death. Many of the songs were separated and released on quick cash in LP's. Hendrix father acquired the rights to his music and his step sister worked to release the closest thing possible his original vision. Angel (one of my personal favorites), Dolly Dagger (very catchy), Freedom & Night Birds Flying High all make the album.<br /><br />  While some Hendrix fans may dislike material not approved by him to appear, it giving it a more complete vision of Hendrix. In my opinion its by far the best compilation of Hendrix released to date including Smash Hits which was kind of Are You Experience heavy.<br /><br />Top Songs<br />-Hey Joe<br />-Manic Depression<br />-Castles Made In Sand<br />-Bold As Love<br />-Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)
B00846REIS|3.0|When I purchased this book on my kindle I was looking for something kind of similar to The Fifty Shades Trilogy but I still wanted a book that had it's on thing going on but when I was reading it...I just felt like it was a little too similar but with different characters. I also hated how the book ended it really was a terrible ending...It didn't leave you hanging on or caring about what happens to the characters which is not good considering in October the other series comes out. It wasn't awful but it wasn't the best either...it was just okay!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I can't understand the bad reviews that this film receives... IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Battleship is an incredibly action packed battle between humankind and hostile extraterrestrials intent on destroying the world. I personally went to see it 6 times in theaters, and coming from a family with a large Navy background it was very entertaining and exciting! Liam Neeson, Taylor Kitch and yes, even Rihanna ABSOLUTELY MAKE this film! There is perfect chemistry between the actors which enables them to deliver an extremely awesome performance. If you are looking for an action packed film with an inspiring ending, BATTLESHIP is for you!!! MIGHTY MO'!!! (Watch the movie!!!)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was great! I couldn't put it down so I finished it pretty fast. I loved the characters. Ana Steele is  a dorky girl who doesn't know how beautiful she is and Christian Grey sounds like a dream.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I THINK MY TITLE SAYS ENOUGH, TRY THIS APP!!!! CAN NOT POSSIBLE HURT CONSIDERING IT'S FREE!!! WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR, VERY RELIABLE, SEE FOR YOURSELF! !!!! XOXO
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This was a really good movie. I liked the part when the inception happened. It was really mind blowing and cool.
0743289692|5.0|Originally I bought this book to read on the plane.  I recommended it for a book club and to this day everyone say a it was one of the best books they ever read.  I loaned it to a friend but never got it back  so I HAD to buy another copy.  It is one of those books I just HAVE TO HAVE in my library.  It is SOOO MEMORABLE!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|My Professor suggested that this book would be a good read for the summer since I am out of school. She went on to say that I should not buy the book until school was out because it was so good I would not be able to put it down.  She was so right - this book is fantastic.  The language is extraordinary and it is an excellent read. Erotic too!
1612130283|1.0|Honestly, I only made it to chapter seven of this book, but it's for good reason. This book is absolutely horrible ! The first two pages started out ok, but after that it got really repetitive and very boring. There is so much hype in the air about this book, and I do not understand why. This writer is obviously being blessed by God. A few of my friends said that this book was good. A few magazine articles said that it was a must read, so I was almost sure that it was going to be good, but I have been let down. The main male character--Christian Grey is overly everything. He's overly perfect, overly mysterious, is grey eyes turning dark and flashing way too many time, he overly cocks his head, and his wry smile is overly mentioned. The woman is overly in like with him. It was way too much, annoying, and it didn't make since it all. I gave up reading the book by chapter 7. I was going to continue just for finishing purposes, but I figured, why torture myself?
030758836X|2.0|An intriguing beginning quickly turns into sensationalism at the end.<br /><br />Part 1 and most of Part 2 will keep you turning the pages with the quick chapters and plot twists. But at the end of Part 2 and all of Part 3, the plot twists upon plot twists became laughable. And the inconsistencies and inaccuracies within the story (not the story as told by the characters, but the story as a whole) leave you feeling like Gillian Flynn got way too excited coming up with the plot twists and should have contemplated the ending a little more.<br /><br />Those inconsistencies can't really be discussed without ruining the plot, however far-fetched it becomes in the end.
0307341577|4.0|It's the middle of July...I've been reading this horror tale, this fictionalized true crime enactment, this dark figment of a pretty Chicago wife's imagination off and on for most of four days.  Why did I finish it?<br /><br />Yesterday I nearly gave up on the Day family massacre in 1985, the ruminations of a 7-year old child who sent her brother Ben to prison for life.  Libby Day is not the sympathetic figure she was in 1985.  She's nearly 32 yrs old and has spent almost all of a $300,000 plus trust fund created to help her survive the loss of her family...her mother and two sisters.  She eats chunks of Velveeta cheese with mustard on white bread and sleeps on unwashed sheets.  She's been victimized again in her search for more cash by relating her family history and trying to sell memorabilia to a macabre Kill Club who meets in an abandoned building to discuss gruesome murders.<br /><br />Then my interest piques when Libby visits a satellite group of Kill Club women who are trying to free her brother Ben.  The description of rich women is right on.  You can tell by their wardrobe, Flynn writes, but relates another way to pick them. \\"They immediately correct how their names are said. A-lee-see-a, not Al-eesh-a, Deb-or-ah not Debra.\\" And they sometimes write to prisoners \\"because...it's the ultimate Christian act, loving the usually unloveable.\\" I have a rich friend who does those things!<br /><br />Then I run into a patch of Flynn's brilliant metaphors...sometimes two on a page. \\"The livery smile\\" of the banker who comes to tell pretty mother Peggy that they're foreclosing on the farm the day before the massacre.  A character with a nose \\"like an outie belly button.\\" Another with \\"eyes...small and bland as dimes that had been in someone's pocket too long\\" or eyes that \\"look Easter-blue, like pieces of candy.\\" Or funny metaphor...a stripper's breasts that are \\"shiny and globular like cellophaned chicken...\\"  This gal can write.<br /><br />After you finish this book...read the acknowledgments. Flynn doesn't explain why Ben dyes his red hair black the night before the murders or why Libby dyes her hair bright red again the day she discovers the truth.  But she does thank her \\"brilliant, funny, giant-hearted, super-hot husband... What do I say to a man who knows how I think and still sleeps next to me with the lights off?\\"<br /><br />I can't help you with that answer, Gillian Flynn, but I do know what to say to an author who's penned such a novel.  Give me a few days to recover and I'll read [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects]].  And now I know why your latest novel [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl]] just hit the top of the NYT best-seller list...read the acknowledgments.

B005K01VZS|5.0|This was a fast easy ready. Sometimes in our daily lives we need an inspirational book like this to lift our spirits.I couldn't put this book down until I finished it!!! We are too fast to judge people by what they look like instead of getting to know them. Our self inflicted walls of prejudice need to come down and this book reminds us of that fact. Good book for any age.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have had this book on my kindle for months anticipating reading it, afraid i would read it and be disappointed.I have read and loved the Providence series and was afraid that the author could not possible surpass an already delicious series.Beautiful Disaster exceeded all my expectations and the hype surrounding it is truly well deserved, some might say that the characters seem unrealistic, scenes maybe unbelievable or too violent, that Travis is too good to be true, my answer  is that this is why i read, it is a form of escapism and with Beautiful Disaster i truly escaped and fell into the story.I would recommend this story to anyone who loves a good romantic story(so good at the end i turned around and started the story again) and i will anxiously await Travis's POV, Congratulations on an awesome book Jamie McGuire
B0086700CM|5.0|Love the game its really adictive. the invisibility is really cool. and the super speed is awesome. the invisibility is really helpful since you can pass through anything and I'm looking forward to unlocking the football player.also the force field it creates when you use the invisibility is also helpful.
0525425764|2.0|I have enjoyed the Theodore Boone novels, since they can be read in one afternoon by an adult. But I was appalled that Grisham would write and his editors would approve the story line that stealing the password so that his uncle could illegally access files sealed by the court was justified. Theo faced an ethical decision and failed but we have the uncle telling he did the right thing.<br /><br />I expected complaints from parents!
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|Number One, what I would like to know is why is this in the childrens' section. This book contains profanity and somebody says there is a sentance referencing oral sex, whatever that is, but I don't think that's child material ( I'm Ray's daughter ). Number Two, I got bored of this book 10-15 pages in. The only reason I kept reading was because it was the only book on my kindle at the time that wasn't an audiobook. I kept it on my kindle anyway, though, in case I ever wanted to read it again. I'm a bit dubious about that, though, because I got my kindle on September 21st, 2011, and that was a few months short of a year ago.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|ya I'm bored and its midnight so I cant do anything cause Im not real sure wt to do at 12:30 am any suggestions .........guess not lawl ima text my friend till he wakes up XD yuss I'm mean bai

0345803485|1.0|I FINALLY FINISHED 50 SHADES!!!!  I read over 500 pages of a poorly edited book. There were soooooooooooo many repetitive phrases, I just started skimming over them. To quote a reviewer, DS from L.A. \\"I have discovered that Ana says \\"Jeez\\" 81 times and \\"oh my\\" 72 times. She \\"blushes\\" or \\"flushes\\" 125 times, including 13 that are \\"scarlet,\\" 6 that are \\"crimson,\\" and one that is \\"stars and stripes red.\\" (I can't even imagine.) Ana \\"peeks up\\" at Christian 13 times, and there are 9 references to Christian's \\"hooded eyes,\\" 7 to his \\"long index finger,\\" and 25 to how \\"hot\\" he is (including four recurrences of the epic declarative sentence \\"He's so freaking hot.\\"). Christian's \\"mouth presses into a hard line\\" 10 times. Characters \\"murmur\\" 199 times, \\"mutter\\" 49 times, and \\"whisper\\" 195 times (doesn't anyone just talk?), \\"clamber\\" on/in/out of things 21 times, and \\"smirk\\" 34 times. Christian and Ana also \\"gasp\\" 46 times and experience 18 \\"breath hitches,\\" suggesting a need for prompt intervention by paramedics. Finally, in a remarkable bit of symmetry, our hero and heroine exchange 124 \\"grins\\" and 124 \\"frowns\\"... which, by the way, seems an awful lot of frowning for a woman who experiences \\"intense,\\" \\"body-shattering,\\" \\"delicious,\\" \\"violent,\\" \\"all-consuming,\\" \\"turbulent,\\" \\"agonizing\\" and \\"exhausting\\" orgasms on just about every page.\\"<br /><br />I refused to let it beat me.. And the so called sex scenes or tortured sex didn't appeal to me for the most part.<br /><br />Not quite sure what the hype was about. So many said they couldn't put it down...I had to remember to pick it up and be done with it already.<br /><br />I'LL PASS ON THE OTHER TWO FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|Oh it's so unbelievable how unbelievable this book was. I did not even get close to finishing it, and I was truly looking forward to reading it due to the hype (was a bit put off about the rumored enjoyment of inflicting pain on women due to my hatred of sociopath/psychopath-esque tendencies...but convinced myself it was all for love in the end, right?) but was shocked as to how poorly written it was after the first page. I tried to read this and give it a fair chance, but I seriously could not read one more ridiculous word. I am baffled how this has replaced Hunger Games (an excellent series) on the Bestseller's list.
0545403359|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining, best books ever written for all ages.  This book was written from the point of view of the horse and it takes him through several owners and WWI.  Joey is a magnificent animal with a great love for his one true owner, Albert, who has his love and devotion for all time.  This book shows the devotion and love that can exist between an animal and their owner.  It also displays the horrors and the unfairness to everyone and everything in war.  Although it depicts tough times and the horrors of war, it still leaves the reader with good feelings and understanding for Joey and Albert.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book was that it ended too quickly.  I wanted it to continue and smiled when I was done.  Michael Morpurgo hit this one out of the ball park.  Although he writes for the younger reader, this particular book is great for any age.  I would definitely recommend it.
0345803485|5.0|love the book. I rather read this than my biology books.  to all the haters, you guys probably have a bad sex life. lol!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|this game amazing and I love that's its a free roam game also the graphics are good but the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that a lot of the time it randomly starts a new game and that isn't cool when there's about 20 to 25 missons

0142420891|3.0|Although Where She Went is the sequel to If I Stay, it worked just fine on its own for me, since the story line of the first book was explained through flashbacks. If I Stay is told from Mia's point of view, while Where She Went continues the story from Adam's perspective.<br /><br />Adam is a stereotypical rock star. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. After all, the word `stereotype' has some negative connotations, but some stereotypes do seem to be based on general truths and recognized patterns of behavior. That said, Adam is an arrogant, angry, self-absorbed, substance abusing, addicted to his meds celebrity who is chock full o' angst. But he has a `reason' for his self-destructive behavior- the great love of his life, Mia, dumped him a few years ago without so much as a by-your-leave. His downward spiral has fueled his muse and propelled him to stardom, but at the price of healthy relationships with family and friends.<br /><br />Mia has become a successful cellist, but without the damaging patterns of  behavior that her former boyfriend Adam exhibits. Then Adam visits one of her concerts, and a reunion begins that allows them both to deal with their past issues and find healing.<br /><br />I have difficulties with books that are full of melodrama. The extremes of love, grief, and anger don't ring true to me, especially when we are talking about a guy who mourns a break up with his girlfriend by going to bed for 3 months and letting everyone take care of him. He finally punches a hole in the wall and starts channeling his pain into music. Okaaaayyy.<br /><br />All this passion and rage had me wondering about the Mysterious Secret of why Mia left Adam. It felt like it was going to be compelling, and the flashbacks were building tension toward the Big Reveal. But when Mia finally confides to Adam the reason for her sudden and silent abdication, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />And I am still not sure why Mia has a restraining order against Adam.<br /><br />I thought the writing was pretty, descriptive, and engaging, in part as a result of the story being written in first person present tense, which gives the story immediacy. If you quarantine the critical thinking section of your brain, and are reading purely for enjoyment, you could easily lose yourself in the story.<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Death- Adam and Mia deal with death very differently. Mia seems to be grieving her family in a healthy way, while Adam mourns their loss (he was genuinely fond of them and very connected) as well as the `loss' of Mia by being alternately petulant and violent. He drowns his sorrows in music, fame, and pills.<br />Inner conflicts- Mia deals with the loss of her family and moves on with her life, while Adam stews in his melancholy. Mia feels that music fills the void insider her, while Adam believes music is the void. It certainly does seem to be swallowing him whole./><br />I thought the writing was pretty, descriptive, and engaging, in part as a result of the story being written in first person present tense, which gives the story immediacy.

B003DFLZB2|5.0|This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I listen to this soundtrack all day. It has moments of power and of beauty so creatively intermingled and dancing around each other, building one to the other. It's inspiring and exhilarating. To me, it captures the movements of the soul, such as reflection, sadness, fear, struggle/chaos, resolve, courage, action, hope, mystery.<br /><br />A fair warning though: this CD has a wide dynamic range (volume), so it won't work all that well playing in the car or other places where there is background noise (unless you're willing to keep your fingers on the volume knob the whole time).<br /><br />Another fair warning: it'll make you feel like watching the movie all the time! ;)
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|I frickin' love them!! I had to listen to this cd a couple of times before I got into the groove. I still think Night Work is their best album but this is a close second for sure.<br /><br />Let's have a kiki? Not so much....<br /><br />Inevitable, is my favorite for sure!<br /><br />All in all, it's another hit for them and I really love their music!
B006TVQU6C|5.0|I just bought this case. The case was very simple to transfer my parts into. I love the snap-in hard drive bays and dvd bays. It has good fan placing that will have good airflow throughout the case. It is a good solid platform to build a good computer off of. The only problem I had was plugging in my 4-pin cpu power cable from my power supply. I am not sure if my cable is short but I had to route the power cable in tight positions including right under the back of my graphics card. I did get the cable to fit though. My graphics card that has good length is able to fit in the case just fine with about 3 inches to spare behind it.<br /><br />Great case I recommend it.
B007X4N0DU|4.0|I didn't immediately like it.  Is that a surprise?  After being blown away by the Howard Benson produced \\"Satellite\\" and then noticing a pattern of great release (\\"Satellite\\"), underwhelming release (\\"Payable On Death\\"), great release (\\"Testify\\"), underwhelming release (\\"When Angels & Serpents Dance\\"), I was anticipating and salivating at the next Howard Benson produced should be great release.  With my expectations running so high I was practically guaranteed disappointment upon first listen.  With first listens you get impressions.  You need several listens to let the moods, the grooves, and the nuances to settle into your psyche.  This release is no different; it needs multiple listens.  While I do believe it is a more obvious/ less nuanced and cleaner release than most of their LPs it still contains a lot that you're not going to take in on first listen because the heaviness of the album will dominate your impressions.  The quiter songs and the playful creativity and diversity will be missed.  This is a modern rock album like their last release and it stands on its own as a good P.O.D. album with the boys experimenting just a little bit while keeping their message real.  Is it better than or equal to \\"Satellite\\" or \\"Testify\\"?  No way.  Better than \\"Payable On Death\\"?  Oh, yes.  Easily.  Better than \\"When Angels & Serpents Dance\\"?  Yep, but by how much?  You'll have to answer that question for yourself.<br /><br />(1) Eyez ~ \\"You keep laughing now you're gonna regret it then.\\"  A heavy thrumming song about judgment day.  The song is serious minded and musically heavy handedd.  Heavy repetition, which we'll find is used throughout this release, is used here to repeatedly blister the ears.  4/5<br />(2) Murdered Love ~ You might find yourself (A) repeating the chorus \\"The day that they murdered/ The day that they murdered/ The day that they murdered/ LOVE!\\" and (B) hating the song because you can't get it out of your head.  Like \\"Eyez\\" this song follows the same formula of bludgeoning your ears with the heavy rhythyms (the guitar serves as groove, transitional points, and crunch and there is some noticeable synth work for some ominous fill).  But this is a better song than \\"Eyez\\" because of a Matisyahu-ish light rap style and a brief but effective musical break to some lighter sounds toward the end of the song.  4/5<br />(3) Higer ~ While still maintaining a heavy rock sound \\"Higher\\" feels all the lighter than the first two songs for several reasons: the drums and bass are dropped back in the mix to allow Curiel's guitar, with notes more open and fluid, to dominate; Sonny's singing is just that, singing (not yelling), and he keeps the verses fairly level while hitting his emotional apexes at the tail end of the choruses; the lyrics are denser and longer (there's less repetition here).  A lot of people will like the song because of the positive push.  Me?  I don't think that it is one of their stronger songs...maybe even the weakest on the album.  It's no \\"Alive\\" or \\"If You Could See Me Now\\".  3/5<br />(4) Lost In Forever ~ This is a solid contemporary rock hit where all of the pieces fit.  The music is solid and tight with a little variety and some grooving heaviness.  The singing is crisp and the lyrics relatable.  Everyone contributes.  4.5/5<br />(5) West Coast Rock Steady ~ Cypress Hill is represented on this track and adds some SoCal rap flavor.  This is the fun \\"this is where we be from so let me hear ya holla\\" song of the album.  It's not about seriousness but rather feeling good and embracing your hometown.  It is fun and it works.  5/5<br />(6) Beautiful ~ This is the first truly great song on the album.  It is their \\"Beautiful Day\\".  Because of the captivating nature of this song many might describe this as this album's \\"Youth Of A Nation\\" and that seems appropriate given that the verses in both songs deal with very similar themes but saying that \\"Beautiful\\" is this album's \\"Youth Of A Nation\\" would be missing the point.  YOAN didn't point to easy answers or hope but rather spilled the feeling of pain and disenfranchisement all over America's kitchen floor.  This song does no such thing.  While singing sympathetically for the fractured and lost in the verses Sonny lifts us up in the chorus when he confidently and impressively affirms \\"Life is beautiful, share a little love with the whole wide world.\\"  You'll be right there with him singing this too and you'll believe it.  5/5<br />(7) Babylon Is A Murder ~ Can we have a P.O.D. album without any Reggae influences seeping in?  Probably not but this album comes pretty close with this song and \\"Panic & Run\\" being the only two songs were the influence is heard.  Even so the Reggae influence in this song is pretty mild and generally confined to the singing.  Fans who haven't liked this aspect of P.O.D. probably will like this song and may not even notice it.  This is an angry and defiant song but the anger is not explosive; rather, it is tempered, contained, and conscious of the coming future and of justice.  It is anger and not outrage.  Here, finally, we also get a small but noticeable guitar solo which has been absent from the album so far.  4/5<br />(8) On Fire ~ This is a ripper from start to finish and just might be the most blazing song on the album.  It's also got a big easy chorus line to repeat (\\"Stop! Drop! Roll! I'm on fire!).  That said the song isn't that memorable.  It's almost as if it tries too hard.  3.5/5<br />(9) Bad Boy ~ As others have noted this is a departure for our boys because it is a song about romantic (i.e., physical) love.  Even so the love is bound within a committed relationship and it is not sexually graphic.  The theme and ideal is not a popular one in our sex-obsessed and commitment anemic culture.  The vibe of the song is light.  It would play well on the radio and is catchy.  The singing is clear and melodious.  It's really only a departure in presentation, not in content.  The music is playful and even danceable.  The song isn't preachy and doesn't take itself seriously (listen to their banter and laughing at the end of the track--they're having a good time).  It helps to give the album diversity.  It's P.O.D. light.  4/5<br />(10) Panic & Run ~ Starting off with a heavy rock groove it quickly drops into the second Reggae-light (in both sungcraft and music this time) tunage.  The song then alternates between these two styles.  Better than \\"On Fire\\" because it's tighter and shorter.  4/5<br />(11) I Am ~ Uh oh.  This is the bad boy song of the album (yes, despite the other song titled \\"Bad Boy\\").  It has already generated a lot of controversy because the Christian band is dropping a certain type of bomb (that would be an \\"F\\" bomb in case you're wondering).  No, I won't be letting my kids listen to this disc and that is partly due to this song (but only partly, not entirely).  If you're bothered by the F-bomb here and that's it then you're not listening to the rest of the lyrics.  They are harsh, unyielding, and bitter.  (Exmp. taken from the opening stanza: \\"I am the murderer, the pervert, sick to the core/ I am the unclean, dope fiend, I am the whore/ I am the beat down, mistreated, sexually abused/ I have violated, fornicated and sexually used...\\")  Sonny and the rest of the guys are not letting themselves off the hook in this messy bit of pan-confession but are writing from a guilty, ashamed, and low personification of a non-believer (something they all once were).  The voice of the song is unrighteous anger, misplaced outrage, and pathological defiance because though it sees God myopically it asks (like so many do) \\"why in the world would you die for me?\\"  This is confused but understandable questioning.  It is a voice of distrust, in oneself, in others, and in the concept of a savior.  Undoubtedly when many P.O.D. fans hear this some are going to be right there feeling it (even many of those who claim Christ) and believing that the Southtown boys havefundamentally understood where the fan is coming from and this...this can be a further element that allows the band to dialogue with the sick and the lost, something they have always striven to do.  But here I am being P.O.D.'s apologist and that is not my job.  Back to the song.  It might be my favorite on this release.  It's a good ender because it puts a statement at the end of \\"Murdered Love\\".  The album doesn't go out with a whimper but with a bang and may leave the listener disconcerted, maybe even asking questions.  The music is muscular but in service to the lyrics, and the song is pained; it is not easy.  It may have come out of Sonny's involvement with The Whosoevers.  It may not have, I don't know.  But I do know that it makes me think, and feel, and ask questions.  That I like.  But it is not for the timid or fainthearted.  5/5<br /><br />The overall scope of this album is fairly apocalyptic.  We have murdered love and judgment is coming.  P.O.D. try to wake us up before it's too late, and they also take some time to breathe and enjoy themselves along the way.  They continue to sound the alarm.and even danceable.

B004GJYR7I|4.0|My Mother-in-law had mentioned it in a conversation, so I bought it for her Birthday. I hadn't seen in before and the three of us watched it on her Birthday. We all laughed an laughed. Clever writing and directing. Way before it's time. Love it. And now, we all can watch it over again.
0307472841|5.0|I picked up a used copy to take on a trip and I'm glad I did. This is an unusual thriller about a grisly mass murder coupled with fascinating historical complications. A small village in Sweden is wiped out by a brutal killer. A man with a rap sheet confesses and the police buy it. The unusual protagonist, a female judge, suspects that the case is more complicated. She finds clues that the police overlooked, which lead her to China and the real killer. I loved the Chinese killer, a classic psychopath who uses his billionaire business network and political connections to get away with murder -- literally. When he discovers that the judge is sniffing around, he targets her for assassination. The lady judge is a different sort of detective, stumbling around in the dark, scared of her own shadow, but compelled to follow the trail to its conclusion. I disagree with the criticisms in other reviews: For me, this was an exciting well-told story that kept me wanting to know more and more but doled it out in small tidbits so that I was never bored. I'm always impressed by this level of complexity in story creation and development. Similar to the Dragon Tattoo books in scope and originality. I can hear Hollywood calling.

0345803485|1.0|This book is very poorly written. I understand that it was originally written in serial format, but that does not mean that editing isn't required for the published version. It is exceptionally repetative, about 200 pages longer than it needs to be, and the sex is so very, very boring. The characters are so unbelievable with no development. It would have been much more interesting to follow her roommate Kate. I just cannot believe that a beautiful 21/22 year old has never held anyone's hand but has managed to kiss a guy or two. Nor do I believe that she had never, ever had a crush on someone. This book is proclaimed as naughty and shocking but is really lame with only the hint of S&M in the backdrop and very little actual practice. The popularity of this book just proves the repression of the contemporary woman. Any woman with confidence in herself, her body and her sexuality will find this book offensive. If you aren't confident in yourself, your body or your sexuality get a therapist. Don't waste your time on this book.
031603438X|5.0|No one defines my generation's rock n roll better than Keef. The Glimmer Twins led the way, and they ain't done yet. This book is better than I hoped it would be. Having read everything I could about the Stones over the years, \\"Life\\" corroborated many stories, told from the horse's mouth. My favorite lines are on page 365, \\"...They're ( fans of him and his music) wishing me to do the things they can't. They've got to do this job, they've got this life, thay're an insurance salesman...but at the same time, inside of them is a raging Keith Richards...\\" And that aptly describes this fan ( not the salesman part, but definitely \\"the salt of the earth\\").
0143034901|4.0|this was a book i chose out reading reviews for similar books for another author i had just finished and was wanting a certain style of writing close to hers.  ( elizabeth kostova's the Historian:[[ASIN:0316070637 The Historian )  so this book popped up and the reviews were excellent.  i was not disappointed, mr. zafron had my attenion from beginning to end. usually its about the story or the writing style for me, but this book had both. im now finishing the angels game, and its proven to also be hard to put down.

0143119680|1.0|The premise to this novel is a promising one; an intellectual take on the supernatural craze. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? The first few pages certainly enforce this aspect, as we're plunged into the Bodelian, where university professor and acclaimed historian Diana is doing research for an up-coming presentation. Sure she sounds a little cliché as she moans about being a witch and how she daren't ever use her powers, but I could look passed that for the sake of a good novel. But boy, did it go downhill fast.<br /><br />First of all, for an academic powerhouse, Diana sure doesn't seem very intelligent. I was able to work out the \\"twists\\" chapters before Diana did, and when she finally did get there she portrayed it like some massive revelation. It was not. It never was. She seems to lack the ability to think for herself, and instead relies on her over-bearing, domineering 1,500 year-old vampire boyfriend Matthew to remind her when to sleep, eat and even bathe. Seriously. I wish I was over-exaggerating. I was able to pinpoint the overall decline of the plot as being the minute Matthew steps into the equation. In Matthew's presence, Diana morphs into an even more annoying version of Bella Swan; she's clingy, desperate, love-sick, and she literally faints about five times. I lost count of the number of chapters that ended in, \\"And then everything went black\\". If Diana stopped fainting, she might actually have a clue of what's going on around her. At one point, there's actually an instance where Matthew explicitly tells Diana not to go outside... And then conveniently falls into vampire slumber. So what does Diana do now that her vampire bodyguard is asleep? She goes outside. Yep. I had to try my very best not to throw the book across the room.<br /><br />Second of all, the storyline itself is dull as dishwater. There would be entire chapters where Diana did nothing but row, jog, ride horses, do yoga and drink tea. I'm not even kidding. And did these mundane acts lead to any development of the plot whatsoever? No. Of course not. Their main purpose in the story was so Deborah Harkness could demonstrate that, not only is Diana ridiculously \\"smart\\", she's also athletically gifted as well. So by this point we're about 1/3 of the way in, and Diana is already showing major signs of being a Mary-Sue. But it gets worse.<br /><br />So back to why Diana doesn't use her magic. Basically she refuses to use it because she thinks magic was somehow to blame for her parents' death (yes, she also an orphan, and yes, she lives with her two eccentric aunts. I wish I was making this up). But now that Matthew's here, he's desperate to get her to unleash her magical side. He does a blood test on her, because apparently magic ability has specific markers in the DNA (yep). And wouldn't you guess it? Diana can do pretty much everything, even the rarest of abilities that the most apt witches aren't able to master. And yet here's Diana, sorry little brain-dead Diana, who can conjure witchwater by just getting really, really upset. She has now exceeded Bella Swan in the Mary-Sue department.<br /><br />Now on to the character development. I found it difficult to find a character who wasn't one-dimensional, clichéd and just totally dull. I had difficulty engaging with Matthew, and especially his subsequent relationship with Diana, because he didn't seem real. Matthew was the accumulation of a dozen different modern vampire stereotypes (can go out in the sun, wooden stakes don't faze him, he's an Adonis, that kind of deal), but he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. Well, apart from when he's reminding Diana that she needs to eat. He doesn't have depth of character, he doesn't have flaws or quirks. He likes chess, and that's about it. Then, of course, there are the obligatory supernatural bad guys. Basically it's a congregation of three vampires, three witches and three daemons, and they're desperate to break Diana and Matthew apart, no matter the cost (yes, cliché of clichés, inter-creature relationships are forbidden). And don't even get me started on daemons. I bet you're thinking that they come from Hell and are a bit evil, right? Wrong. They're not from Hell. They're born of mortal parents and don't seem to have any supernatural abilities whatsoever, apart from being a little more creative than the mere mortal. Why Harkness chose to call them daemons I'll never know. They seem like a pointless addition to the story, not really having anything significant to do except interact with Matthew and Diana every so often. I think Harkness realised she needed to have more creatures than just witches and vampires, and the \\"daemons\\" were the result. Sigh. I think my favourite character in the entire novel was Diana's house, and even the house seemed to realise how much of an utter idiot Diana was.<br /><br />And do you remember that academic presentation Diana was preparing for in the first chapter? Completely forgotten. It's not mentioned until the very end of the novel, whereupon Matthew has to say he's taken the liberty of cancelling it for Diana because all priorities in her life were replaced by her dreamy vampire boyfriend. To be frank, this entire novel is an insult to all progress made by women's rights since we got the vote. When Matthew's not around, she's obsessing over him. When she knows he's on his way back, she just sits and waits for him. When he is around, she's drooling all over him and saying creepy things (like referring to his vampire \\"children\\" as son and daughter). She's literally prepared to abandon her entire life -- her career, her research, her family -- for the sake of this vampire. They have a little \\"vampire\\" marriage, and from then on she constantly refers to Matthew as her \\"husband\\", and he in turn refers to Diana as \\"mon coeur\\" (which I found really irritating). So you'd think they had been together for a fair while, right? It certainly seems so, since their entire relationship drags on for over 600 pages. But no. They've been together for the grand total of one month. ONE MONTH. Please excuse me while I shoot myself in the face.<br /><br />So, in sum, do not waste your money on this drivel. It's monotonous, dull, slow-moving, has a watery plot, unbelievable characters, and absolutely no resolution at the ending whatsoever. I'd rather read the dictionary than read Deborah Harkness' sorry excuse for literature ever again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE the books, I just do... read the 3 of them in 4 days, had to finish this one in the bathroom as my husband though I was being rude to read in bed at 2 in the morning, when he was trying to sleep... you cannot stop reading, you just cant... you are very likely to dream about whats going to happen next and be obsessed with the story for a few weeks... I think I read the last page at least 20 or 25 times... until I memorized it...it is just a perfect book

0812550757|3.0|You'd be hard pressed to find a more insightful science-fiction writer than the famous Orson Scott Card. The man is absolutely brilliant, with his critically acclaimed novel `Ender's Game', he created a literary work of art, complete with a fascinating protagonist and a very compelling premise. He did the seemingly impossible, he created a book that raised thought-provoking questions on our sense of humanity and our indomitable will to survive, with a character we can identify with even though he's leagues beyond our level of comprehension. It was just as fun to read as it was to contemplate its larger themes and issues. It is to this very day a masterpiece and is solidified as one of my favorite books of all time. Which is why it pains me that I dislike the sequel `Speaker for the Dead.' I'll be frank, Speaker for the Dead isn't a bad book, it's yet another thought-provoking piece of fiction-writing that asks us to think instead of just listen. The book's fatal drawback in my opinion is that it's a sequel to Ender's Game; the continuation of one of the greatest science-fiction novels ever written. Card even claimed he wrote Ender's Game for the sole purpose of setting up the premise for Speaker for the Dead, which is ironic because Ender's Game is better in every area.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead takes place thousands of years after the conclusion of Ender's Game. With the use of space travel, Ender has lived through centuries while his body and mind haven't aged. Despite the enthusiasm to the destruction of the Bugger race of aliens, history doesn't exactly approve of people who commit genocide and has demonized Ender with the title The Xenocide. Having written a book revealing the truth about the Bugger War under the alias: Speaker for the Dead, Ender has created a new following and philosophy on death. When Ender is summoned to the planet `Lusitania' to conduct a speaking, Ender must unravel the mystery surrounding the deaths of the colonists and their assailants, the enigmatic `Piggies', the first sentient race humanity has discovered since the Buggers. Ender must unravel the truth behind the various deaths and their connection to a dysfunctional family in order to save lives and ultimately find redemption in himself.<br /><br />This is one of my biggest gripes with Speaker for the Dead: the plot. I usually praise authors for keeping their book series from becoming repetitive and stale, but this storyline was such a step-down from the absolutely masterful one told in Ender's Game that I couldn't help but be disappointed. Ender's Game was about a young genius being robbed of his happiness and childhood in order to ensure the survival of the human race against an alien menace. It was thought-provoking, but it was also entertaining and sympathetic. Speaker for the Dead simply cannot compare with the previous book in this regard, the plot is unfortunately rather lackluster and at times downright boring. It still maintains a high level of depth and intellect as to be expected from Orson Scott Card himself, but it will not keep you captivated like before. Because of this, Speaker of the Dead comes off feeling preachy in its messages rather than having them interwoven into the fabric of its storytelling. The only driving force that kept me invested was Ender's desperate pursuit for redemption; the rest just isn't very compelling from a story perspective.<br /><br />The other main issue I have with this book is the characters. I can't help but be disappointed with the direction Card took the series after Ender's Game. I would have loved to see Ender's friends from Battle School rejoin him. They each bare the burden of their committed atrocity and thus it would have been interesting to see them continue to grow as a family. Sadly this doesn't happen; Ender has disappeared into time leaving his friends behind in the past. I'm aware they get their own series starting in `Ender's Shadow', but it just isn't the same. The one character that does follow Ender is quickly disposed of early on, making Ender the only character to recur from the first novel, it's very disappointing. The new characters I felt came off rather flat. Novinha and her six children, really don't add much personality to the book but instead made the absence of Bean, Petra, and the others all the more noticeable. The only memorable character from my experience was Jane, an artificial intelligence with an obsession for Ender.<br /><br />While the book is very different in both story and the style of its delivery, it does carry some of the recurring themes from Ender's Game, such as xenophobia and isolation. As human beings, we naturally tend to reject things that are different from our own standards and preconceptions, particularly when it comes to other ideologies. This recurring theme is very predominant in Speaker for the Dead; for Ender is an outsider on the Portuguese colony of Lusitania through his differing ethnicity and his beliefs on death that clash with the local religious orthodoxy. The Piggies are also segregated beyond the reach of other humans due to differences in culture and levels of civility. It's through understanding the nuances of different people that these superficial barriers can be lifted.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead is a difficult book for me to review. It's a very intelligent book from an author that I have an incredible amount of respect for. But while it's another thought-provoking piece of fiction, it failed to invest me with its story and its characters. On its own it's an all around decent read that'll make you think, but as a sequel to one of my favorite books, it simply doesn't deliver.cter that does follow Ender is quickly disposed of early on, making Ender the only character to recur from the first novel, it's very disappointing.

B006LSZECO|4.0|It is the morning of Nick's fifth wedding anniversary.  He wakes to the glaring sun, casting an accusing eye.  After a breakfast of crepes with his wife, Amy, he heads to work at his bar.  Later that afternoon, he receives a call from his neighbor informing him that his front door is ajar and his cat is outside.  Strange! Nick hurries home to discover an alarmingly empty house.  Amy has vanished.  The police arrive and begin their investigation.  As the clues begin to emerge, the guilty finger points at Nick.  He swears he did not murder his wife, despite the accusing evidence.  As the days slide by, the tension mounts.  Amy is nowhere to be found and it looks like Nick will soon be arrested for murder, despite the fact the body is missing.  Nick desperately wants to prove his innocence.  Thus, he endeavors to follow the traditional clues left behind by Amy for Nick to find his present for their anniversary.  The clues lead Nick on hunt and expose some shocking truths about his missing wife.  Is Nick really a murderer?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*Gone Girl is a great summer thriller that will make your head spin. If you are looking for an exciting book full of plot twists and mind boggling surprises this is the book for you.  This was a read that got into my head and left me stunned.  I am still pondering over everything after finishing this one.<br />*I loved the way Ms. Flynn spends the first half carefully spinning her threads.  She creates two memorable characters with Nick and Amy.  The first portion of the book follows Nick as he learns his wife is missing and dealing with the fallout.  Amy's voice during this portion comes from journal entries that date back seven years ago, chronicling how the pair met, the blossoming relationship and all the ups and downs leading to the present.  The reader begins to form opinions on the characters only to be sucker punched in the second half.  All the previous conceptions are thrown out the window and the reader must start anew forming opinions on these characters that you thought you knew.  The execution works so well that I spent the second half of the book uncertain as to how I felt toward either character.  I love books that keep you guessing and this one does that until the last page!<br />*I enjoyed the numerous gotcha moments in this book.  Ms. Flynn carefully lulls you in the beginning making you believe you know who the killer is with her crafty foreshadowing and hints.  You read with eager anticipation expecting a wrench.  Then like a spider catching a bug in its web, she grabs you and swirls you around and dumps you out dizzy with shocking revelations.  This book is packed full of huge twists and surprises.  If you are a fan of psychological thrillers this read is mind blowing.<br />*I liked  Ms. Flynn's in your face writing style.  It is dark, wicked, blatant and a bit crass.  Definitely not for reader's of a more delicate persuasion.  However, if you are a deviant you will love it!<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br />*The pacing of the first half is a bit slow, it really takes awhile for the book to get going.  The first half is interesting but it is weak in comparison to the stunning events that come during the second half.  This book picks up right at the middle and from that point on it is a roller coaster ride to the finish.<br />*There were two details that just didn't sit right with me at the conclusion.  The first was why was there no lie detector tests?  Though not fool proof, one certainly could have changed the way things were going. Second, the anonymous tip that led the police to the diary should have been a definite giveaway because there is no possible way an outsider could have known its location.<br />*The ending certainly left me scratching my head.  It fits but it certainly is unexpected and definitely does not fit expectations.  It will leave you thinking, WHAT!?<br />*As I mentioned earlier, this is a dark psychological thriller; a book for adults.  While there is nothing graphic or disturbing, the writing style is at times a bit crass, blunt and straightforward.  There is plenty of sexual references, adult language and adult situations.<br /><br />Gone Girl was a sinfully wicked summer read that left my head spinning.  All I can say is pick this one up and and expect the unexpected.  I wish I could share with you the many shocking reveals that amazed and stunned me.  Ms. Flynn is a talented writer and she crafts a phenomenal story that turns upside down and starts anew halfway through.  The characters are complex and definitely memorable.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I plan to read other books by Ms. Flynn!<br />Favorite Quotations:<br />\\"There's something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\\"<br />\\"She blew more smoke toward me, a lazy game of cancer catch.\\"<br />\\"I even swoon over his socks, which he manages to shed in tangled poses, as if a puppy carried them in from another room.\\"<br />\\"Over just a few years, the old Amy, the girl of the big laugh and the easy ways, literally shed herself, a pile of skin and soul on the floor, and out stepped this new, brittle, bitter Amy.\\"<br />\\"Sleep is like a cat: it only comes to you if you ignore it.\\"<br />\\"If she were alive, someone would need to return her.

B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This is amazingly beautiful! Like a roller coaster ride of love. When I started reading this book, I literally did not put it down (except for bathroom breaks), that's how much I was attached to the characters. The author caught my attention right away from chapter 1, like I wanted to know what's gonna happen next. I like the way the relationship of the characters started slow because I got the chance to know Travis and then finally fell in love with him as if I am Abby - the heroine. Travis is someone whom you wanted to avoid but like a temptation that's hard to resist. He is not a typical boy next door but a bad boy who loves Abby like a drug - very intense. Abby wants somebody who is the total opposite of Travis, she is brave and doesn't care what other people think about her but she is afraid of her own feelings, she hides her emotions that sometimes its so frustrating.<br /><br />How I wish the author wrote their first night together more passionately and hot because that's how she potrayed Travis' character, a badboy-playboy, but then I thought that she probably doesnt want to focus on that area because it is not an erotic novel but a love story (BUT STILL..... I know for sure the readers will enjoy it more).<br /><br />This is not a quick short story, it's long and entertaining, with some action/adventure in between, and of course a lot of sweet and giddy moments. There are also other interesting characters around Travis and Abby that made this book more enjoyable to read. You will not be bored, I kid you not I read this for 5 straight hours and the next day I tried to read some parts that I thought I missed. I love the fact that its on my Kindle, I can re-read it again anytime I want. Buy it and you will not regret it!
0345529057|5.0|I think a great thing about this series is the fact that each chapter is a new characters point of view. You get to see what other characters think of each other, but then you also get into each characters mind and see what they're really like. Each character has a bit of good and evil in them, and it's incredible how well developed each character is as the series unfolds. Characters that you think are bad can truly be good at heart. There a numerous twists, particularly when you get to the third book.<br /><br />The third book is by far the most fast paced, I couldn't put it down. One event after another, I needed to know what was coming next. It's hard to write a book review without spoiling it, but let's say George Martin has no fear when it comes to killing off characters.<br /><br />Some reviews have mentioned how the fourth and fifth books really slow down, especially in comparison to the third. I haven't read the fifth, but I'm almost done with the fourth. While I tend to agree that it is significantly slower when it comes to the action, I find myself getting through it just as fast. I have this compelling urge to see what becomes of each character because I'm so invested in them. I can honestly say I am not disappointed with the fourth book, like most people seem to be. There are still small twists and things you may not pick up on right away.<br /><br />The fourth book is where all the characters start to get kind of muddled. A whole group of new characters is introduced and other characters change names, some characters already had numerous names to begin with, and it can just be a bit overwhelming at first. As I continue on through the fourth book, it gets easier to distinguish between all of the characters, don't let it discourage you.<br /><br />I bought the four books on paperback and they are fairly small, fit perfectly in my purse which is a bonus for me. They've taken a bit of a beating because of that, but are holding up perfectly well. I highly recommend this series, along with watching the HBO show **but read the books first ;)** It's always better that waycommend this series, along with watching the HBO show **but read the books first ;)** It's always better that way

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a haunting,compelling, fast- paced, intense story.  The characters are fabulous; you love or hate them passionately.  It has terrific life lessons to give you food for thought for days after finishing the novel.  One of my favorite books of all time.  I highly recommend it.

B008CP93S0|1.0|I couldn't even make it past the 30 minute mark before I shut this off.  The characters were stereotypical and not well developed.  Each character from the brother to the brother's wife, were one-dimensional.  The plot could have been written by anyone and the dialog was (at least for the first 30 minutes) predictable and boring.<br /><br />I'm okay with crude jokes but they need to be clever for me to like them.<br /><br />There was nothing clever about this movie.

0062183591|5.0|I find Dan Ariely's books to be enjoyable, enlightening and mildly annoying, in equal measures. The mildly annoying bit is surely unfair (and unreasonable) of me. I do tend to find Ariely's determinedly jaunty tone a bit wearying: he writes as if his readers were a pleasant but especially dim-witted intake of undergraduates. This is probably the secret of his publishing success: as the great H. L. Mencken said, 'No one has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people'(you and me, in this context).  I am also a bit resistant to the notion that things about the human condition with which we are entirely familiar cannot be taken to be really true until they have been 'proved' to be true by psychologists. Most of the  simple but ingenious experiments of Mr Ariely and his fellows tend to confirm several facts about human nature of which we were, in general, already aware. I don't have a problem with that and I enjoyed reading the book. I doubt, however, if you will find that you have learned anything about human nature that you had not already learned from your own experience, and nothing that Ariely and his team 'discover' about our behaviour has not been rather more convincingly portrayed by our great playwrights and novelists.<br /><br />Ariely, to be fair, sets out to write popular science, and he succeeds admirably, although - as ever with the genre - some of the science gets lost in amongst the popularisation. All of his experiments are thought-provoking, though some of his conclusions are more compelling than others. Some leave one wondering, 'Can we really draw that conclusion so emphatically from that data?' Be that as it may, the ingenious tests seem to prove Ariely's central point: pretty much anyone will cheat if they think they are going to get away with it but that, nevertheless, 'most people cheat just enough to still feel good about themselves.' Our notion of ourselves as being decent and upright folk will only withstand so much evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Ariely enhances this core tenet with elaborations about social effects, all of which are interesting but few of which are earth-shattering (if we see that other people are cheating, we're more likely to join in, especially if they are part of our social set; if we feel we're being observed, we're less likely to cheat) and with some of those interesting but occasionally slightly dubious other conclusions: willpower is limited and can be depleted, and we are more likely to succumb to temptation when we have already forced ourselves to resist a number of previous temptations (on that analysis, how does anyone ever give up smoking?); wearing  sunglasses that we know to be fake designer sunglasses  makes us more likely to cheat ('the wearers of fake sunglasses showed a much greater tendency to abandon their moral constraints and cheat at full throttle'). The moral of this tale would seem to be never to ask a friend wearing fake sunglasses to look after your handbag in the pub garden while you go to the loo.<br /><br />All that said, this is a jolly and informative romp through some genuinely interesting current psychological thinking, entertainingly and readably presented. I have to declare an interest at this point: one of the chapters in this book is called `Blinded by our own motivations' and, in another chapter, Ariely writes that, 'We may not always know why we do what we do, choose what we choose, or feel what we feel.' As the man who has written a book called Blindsided on exactly that theme, I cannot help but say, in this particular context, that Dan Ariely is clearly a deeply perceptive and highly intelligent chap (demonstrably so, since he agrees with me).<br /><br />I do, however, have a few gripes. Ariely concludes, as a result of a particular set of experiments, that people with a particularly creative mindset are more likely to deceive than others: their enhanced 'story-telling' abilities allow themto be comfortable with various version of reality that may not exactly coincide with what you and I thought had actually happened. ('The more creative we are, the more we are able to come up with good stories about how we are doing the right thing, even when we are not.') But then the psychologists discover that one sees the same effect in people who have been merely 'primed' for creativity by being exposed to a number of carefully-chosen words in the course of the experiment:  'creative', 'original', 'novel', 'new' and 'ingenious',  for example.  Since Ariely is attempting to make a conclusion based on the fundamental structure of individuals' brains (creative people have more white matter in their noddles and are therefore able to 'make more connections between different memories and ideas' than other people) it seems a bit cavalier (and unlikely) to suggest that merely introducing the notion of creativity via a few words can reconstruct conditions that he had previously argued were the result of the intrinsic physical make up of some individuals' brains.<br /><br />I also wonder what Ariely is even thinking of when he says 'So where do we stand on self-deception? Should we maintain it? Eliminate it?' I thought that everything that Ariely had said in the book up until this point (page 158) had made it pretty clear that we didn't have much choice in the matter. And Ariely seems to want to discover the 'function' of self-deception. One of his core conclusions is that 'self-deception is similar to its cousins, overconfidence and optimism' in that it can help us deal with stress, carry out tedious tasks and get us to try new and different experiences (if we didn't deceive ourselves, we would realise that we were doomed to either boredom or failure, or both).<br /><br />My fundamental complaint is that Ariely seems to begin with the premise that all human beings are essentially honest and then to drop his carefully manufactured bombshell (We are all far less honest than we think!) on our unsuspecting heads. I'm also far from sure that self-deception has any kind of benign 'function', as Ariely suggests: as social animals, most of us are aware that mere anarchy is the route to social disaster, but that doesn't mean that we can't help ourselves to just a little bit of something that might technically belong to somebody else. As self-aggrandising idiots, we also think that we are capable of anything. This leads us (happily) to attempt things that we should realise that we are incapable of.  As Ariely says, 'we persist in deceiving ourselves in part to maintain a positive self-image. We gloss over our failures, highlight our successes (even when they are not entirely our own), and love to blame other people and outside circumstances when our failures are undeniable.' That is a lovely summing up of a critical part of the human condition, but I am uncertain about Ariely's suggestion that we have any choice as to whether to deceive ourselves or not, or that self-deception is some kind of advantageous evolutionary pressure that helps us to cope with the realities of human life. I feel rather that self-deception is simply a part of the human condition and that we might be far more evolutionarily successful (but also far more boring) if, like the Vulcan, Spock ,from Star Trek, we didn't actually practice self-deception in the way that we do.<br /><br />But I wouldn't be making these moans and gripes if Ariely's book hadn't set me off on a number of trains of thought.

B003VANOFY|5.0|When my G930 arrived it was better than i expected. First of all im sure some of you are wondering about the battery life since its wireless. Well have no fear, the battery is great! the program on the computer usually says about 10 hours or more when it near full charge. I haven't actually timed it myself but it last all day. And even if you do drain it and still want to play, the charge cord is really long and adjustable for how you want it. And when the battery finally gives up the ghosts, logitech offers you a replacement battery for a great price and tells you how to do it yourself so you dont have to ship it out and wait.<br /><br />Now for the functions on the side. The G-keys are great to set for whatever you want. Some set for voice morpher, but I have some of mine set to pause my movies or netflix when I like to watch with silence or without disturbing others. And for my gaming side, my laptop always minimizes my game when I adjust the volume because its a pop-up type volume thing, cool but annoying at times. Well this volume control still adjust the volume without doing that so I can adjust my volume anytime in-game.<br /><br />As for the mic, it is crystal clear and has good sensitivity without going over board so every hears your family on the other side of the house. It is very flexible and is easy to bend but stays where you put it, no spring action. The whole construction is great. Very sturdy but also very comfortable. I can wear this headset for hours and hours.<br /><br />And now for my favorite part, the surround sound. This is wear hardcore gamers won't even think of getting something with simulated surround sound. Well, thats their loss, because this thing is amazing. I can always tell where shots are coming from or if footsteps are in front of me or behind. And if you have a good movie with surround sound you feel like your in it and can't help but turn around every once in a while.<br /><br />I think that covers most of it, the only other thing is the software. I've had the software for a while because of my G-series mouse. All the G-series use the same program so you don't have to install multiple programs which is great. It allows you to easily switch in between all of your plugged in devices. you have control over how loud the mic is, how the treble and bass is, along with the surround sound so you can make sure you hear stuff behind you more than everything else. And you can set different profiles for the G-keys for different games.<br /><br />There is only one downside. Because it is wireless it loses connection once in a while. But when I say once in a while, I mean once every few days of using it 5 hours a day. Im not sure if its software or just interference from a cellphone because they both run on 2.4 ghz. But don't worry, things that run are 2.4 are made to search for open channels so they don't interfere.<br /><br />Short story:<br /><br />Pros- Amazing surround sound, very realistic<br />  - Comfortable to wear for hours on end<br />  - Software is great and easy to use<br />  - Long lasting battery<br />  - Long range and solid wireless connection<br />  - G-keys for many uses<br />  - Voice Morpher<br />  - Volume control and mic mute<br /><br />Cons- Really nothing, just it does disconnects once in a while, but very rare
B003Y5H5BA|3.0|It's summer so it must be time to rehash an old TV series and bring it up to date.  This time the producers take a popular show from the mid '80's that was a launching pad for Johnny Depp, who played a cop who goes undercover at a high school.  I never watched the show but it is my understanding it was played as a straight-ahead police drama but with teens in lead roles.  Smart for ratings.<br /><br />This time, while the overall plot is the same, it's played for laughs.  And it partially succeeds.  We're used to seeing Jonah Hill in comedic roles and he's always good.  Hunky co-star Channing Tatum has pretty much been in dance oriented flicks, dramas or action films so this is a step up (pun intended) in a new direction.  The two rookie cops were high school classmates 7 years earlier.  Jenko (Tatum) was a stud, but dumb.  Schmidt (Hill) was a geek and very smart.  In their new assignments, the principal gets their aliases confused (our cops also can't seem to remember what their undercover names are) and so they get the wrong schedule.  Oh yeah.  They're supposed to be brothers.<br /><br />With only 30 days left in the school year you would think these two could assimilate into the school and catch the drug dealers.  But even the supposedly smart one (Schmidt) manages to get in over his head.  I realize that each character is to have a second chance at finishing high school the right way, but really?  The film ends tidily and there are enough good laughs to give the film a modest recommendation.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is just fine if not very colorful or explosive.  It has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is excellent in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is very immersive.  A shoot out at the end of the film will get you dodging bullets from all angles.

Though Winter is on its way this is not the only problem the House of Stark faces when The Hand of the King dies the king himself requests that Eddard Stark become the new Hand and help him rule his kingdom throwing Eddard Stark and his family into a game full of lies, espionage, and murder. Across the sea the former prince barters his own sister for an army of warriors in hopes of gaining his rightful place, but the cruel prince underestimates the people his sister has become a part of.<br /><br />There is no way to truly encompass this novel in a short synopsis, not only because it is eight hundred pages long but because the author seems to encompass almost every genre imaginable. I imagine if some authors try this they will find a jumbled mess in their hands but George R. R. Martin managed to bring together a novel that is truly epic and seamless in its telling. Not only does the author write a beautiful story between his characters making you fall in love with each one he also manages to make you hate the villains so much so that you almost wish they would soon get what they deserve. To me this is the mark of a brilliant novel, many authors can make you fall in love with characters but very few can make you hate them.

B007X4QZWI|5.0|Reviewed by Thayne Warner. I guess that makes me \\"GameDad.\\"<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Ancient Bards was a wonderful, serendipitous find. Simply put, the music is magical.<br /><br />Let's cut to the chase. Sara Squadrani imbues the admittedly very proficient, entertaining, high-quality instrumental music with the powerful--VERY powerful enchantment of her voice. No wilting flower--no wailing waif--no winsome lass. No! Sara's voice weaves her spells with a punching, pounding potency. I am no music expert, or even connoseur of power metal, but she has the most powerful female METAL voice I have heard. And beats most males for actual power, as well -- not counting the Cookie Monster growling guys, of course, but then again, they don't sing! And does she sing! Soaring, unapologetic, and, simply put, purely wonderful.<br /><br />And again, I cannot stress enough the strong proficiency of her bandmates. I will be the first to admit that I love vocals more than anything else in all genres. But Daniele Mazza--the conductor of this pounding orchestra and, I am given to understand, the main composer--provides excellent direction.<br /><br />To be clear--this is Power Metal in the vein of [Flames of] Rhapsody--and thus laden with fairly predictable storylines (at least in this album), with somewhat cardboard-flat characters, and some strange lyrical content. But you won't notice, because Sara is singing it, and she makes it all sound fantastic. Plus, if I wanted a richly nuanced novel, with complex characters and a well-researched and edited storyline, I'd be reading, you know, a book.<br /><br />This is in good fun. And, after listening to it probably about 30-40 times straight now, I am still enchanted and enthralled by it. Sara's somewhat-accented English does not detract, and, in many ways it adds to the mystique. So much so that my 5 and 8 year old daughters and I can't help but sing along, at the top of our voices:<br /><br />SENDER HAS FOUND THE MAGICAL SERD!<br />SENDER WANTS TO CONQUER THE WERLD!<br />SENDER HAS FOUND THE MAGICAL SERD!*<br />THE BLACK CRYSTAL SERRRRRD!<br /><br />IT'S THE BEGINNING OF A NEW WAR!<br />NOW THAT SENDOR HAS GOT THE SERD!<br />HE WANTS TO CONQUER OUR WHOLE WERLD!<br />IT IS THE BIRTH OF EVIL!<br /><br />Buy this album.

0143121006|5.0|The diverse bunch of characters in this fascinating book include an English Sinologist, Western diplomats, Chinese detectives, brutal Japanese soldiers, expatriates in pre-World War II Peking, prostitutes, pimps, dope peddlers, an evil American dentist, and a White Russian hermaphrodite.  The Sinologist, whose daughter is brutally murdered, ultimately demonstrates that the tools of serious scholarship and the methods of the detective are one and the same. E.T.C. Werner, the complex and grieving father, exhibits an incredible strength and tenacity as he pursues his crusade to find justice for his daughter, a justice that author Paul French finally makes possible. This true story, though filled with brutality, is also touched by a rare humanity.  What a movie it will make!
B0073U2FB2|5.0|This end of the world alien movie was not to bad. i really liked it. i thought that the effcts were pretty good. the storyline could of been a little better than it was but i consider this a fun end of the world movie. who knows it could happen and what would we do. i did like the actors and i have a feeling that there might be another one. so if you liked this movie then expect a sequel, it might not come to theaters but who knows. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. i did like the way they portrayed the aliens that was new.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean has built up ever-growing career from pretty much ground zero, from residing in New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina back in 2005 losing every prized possession he owned and forming a brand new life in California, Frank Ocean has experienced some struggles throughout his life. As the main R&B Crooner from Odd Future, as well as establishing his own name by collaborating with some of today's biggest artists from Kanye West to Beyonce, John Mayer to Justin Bieber; Frank Ocean has quite the resume for a fresh new artist. Frank Ocean's main genre is R&B, however he incorporates sounds from Electro, jazz, gospel, etc. to form a very unique brand of music that is undeniably his own. What makes Frank Ocean so distinct from the saturated market of R&B artists, is his artistic approach to his music. Yes, as an R&B artists he talks about sex and talks about love, the typical norm, however, Frank Ocean as an artist takes R&B to a whole nother level. Frank Ocean is one of very few R&B artists that touches on socioeconomic issues such as religion, philosophy, drugs among other things. As an artist (especially in R&B) Ocean is way ahead of the pack, his innovation in music is way ahead of everybody as of now. In my opinion he may never be as popular in R&B as Trey Songz, Usher or Chris Brown, but artistically Frank Ocean has proven himself to be a true original.<br /><br />  If you're a fan of Frank Ocean, you will already have noticed that sonically, Channel Orange is very similar to his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra containing various skits and interludes that often have cultural references mixed in between. Channel Orange is one of those rare albums in the mainstream that lets listeners delved into the artist's psyche, and thankfully Frank Ocean is an interesting person to listen to. Frank Ocean does not succumb to the pressure of making typical \\"lets make love\\" songs or \\"get up and dance\\", his lyrics are much more poetic and meaningful.  The first track \\"Thinking Bout You\\" demonstrates some of Frank's storytelling ability; Ocean's lyrics are contain much more substance,  filled with double entendres that are neither corny nor clich&eacute;. Songs such as \\"Bad Religion\\"  & \\"Forrest Gump\\" contain some of the more personal lyrics from Frank, basically questioning his own existence and the reason to why he is the way he is. Don't get me wrong Frank has his \\"crooning moment\\" that are sex driven and about love \\"Pink Matter feat. Andre 3000\\", \\"Sierra Leone\\" are perfect examples.<br /><br />  \\"Super Rich Kids feat. Earl Sweatshirt\\" and \\"Sweet Life\\" addresses social classes and the power of money manipulation (no illuminati reference) \\"Crack Rocks\\" and \\"Pilot Jones\\" also addresses drug addiction. Now while I may love this album, there are instances where I tend to become bored. The sound at times can become tiresome, the tempo of nearly every song is damn near similar with the exception of tracks \\"Pyramids\\" & \\"Monks\\". I don't mind as much because there are no songs on the album that sound the same, however there are moments where I wish Frank Ocean could be a little more optimistic on the album. With that being said Frank does not sound emo or anywhere like a b**** when he sings unlike some artists (*cough* Drake) Frank Ocean is a grown man being honest in his music and that is what I appreciate about him the most. The obvious scandal surrounding Frank Ocean as well is his \\"coming out\\" party; yes Frank Ocean is bi-sexual, he likes men and women, and it is clearly heard throughout the album which creates an interesting dynamic (to me anyways).  Does it bother me? Not one bit; if anything it makes Frank Ocean more respectable as a person, being able to express himself honestly and openly to his fans takes some balls. Channel Orange is probably the most ambitious R&B album 2012 has to offer and should definitely be heard.<br /><br />Top 5 Tracks<br />1) Thinkin Bout You<br />2) Sierra Leone<br />3) Super Rich Kids feat. Earl Sweatshirt<br />4) Pyramids<br />5) Lost) Pyramids<br />5) Lost

0736083863|5.0|This book is excellent. It's scope is a nice balance of breadth and depth of both anatomy and the practical application of the principles they discuss. I am currently teaching a Pilates Mat Instructor Training course, and I required all of my students to purchase it. The drawings depicting the exercises and the major muscles that are active during the exercises is especially helpful for both new and veteran instructors. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
B007ZBWJXS|5.0|If you expect to hear a new version of 'Heat of the Moment', 'Only Time Will Tell' or 'Sole Survivor' you are going to be disappointed. Those songs had already been done, but that being said, there are many tracks here that will become instant clasics to any Asia fan. The craftmanship that Downes, Howe, Palmer and Wetton produced here is amazing. The first track, Tomorrow the World opens strangly enough for an Asia album(more like an Icon album though which is a side product of Wetton and Downes)but quickly changes tempo and opens up to a great clasic track. John Wetton vocals kick in followed by the percussion work of Carl Palmer and Geoffry Downes on keyboard and then Steve Howe adds his unforgettable riffs to the mix and it will impress you. In fact toward the end of the track there is a terrific mini Jam session with Geoff and Steve performing dueling solo work against the back drop of Carl's drumming and John's bass work. The running time for each track may be considered long by today's music standards; but the old saying that time flies when you are having fun applies here. Bury Me in Willow clocks in just over 6 minutes, but its the track that I haved played the most. That also is in part to the beautiful, thought provoking and breath taking lyrics that can be found on every track.  Forgive the pun, but when these guys get together they make beautiful music together.
B000002HMH|4.0|When Load came out in 1996 everyone was starving for more Metallica (had been 5 years since The Black Album). I remember loving 'Until It Sleeps' and liking most of the rest of the album. I also remember not understanding the whole image makeover thing. I didn't care about the cutting of the hair but the makeup and faux homosexual stuff between Lars and Kirk annoyed me. I have no issues with those social issues and personal choice, but it just didn't make much sense to me (as a teen) and it still doesn't really now a decade and half later. It was a forced and phony image that they've thankfully discarded.<br /><br />Back to the music however, so after liking it initially, I discarded Load and Reload as Metallica went into decline at the end of the 90s into the whole napster thing and then the disaster of St Anger and losing Jason. (One of my friends left and never came back to the band)... I \\"hated\\" Load for awhile there. Once all that subsided and the buildup of Death Magnetic started their comeback I jumped back on board and loved DM. I have since seen them twice in Concert (World Magnetic Tour and Orion) and they were incredible. I have been listening to Load again and man is it a kick@ss album. Bluesy, hard rock, some metal, but lots of energy and grooves. There are some outstanding songs on the album that spawned a bunch of radio singles like Ain't My Bitch, Until It Sleeps, King Nothing, Hero of the Day. Mama Said is notable, and a huge departure from their typical sound but it sticks with you and its a great song. The 2 highlights though for me are Bleeding Me and Outlaw Torn. Both epic masterpieces.<br /><br />I grew up in the 80s and caught on to them right before TBA came out, and I love all of their 80s stuff, RTL being my favorite, but Load is also a great album and any fan should enjoy it.

B005LAII9O|3.0|This movie was pretty disappointing. I give it two and a half stars. I want to like it, but it's just too hard. I was expecting Scarface, I wanted Scarface, but I got Alexander instead. The movie has a great premise, good actors, but it just comes out as a mess in the end. I must agree with other reviewers that the ending is just horrible. It stops this from being a good/okay movie, but even the first three quarters of the film are no where near great. It seems like it was all put together at the last minute. I'm hoping that all of this was just the common butchering of the movie studios and that there will be a director's cut or an intended original of the film sometime in the near future that gives me that deep feeling of \\"Wow. What a profound piece of art I have just witnessed.\\" instead of \\"Really? What the heck did I just watch for two hours?\\" I hope I'm right. I know that Uma Thurman filmed scenes as Blake Lively's character's mom. These scenes were cut due to time constraints and could have possibly added some needed character development. Hopefully, that's evidence that there is a director's cut somewhere waiting to be shared. If not, they could give me a day or two in the editing room with this theatrical version and I could make a much better movie by moving certain scenes around and completely deleting others.<br />So that's my advice. Wait for a director's cut and skip the theatrical, you won't miss anything. It's all over the place. It starts off like a romantic drama between Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch, and Aaron Johnson, then it progresses into a crime caper, takes a slight tangent into a family drama with Selma Hayek and her daughter, becomes a buddy comedy with John Travolta and Benicio Del Torro for a scene, back to crime caper to end it, re-end it with an arthouse twist, plus, unneeded narration here and there throughout the film.

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Good app, but it is just another money sucking strategy. You could see my review on the Sketch W Friends page. That review is much better. Thus, making the app so indescribably better. On this app, the colors cost you money. REAL money! Good thing this app is free, because that would give me another to moan about. Another thing I don't like is that when the app sets you up with someone, they never answer back!This Apo is real dumb.It needs to get better. OMGPOP fix your app!

B003R0MF5S|5.0|Season four of Chuck can argued as the pinnacle of show's short, yet remarkable run. This season Chuck has begun to evolve into the chararcter we've always wanted him to be and do the remarkable things we hoped he would do. Even though Chuck was with us for only five short years, Chuck, Sarah, Casey and the rest of the gang has made this show a truly one-of-a-kind comedy for the ages.<br /><br />Great features on the Blu-Ray extras. Solid picture and audio transfer. If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I won't rehash others posts here -- just a few personal opinions, though:<br /> * Best Rush release in 30 years (Moving Pictures)<br /> * Definitely in their top 5 studio albums (in a quality class with Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves, 2112 + whatever your other personal favorite might be)<br /> * Best individual song composition since Subdivisions (track 4, The Anarchist).<br /><br />A must listen.  The album only gets better on subsequent listens as more of its musical depth surfaces.  After I listened to this album the 3rd time through, it just seemed to click in my head and I have been floored since.
0345803485|1.0|I am disturbed by this book...it is a shame, trashy and creepy and a woman who is smart and educated can do better than being a sex-slave...is that what a smart college graduate student do? just thinking about sex and about her....24/7 and never uses her brain? The worst part is that our public libraries are allowed to carry porn books like this trashy one, loan it to whoever, and participate in making this stupid psycho richer for nothing.
B005LAII0I|4.0|I did not expect too much from this one as I had heard it was all CGI etc.  However, I was quite impressed with Julia Roberts - very well done on her role as the wicked stepmother and quite sinister in a low key way.  I enjoyed it very much.

B002YVAT72|5.0|I don't usually go five stars, but this unit simply didn't have anything about it to detract more than half a star, so we round up to five.<br /><br />This unit was a great price (~$65) for what it is and how stylish it looks. Sure, it is all plastic, but it feels hefty and looks great. It has very large, stable, rubbery feet and a heavy turntable pad.<br /><br />Packaging was great, everything fragile was wrapped nicely, especially the needle area, and the shiny blackness was covered in a cloth-like sheath (cloth nice enough I used it to wipe the dust off the album I ripped).<br /><br />Operation: Just plug it in and run the USB cord (standard size and a cord is included) to your Mac or PC. I have a Mac, and while the provided software (on a CD-ROM) was rudimentary, it had me up and running literally within minutes. I opted to download the free Audacity, and it worked great to start recording. I will admit I was so out of practice with turntables that I was wondering where the \\"ON\\" button was, but all you need to do is lift the arm, move it over the album, and it spins up. Lower the arm and you've got sound. (When it is done, the auto shutoff appeared to work as you would expect).<br /><br />Signal appeared to be strong and clear, and I did not need to amplify the gain in Audacity to have resulting MP3s that sound like they are at the same level as various eMusic MP3 downloads of CD rips. It also wasn't overly amplified/distorted or compressed as far as I could tell, but I am not an expert in turntables enough to know how good the needle/head is. I ripped an album with no problem and it sounded good. The lid closes softly and snugly, so I assume that helps keep some noise off the needle, too.<br /><br />Other goodies. The RCA output is nice, though the cord is hard-attached to the back as opposed to being modular (jacks), but you can get adapters to make this pipe through a longer cord, a headphone jack, whatever. I didn't test that but assume it works. It's a niceadd-on. An even nicer add on is the line IN. I didn't test that either, but theoretically that would let you pipe through ANY analog source and convert it to a USB audio signal. I realize most computers are already going to have an sound recording line in, but this USB input can be a secondary route to get pretty much any sound source you want sampled, all in one decent-looking package.<br /><br />One simply doesn't expect an electronics device (spanning decades from phonograph tech to USB signals) to come so cheaply or attractively.  I sure don't, anyway.

1469984202|5.0|Wow!  This book has surpassed my expectations in every possible way.  I have alot of trouble finding good Sci-Fi like Asimov used to write, and frankly, I have very much disliked self-published stories.  I hate to say this out loud, but there's often a reason books are self-published and not picked up by a big publisher.  The reviews finally swayed me.  And I say \\"Finally\\" because while I've seen the name pop up a few times, I could never fully convince myself to take a chance.  I read one reviews that compared it to \\"Ready Player One\\", which frankly was the worst book I ever started and couldn't finish.  But in the end, there were *SO MANY* positive reviews I decided to gamble with $5.99US.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you this book is awesome.  I know that sounds lame, but then again, that's why I'm not a writer.  And while I can't articulate all the ways that a story is well written, I know when I've read a good one, because I end up thinking about it when I'm not reading, and *really* wanting to read what is going to happen next.<br /><br />I would say this isn't hard sci-fi, but is more old-fashioned sci-fi.  Simple story telling that moves fast.  This isn't RR Martin, where you're going to really get into how white the color white is, or read pages on pages of what was for dinner.  This is like reading an Asimov story where there's lots of surprises, reasonable twists, and you figure things out at the same time as the character.  There were several times where I figured out where the story was going to lead a character, and I didn't have to read far before the character realized it as well.  It's no fun to always be smarter than the main characters.<br /><br />So.  Once finished, I stood up and slowly clapped, because this book impressed me, and the author clearly has talent.

0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Gray by E. L. James is one of the most creative, over the top books I have read and I read all genres. It is an experience you will never forget. I don't know why anyone would  dislike this book. It is repetitive in some chapters, nevertheless, that does not take away from the experience that the writer has uniquely provided as a gift to the reader.<br /><br />The main characters Christian and Anastasia are so real that you could forget that they are in the author's imagination. You may find yourself lost in their world and never wanting to return to your own reality. You will love the dark, mysterious, handsome, gorgeous, rich Christian Gray and admire the tenacity and courage that Anastasia demonstrates when confronted with decisions that will change her young life.<br /><br />After reading book 1 you may discover that you can't wait to read book 2 (Fifty Shades Darker) and book 3(Fifty Shades Freed). It is the final chapters of book 3 that will answer your questions and have you begging for more. You may find as I did that you may need to read book 1 again to savor every bit of this sexual, erotic, heart-wrenching, unusual love story.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This series is outstanding, the writing is impeccable.<br /><br />After watching the first episode of \\"Game of Thrones\\" about a year ago, I became completely enamored of the show. The rest of last summer was spent reading the series of fantasy books by George R.R. Martin.  He understands how to create a fantasy world based on fact.  The characters, cultures, and situations are infused by events, locations, and people who were often very real and made their mark felt by us today. Look up the Lancasters, Hadrian's wall, the War of the Roses, the Mongols, and the Colossus of Rhodes for a start!<br /><br />The right actors were found to play very complex characters.  You may find that you have favorites.  Don't get too attached to any of them, though!<br /><br />HBO has put the necessary money into bringing the books to life with top-notch production values.  Every episode is better than most movies released today. George R.R. Martin brought his vision to the right place. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss show tremendous respect for the books and even bring dialogue directly into the scripts.  The show is fast-paced, intelligent, and has made all the other TV shows that I used to like - boring.  My only request would be to tone down on the nude scenes that might interfere with character development!<br /><br />As for the controversy about George Bush's head on a pike next to the Starks - they are the side that represents family values! His head is up there with Lord Eddard Stark, who died for loyalty and honor.  He is in very good company...
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great App. Good for pacing time in between books. The only drawback are the pop-up ads that sometimes appear at the start of a game every now and again. But I suppose that nothing is free.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Maybe I am biased, because I have loved Phantom since 1989. But, as one who has read/watched/listened to so many different adaptations of the Phantom story over the years, I have to say that I truly loved this. I did also read the book this was adapted from, and was not very impressed, but Andrew Lloyd Webber has once again worked his magic. Some people had issues with the setting...Coney Island, others had issues with the music or the acting, or the fact that Raoul is not portrayed as the \\"knight in shining armor\\". But if you go into this expecting it to be  a continuation of the Phantom era of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, then you may very well be disappointed. It is another story entirely, one that I think works well. I loved the music, the actors were superb, and the story haunted me long after the last music note ended. Now I must go out and buy the music CD so that I can properly aggravate my husband and teenagers by listening to it and signing refrains from it until they want to pull out all their hair, they would expect nothing less. BRAVO Mr. Webber! And thank you for bringing my Phantom back!

0985081821|4.0|I have followed Rebecca Hamilton on twitter for a while now and finally was able to read her book. The book was not what I expected (this is a good thing). I was expecting more of the same type of witch/vampire story line as many of the newer books of this subject. However, this was not what I got in The Forever Girl! It started out a little slow with the information but caught my interest almost instantly. After the first few chapters I didn't want to put it down, I just had to see what the next twist was! (And this book is full of twist and turns). By the end of the book I was disappointed that it was over and I would have to wait for the next to find out what Sophia will encounter next.<br /><br />On another note this book held a lot of interest for me due to the fact that one of my ancestors was tried and hung during the Salem Witch Trails.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever had any interest or curiousity in the supernatural/paranormal field! Very well written and holds your attention! Congratulations Rebecca, you have a new fan. Can't wait for the next in the series!!
1932100660|4.0|This book is an absolute must read for anyone concerned about preventing chronic disease. The evidence for a plant-based diet is so strong that after reading it I went back to vegetarianism and am easing into veganism. Anyone who feels that they have to defend their plant-centric eating choices will find plenty of health and ecological ammunition here. Campbell also gives us an insiders look at the political morass surrounding research, government, and academic interests in nutritional information. Once you understand how much industry money has influenced research and government guidelines you will be much better prepared to make enlightened choices and find your own way to long term health.<br /><br />So, despite thinking that anyone who is serious about their health must read this book, I still only gave it four stars. Campbell has found a crusade. It is obvious that along the way he has sustained some professional scars. Those become increasingly obvious later in the book as he starts to repeat himself. The last chapter in particular takes on a wounded tone. The book would have been better served with some judicious editing to sharpen the extremely worthy message. Read it anyway; this book could save your life.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I downloaded this from Amazon as lots of people had told me it was an excellent read - maybe I read a completely different book but I thought it was utter rubbish - very badly written with no real story.  I persevered for as long as I could but it continued to be more of the same - rubbish!!  I think the only reason people are buying this book is because of all the hype surrounding it - don't waste your money, I wish I hadn't.
B004JQN364|4.0|This cute little guy now guards my bookcase for me. It has a TON of detail for such a small figure, and even some articulation in the jaw. My only regret is that while the axe and sword are both separate items, it appears the axe is stuck in the holder on its back due to the shape of the handle; I think it'd be great to be able to change weapons, but apparently this is not an option, even though the axe wiggles freely in its holder.

B007NR9WBG|4.0|I was rather surprised that Warner's didn't put any additional features on this package other than a trailer, but it is a property they acquired from MGM, so perhaps they don't have much.  Or perhaps due to Natalie Woods death, there never was much in the first place.  Trumble could have been compensated for a commentary, though.  That would have been nice.  In any case, they have been true to the film's source elements, in remastering this release.  The aspect ration changes appropriately, simulating the original theatrical experience.  Both Showscan(which evidences a typical Panavision aspect ration, even though it's 65mm film) and a regular 35 millimeter negative, were used according to when the audience is or is not experiencing the device known as project Brainstorm.  And it works really well.  Very nice to finally have the film to view, as it was intended.  Recommended.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Because of all of the hype, I thought this might be a thrilling summer read. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money and the plot was uninteresting.

B000002OR4|5.0|The music from the movie, Schindler's List was superb.  John Williams brilliant moving music played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra is unequaled to most that I've heard.  Without Williams music, the power of this outstanding movie would not have been as heart tugging.<br /><br />If you enjoy classical-like music scores, please add this CD to your music collection.<br /><br />Everyone who has watched the movie will recall the Academy Award-winning best music score.  Also, almost all of the tracks on this CD are worthy of praise.<br /><br />Among my favorite tracks include:<br /><br />Track 4 - 'Remembrances' is especially moving.<br /><br />Track 7 - 'I Could Have Done More' was especially emotional.<br /><br />Track 13 - 'Remembrances' featuring the great Itzhak Perlman with John Williams moved me most deeply.<br /><br />And, of course, the movie's main theme will forever remain on our minds and hearts as the 'voice' and soul of this great and important film.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I waited almost two decades to buy this CD, except that Schindler's List was a very difficult movie to watch,  even though I've watched it many times.  When I've heard the music from the movie on other CD's featuring movie soundtracks, it brought back the horrors of the Holocaust.  Perhaps, this is why I delayed purchasing this CD.  Yet, now that I have it, I will cherish it.<br /><br />Do not delay buying this CD as I did.  You will feel elevated in awareness about the atrocities that occurred during the Holocaust, as you listen to this music masterpiece.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />July 12, 2012

B00169N0BK|2.0|Plan on spending lots of time to try to get your computer to recognize this device, every time you use it.  The drivers are very old and need to be updated. When you go to X-Rite's site and look for connection problems you will see ~ 60 different causes.  I finely printed up some instructions so I won't have to figure this out every time I use it.  I also have found it prints my pictures dark and I have to up my brightness in Photoshop 50% to get a decent print.  X-Rite's site says that's because your monitor brightness is set too bright.  Well, their color munki set it that bright.  X-Rite really needs to do some serious software updating and stop listing 60 different fixes or work arounds.  The software interface looks great.  It's just that it doesn't work that well.  I wouldn't recommend someone to spend $400+ until they faced up to the poor software and fixed it.<br /><br />Update 12-26-2012<br />I recently subscribed to an X-Rite web based seminar on color calibration thinking I could learn more about the problems I've had with the ColorMunki Photo.  They only covered their top of the line I1 Pro.  I asked about the colorMunki and was told it had its own software and they wouldn't discuss it.  I'm still very disappointed about their lack of support.  The software is still old and has not been updated in years.  I did learn (from the seminar) that if you're using brand name paper, you're better off to use the paper manufactures profiles for your particular printer than to use the ColorMunki.  If you are using 3rd party paper and aren't getting good results, then the ColorMunki is better than nothing.  If I had it over again, I would buy a good monitor calibration tool and not spend the money on the ColorMunki.  If you really need a high end system and are willing to spend >$1,000 then you will most likely get a product that is better supported.  And yes, you really do need to turn the brightness down on your monitor.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Well, it's a good book if you are over all the cheesey romance novels from the 90's and need a little spice.  And that's about all the positive things I can say besides read alone because suddenly you will be embarassed and aware of anyone around you once you hit the spice scenes. I only gave it 2 stars and not 1 because the spice scenes kept me from putting the book down...but it gets old.  Quick.<br /><br /> It truly is bad writing/editing.  I thought twilight was bad but at least there was some kind of plot. No plot and no purpose except to fill a fantasy.  I can't even get through the 2nd book.  The same lines are used over and over, making the book become mundane.  I can actually skip pages because its all the same stuff.  Not to mention that the story is unrealistic... (SPOILER ALERT) A young 21-yr old virgin who gives it up so quick and viciously and then lusts for all kinds of sexual power (including S&M?) HA.  Purchase if you have nothing else better to read, not worth the hype.

Chris Squire. the only original member of Yes, who has been in the group since the start back in 1969 and still is. And Steve Hackett, once a member of Genesis before he went away to create his personal music.<br /><br />They call themselfs Squackett, which is their two surnames together, and rather funny as well. But you won't laugh at their music. It's brilliant both in the ways they create the songs and how they play them. Steve has a magnific way to play his guitars, and Chris knows howe to play the bass. And both of them are very good singers.<br /><br />So if you want to have a nice time and good listening, you should buy this masterpiece.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|I watched for the same reason I still make myself view WWII movies: to never forget the senseless loss that so many suffered; to somehow ensure that their suffering was not in vain as it truly would be if we did not remember, and make it an absolute priority to not let it happen again!<br /><br /> As I watched, I was surprised by the added dimension of the search; for the key, for meaning to meaningless horrors, but especially to connections with others that were hurting as much as the main characters. I dedicate this to the heroes who faced the day-to-day fears head-on, who searched for hands reaching for the stability that, they, themselves longed for. Praying that you have found peace, meaning to life, strength and stability.

1451626657|5.0|After reading Catch-22 with a new draft card in 1966, and laughing at most pages, I found it unreadable circa 1998- somehow \\"where's the Holocaust?\\" got in the way, especially as the bases that might have hit the camps were in Italy.  Suspect that was mostly a disorder of my sense of humor, utter inability to suspend disbelief and let the prose carry you.    Today, especially on Audible, I find myself sounding like James Webb - here's a link.    [...]    Carrying the book around I Corps and laughing out loud - sounds like a classic, bottom-up evidence that this book can speak to a wild variety of people.
0062206281|5.0|And here's the awesome thing...  Within mere pages I was immersed in Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's Barcelona.  I love authors whose use of language is as idiosyncratic as a fingerprint, and Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is one.  I'd recognize his style immediately, whether his name was on the cover or not.  He has stated in the past that the four books that make up this tetralogy can be read in any order, and that was true enough for the first two books, but not, perhaps, for this one.  Here's why:<br /><br />Bookseller and bibliophile Daniel Sempere was at the heart of The Shadow of the Wind.  And while there was plenty of intriguing overlap, The Angel's Game told the story of writer David Mart&iacute;n in an earlier timeline.  The Prisoner of Heaven is the perfect bridge between these two books.  It's told in two different times, and it picks up on the stories of both Daniel and David after the ends of their prior novels.  And while there are many, many connections between these two men, the one at the heart of this novel is Daniel's best friend and bookstore employee, Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres.<br /><br />In the present day of the novel (1958), a visit to Sempere & Sons by a disquieting stranger who leaves a gift for Ferm&iacute;n is the catalyst for the older man to at last come clean about his past.  Flashing back to 1939, Ferm&iacute;n tells Daniel about his imprisonment during the war.  That was where Ferm&iacute;n met David Mart&iacute;n, and the man had a significant impact on his life.  There's more to the tale, of course, but that's all I'm telling you.<br /><br />If this novel has a flaw, it's that it's a super-quick read.  And it's just so completely enjoyable that it will leave you aching for book four.  As for this book, aside from its shortness, it is notably less complex than the prior offerings.  Less complex on its own, that is.  The way it fits into the puzzle of the larger story is pretty freakin' fantastic.<br /><br />As a writer, Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's strengths and weaknesses are fairly consistent.  As noted above, at the heart of this novel are characters we already know.  They feel well-fleshed to the point that I should be able to recognize them on the street.  Time spent at Sempere & Sons feels like visiting old friends.  Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's prose continues to be somewhat florid, but you know, I like it.  Not every author is going to write: \\"Outside, a cold Monday awaited him, sprinkled with snowflakes that drifted in the air and settled on passers-by like glass spiders hanging from invisible threads.\\"  If you're reading this review, you've already formed an opinion on the man's prose.  Love him or hate him, expect more of the same.<br /><br />And if you haven't already formed that opinion, my advice is to read the first two books in either order and then return to this one.  As for me, I'm waiting with mixed emotions for the conclusion to this fantastic quartet of novels.  I want it!  I want it!

1607053888|5.0|The bags in this book are all modern versions of classic bags!  There are 19 different projects in this book, each neatly divided into categories.  There are Small Bags, Clutches and Large Bags.  There are several (if not all) of the bags that I plan to make!  The instructions are very well written and there are photo illustrations for most of the steps.  It has very easy to understand directions for each bag.  The patterns are all at the back of the book.  Since I had the ebook, I wondered how well that would work, but I printed out the pattern for my first project last night and it printed just fine.  I think it might actually be easier than keeping up with pattern pieces that you tear out of the back of books.<br /><br />The small bags section has a pencil case, a case for your sunglasses, a wallet, and an adorable wristlet.  I plan to make the Metro Shopping bag first.  Another thing I really loved about this book is that each of the bags is shown in several different fabric combinations.  It gives you a great idea of how each bag would look with your own combinations of fabrics.

0062015176|2.0|Five stars for the poem, one star for the graphics and typography. This book is patently NOT the way to read this poem. Howl is momentum; Howl is movement; Howl is a wall of words that knocks you down and ties you up. This book was full of stills plucked from an animation and breaks up the wall of words over hundreds of pages. Both choices disservice both the poem and animation. The poem ends up broken into pieces. The pictures are indistinct and poorly composed, because they were never meant to be stills. The art itself borders on cheesy, with characters firmly in the uncanny valley and visual metaphor that is just too easy.<br /><br />This book is a dead thing. If you want a better experience, print the poem out in its entirety on a roll of butcher paper and read it out loud to yourself by candlelight in an empty room.

B005LAIGF0|4.0|I watched the longer director's cut after watching the theatrical release on streaming because I didn't want to miss a masterpiece. It turns out an extra half hour doesn't make or break this film, but I was glad for the exercise because I wanted more clues to the film's intentions. It has a naturalistic sprawl to it that challenges one to tie everything together neatly.<br /><br />Anna Paquin plays Lisa, a high-school student who inadvertently causes an accident and for her own redemption seeks some form of accountability for the victim's death. For all her noble intentions, she's not an entirely likable character. As a private school student in NYC, she reflexively knows she's entitled, but there's a fine line between being self-aware and self-absorbed. The victim's best friend warns her not to make the tragedy her own story. Adolescents don't feel more because they haven't experienced anything yet, they just feel more easily, she says.<br /><br />Yet we're thrown into sympathy with how and what she sees. She's in a period of life where she's figuring out what's important to her. There's a cacophony of voices out there and what happens to seep in is partly what will define you forever. She seethes with teenage contempt for her mother while speaking with affable deference on the phone to her father, who lives on the other coast. She makes her first forays into sexual experience with both frankness and diffidence. She's the most openly guarded young woman on the Upper West Side. Paquin plays her part with electrifying and unpredictable verve. Matt Damon, as her math teacher, eyes her warily like she's a bomb waiting to go off, which is both amusing and well warranted.<br /><br />Differences between the director's cut and the theatrical release: The main action is the same, but Lonergan flushes out her relationships with the various boys/men in her life, so later scenes don't seem so sudden. In the first half, it's helpful and in the second half, I actually prefer themore abrupt and ambiguous nature of the released cut. Lisa's mom has more scenes with her suitor and there are more school scenes, showing Lisa is involved in a play, effectively a therapy session for the kids and dividing the kids who are wrapped up in their earnest feelings from the ones who've chosen to take the view of ironic detachment. I could take it or leave it. But the reason I would recommend the longer cut are the shots of New York. The briefer shots of the city in the shorter version seem more perfunctory or maybe pretentious--yes, that is slow-mo walking. But in the longer version, they feel more organic. These aren't Woody Allen shots of the golden skyline and gleaming bridges. Rather they are views from buildings of other taller buildings. A cocoon of humanity.<br /><br />And what I loved most in both versions are all the small things that are finely observed. The universal furious hand-waving signifying the person in the room to shut up as ONE IS ON A VERY IMPORTANT PHONE CALL; Lisa walking on the street through a pack of boys, vibrating with self-consciousness and defiance. I know if I had seen this in a theater, we would have all laughed at the teen boy crying after an unsuccessful phone call. It may be a failure of this ambitious work that was so exalted that I remember all the small, domestic details more, but everyone will probably take something different from this movie.
0062082353|5.0|This book was my introduction to SEALS and frankly, to the war in Iraq.  As most civilian Americans, I've been afforded brief, sanitized glimpses of the war and Chris Kyle took me right into the dirt, smell and chaos of it. It was uncomfortable for my fat, dumb and happy self to read while lounging in my comfy chair when I was struck with how disconnected I truly was from the reality that MY COUNTRY IS AT WAR and what that means for those fighting it. The book is as real and stark a thing as I have ever read and the only thing that made it bearable was Chris Kyle's humanity throughout it all.  I almost felt like an observer watching him grow from childhood into a man committed to protect and defend, with a commitment demanding a cost I can't even imagine.  He was refreshingly unapologetic about doing his duty to the best of his abilities, even though his duty is one that could be abhorrent to those of us can't imagine taking the life of another.  He's the 'someone' that does the deed that has to be done that most of us don't want to think about.  I HATE the title of the book, and it does not reflect the book. Within the pages, you will find a modest man, who worked and sweated to hone his skills, and then use them on our behalf - and I suspect more to save the lives of his fellow warriors.  I'm a 62 year old grandmother with NO military knowledge or experience, and this is a young man I would like to give a hug and then buy him a beer.  To military personnel...he speaks your story.  To civilians...he speaks the story you should know.

0439023521|5.0|My daughter had me read this book because she enjoyed it so much. It is very well written and I had a hard time putting it down. I read all three in the trilogy over the course of 8-10 days. The story is not quite as complex as an adult novel, but it makes up for with tension and action. I would definitely recommend this for adults as well.<br /><br />The concept of the Hunger Games is intriguing. As I was reading, I kept thinking about the Romans and the parallels with the gladiatorial games. The Hunger Games pit adolescents against each other in a fight to the death with only one left standing. The arena was very interesting and is not \\"static\\". I don't what to spoil the fun, so I'll just say that similiar to the Colosseum, the arena for the Hunger Games is full of surprises. I've seen the trailer for the movie and I don't really want to see it. After reading all three novels in the series, I had all the places and characters firmly established in my mind. I tribute that to excellent writing. If you're like me, you'll be pulled into the story quickly and this will turn into a page-tuner of the highest order.<br /><br />The only few minor complaints I have are with fact that the mother has such a trivial role. I would assume this character would play a larger role given the main character is a minor. But, I attribute this to the novel being geared towards a younger audience. But, this doesn't take away the enjoyment of the story.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|First what could I say about the CD I love Justin Bieber let's face the fact I think almost evryone does and I love CD cause the type of music J.B. is using but it was a great cd.
B007P0Z9AY|3.0|This movie is ok and kind of gets lost in itself.  It had the potential to be sexy but it is not.  The relationships are not well developed and the characters are not  that appealing.
B004B8DH98|1.0|It seriously hurt to give this movie  one  star..<br /> I'd recommend  you do not waste your TIME or money on this  movie..
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of my favorite movies, a must see.  A beautifully told story and you feel like you really know the characters.  Well acted and superbly directed.
B0086700CM|4.0|Lots of fun for me and my 5 year old. Easy enough for her but challenging at the same time.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Never heard of most of the covers on this EP until Pentatonix did them because I am not normally a fan of pop music. When Pentatonix does pop covers and originals I love them though.  The only down side is they get stuck in my head and play over and over all day long :)
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|Saw this movie 3 times in the theatres and couldn't wait for the Blu-ray release! BUT, once I saw it was an UltraViolet release, I passed. This is what ruined GREEN LANTERN's Blu-ray release: UltraViolet BS.  Ultra-Violet is NOT a Digital Copy. After signing up for 3 different websites (UltraViolet, Flixster & the studio's), Ultra-Violet gives you access to STREAM the movie.  But you MUST have Wi-Fi capablity, or no movie!  You never \\"own\\" the movie, only the ability to stream it. What a waste and a disappointment.  DON'T BE FOOLED!!
0307595579|5.0|Nice little box set, bought this for someone at the time and they loved it (i think) haha. all 3 books in one place with a great price tag
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have. It contains the many different versions of the Bible, so no matter which version you prefer, it's there. If you prefer to relax and listen to the word of God, it allows you to do that also. The chapters can be put in alphabetical order as to make it easier for some (such as myself) to locate. It contains many more helpful tools. You have to give it a try. One word \\"Awesome\\"
B008KNUKVI|5.0|If you are listening to these previews here or any of their Youtube videos, before you dismiss it, be sure you are listening with earbuds, headphones, or good speakers because small PC, laptop or tablet speakers do not let you hear the full range of sound and harmony these five people create.  Deep bass, vocal percussion, and tight harmonies with really sharp arrangements of the four covers and two original songs (The Baddest Girl, Show You How to Love).  This is all just five voices, no instruments at all.  A truly amazing debut by this group!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Work just as expected. If your looking for a simple sharpening system that works this is your best bet. Not a professional edge but it does the job and it's easy to use.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Proof that great movies can be destroyed by bad marketing choices, John Carter is some of the most fun I have had at the movies all year. Based (moderately loosely) on E.R. Burroughs classic \\"A Princess of Mars\\" John Carter tells the tell of an earthman trapped on another planet, surviving and thriving among the often hostile alien locals, and saving the damsel in distress. The special effects are wonderful and the cast (despite being relatively unknown) deliver perfectly acceptable performances. Willam daFoe is especially awesome as Tars Tarkas, the Thark clan leader. This movie deviates greatly from the book (which I was inspired to read AFTER seeing the movie and am looking forward to completing the 11 book saga) but if Burroughs purist can look past the screenplay deviations they will see the bulk of Burrough's Barsoom brought to life quite faithfully. You won't find oscar winning performances or dialogue but you will find a fantastic fantasy adventure that can be enjoyed again and again. HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Oh, and who doesn't love Woola? =)
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Personally, I loved this book. The only reason i gave it four stars was because of how much it seemed like Message in a Bottle. You know that the woman in that book found something that wasn't hers and eventually found the owner? same thing in this book, but the roles were reversed. In all it was a good book. but it just seemed so... repetitive of him to write this novel.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am in love with this game. It is awesome! The unlocks are also cool. I highly suggest this game for everyone
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game ever but one thing is that it glitches once a while but other wise it fun to play scats and parona mini gameand unlock people from previous ice ages

B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game im so addicted i hope they have more like thisn plus its sooo free it was worth it
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Like most folks, I never even considered that anyone but Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. Thus, when I first heard about this movie, I dismissed it immediately as not worth my time.<br /><br />What a mistake that was.<br /><br />I still don't completely buy the theory presented in this movie, but, honestly, forget the theories and speculation and scholarly arguments and all that. Just WATCH the movie and don't let it raise your blood pressure and you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. It reminded me a lot of Immortal Beloved and Amadeus, two movies that don't make great history but do make PHENOMENAL films.<br /><br />Rhys Ifans is just fantastic in this movie. If you remember him from movies like Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, or Enduring Love you won't recognize him here. He was THAT good (and ridiculously gorgeous *sigh*). He deserved an Oscar nod in my opinion. I completely fell head over heels in love with him watching this. And yes, I cried at the end. A lot.<br /><br />Actually, the entire cast in this movie was spot on amazing. There wasn't a single performance I had any problems with.<br /><br />I have to also mention the incredible special effects. We were literally looking at Elizabethan London from a helicopter. It was that convincing and so beautiful.<br /><br />While the main story about Edward de Vere is beautiful, tragic and heartbreaking, what got to me most emotionally actually was the extreme reverence for the works. Just because the movie proposes a disliked theory doesn't mean that the author or director had anything whatsoever against the works themselves. Quite the contrary. They were treated with an almost holy reverence that really moved me.<br /><br />When asked what he believed, Rhys Ifans responded that he thought there was some basis for the theory but ultimately that wasn't what mattered. Rather, he hoped that this movie would renew and refresh interest in Shakespeare, breathe some new life into the works, and make more people want to read up on the history themselves. It's certainly working on me, I went out and bought new copies of my favorite plays to read again.<br /><br />Really, the only people who couldn't enjoy this, I think, are people who know WAY too much about the topic to put aside their knowledge or people who have trouble shutting off their analytical mind and just enjoying something beautiful.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you should get it its really fun!!!!!!!!!! =D :p awesome love it! love !it love it !!! love it awesome very good
B007WOFXAO|5.0|This is a box set of America's first five albums.  All five were hits and include several hit singles.  Two of the albums were produced by legendary Beatles producer, George Martin.  Their first album, America, spent 5 weeks at the top of the Billboard album chart in 1972 and was certified PLATINUM by the RIAA.  It was produced by British rock pioneer Ian Samwell.  Homecoming peaked at number 8 on the album chart and was also certified PLATINUM in the US.  Hat Trick hit 28 in 1973.  Holiday reached number 3 and was certified GOLD in 1974.  Hearts reached number 4 and was also certified GOLD.<br /><br />This set includes two number 1 singles (A Horse With No Name and Sister Golden Hair), four top ten songs (I Need You, Ventura Highway, Tin Man, and Lonely People), two other top 40 hits (Don't Cross The River and Daisy Jane), and well as several other songs that charted or received significant airplay on stations that played album tracks (Sandman, Only in Your Heart, To Each His Own, Muskrat Love, Baby Its Up To You, Another Try, Woman Tonight, and Old Virginia).<br /><br />An excellent collection if you do not already own the individual releases.  If you like 70's folk rock/pop, you should enjoy this set.
B003XYERRM|5.0|I have read SO many historial books about the Tudors and the Plantagenets but this book is hands down the absolute best ! I have savored it and have enjoyed every word written. I won't go into the story as other reviewers have already done a splendid job of that. If you have ANY interest in this era of history and especially in Richard III, this is a MUST read. I simply cannot say enough about it-JUST BUY IT AND READ IT !  It is my intention to purchase every other book this author has written. I love her style !!!
034580404X|4.0|I was interested in reading this after so much reference and talk on the media and web sites.<br />I have not been disappointed. I am enthralled with the characters and could not wait each day to get to the<br />next chapter.  I felt that some of the sex scene descriptions were overly long and getting to know the reason for Christians \\"Fifty Shades\\" and how he became so wealthy took way too much time...it should have been disclosed more in Fifty Shades of Darker. Having said that I did not want the story to end.
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|Being an American, I know I'm supposed to love this movie. I hate it. Capitalizing on a tragedy only works if the interpretation is good and this is just plain horrible. The fact that I have to explain why this film is bad is annoying in and of itself.<br /><br />I watched this movie with my room mate and at first I admired the cinematography and Tom Hanks was good as usual (not in the movie long enough though), and then I realized, \\"Wow. This Oskar kid is an annoying douche.\\" Halfway through I look over at my friend and he's weeping. Sigh. Of course. Make a movie with something to do with 9/11 and Americans start balling. No matter how crappy it is. The creators of this movie knew what they were doing. It's called manipulation.<br /><br />Anyway, the kid who plays the main character is not a good actor. I know he's supposed to have Asperger's and is a genius or whatever but he sucks. Plain and simple. As another reviewer pointed out, nowhere in the book does it say he's effeminate. And yet he's prancing around whining like a little bitch throughout the entire movie. Not that I have anything wrong with effeminate people but in this case it adds to the annoyance. He ruined the film for me but even if it wasn't for him the script itself is terrible.<br /><br />Don't watch it. I know there are more positive reviews than bad but that doesn't mean anything except Americans are easily deceived.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun app. Runs flawlessly on my bargain priced Polaroid mini tablet. Beautiful colors and animation. It's well worth the price.
0891419063|5.0|This book is heartbreaking and horrifying, one of the most graphic \\"reads\\" about Peleliu and Okinawa. Once read, never forgotten.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|While some may complain that this movie is predictable, the story made me smile.  It was beautifully shot and the story kept my interest.  I really enjoyed the humor and how innocent and sweet the romance was.  Ewan Mcgregor is such an endearing character that you just have to smile.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|The book was gritty and real. Particularly loved reading the witty thoughts of inquisitor Glokta. A fresh intersting world. Highly reccomended.
B007TVANDM|5.0|Pete is an entertaining and wholesome cat. My daughter loves him. She reads it in the morning, at noon, and before going to bed. The illustrations are child-friendly, colorful, and eye-catching. The book's approach is also very creative that children, who have very short attention spans, are glued reading it. The story also has a moral lesson which makes it just the perfect book for kids!
B00418NVMQ|5.0|While both their studio albums are excellent, Lzzy seems even more talented when performing in front of a live audience.  I'd highly recommend this video.  The only negative is the excessive editing flipping from one camera angle to another hyperactively.  Though I've seen far worse editing (e.g. when Steve Harris is allowed to edit for Iron Maiden).<br /><br />Lzzy's vocals are powerful & show true enthusiasm. Her love of playing in front of an eager crowd is quite evident.<br /><br />I like her even more after seeing an interview with her on YouTube recently where one finds she's really very down to earth.  I don't often given out 5 stars, feeling that tossing them around too much devalues them.  But this reaches a level that truly deserves all five.
055358202X|2.0|Others have already written very detailed accounts about why this book is not nearly as good as the third one. I honestly felt the same way about the second one though. Nothing happened there either. I am disappointed that every single character starts off with a goal, quest, something they need to do...and then they keep repeating what it is they need to do for every chapter after that, and in their final chapter they fail.<br /><br />(Mild SPOILERS)<br /><br />Brienne: I wish I wasn't so ugly and freakish. I wish I could have honor and keep my vow to Lady Catelyn. I wish I could find Sansa...and maybe Arya too.<br /><br />She repeats this mantra every single chapter she has...and then it all falls apart.<br /><br />Jaime: Oh if I only had my right hand, I'd still be badass. Tyrion was lying about Cersei, right? OR WAS HE?!! I will train so that I can be a badass again.<br /><br />Repeat four or five more times...and then nothing. NOTHING HAPPENS WITH JAIMIE.<br /><br />I have to say the whole plot of Dorne was incredibly disappointing. Hints of starting another war and then nothing. Again. The ironborn? Who the hell cares. I can't bring myself to give a damn about them because I'm too busy wondering where Tyrion is and what Jon is doing and why nothing is happening. I'm also pretty sick of Martin's fetish with maiming/disfiguring ALL of his characters. I'm sure by the end there won't be ANYONE missing a nose, ear, cheek, hand, face, skin or genitals.<br /><br />This goes on and on for every single character, making me want to poke my eye out and making me skim large portions of nothing but repetition of the same thoughts over and over. HOW IS THIS A BOOK? How do editors let it go by with so much repetition and so little character development? He really is horrible at pacing. Only the first and third book are any good, I haven't read the 5th one yet, but I think I need a break because the way I feel right now I'm likely to just go to the end and read each character's last chapter. The only chapters you need in a GRRM book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Forget the hype. Forget that it's labeled erotica.  Forget the world outside pages and read and treat yourself to pure entertainment.  Sure it's kinky but the real tale is of two fragile people each learning to love and open up and compromise. And YES it could be to HOT for some to handle. All three books a must read.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Working great while on the move with my Motorola Xoom tablet using ICS as the OS. Cannot complain on the price of this product when I got it.<br /><br />--Silversword<br />  Maui, Hawaii
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|Very adult. Not for the feint of heart. It's really true to the comic. Not like Marvel movies. The super hero costumes are very much like the comic depictions. Great movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever I love it want fun games but don't want to ruin your dock this is your app
B006DHAT5K|1.0|The main character of this movie is a filthy whore who plunges the depths of self-degradation in pursuit of some man to love her. Her male romantic interest is a morally corrupt libertine who uses and disposes of an endless series of one-night stands. The script contains some of the most obscene dialogue and situations I've ever heard or seen in a movie. Yet, for modern America, this is a \\"romantic comedy\\", and the movie's target audience of twenty-something, White, urban professionals will identify with the utterly soulless, amoral and promiscuous protagonists. What a sad commentary on our people. What a depressing testimony to the depths to which humans can sink.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so so much. It is very addicting, too. In my opinion, I think everyone who likes puzzles, should try this game out!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So much has been said about these amazing books that I can only echo the glowing praise. I wasn't sure that the story could live up to all the 5-star reviews, but it easily exceeded my expectations. The author writes characters that you quickly fall in love (and hate) with, and I shared their triumphs and failures equally.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give the author is that every time I thought I had figured out where he was heading with the story he still managed to surprise me by swerving in a different, and ultimately more satisfying, direction.<br /><br />Post-apocalyptic stories seem to be a dime a dozen these days, but this solidly one rises above the pack.
B008K8H9C6|2.0|This game felt more like a chore than a fun game. It was too easy and simplistic, it felt like nothing was really happening in comparison to Angry Birds.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|lots to do! great for big kids and little kids. very entertaining characters and always have goals<br /> to complete.  whole family loves it.
B005HSL626|3.0|It's a fun game at first. Very addictive or at least for an hour. I play fruit ninja on kindle fire and it always glitches in the bad way. First off every once in a while the screen would turn completely black! That got really on my nerves. Second it freezes every 10 seconds for a little bit. The last thing is last week I was playing fruit ninja trying to unlock something than the game froze for about a minute and than brought me to the home screen and all the fruits were gone!!!!!!!! I couldn't play the game for DAYS. Not recomended for kindle fire. Sorry........:(<br /><br />Plus the shadow blade is hard to unlock.  XD
B005P4PAZG|5.0|We came to this series late, but my partner and I absolutely LOVE this series!!  The dialogue is wonderful, and Jim Parsons is downright, hands down, AMAZING!! :) :)<br /><br />A show that celebrates INTELLIGENCE, wow, who'da thunk?  :)<br /><br />Give the show a chance and I swear, you'll be hooked! :)
B007BVOEPI|1.0|I read these books and they are definitely not for children.  I however was disappointed that in the way that HBO took every opportunity to show nudity, sex, and more nudity and sex.  I never considered myself prudish, but this was just too much for me.<br /><br />Needless to say I'm disappointed that HBO took the series and chose to cross the lines of decency, but that is to be expected I suppose.<br /><br />Just my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|It soooooo fun and adicting. you can unlock new carecters bounes and speed starters. get it one off the best free thing you will get
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|basically find the hidden object game dressed up with story line. not great but very good. hours of game play. somewhat repetitive but some objects are cleverly hidden so there is some challenge. however I don't really understand the mini games, which I tend to skip.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game I like it. the only thing is getting neighbors. people on face book don't really play. I play with my kindle.
0091947561|5.0|Having worked in product development and ensuring my clients successes over the past 17 years it is important to still remember 'what can we do differently' or 'why is it important to change?' or 'how are we going to apply technology in a different manner'?  Still many older industry are not truly effected by technology.  But it is fascinating to hear about evolution in footwear or with athletes and it serves a good reminder to never give up. I really enjoyed the book.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay. The third and final book of the Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen may have survived the arena twice, but she's now a piece in a bigger game playing in Panem. The districts are rebelling against the dictatorship of the rulers in the Capitol, and they need Katniss to be the face of the rebellion.<br /><br />The first time I read this book, I found it really boring and absorbed little. Now, more than a year later, I have found it both well written and captivating.<br /><br />I'll start with the praise. My main compliment is how believable the story was. The writing and prose are both excellent. Very few books can use both 1st person narration and present tense and Suzanne Collins does it extremely well. Katniss' internal thoughts, dialogue and actions are all extremely believable, and though many people are complaining that she turns `soft' I like that she finally shows some feeling...Apart from that the language she uses is extremely emotive, and again, Katniss' train of thought was both believable and easy to follow. I would also like to say that I was crying on and off from Peeta's 2nd propo until the end.<br /><br />Some of the subjects discussed are very different to those in the first book, especially if you compare the first half of the Hunger Games to the last part of Mockingjay. For the most part though, the development is sound and I feel Katniss has really matured from then. Even just in this book the journey she has come upon is both indepth and realistic. People complain that she has turned `soft' but actually she has become all the more believable. Because real people would not be able to cope with the things that Katniss has had to cope with, and stay the same. They would change. Even simply walking into the arena would change you.<br /><br /> Peeta's transformation is probably even larger, given that he was hijacked and then bought back. He copes in a credible way and Peeta's occasional transformations back into the `land of the hijacked' backed that up.<br /><br />The other point was that some of the things bought up in this book, especially madness, instability and the feeling of incompetence were unexpected, but once again convincing.  The plot was good, and the character development in particular excellent- nothing happened too suddenly, yet in a way it was unexpected.<br /><br />This book articulates very well some of the problems with this world, right now. I agree that it was one of the most thought provoking books I've read for a while. It made me reflect on some of the things that were happening around me in a way that very few books do. It is also one of the only books I've read that sufficiently captures just what it's like to only be a pawn in a bigger picture, to be a piece in somebody else's plans. District 13, the head of the rebellion, is in some ways no better than the Capitol, similar to in Animal Farm.<br /><br /> Katniss has really grown up, especially after Prim's death. Some may say that it was unnecessary, given that most of the events only took place because she had volunteered. But it shows how much Katniss has been through, and the fact that she has, in fact, changed a lot from when she first volunteered for her sister.<br /><br />My main problem last time was that the paragraphs were too long, the story too contrived. As a result I skimmed through much of it and often found myself disoriented and not knowing what was going on. I think that the writing was in a way too cluttered, without enough brakes. Once I started to get into it, I read it word for word and as a result got much more out of it.<br /><br />The only other problem I had was the ending. It happened a bit too abruptly, and I feel that it would have been possible to do a better job of describing exactly what happened after President Coin died. It was something that would not have gone unpunished, and we are still left with no explanation as to why Plutarch came to her defence. I also felt bad at the way she let Galego that way. Although I agree that Peeta was the right choice, and I understand why she felt that Gale was at least in some way responsible for Prim's death, Gale is still her best friend and at some point she needs to forgive him. It may be something she would have done before, but by this point she's been through enough to go to 2 and talk to him, if not straight away then eventually.<br /><br />There is also no talk about exactly how things got `better,' except that the arenas had all been destroyed. In my view felt that things would not have gotten much better under District 13, and would have liked an understanding of what exactly happened to Panem afterwards.<br /><br />This book was extremely different to what I had expected, and the other two books were a perfect, if unexpected, backdrop. It may seem strange that Katniss at no time participates in the Hunger Games, despite it being the series title, but in fact the arena is now emerging all around her. All in all, an excellent book which left me both drained and satisfied.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the trilogy of books was great. When they first came out<br />the news made it seem as if it was a very pornographic fithy book.<br />Once  I started reading it I realize it was a story about two consenting<br />adults, one of which because of their life when they were young had issues.<br /><br />I thought it was a very cute and well written love story. I enjoyed it very much.<br />Can't wait to see what the author E.L. James is going [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]to write to top this one.
B00846REIS|2.0|This was like reading a novel unashamedly plagiarized and done poorly.  From the very rich guy with a secret past, a VERY needy woman, family issues, a safeword etc etc this was like a poor clone of Fifty Shades.  There was so many sexual acts it actually became boring.  Don't waste your money on this.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this was an interesting combination of zombie and samurai. the levels get alittle difficult as the game progresses and there are more attempts to get you to pay for advanced features, but i would definitely recommend this game for others.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think its a great game when your really board or just want to play. its very and strangley addiecting! I really like it!
0345803485|1.0|Half way through thus far and it is terribly repetitive. I thought it'd be far more descriptive ...dirty...sexy...erotic. boy was I mistaken! Not anywhere near believable. Wish I had read the reviews first. Thank God it is merely a rental.
B0016K40KY|5.0|Shipped safe and sound.  Got it in time.  I bought this for my dad for Father's Day.  He is a huge Lawrence of Arabia fan.  He said he's watched it multiple times.  So...seems pretty good to me!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Redshirts was a fantastic story and incredible original idea. I would recommend it to all my friends. The reason I marked it down one star is that the three additional codas were interesting but they also seemed to be add ons that were out of place and didn't fit well with the original story.
B0086700CM|4.0|be ready to to be pissed. that you suck.....but its fun good quality. all in all good app you wont be dissipointed.<br />.
B002RHL8DC|1.0|The only thing good about this series is that it ended quickly. By and large a total waste of time. Watch it only if you're already suicidal.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! It keeps me occupied. I play at home and on my lunch break everyday. It's awesome!
B001EUMOP4|5.0|Mr black magic's tongue hisses the devils blues again.<br /><br />Listen to \\"Wrong side of the road\\" and you can die knowing you have heard the best blues song possibly written
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I'm really enjoying this cd. My biggest problem is that I find, \\"Nostalgia, ultra\\" so incredibly amazing and just sheer genius, that I can't stop playing it long enough to really give \\"channel ORANGE\\" a fair shake. Yes, I'm one of those people who had never heard of Frank Ocean until July 4th. Whatever the case, it is obvious that Frank Ocean is a legend in the making.
1594203334|4.0|I haven't read many parenting books, though I am an avid reader. I have found that I am very comfortable with trusting my insticts, and giving my 17 month old lots of \\"freedom to be\\" while imposing a few very strict limits. Well oh-la-la, it turns out, my family and I are so French! It was funny to me to have stumbled on this book and found a parenting style when I really didnt think I had one and I surely wasnt looking for one. I bought it mainly to find out how the French cultivate patience in their children.<br />The French parenting style is very common sense and I find that lacking in many parents I meet who jump on bandwagons and don't take time to think for themselves, so I think many could benefit from reading this book (not YOU of course, its those OTHER parents) haha.  Also I was very interested to read about the way the French government supports families.<br />Its not a perfect book but I found it entertaining, interesting, and got some good ideas from it as well. I'd recommend this!
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|couldnt really test it out cause my antec h2o 620 leaked and fried this cpu cause when i used the stock heatsink first and tried overclock i was hitting 70C. had to return it. will update when i get a replacement
B0086700CM|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good game, you play as a guy (I do wish there was an option to change to a female character if desired but anyways) and you stole some sort of ancient treasure,  a bunch of, gosh I don't even know what animals they are they look like monkeys but I don't know and their chasing you, the controls are good,  well thought out I just found them a little hard to remember but that's just me. the main idea of the game is just run untill you die,  so basically from falling, running into something or being hit with a random object. the objection of the game is to keep aiming for a better score just running a little farther, each time. This game honestly isn't for me I prefer games with more of a plot and a different appeal for each level or whatnot but I do know several people that would enjoy it so I gave it a three. I just don't understand all the poor reviews for this game hence the title.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|excellent imagery and very informative.Feels like you are there in the canyon & on the river.An affordable alternative to an expensive trip.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked it but I cant really play it when I wanna because it ((most of the time))  says that force close of wait bull ...but all in all its a good game and I highly recommend this game to anybody...it has some kid game for the kids and some mature game for the grown ups!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is much better than book 1 in the series. Love this series. May reread it, it was that good.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book 2 was not as trashy as Book 1.  A story begins to develope. It is so unbelieveablre a college grad would be as dumb in todays world.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series of books. Did not think the ending was great but I am thrilled I decided to read them. May reread them.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm just adding a 1-star review in the vain hope that we'll see the original (1978-82) theatrical versions of this trilogy on Blu-ray sooner rather than later.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids and I enjoy this app.  They want to check it everyday!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone else with kids!
B0086700CM|5.0|The most amazing app in the app store.  should get back up to #1 in most popular! lags sometimes but if your good then that doesn't matter! instant download is a must
034552554X|3.0|The publicity for this novel breathlessly proclaims that the \\"little-heard-of\\" language based on the meaning of flowers is the basis of Vanessa Diffenbaugh's \\"The Language of Flowers,\\" as if this were some thunderous new revelation. Heck, I knew about the \\"secret\\" meaning of flowers when I was in high school. It was pretty well known that back in the Renaissance or even earlier that men would court their ladies with flowers that had coded messages. So I wasn't bowled over by the subject matter. I was more interested in seeing what Diffenbaugh was going to do with the material to make an interesting novel.<br /><br />Really, the story didn't exactly carry me away. First, it's told in a curious present action, past action style, in which the past is allowed to catch up with the present. Now only is it confusing, but it makes me wonder how Diffenbaugh pulled it off. While I was figuring it all out, it pulled me right out of the story. This is something that a novelist should never allow. The rule of thumb os to always keep the reader deeply embedded with the action and don't let writing flourishes distract them.<br /><br />Secondly, the protagonist, Victoria, is not likable, and despite efforts to restore her to honor as the novel goes on, I never warmed up to her. So, it's hard to feel that the love and attention others lavish on her make sense when she's so churlish and irresponsible. I often thought she needs to see a psychologist.<br /><br />As to how the flowers fit in, Victoria and her sometime lover speak to each other through flowers. Indeed, Victoria needs the flowers because she can't seem to be civil when speaking to anyone. Later she makes a fine business out of creating floral displays with meaning for trendy San Franciscans. But she never seems to learn proper manners.<br /><br />On the whole, I was bored with much of the book and wondered why most of the characters, who were nicely drawn, didn't just walk away from Victoria. This novel really could have been much better.been much better.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Bought this with my Nikon 5100 camera about a year ago. Price was around a hundred dollars. Has worked great and is just the right size to always have with you and to have on the camera.  Provides enough light in almost all the situations. It has been very good on batteries and is giving me the perfect lighting with the dedicated camera.  I have nothing but good things to say about this flash, which I can just put in my pocket when the situation dictates.It comes with a very nice soft cloth case. Easy to use and great for those situations where you need more then the flash on the camera.  The seller was excellent on the delivery.
B0086700CM|5.0|sweet game its great. I played it on my friends iPods and other electronics and liked it. got a kindle so I got the app. still like it. one time with all games it slowed down or was glichy but then soon enough it went back to normal. I think it did that because I had the app for a while. but anyway, I still love the game. would HIGHLY recommend. have fun!!!!<br />  [Gill's Reviews]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this app! now i dont have to go to settings&gt;device&gt;battery power c: i highly recommend this app to anyone! have fun and enjoy

B0086700CM|4.0|its a very addiction game that I cant seem to set down once I start playing it.. I love it!!
0142410349|5.0|... that the composer Leos Janacek died before Roald Dahl wrote \\"Fantastic Mr Fox\\"!!! Janacek's glorious opera, The Cunning Little Vixen, is based on a cartoon tale of a fox adopted by a huntsman. Janacek's sardonic humor seems identical to Dahl's. The two of them are magnificently disrespectful toward pomposity and sanctimony, irreverent toward everything except the wonder of Life.<br /><br />I read this book and perhaps every book written by Roald Dahl to my son when he was small, until he turned around and read them all back to me. He learned more about Reading thus than from any school he attended, and more about decency than from any church.<br /><br />Alas, foxes are not as endearing in ordinary life as they are in Dahl's or Janacek's fantasies. Living foxes, especially the red species, are exquisite to watch but nasty to live near. Foxes are snappy little beasts and single-minded stalkers. They're defenseless except by skulking. Pursuing them with dogs and on horses was surely among the most repugnant vices of the degenerate British upper class. [Apologies to Anthony Trollope, that grand humane novelist who shamefully slaughtered foxes at every opportunity.] Roald Dahl's humor often had a cruel edge, but in his defense it must be noted that he turned it chiefly toward his own species.<br /><br />The opera:<br />[[ASIN:B0043CT91M The Cunning Little Vixen - Janacek]]

B004LROUNG|5.0|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg operate a Chicago 'boutique' law firm but, are far from a boutique firm. There dog nicknamed AC, for ambulance chaser, says it all. Oscar is an attorney in his 60's who is grumpy all the time and worried about the bottom line and does not want to spend any extra money. Wally who is in his 40's, a recovering alcoholic and womanizer, is constantly looking for his 'gold mine' in the perfect case and will advertise on anything for business. Oscar and Wally are managing with the cases they have to help pass time and hopefully pay the bills.<br /><br />David Zinc is on his way to work one day realizes just how much he really hates his 6-figure job. He finally has had enough and just 'snaps' and quits. After going on a drinking binge that day, he ends up at the Finley & Figg law office. He realizes that this is where he belongs and that he needs to work there.<br /><br />Wally meets Lyle, the son of a client who has just died. Lyle is convinced that his dad died from using the medicine called Krayoxx. Wally suddenly knows that this is the gold mine that he has been looking. If he can just find a few more cases, he can take the mammoth pharmaceutical company for wrongful death and near death of patients who have used this medication.<br /><br />One his first day at the office,David thinks that maybe he made a mistake in joining this little firm as it is not quite what he thought and he is unsure of some of their practices. David decides to stay on and becomes involved in the Krayoxx lawsuit. David soon finds out that neither of the partners have ever tired a case in the federal courts and they don't have the slightest idea as to how to go about it. In the meantime they have decided to partner up with Zell and Potter and big law firm in Florida that specializes in this type of law. David gets a crash course in how to handle a case in a federal courtroom and learns more about his coworkers.<br /><br />On the side, David is investigating a case of a5 year old, that looks like it may not end up anywhere as there is no way to find out who is blame for the brain damage caused by lead poisoning from a toy. David feels bad for the family and becomes close to them.<br /><br />I have to say that I really enjoyed this book even though it started out a bit slow for me. It was they kind of legal suspense/thriller that I have come to know and enjoy from Grisham and as I got closer to the end, I found myself turning the pages as fast as I could read them.
055357342X|4.0|I thought this book was well written and the story was very gripping. I found myself flipping ahead to the characters next chapter so I didn't have to wait to see what happened next. I enjoyed this book more so that the first two but it's hard to say that because the first two setup the characters so well that the third was an 'icing' of sorts.<br /><br />GRRM is the only author that had made me want to punch him in the face, and then 3 chapters later, give me chills, make me stand up and yell horray, etc etc and say 'thanks'.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an alright game tunes of fun cant get enough. just get mad at times cause some of the games are hard smh. ive been stuck on the snake game forever. heeeeelllppp
0307730697|5.0|This is by far the most inspiring story I have ever read. Truly an amazing man and warrior. This is a must read for anyone interested in the Special Forces and stories of people overcoming obstacles. What an incredible story. I read it three times. Absolutely LOVED IT!!!
0061692042|1.0|Hard to believe this guy has won major awards. He's surely coasting on reputation now! This book is about as exciting as watching a Kroger truck unload. Boring characters. Boring plot...if there is one. Boring read. Even at Amazon prices, save your dough. Go watch an ant crawl. Same thing.
B005XTLAQQ|4.0|My 6-year-old daughter loved that Barbie. All details were handled carefully and the final product is excellent. But the clothes needs to be special care to not tear.
291193976X|4.0|There is something special about reading a book filled with heart and passion in one's own language.  Stephane Hessel captured the souls of many dormant too long.<br />More people in the world need to experience Indignation!<br /><br />The book arrived from France in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I will order from this vender again!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Most of the reviews I read were good so I decided to order one and I'm glad I did. I love it.
B003NTSBUG|3.0|This movie left me guessing until the end.  In fact, I'm still not sure I understand all the twists and turns.  If you like dark mysteries, this is a good choice.  I'm going to watch it again to catch what I missed.
1250000971|5.0|Good buy!  Hardcover edition at a better price than Sam's, etc. I read the previous book on the subject and really enjoyed it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought my original set in Oct 2011.  I say original because I have now had THREE of these.  Same issue on each one, waiting on the RMA on the third one.<br /><br />The USB connection on the set is NOT designed for repeated unplugging.  The connection that is soldered into the board is done so poorly that it will break.  First  you will feel it loosen, eventually when you plug it in it will do nothing but wiggle.  This leads to the next issue, the battery can't be charged, even when it is plugged in, so it becomes a useless item.<br /><br />The Pros(when working):<br />Good connectivity through out most of the house<br />good sound<br />mic quality is ok (Used in Teamspeak, TF2, BF3, Portal2)<br />Personally I've had no interference with our wireless phone system(6 GhZ)  bluetooth enabled phones, wireless routers (Dlink DIR-655) etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Issue Mentioned above<br />Earmuff connection/breakage issue<br />out of the box sound is initially bad (can be fixed if you install the drivers)<br />I have no idea of the battery life/longevity<br /><br />Another Pro:<br />IF you can manage to find the phone number for Logitech (they do bury it in their website) the customer service reps are nice.<br /><br />The last con I can think of... my chair eating the corded headphones I have as a replacement in between sending them in to be fixed.  Not really their fault though.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story is a psychological thriller about a married couple. Excellent twists and turns keep the reader off balance to the end. Best book I have read in the last couple of months.
031261246X|4.0|I can't help but wonder if this isn't a repurposed project that the author conceived or wrote when the y2k issue was prominent: right before the millenium changed in 2000, many were worried that computer systems that we blindly depend upon would experience shut-downs or malfunction due to limits in the math with which they were originally programmed.  I guess I have to read the book to see if this concern is unfounded :)
1469984202|5.0|So much more than I expected!! Kept me up all night! I cannot wait to find out what happens in Silo 17!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Excellent product, playes perfectly, no scratches or cracks, arrived very quickly, even with standard shipping it was here within a few days. Very pleased.  Special effects are amazing, 3d isnt quite the best, but still a worthwhile buy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I have ever had. even when you cant pass the game that u r playing
B00881VLCE|5.0|great puzzle game. glad I found one I like. love all the pictured to choose from. will definately keep this app.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved it<br />you should totally get this game<br />it is really addicting<br />I cant stop playing it<br />I rated it a five<br />amazing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun but requires a lot of effort to complete. other than the difficulty the variety and general quality is amazing for being free.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Overall, the movie was pretty good. The special effects were stunning. This revision of Disney's Snow White has a dark side to it, but interesting none the less. The costumes and scenery were breathtaking. The pure evilness of the Queen is clearly displayed in this version, an aspect not seen before.<br /><br />The flow of the story at times seemed abrupt. Stewart's performance was adequate, showing very little emotional variance. It was interesting to see Hemsworth as a character other than his acclaimed role of THOR. It was refreshing to see a heroine take charge rather than the usual \\"Prince Charming saves the day\\" scenario. I would like to have seen Stewart's character involved in more fighting scenes, especially when she confronts the Queen.<br /><br />One aspect I really did not like was the ending because it left you hanging. Personally speaking, there should have been some sort of epilogue following the conclusion of the film. Never the less, it was an entertaining movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoy play dis game so much. Dis da best game eva. They need to make another one.  I just hot da game and I'm already on level 10 dis game rock.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I bought this book after seeing all the reviews and what a waste of time and money it was. College is NOT like high school, it was extremely poorly written. I absolutely had to write a review to let women know that a violent, cocky man is NOT the one to choose over a man she could have had with class and humility. Whoever the editor was of the book did a horrid job on editing. Missed words and typos. The only reason I gave it even 2 stars was for the fight scenes. There is no description of the characters and everything just jumps around from scene to scene. No descriptions. This is a horrible writer. Knowing that it even got published makes me want to write something just as bad just because I know it'll get published. If women REALLY want a trashy dude like this, I'm absolutely terrified for our society. I don't want to live on this planet anymore if this is considered a \\"good read.\\"
B007V80WUC|4.0|With the exit of the best prog band of all time befor us, I am delighted to say that bands like CM, Symphony X and Solid Vision are ready and well positioned to carry the torch.  If I did not have these bands to focus on, I would basically be depressed in the wake of the fall of Dream Theater( new album is trash without Portnoy). Anyway, brothers extraordinaire Haugen freekin rock!!!! Hooks , melodies and strong musical arrangements are surprisingly tangle free and embellished by one of the best voices in the bizz-M.E.!!! The keys are also crisp, concise and unusually well executed .<br />I will say that the lean is a bit poppy but extremely well united with the strong musicianship and talent of the band , in a way you very rarely hear.<br />I give it a strong buy rating.
B004ZT9QM0|5.0|One of my favorite aspects of this show is that the writers seemed to have, in the quest for stories, looked at actual mythologies on which to build or interpolate -- this episode being a classic example.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />My only complaint is that the alien's actions (as perceived by the humans initially) seemed incredibly farfetched if we're to believe that it was based on an automated medical protocol (what's with the outbursts of apparent anger and with using music as an anesthetic?). Then again, admittedly, once you begin to question these kinds of things you'll quickly find yourself concluding that nothing in the show is possible and then remember embarrassingly that you're watching a fictional television series.
1439153663|5.0|I love historical fiction and was intrigued by the story line of a white Irish girl living with slaves as an indentured servant. Tge characters in this book show the reader what a true family us and they never stop fighting for each other.  I fell un love with every character and felt as if the events were unfolding in front of me. I would recommend this book to anyone...u just won't be able to stop reading it!
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I have always been interested in the paranormal and the supernatural. This is what attracted me to read The Forever Girl - other than the very nice cover, of course. However, there is more to this book than just Wiccan stuff. There is self-discovery, love and even some sex! It is definitely something unique from your average supernatural stuff.
0439023521|5.0|This book was a fast read! After it arrived, I was not able to put the book donw and finished it in 3 days, and I am not a fast reader. The story, plaot with twist and page-turning excitment kept me glued to the final page!
B0063IH60K|1.0|I thought I was goining to like this game - and at first I did. But I am tired of the ads.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book really annoying. I deleted it from my kindle. The erotic scenes take so long and are so frequent that it feels like really long commercials during a movie. It made me lose interest. But, to be fair, I did not realize that it was an erotic novel.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I got this app for the free app of the day. I have liked it so far you can do plenty of things on it like cropping and putting frames and what's ever else there is I haven't any glitches and ive enjoyed it so far however I did get it free and I myself wouldnt pay five bucks for it
B006ZZANG0|4.0|I bought Rufus's first album in 1998 and fell quickly for his in-love-with-being-love, expressive, operatic style. After that Rufus made some more expressive, if eccentric, albums showcasing his outstanding song-writing talents and great singing voice.<br /><br />Now, with 'Out of the Game' Rufus seems to have settled completely down to the cosy style of easy listening. At first I was disappointed. However, this is not rubbish easy listening, this is high quality Burt Baccharach kind of easy listening. Most of the songs are well crafted but sound simple relative to his back catalogue. The arrangements are ok but not great. Some songs I like, some I don't. This album is not as expressive as his old albums. There do not seem to be any problems to solve anymore. The singing is relaxed and flawless. The balmy song 'Candles' is the most expressive song on the album and it is the one which got to me first and remains the best song on this album in my view. It is a gem which clearly carries greater weight than the other songs.<br /><br />In short, with this album I think Rufus reinforces his reputation as an uncommonly clever singer-songwriter but at the same time the distinct loss of his earlier edge (which is absent on this album) will probably disappoint some of his prior followers. For me, the way his musical style has developed is logical. He has matured well.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am not sure which is most disturbing the book itself or the interest it has generated. I liked the ending but don't see why there is a second book, or third.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I actually purchased this book due to all the hype and the fact that it was a \\"New York Times Best Seller\\" ... well, if this is a best seller I think I'll stick with underground authors. This book was boring from beginning to end. Anastasia is childish and annoying (and those are her good qualities). And although the description and character development of Christian Grey is the ONLY good thing about the book, how many times can a person describe his gray eyes? I don't now what was more bothersome....the continuous repetition (\\"oh my\\") or the obvious use of a thesaurus to the point where an everyday person would need a dictionary by their side while they read this book. And I won't even get started on the whole BDSM theme...this book does not do it any favors. Just because the character uses the f-word alot and ties someone to a bed does not mean its BDSM, nor does it explain what BDSM is.<br /><br />I completely agree with every review of 1 star or less...I wish I read these reviews before buying this book. And Hollywood wants to turn this into a movie??????<br /><br />Overall, save your money. However, if you are looking for a great \\"girl meets boy whose really a controlling Dom and introduces her to BDSM\\" with great character development and the promise of everything Fifty Shades of Gray SHOULD have been, may I suggest S&M (Scott & Mariana) by Vera Roberts.
B000J025AE|4.0|The Poseidon Adventure was a good movie.  I am always leery of remakes but I enjoyed this one.  The story and characters were modified, but it actually added to the tension of the story line.
B0085HWZDK|4.0|This is a Great Performance from Robert plant. However, I don't think this is the complete performance. Also, this concert is interrupted by interview segments between many songs. These two issues is the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars.
B008578PMU|4.0|My other half is a history buff and really wanted to see this movie.  We both enjoyed it.  The story gave a great picture of the discrimination the pilots had to overcome and also of the issues they faced individually and as a squadron.  I love stories of the underdog having to prove himself and coming out on top.  Discrimination in any form is terrible.  Overcoming it is awesome!  Good movie!
0345803485|1.0|This book is an axample of great salesmanship - poorly written and stupid - I could barely finish the book - I know 4 friends who bought it and never even finished reading.  This author would be broke if he had to refund the price of the book if you didnt like it - it stunk and I feel suckered - PT Barnum was correct
B007PS0X0W|1.0|I normally dont write reviews but for this movie i thought i would make the exception. I was sorely disappointed very weak story compared to the rest of the series. felt like the movie was only half way done when it ended. i can understand if this was a bridge for the next one, but renting it would be the way to go. it felt like it could have been an extended trailer. bummer.
B007EC6FIS|4.0|When I first started listening to the songs on this album, I was drawn to the melodies but felt a tad disappointed by the lyrics.  I had always admired Keane's lyrics -- they struck me as creative and sometimes almost poetic -- but some of the lyrics on Strangeland felt too simplistic and cliché (I try to overlook the kindergarten-like rhyme of \\"go\\" and \\"know\\" on \\"On the Road\\").  But I adore Keane so much that it seemed impossible that I wouldn't fall in love with this album eventually.  And I did.  The strong melodies, the musical arrangements, and Tom's incredible vocals more than made up for what I thought was the only real flaw of this album.  I also have to say that having seen Keane in concert recently -- their show at the Orpheum in L.A. was incredible, and that's putting it mildly -- made the songs on Strangeland really come alive for me.  I have listened to little else over the past couple of weeks.<br /><br />The deluxe edition is well worth paying extra money.  \\"Strangeland\\" and \\"Run with Me\\" are my favourite bonus tracks.<br /><br />I also strongly recommend watching Keane live.  They sound great on the CD but sound even more sublime live.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is exaclty like Mario I have been looking for a game like this but never found it it is really good
B000Y0Q6YU|4.0|Pretty darn good episode; the description doesn't even cover half of what goes on. Anyway, good amounts of action and such and a certain twist. Get to see what Samantha Carter looks like without her makeup too!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|About half way through the book and it is great.  It is a fun, light read that I have a hard time putting down.  I really enjoy the book!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this game is a lot of fun to play.  the objects are easy to see.  you can find them fairly easy but still challenging enough to keep your interest.  worth the money.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|with some flashlight apps you would expect them not to work but this one does I even did a test to see if it worked and you could actually see in a dark room
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Utter rubbish , don't waste your time - nothing more than a spiced up Mills and Boon.  Won't be reading the remaining books.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|My kids loved it and you can't beat the price on amazon.com.  Same movie as I remember as a child!  Only issue was a little language not appropriate for my smaller children-didn't realize this since we must have seen a sensored version on tv previously.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|If you are the type of reader who needs instant gratification, right from the first word of the first page, this book is not for you. The first 20% (for us Kindle readers) is very slow. It is filled with alchemical, historical, mathematical, etc information that you may or may not need further along in the novel and it is tedious. This book is also mostly first person, except for certain chapters where the POV switches to third person. Honestly, first person, not my favorite. And the change of POV makes it obvious the main character couldn't expose everything the author wanted.<br /><br />Having said that, once the book gets rolling, it is quite engaging, and take it from me, you can skim most of the boring, tedious, \\"I ate this\\", \\"I wore that\\" and \\"I drank that\\", which makes the story move faster and the reading more palatable.<br /><br />Is Matthew a typical vampire? Not really, if you're a nosferatuphile. Is Diana a typical witch? Not at all. But maybe that's why they seem to work. Altho, I do agree with other reviewers who called the romance rather contrived. But when I read a book of this nature, I'm not looking for reality and I can overlook a bit of contrivance for entertainment purposes.<br /><br />To liken this book to Twilight I feel is an insult to this author. While I did read that series (it's vampire after all and I am addicted), I am not a fan of the storyline nor the author's technical prowess. Ms Harkness has the chops to be a good writer. She has an accessible, evocative style, sometimes a bit too barren and simple and other times overblown and aggrandized but she just needs a bit of polish. Some of the language comes across as a child's first writing project and other parts are simply inspired.<br /><br />I think you'll all like the animated Bishop house, an edifice with its own personality and sense of hospitality. It's one of the better characters in the novel, and one of my favorites.<br /><br />The ending was predictable -- but I haven't reada great twist in quite a while -- and it inevitably led to a sequel which was just released. I'm at about the 20% mark in that book, and it starts much more quickly.<br /><br />All in all, if you have patience, like light paranormal romance with a lot of historical fact and scientic discovery thrown in, you'll like this book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for what it was. That being said my complaint is not with the book itself but with the following:<br /><br />I have a few friends who have a Kindle, and would like to borrow my book, however either the publisher or rights holder will not allow this to happen. If you purchase this in Kindle format you cannot at this time loan it out. I paid the $9.99 which is the same price at Barnes and Nobles, Sam's, etc... but because I decided to purchase the Kindle version I cannot loan it. However if I had purchased the actual book I could have loaned it to as many people as I should choose.<br /><br />Buyer beware. If you are going to purchase a Kindle version of a book (and this is not Amazon's fault but rather the choice of the publisher or rights holder) make sure if you have any thoughts of lending it to someone else you check out if it can be lended in advance. I will check more closely in the future for certain!

0451450523|5.0|This isn't me telling you what the book is all about or anything like that. I love the book, I started with the movie, but none of that matters to the people who don't understand this work of art.<br /><br />I could go on forever on the beauty and the emotion behind the story, how it makes me cry every time because she learns to love, only to learn how to regret as well and lives her eternal life as the only unicorn who knows these emotions; but the real point I want to make isn't that.<br /><br />For people who don't understand the book, why it lingers in parts, why the wording is the way it is, all I can tell you is how I read it: through a unicorn's eyes.<br /><br />If we can read sci-fi through the eyes of an alien or other fantasy through the eyes of a hobbit, a wizard, a werewolf, an elf, why can't we simply sit and read through the eyes of a unicorn?<br /><br />I felt it was all about realizing the purer aspects of human nature, the raw emotion the first time we ever felt them. Imagine living for hundreds of years without experiencing your first love, finding him so strong and true and kind, and then finding out you can never EVER be with him and that's how tragic The Last Unicorn is and how beautiful it is.

B000687M48|4.0|I am a huge fan of Evanescence and own all their music CD wise not singles.  I loved each and every song off their first CD so of course I enjoy listening to all the songs here on their live concert of their first CD.  The added benifit to me was track five when they did Korn's thoughtless.  Also in my viewpoint the last track missing was very powerful music wise and lryics wise.  Then for all their fans out there adding in the live concert on DVD was just an added bonus as I see it, because you really get your money worth that way.  So if you want a live CD with an added DVD of the concert plus the sound quality is actually very good, then pick this CD/DVD up and savor their music by yourself or with your friends.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|Evanescence return with the CD the open door very haunting music, powerful rock parts, and three soft song which the only soft song I thought was decent enough to like was the last song Good enough.  The rest of the album is very good, I just didnt care for track six and eight.  But you make up your own mind by listening to their music with an open mind.  I personally gave it 4 stars only because of track six and eight.  I think Amy Lee is an amazing singer and look forward to all the CD's they put out as this band keeps going strong and hopefully lot more music for them.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|great sounding cd box set. this is a must have.. Sound is excellent..!!!  relive the journey of \\"Pink\\" .  This is a top 5 CD of all time
B000089RVX|5.0|What can be said about Evanescence first album that hasn't been said yet.  In my viewpoint this band came out with a powerful CD full of great rock music, and an amazing soft song that sure was played over and over again on the radio.  Just like everyone else I loved the song Bring me to life, but I also enjoy track six Tourniquet, and track 11 Whisper, and one of my personal favorites track three Everybody's Fool.  But the whole CD rocks start to finish and if your into female singers then Amy Lee of Evanescence is a good one to listen to.  So pick this CD up if you love your rock music and want to amp up your bedroom or car radio with her music.

0345803485|4.0|I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James with preconceived notions. By the time I reached the end of the book, I did a complete flip, shocking me to my core.<br /><br />First, the writing is atrocious. No way to get around that fact.<br />Echoes. \\"...He smirks. 'Are you smirking at me, Mr. Grey?' I ask sweetly...\\"<br />Repeated and unnecessary dialogue tags.I whisper. He whispers. He orders/warns/breathes.<br />Profanity that plops out of nowhere like a dead bird falling from the sky.<br />Bad sentence structure. '...I can almost hear his sphinxlike smile through the phone...'<br />Internal dialogue that slows the story line to a crawl.<br /><br />All this and more tooth-grinding moments.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />Hidden in the horrible writing and the sex scenes that aren't worth my time to read or review, there is an interesting story. Talk about flummoxed. Here was a book I intended to hate. The sarcastic notes I took as I read the book attest to that fact. Halfway through the novel, my attitude changed. It took that long for it to hook me.<br /><br />This book could have been so much better. But the crappy writing and subject matter make it too easy a target for a discerning audience.<br /><br />BTW, this is NOT a knockoff of Twilight. The comparison is ridiculous and feeble to the max.<br /><br />Will I buy the next in the series? Probably not. I am curious about the outcome of the characters though. I cannot recommend shelling out ten bucks to read it. But don't make up your mind on reviews or sample chapters alone. I've made that mistake in the past.<br /><br />Summary: This book surprised me and the ending made me want to know more. If re-written and edited by a knowledgeable person, this novel would have garnered good critical reviews.<br /><br />Too bad voyeurism and poor writing overshadowed a good story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is well worth it! Totally fun and simple to do. And free!?! This app is the whole deal!
B004XWLN20|4.0|First, about the packaging. So many reviewers complained that I was worried this would be an issue. Although the packaging is atypical, its design does not damage the disks. I actually tore the package when extracting the first disk because of the cautions raised by reviewers. However, I learned how to extract and replace the disks easily with no damage. I pull the disk up 1/4 to 1/2 inch until it seems to get stuck. Then, using tissue between by fingers for a good grip and to avoid leaving skin oils on the disk, I pull firmly straight up and the disk pops right out with no visible damage. In the end, the packaging design works just fine but an insert with some pointers might have been helpful to those of us so familiar with regular DVD packaging.<br /><br />Second, the media quality. Using a PS3 into a 55-inch Bravia, with digital audio from the PS3 to the sound system provides amazing video and audio quality considering how old Season 1 is. Most shows that old are not released on DVD in widescreen. The PS3 upscaling has this 11+ year old episode looking almost as good as Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Third, the story. Season 1 is an outstanding treatment of the classic Superboy saga, and has great backing music. I recall my frustration as the seasons advanced that the story really didn't, and finally quit watching the show. A couple years ago, I learned that it was still on -- in its 10th and last season! And that there was going to be a 10-season release. I decided to buy the set because I haven't seen that last 5 seasons, and because I'm running out of good TV to buy.<br /><br />So far, just into Season 2, everything about it gets 5 stars. July 13, 2012<br /><br />Well, it's Oct 22, 2012, and I finished the series yesterday. Baseball season, ya know.<br />I had to subtract one star for the decline in writing, mostly in the last season.<br />He doesn't \\"put on the suit and fly\\" until the very very end, which I guess was the intention -- to show the 10-year evolution of howhorned-rimmed-glasses-wearing-mild-mannered reporter versus \\"up in the sky\\" SuperMan situation came to be.<br />It could be titled \\"The Long and Untold Story of SuperBoy\\", or as I felt in many of the episodes, \\"Clueless Clark\\".<br /><br />HOWEVER -- I was impressed through many of the episodes in the middle seasons how well the stories, dialogue, imagery, etc could have been so easily transferred to an actual comic book. This was very well-done and I even thought of looking for a 200-set of Smallville in comic book form.<br />The exception(s), as another reviewer points out, is all the teenage whining dialogue in the early episodes, and then again toward the end, all the drawn out sappy dialogue -- much of it romantic -- which lost that \\"comic book\\" feel which pervaded the series so well for so long.<br /><br />And kudos to Allison Mack for being Clark's brains -- as Chloe -- most of the time. The voice of reason in almost every story.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the series more than I thought I would, given that I quit watching it on-air when the Jane Seymour sequence seemed to diverge from the story too much.<br /><br />Media: The video and audio quality throughout all the seasons was impeccable for a TV show. You expect it in 2010, but it was that good from the get-go.<br /><br />AND - I groaned at the constant resurrection of the Lionel Luther character. He makes a great comic-book villain -- I guess that's why. Reminded me of Syler in \\"Heroes\\". Indicative of writers running out of ideas.<br /><br />Summary: Production Value 5 stars, Story Quality, overall, 4 stars.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|There is no doubt this movie is relatively entertaining on purely robot fights, but there are plenty of reasons why it's not a 5-star movie.<br /><br />Based in the \\"near\\" future, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a former fighter who uses the majority of his resources in life fueling his problems as a degenerate gambler with ADHD (either that, or he cares not to watch his fights or read instruction manuals).  Charlie nickels and dimes his way through life, shunning responsibility in favor of the next robot fight he'll bet upon and inevitably lose.  Along comes his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) and a heaping dose of Deus ex machine to save the day.  In no time at all they steal a decommissioned sparring robot that, through the gee-whiz engineering prowess of a wunderkind 11 year old, is suddenly knocking on the door of the championships with only a few fights on record.  Will they win?  Will Charlie and his son reconcile?  Anyone who has seen [[ASIN:B002GHHHH4 Over the Top]] should know the answers already, and, like me, should start calling the movie Reel Steal.<br /><br />Underdog vs. champion movies work really well.  Mixed with sports they work even better.  But if we learned anything from The Blind Side, irritating children who command far too much screen time do not work all that well.  The script is clich&eacute;-ridden, and Goyo is irritating beyond belief  Seriously, he's \\"Hmong actors in [[ASIN:B002BCNK1Q Gran Torino]]\\"-horrible.  Nearly ruined, Real Steel's FX rises above Goyo's hip-hop Anakin portrayal and provides a bunch of seamless, metal crunching battle scenes.  Had this movie just stuck to the futuristic [[ASIN:B00005BY8V Rock 'Em Sock 'Em ROBOTS]] routine, it would have worked much better.  As it stands, however, sentimentality was thrown in, with a kid and father who never actually acknowledge one another other than business partners, and a third wheel (Evangeline Lilly) who was so cursory she probably got paid in game room tokens.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy the entire movie.  Discerning viewers will nit-pick the very corny melodrama, lack of character development, and mixed messages (seriously, the dude actively commits grand larceny with his kid).  All viewers should enjoy the robot fights.  Winner by split decision./><br />Kids will enjoy the entire movie.

0061122416|5.0|I bought this book for a school assignment and didn't know what to expect.  To be completely honest, this was the most enjoyable book I have ever read.  Hidden beneath this coming-of-age story is a constantly evolving meditation on the nature of our lives and that of the world as a whole.  Paulo Coelho has most certainly earned his renown for this novel.<br /><br />P.S: This book is very brief; at 165 pages.
1594744769|3.0|This is a tough review for me to write.  Because I really wanted to love this book.  It has been on my wish list for quite some time and I decided to buy it to read while on vacation.  Let me start with what I loved about the book.  The pictures.  I think that this is one of the neatest things I have seen in a book since I read Griffin and Sabine years ago.  The use of authentic photos and incorporating them into the story?  Love it!  I actually went back and looked at them more than once just to study them.  Really, really cool.  The story itself?  A little slow for my taste.<br /><br />I had really high hopes that this was going to be a pretty fast paced book and was sad to see that it lagged along quite slowly.  The story itself was interesting and the author left the ending open ended so I am not sure if there is an intention for a sequel or not.  But, I just wanted more.  More details on the hollowgast, more description, more wights, etc...it just was not what I thought it was going to be. I loved the peculiar children and also wish there was more about them.  But, you don't know much about them - just a brief glimpse into what some of their \\"talents\\" are and that they were outcasts in their families.<br /><br />Would I recommend the book?  Sure, but don't expect it to be an edge of your seat thriller.

B008H5J510|4.0|\\"Katy Perry Part of Me\\" is a rare and unique glimpse into the life, childhood, upbringing, ups and down and tag along journey for the concert tour of a lifetime for Katy Perry. In the capable hands of producers Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, this isn't just your ordinary run-of-the-mill documentary/concert video, this is a story and a behind the scenes insight like I've never seen before.<br /><br />A few things grabbed me as the movie starts with the preparation of her monster first world tour. They start with the setup for her first concert and her associating with her crew, dancers and staff before going into the opening number. She treats the people around her like gold. The people she hires to do her costumes, makeup, manage her schedule and organize her life aren't industry people. They are her friends. They were ordinary, run-of-the-mill people who Katy worked with when she was a nobody and she kept them. She loves them, and they love her and that is the nuts and bolts of \\"Part of Me\\".<br /><br />Katy Perry may consider herself the `Pied Piper of Weirdness', but I would consider her the `Pied Piper of Genuineness'. It is the heart of her success, because it is exactly what took her, after years of struggle, out from under record labels that told her who she \\"should\\" be. Millions of fans, literally overnight, took to her personality of being exactly who she is and fell in love with her. She is the voice of this generation. I don't doubt that. We live in a time where traditions and expectations are blending with freedom of expression and freedom of genuineness.  Katy Perry quite simply stands for being proud of who you are and being loud and proud about it. This very thing has made her a mega star.<br /><br />In the Summer of 2011, Katy Perry did what only one artist had ever done before. She had 5 number one hits from one album. Only Michael Jackson had ever done that before. She did this by not being Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson or who ever else she was told to be like, she did this by being herself and with \\"Part of Me\\" you find out, that herself is something good and decent. Until her late teens, she was raised in a strict religious household. Even though she broke from that mold and had to pursue a path apart from her parents, she still finishes her shows looking to the sky and saying, \\"Thank you God.\\"<br /><br />Sure, some of what she brings to the stage is like Willy Wonka meets Wizard of Oz but the essence of genuineness that she embodies is no different back stage, with fans or on stage. She is always exactly who she says she is. Although as the toll of the tour begins to mount with personal heartbreaks, we see how she has established a persona with her fans and despite hardships, they come to expect it and she must deliver.<br /><br />\\"Katy Perry Part of Me\\" is not just a concert/behind the scenes video. It goes into the heart of an extremely genuine overnight sensation that is tackling life, just like all of us. The best movies are the ones you walk out of still thinking about, wanting to talk about and maybe even discovering a life lesson or two. \\"Part of Me\\" is one of those movies. You come out of that movie feeling a genuine kinship with a celebrity who can never be described as `typical'. There was a joy in her eyes and smile throughout most of the movie, but toward the end some of that was gone and you want to console her like a friend.

B0084IG7KC|2.0|The Hunger Games is the third directing and the ninth writing venture for Gary Ross. This adaption of Suzanne Collin's popular book series is by far Ross's most high profile project since his enjoyable late '80's movie Big. Ross directed and wrote(in collaboration with Collins) the screenplay for this disappointing take on the story originally portrayed by Collins' in the source material. This reviewer was honestly very excited (albeit a little skeptical) for the movie adaption of such a good series of books but my excitement was cut short within the first hour of the movie. I held onto hope for the rest of the 142 minute movie only to leave feeling that I and all other ticket buyers had been cheated.<br /><br />The problems in the movie are many but some take center stage. My first problem with the movie is the safety of approach that the movie takes. There is next to no artistic or cinematic storytelling in the movie. It seems the writers forgot that they were supposed to be making a movie and not just rewriting the book. The cinematography was stale and uninteresting neglecting the possibility's available to the the medium of visual storytelling. In fact the only time that the camera does any more the stare at the characters as they deliver a poorly written line is during the action scenes in which it shakes, I can only guess to remove emphasis from the violence and to put emphasis on the chaos of the scenes, a goal which it fails at horribly. The lack of cinematic ability is paired with a boring, overly dramatic score by James Newton Howard(who did great work on The Fugitive) contribute to the film's uninviting pace which is not so much too slow as too melodramatic.<br /><br />The best part of the film was most definitely the performance by lead actress Jenifer Lawrence. She is one with much potential in her field. But even her great talent could not turn my mind from the horribly written script. Most of the rest of the acting was disappointing especially with such a great roster of actors. Josh Hutcherson (who plays Katniss'(Lawrence) major love interest Peeta) gave a particularly weak performance in comparison with his earlier work which included other young reader's book adaptions Bridge to Terabithia and Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant. His acting was either unconvincing or severely over the top. This seems to be the suit the rest of the acting followed. It was  either the delivery or the writing (or both) that failed in almost every case. A good performance was delivered by Stanley Tucci unlike a disappointing performance by adult co-star Woody Harrelson who played Haymitch the two main character's drunk mentor.<br /><br />After all the negative things I have said I feel I must mention that the look of some parts of the film are very good. The Tribute introduction is far more spectacular than I could have imagined in my head. But the look of the props and the costumes makes it feel two dimensional compared to the books. It as if the film makers only focused on the look of the world and none of the depth. All things considered my final words on The Hunger Games are that with a combination of a mediocre script, horrible execution on the film makers part, mixed acting and a good visual take on the world, the odds were not in favor of this adapted novel.

B0085HWZ9Y|4.0|It's a no-brainer that any Robert Plant fan must get this dvd.  If you've seen a show on the tour, you know this is stellar stuff.  What is somewhat disappointing however is that the release is from The Artists Den series (no slight on them) and not from a regular show or series of shows from Robert's tour.  That setlist is shorter than a regular tour show and omits several BOJ songs such as You Can't Buy My Love, Monkey, Silver Rider, and Harms Swift Way.  While there was some variation in setlists throughout the tour, he also performed Tall Cool One.  So I think this release could have been better, but on the bright side at least something was released.

B005MWPW86|5.0|I listened to this on audiobook and Craig Ferguson's Scottish accent only added to the wonderful story.  The memoir is so refreshing.  Yes, he went through lows and hit rock bottom, but he doesn't dwell on it.  He tells it with simple charm and his characteristic self-depreciating humor.<br /><br />He covers everything from his youth in Scotland (tough times) to his yearning to come to America.  From his relationship with his wives (yes plural, he talks about the end of his marriages and his blame in most of them), to his career and his road to becoming a late night TV host, to finally becoming an American citizen.<br /><br />He blends his insecurities with his selfishness like a master weaver.  And really he is.  His writing is astounding. He is not just another celebrity writing a memoir, he is the whole package.  Funny, approachable, talented.

Chris is exceptional at his chosen vocation. Also, he is lucky and appears, at least to his own view, invincible. The reader knows he is not. This book relates to tactics and their change with the american sniper from vietnam to the present AND, most important, the personal demons incountered. Four tours is really rolling the dice and I am amazed he survived. Read this book and you will have some miniscule perception of the mental turmoil both Chris and Taya, Chris's wife, overcame. Finally, Chris chose to leave the Navy, another milestone. Read to honor the men our stupid politicians sent to battle. Learn about Ryan, and his dedication; he cannot write a book. You will not be able to put it down, unless you have been there. My best to Chris and Taya.<br /><br />Now I have read Luttels story, Marchinco's involvements and have several of the Hathcock volumes.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The office suite professional 6 works great. I am using it on the pandigital novel (which is not the greatest device). By adding this app i went from wanting to toss the novel into the goodwill stack to now i am using it every day. the only draw back is that there is not a built in dictionary for spell check. other than that it is awesome!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first Fifty Shades was kind of shocking, but interesting.  The second one was still interesting.  But by the 3rd one I got a little sick of all of it.

B002VRZEYM|1.0|I really felt this movie was a bunco of crap.  The producers and director despise innovation and technological advancements in the food industry and would have the audacity to go to a third world country and and deny them the food they need is bad b/c its not organic, hormone free, raised in cages, and etc.

B0081L37Z0|5.0|The TV previews of this gave me an \\"eh, it looks alright\\" response; not something I specifically wanted to go out to see. Along with this, Channing Tatum always comes off as a dumb pretty boy. Much to my surprise, his movie role played this up in the most perfect way!<br /><br />This movie is moderately crude and has a lot of curse words flying around. It feels very real, which is the vibe that comes across. All the modern day trends are pointed out in a really funny way, showing the way high school is today. It was brilliant the way they took two guys who haven't been out of high school too long, but long enough to not understand what has happened with the cliques they grew up with. This is not an exact remake of the original and I feel that those who absolutely hated it do not realize this.<br /><br />No other movie has kept me laughing as much as this one. A pleasant surprise!

0061537969|4.0|THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN was THE dog book to read a few years back and held the spotlight on the best seller list for months and months electrifying fans from around the world. I realize that I am probably the last guest to arrive at this particular party but now that I am here I must admit that this tale related by a dog nearing the end of his days was better than I expected and is filled with humor, wisdom and tales of \\"doggie devotion\\" that falls into the \\"two hankie\\" category.<br /><br />Enzo, the dog, has endeavored for years to develop his human side so that, in accordance with Mongolian legend, he will be prepared for his reincarnation as a human in his next life where he is certain he will return as a man complete with opposable thumbs.  In the very first chapter Enzo says, \\"I'm stuffed into a dog's body, but that's just the shell.  It's what's inside that's important.  The Soul. And my soul is very human\\".<br /><br />As an attentive observer of human nature Enzo gleans most of his information on \\"humanness\\" from watching television and witnessing the devotion, sacrifice, patience, love, and loyalty practiced by his owner Denny Swift, an aspiring race car driver with a talent for driving in the rain.<br /><br />As Enzo witnesses the lives of the humans around him he determines that living life is metaphorically akin to navigating a wet race track and surmises that each of us has a \\"fear of the rain\\" that manifests itself in various ways throughout our lives.  You will be charmed and captivated by the quiet insights of this loving creature and wish that humans were just half as committed and understanding.<br /><br />P.S.  If you are a dog lover who read and enjoyed the story of Enzo and Denny, then may I strongly suggest that the next book on your reading list should be A DOG'S PURPOSE by  W. Bruce Cameron.
0805095535|5.0|Author Paul Auster, novelist, poet, essayist--with a deepening awareness of time as he enters his sixty-third year-- sets out to write a journal of his life. His birth, his childhood, his body, his high and low points, his failures, dumb-luck accidents, periods of black depression and moments of redemption, a lot about his mother, a little about his father, his first  marriage, doomed and unhappy and his second, enduring and intimate. He talks about places he's lived, people he's known, and most of all, mortality. His growing awareness that his time on earth is limited.<br /><br />Very few authors could pull this off, but  Auster makes it interesting, charming, poetical, musical and delightful. Yes, at times he goes too far--describing every house he ever lived in gets a bit tedious. Still most of it is like prose poetry. Some of it is hilariously funny. Some of it is profoundly revealing, stuff you would only share with your best friend. Some of it gets a little bit silly, like telling us every type of candy he ever enjoyed. But hey, this author is a genius, and he can do things lesser authors shouldn't attempt.<br /><br />I have enjoyed some of Paul Auster's novels and I enjoyed this memoir as well. It's a good book to read in one's sixties or seventies, but, actually, I can recommend it for anyone. Be sure to get hold of Winter Journal as soon as it's available. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I thought this book was amazing. The level of detail that Martin uses to describe things is wonderful. The only problem I had with it was that it dragged on from time to time. Other than that, the continuity was great. With jumping back and forth from different character's view points, I thought there were going to be a few issues, but the story flowed seamlessly. I can't wait to get through the other books.
B000ZN8036|4.0|Seen half the movie on TV about 5 years ago. When i seen the write up on Amazon ,I had to get it .The two disc version was nice .Put real a  face on some of the actors .Was drawn to the story line of going up north to find your own version of life.In 1977 I answered an add to work Alaskan King crab canery work.Ended living there for 4 years . Ended working  King crab of 1979, tanner 1980 & king of 1980. One of the reasons that drew me to dutch harbor was the concept of gettin away from people .I to came to the reality that I needed people in my life, to be happy. Sounds kind of weird but its a way of life  for alot of people ,I was lucky to live long enough to learn that lesson.Not so for Super Tramp,on a good note is he died living out his dream,which is a very important concept that needs to be respected  up north.

0385339100|5.0|Hooked from the beginning to the end. Seems little unbelievable but is justified well with the details. Patrick seems to be too lucky, well, he had 4 years to scheme. I loved it and I told the story to my wife who is so uninterested in listening, but she felt interested too with the plot and wanted me to update her as I progressed reading.<br />I loved the part how Jack Stephano was milked by Patrick :-)

Because in my opinion it is among the best superhero movies ever next to Christopher Nolan's Batman films.  So if you were to die today and you were to ask me what superhero movie to see, I would have to say go and watch \\"The Avengers\\".<br />Storyline: B+<br />Acting: A<br />Visual Effects: A<br />Action Scenes: A+<br />  Possible Academy Awards nominations:<br />  Best Director-Joss Whedon<br />  Best Supporting Actor- Robert Downey Jr.<br />  Best Supporting Actor- Mark Ruffalo<br />  Best Adapted Screenplay<br />  Best Costume Design<br />  Best Visual Effects<br />  Best Sound<br />  Best Sound editing
B00782O7NE|4.0|The Artist premiered at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and slowly descended into the public consciousness. Within a few months it was one of the most acclaimed movies of the year and would ultimately steal the thunder of all other major films, leading up to it winning five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Of course, as I'm sure you're aware by now, The Artist is a silent film in black & white. This could've been a gimmick, a quick experiment that would've faded from memory soon after its release. I believe the secret to the film's success is how close it sticks to the mechanics of silent cinema and the wholly apparent love that writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has for silent cinema. It transcends mere gimmickry. Is The Artist the best film of 2011? Not in my opinion. But it is a terrific film that I'm pleased to see acknowledged in this industry.<br /><br />The plot is nothing particularly innovative, but you can't pay homage to silent cinema with a layered, intricate plot. The film spans 1927 (when The Jazz Singer debuted as the first film with sound) through 1932. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a star promoting his latest hit film when he crosses paths with Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). Soon, George champions her for a role in his latest film despite protests from Kinograph Studios' head Al Zimmer (John Goodman). As Peppy rises through the industry, Zimmer announces that Kinograph will begin producing films with sound exclusively. George remonstrates, but soon finds his star fading while Peppy becomes Hollywood's latest star.<br /><br />Aside from Best Picture, The Artist won four additional Academy Awards for Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Director, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score. These awards are well-deserved. Dujardin, with his winning smile, fully assumes the role of a silent film star and gives a memorable, lively performance while only speaking 3 words in the entire film. Bejo, a nominee for Best Actress, deserves equal praise.With no dialogue to guide them, these modern actors must rely completely on their physical ability to create their characters and they all prove to be remarkably gifted. The new faces and the veteran actors like Goodman and James Cromwell all deserve accolades for their work. I include the dog, Jack, in this statement. He's one of the more lovable animals of recent cinema.<br /><br />The Artist is a love letter to silent film, but it looks and feels like the real thing. Because of this, a lot of people will hate it on principle. I can't imagine a lover of cinema disliking the film however. Besides, it's remarkably accessible in part because of how charming it is. Those weary of silent films may want to put aside their bias for a moment. The Oscar-winning score is a huge part of the film, essentially the driving force, and it's totally memorable and catchy. On a technical level, The Artist has few missteps; it's beautifully photographed, choreographed, and the art direction is stunning.<br /><br />I'm glad The Artist won Best Picture, despite the fact that I don't think it was the best film of 2011. It is a jubilant tribute to the magic of classic cinema and is ultimately a magical, if somewhat underwhelming film.
0345803507|2.0|I started reading the third book because of my overbearing need to finish something when I start it, not because the first two books were so amazing.  They were mildy entertaining.  By the third book I have become extremely tired of the characters and the same old storyline or lack thereof.<br /><br />Basically the third book is page after page of Ana being afraid to hurt Christian's feelings or make him angry, sad or mad.  It is pathetic that the female lead of the book needs to walk on eggshells the entire time.  I think at least once every three pages Ana says \\"Holy Cr** he's mad\\", \\"Holy F*** he's sad\\", \\"Holy Shit he's angry\\".  If I read one more \\"Holy\\" anything I am going to throw the book across the room.<br /><br />Ana never sticks up for herself towards the overbearing, over controlling, stalker of a character that Christian is.  Just when you think she might, she just has sex with him for the 100th time that day because he is so gorgeous and all is well in their fantasy world. After 200 times of seeing someone naked, you get used to it, you don't gawk everytime.  Get over it and stand up for yourself.  Yes, we know he's the most handsome man alive, we read it on every other page, but still!<br /><br />During one of their fights regarding her keeping her maiden name at work she tells him that the reason is not beacuse of him but because she wants to be independent there.  As he stares at her with a \\"perplexed look\\" she thinks \\"Holy F***.  I've hurt his feelings.  Oh no.\\"  That is an actual quote from the book.  The third book should have included Ana growing a backbone and Christian to stop being a jealous control freak.  They are a married couple, not two 13 year olds who are dating.  Give me a break.<br /><br />Also, it is completely unrealistic that Christian is a billionaire CEO when he is never at work!  You cannot make that much money at 27 when all you do is stalk your wife and then have sex 85 times a day.<br /><br />This book is EXTREMELY repetitiveand frankly I find it completely annoying how weak the female character is made to be.  It's a poor message to women and in reality it is not healthy to use sex to solve all your problems.  It's 2012 ladies, stand up to your man!<br /><br />If you do not possess the need to finish something, do not bother with book three.  Save your time and money.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This game is well designed and my whole family enjoys it a lot. Settlers lends itself well to those who like to play strategy games but don't want a game that is hard to learn and complex like DnD. A good alternative to this game for those that want a little less strategy or a game that takes a bit less time (settlers takes about 1-2 hours) would be [[ASIN:B004YNRHVO Struggle For Catan]]. It has the same basic game-play without the board (it's a card only version).

0786891416|4.0|I really didn't expect a lot from a fictitious author based on a television show, but Heat Wave is really pretty good. It's by no means a literary marvel, but the plot was interesting, the characters playful and fun, and the pacing good. I look forward to reading others in the series.

B0054JELS4|5.0|NCIS is my favorite network television show. The excellent chemistry between the characters, variety of humorous touches, detective puzzles and interwoven plots made my husband and I want to watch the series episodes in order and without the annoyance of obnoxious commercials. This package fits the bill perfectly. The package includes the individual season jackets and some interviews/commentary as well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes detective stories in a character driven setting. I am not a fan of reality TV so in this case I appreciate the delicate handling of the crime scenes that could have been disgusting. I can see why so many people watch NCIS.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't understand why this book is referred to as \\"erotica\\".  The sex is silly and juvenile. I understand that James is going for naive but by the time someone is in their 20s they know the various names for genitalia.  There is nothing dirty or sexy or hot about the sex.<br /><br />Additionally, I have to wonder if this book was ever edited.  There are phrases that are used over and over.  For example:  I stared up at him through my eyelashes.  I would hope a writer would be able to covey that thought more than one way and I would expect an editor to point out to a writer that they are repetative.<br /><br />There were many times during the first half of this book I wanted to put it down and never pick it up.  The only thing that kept me coming back was Grey's back story.  I kept reading to find out more about him and his youth.<br /><br />By the time I got to the second half of the book, the repetative phrases were much less and Ana's character was a bit more interesting.  In fact, Ana's inner voice had some funny lines.  James did a spot-on job of illustrating how women over think relationships.  Every woman will recognize a part of themselves in Ana.<br /><br />The description and examination of Dom/Sub relationships was interesting and pretty accurate.  It's a nice twist in the typical rich, damaged boy meets innocent, insecure girl and they try to fix each other story.<br /><br />All in all, I would classify this as a good first draft of someone's first book.  In the end, it's the lure of learning more about Grey's background that kept me interested and took me to the next book.
B004LH3AM8|5.0|I heard about this book on the radio one day and I was frightened by how harsh the mother sounded, in her interactions with her children. I couldn't believe that there was someone so mean who would push her children so far. I asked myself, is she for REAL? But then I thought of my own upbringing. I was born in an Eastern European country and came to America as a child. And in my own family I see differences between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" (Americans). So I wondered how this book would relate to my own family and that's why I read it. I listened to it on Audiobook first, and then picked up the hardcover to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br /><br />I want to break up my review into 2 parts:<br />1. Literary Review:  Engrossing, well written, witty, good use of English, I could really FEEL the emotion, frustration, anguish, and exhaustion. Provocative and interesting and funny at times. I finished the audiobook in 5 days!! VERY FAST.<br /><br />2. Subject Matter: Well, it certainly made me ask a lot of questions. Questions about Americana or \\"Westerners\\" as Amy calls us (to separate from the Chinese mothers, although she did note that many other cultures, like India, Pakistan, Korea, also have similar child-raising mentality). I found that my own family had a lot in common with Amy. My mother was also very strict, angry all the time, compares me to my older, better, smarter, more successful sister (as Amy would put it, I'm the \\"younger, more rebellious sibling\\"). And I also have a pretty strong personality. And as much as Amy recognized her personality in her girls (and therefore knew they would push back), she still thought she could win the arguments. But that was her mistake. I wish she's let up once in a while. I know how it feels to have an overbearing, controlling mother, and I hate it. My own mother is 75% of Amy, and if it was 100% Amy I would completely hate her. So I can totally relate.<br />But less about me....<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is, thereis definitely reason to consider her upbringing techniques. I think many American parents don't participate enough in their kids lives. they don't help them with homework, don't inspire them to take sports or do music, they don't take them on trips to other countries, or register them for contests and competitions. In that regard, I respect Amy very much. I do think kids need to be pushed once in a while, as well as helped. The amount of time and energy Amy spent rushing her kids to rehearsals, making millions of notes, and then checking her kids progress was just astounding. I respect that.<br /><br />However, unlike Amy, I also believe kids should have a choice. She never gave them a choice of what to do and that is why  the clashes, battles, and fights occurred. If she had just taken a moment of peace, quiet, and listened, she might have learned MORE and helped them MORE instead of just shoving the lessons down their throats.<br /><br />I do think American parents give up on their kids too quick (if you didn't win, then it's not for you), and I appreciate Amy's \\"Chinese\\" work ethic (if I didn't win, I just have to work harder next time). What I really disliked is that Amy pushed her kids JUST TO PUSH HER KIDS. It was almost like a terrible game of \\"Let's See How Far We Can Get\\". WHY??? WHAT FOR?? With what goal. At some point you have to stop and reevaluate and see if your children want to continue on the path they were on, and Amy did not. She was like a train barreling through everything, good or bad. And in that regard, she was a bad parent, Chinese or American.<br /><br />I think the book definitely explains a lot about why Chinese, Asians, and many immigrant families are the way they are and I'm happy to have that insight. She opened herself and her family to criticism and let us into her intimate life. That was very brave of her to do, so I respect that very much.<br /><br />I also agree about the \\"3 Generations of Success\\", I can see it happening in my own family. I agree about the \\"older, better daughter, and younger, rebellious daughter.\\" I do think she has a good point to make about parenting skills and I wish more people would listen.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to many people, including teachers, sociologists, psychologists, people who study demographics, but most importantly to NEW PARENTS and PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. I  especially recommend it to all those parents who think they raised a child that just won't listen. There is probably a reason why. And that reason is most likely YOU.

B004FOA84A|3.0|The game plays like old-school adventure games and has graphics and sound effects that are very well done.  The music track was turned off within about 5 seconds as an annoyance.  There are not enough levels to require any sort of detailed map, but still a bit challenging on finding all the hidden objects.  The biggest downside was the rapid completion compared to other games of this sort.  The developer's next game \\"The Lost City\\" is a longer adventure.
034580404X|5.0|This set is interesting.  At first you want to scream \\"run.\\"  Then you see there can be healing and growth and a middle ground with diverse appetites.  It is a bargain, was sent fast, and the seller was very nice.  I suggest you buy here.
B000002ADT|5.0|I've listened to Kind Of Blue everywhere I've lived or traveled.  I've gotten thumbs up from pedestrians at stop lights when I was playing it in my car. I've heard it coming out of apartments in SanFran, heard it playing in cafes, heard it recently on a restaurant sound system near the Santa Fe plaza.  My friend Paul told me that he and some friends were driving through the Sahara Desert in a VW bus and stopped for the night at an oasis with palm trees, a lagoon, a place to park and sleep, and a small cafe.  As they were eating dinner, the owner put a cassette in a cheap tape player and played it.  Kind Of Blue. Paul said it fit.  Perfectly.  Kind Of Blue is music that belongs anywhere and everywhere.  Or maybe it's already there.

B007Y5IAV0|5.0|Serj Tankian does it again! This album is great from start to finish, it is softer than his first solo album but harder than his second solo album.

Keep doing what your doing SERJ it is ******* Awesome man!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I had refused to buy the e-book version due to cost.  I finally tried the sample and I was hooked.  It is similar to a John Jakes book that follows the lives of various families and their interactions together.  I would highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect game for killing time or distracting yourself from life for a while.  Plus, you feel a sense of accomplishing something if you win.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|This is an exciting story that plays very well on HBO, but in book form, falls short and is frustrating.  The book is broken into quasi-chapters about each character done in chronological order.  This is fine, but Mr. Martin likes to end each chapter with a cliff-hanger going on to another character's story.  It is very disjointed, and frustrates me because I have to wait so long to return and resolve the original cliffhanger.  The pacing and chronology is very frustrating.  Just when I care about what is going to happen next, I'm taken to another place and time.  In a shorter novel, this may work, but in a 1000+ page book this reader becomes quite frustrated.<br /><br />Rather than move on to the next book, I think I'll wait for the HBO adaption, which follows the novel quite closely.
0345525558|5.0|My sister in law gave me this book, and I was hooked from the beginning. The chapters go back and forth from present day to ten years prior, and the story comes together with this weaving.<br />This may be the author's first book, but she has created characters and a story that will remain with you long after the book has been read. Few authors do this - Ann Tyler, Pat Conroy, John Irving come to mind - and I would rank this book and this author as having the potential to join them.<br />The central character, Victoria Jones, has spent her life in the foster care system, and has now been emancipated. In short, she is turned out into the world with no money, no job and little hope. She suffers with her inability to allow anyone to get close, and only her command of the Victorian language of flowers, taught to her by one of her foster mothers, allows her to function.<br />With beautifully written and sensitively constructed prose, the author leads us into Victoria's world, and it is a journey worth taking.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was hooked for the first 2/3 of this book.  The diary/present contrast seemed a clever construct.  The characters, though unlikable, seemed on the verge of redemption.  Then we meet Desi, and it all goes downhill.  The ending was contrived, unbelievable, and frustrating.  To imagine that these two hateful people would slog through a life together, and even procreate, just to \\"win\\" is repulsive and beyond belief.  If you want a depressing glimpse into dysfunctional married life, I suggest you go rent the Michael Douglas movie, \\"War of the Roses\\" from the 1980s.  It'll only take an hour and a half of your time as opposed to the hours you'll waste on this novel.
B008645YH6|5.0|I really enjoyed Marina and the Diamonds first cd, I actually had no idea a second one had come out, so thanks Amazon recommendations! I'm not the first to note that there is a Katy Perry-esque vibe in spots, but the difference is the intelligent lyrics.  So whereas the first cd was a little more Kate Bush quirky, this one is a little more Kate Perry poppy - definitely worth the 3.99 for the deluxe version (price at time of review)
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is the greatest game i have played in a long while<br />interesting control system along with beautiful construction and supply depots
B00846REIS|1.0|I can't understand why this book has gotten such rave reviews.  It is a Fifty Shades of Grey rip-off.  The main character, Gideon, is not well developed and he is unlikeable.  Its revealed he was abused but its never fully explained.  The sexual situations throughout the book between all of the characters are sooo far-fetched that its hard to imagine them.<br />I would skip this a go read the Fifty Shades trilogy again!
1608871045|5.0|Very cool book - Goes into a lot of details behind the dark knight and is very interesting.  It pays attention to the small details which adds the most value.  Keep in mind this is NOT a behind the scenes or making of the 'movie' from the real world - it is as if Bruce Wayne 'from the Nolan series' kept a journal and you are reading it from the character's perspective.  A lot of fun inserts and hidden surprises for those who look hard enough...
B007NR9WBG|4.0|I have been waiting for a remastered copy of Brainstorm to come out on BluRay.  I had forgotten that this film was shot in multiple aspect ratios, and when viewing it I was a bit distracted from the message of the film by the constant switching.<br /><br />Other than that, this is still the great film I remember.  It's not the greatest (so only 4 stars), but certainly worth the cost and time investment.  Highly recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|This product was wonderful.  It immediately captured my attention and I completed the trilogy in under a week!  I had no problems with the download to my Kindle Fire and the price was much less than I anticipated.  Everyone should use Amazon for book purchases.  I also ordered the hardback copies for a friend who received it in record time.

B005K17RU0|4.0|this app doesn't lock up like the other more famous one commonly used. I like it a lot better and just wish it could be used sideways in landscape mode.

0345803485|5.0|Hits Close to Home.<br />Everyone out there in long term relationships understand how a good relationship can make you whole; loving each other unconditionally, supporting each other, cherishing each other, and passionately protecting each other all serve to raise an ordinary life to the extraordinary. Strip away all of the kinky sex stuff, and you have an introspective look into the love story of two flawed, lonely people. They each fight demons, wrestle with insecurities, widen their comfort zones, and give up parts of themselves to make the relationship work. This was an awesome book that I found hard to put down.<br /><br />I loved the inside jokes, the hot emails, and the quickfire banter between the characters. I also enjoyed the writing style of the author because she wrote in a way that made me vividly experience an alternate reality. I could feel, see, hear, and experience the emotions, the heat, the tension, the heartbreak, the sorrow, and the intoxication of one another that Ana and Christian experienced. And the sexual encounters...oh my! It was a wake up call to men and women alike - be open to new experiences and take the time to learn the art of seduction, and you will drive each other crazy.<br />Don't believe the haters. This was the best love story that I have ever read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game easy to play good tutorials. not like alot of games that you play for a few minutes and then have to wait forever for your stats to build up. there is always something to do.

B0055S348W|1.0|Got this app free with my tablet. So far only problems with it, uninstalled it.<br />Setup issues: automated setup for local printers is over-automated and not fully able. Noticed printers attached to Mac osx but not at all those attached to Windows pc.<br />Usage problems: never been able to print out anything (from simple text to pdf documents). All attempts end in various error messages.Not only nothing prints but nothing leaves tablet (pc notices no incoming activity).<br />Not acceptable even for free, never mind high price.

B000001FKY|5.0|I always liked Def Leppard back in the day, but they dropped off my radar for a while. I rediscovered them on the radio in the car and decided I had to have this album. The only problem was, I couldn't find this exact album on iTunes. So I came here instead and found what I was looking for. I had forgotten how much I like Def Leppard's sound. Thank you, Amazon!
B0013ND30M|5.0|wonderful classic tale....a birthday gift for our 4 year old daughter and she loves it...great for any little princess...arrived very quickly too!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The resin this game is endless fun is because there are 1 main game 4 side games and 2 mini games .The best part is you can reset the game and do it all over againo
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Excellent modern day war movie. Great shoot em up and the story is fairly realistic. I really enjoyed watching it twice.
1401235417|5.0|What kind of story does it take to be Batman Volume 1?  This is not an origin story, nor is it a reboot: it is simply a great story that simultaneously brings Batman back to his detective roots and takes a serious look at what makes Batman tick, and at his complex, sometimes self-consciously symbolic relationship to Gotham City, and unlike some of the more prying Alan Moore, Grant Morrison and Frank Miller stories that have become so iconic, does so without changing what Batman is at the core.<br /><br />Beyond what it does for the DC Comics mythos (and some real bombshells are dropped here), Court of Owls is simply an extremely fun, exquisitely paced story with a nice balance of intrigue, action and character development and art that complements the story at every turn.<br /><br />5/5
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun. once you start playing you wont want to stop.you should try it out. enjoy
B002PMPTIO|5.0|For anyone who's loved Star Trek and has followed this series from James T. Kirk all the way through to the newest series of Star Trek shows (meaning all you \\"Trekies\\" out there), I can honestly say YOUR GONNA \\"LOVE\\" THIS MOVIE!  IT'S A CLASSIC!  I can honestly say I haven't enjoyed another movie like this in as long as I can remember!  It was refreshing, EXTREMELY well done, funny, exciting and just a pure blast from the past!  The characters cast in each of the roles was just PERFECT!  It seemed as if I were really watching how they all started out as younger versions of the original Star Trek crew (MINUS the old sets that is)!  Each character played fit perfectly into the roles they were cast in and pulled it off smooth as can be.  So smooth in fact, that I couldn't help laughing at some of the characteristics I'd forgotten about but was reminded about in this movie!  I'm sure this movie was great as a stand alone if you haven't seen the original Star Trek series; but, coming from a perspective of having been very familiar with the original Star Trek series and all it's characters from James T. Kirk to Scottie, I seriously DON'T think this movie \\"COULD\\" have been done any better!  It's simply \\"A CLASSIC\\" in my book!  If I could give it 10 stars, I would; and I can't say that about any other movie that comes to mind!  Get it, you'll enjoy it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are one to many ads for my taste . if there were less ads I would have given it five stars.
B006RUJST6|3.0|The thing I liked about this book is that with it, I discovered slam poetry and the avett brothers nothing else.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|The Seiko 5 Automatic is a good watch and keeps consistent time. It does gain a couple of minutes over the course of week or so, but is within tolerances for this type of watch. It is comfortable to wear. I would recommend this watch as a cost effective alternative to quartz watches.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Pretty impressed with this app. Easy to use. Lots of info for weather. Up to date weather news. Graphics very clean. Forecasts darn near right on. Easy to use.

0345803485|1.0|It has taken me awhile to get my thoughts and notes together to write this review. I cannot even fully express how much I disliked this book. YES....not probably the popular opinion, but it IS my opinion.<br /><br />Let us start with the good parts and there isn't many. I thought it was interesting that Christian was a humanitarian and I would have LOVED seeing the author develop that side of him, which would have made me not *hate* his character so much~ The ONLY time I respected Ana was when she left him at the end of the book. Too bad I know she came back, ( even though I will NOT be reading book 2 and 3).<br /><br />Well here goes.....first off it doesn't take long to realize that Ana is a very naive, inexperienced, irritating 21 year old girl. I did not find this to be believable at all. She was so juvenile most of the time that it quickly became so annoying that I consistenly wanted to beat my head against the wall. I seriously know some 16 year old girls that act more mature than the way this character is portrayed.<br /><br />Ana is embarrassed by most things every few pages in the book. She blushes, flushes, and is embarrassed so much that it's pretty much ALL she does. So repetitive and completely unnecessary. She also loves the phrases crap, holy crap, double crap, triple crap, oh shit and holy shit. And again goes on to say these words and phrases over and over and over~ UGH! So irritating!<br /><br />The sex scenes were NOT hot, alluring, sexy, or remotely appealing, they were instead, robotic and repetitive (like most things in this book) I also found it so found it grating that the author used *my sex* instead of just saying vagina, so stupid!<br /><br />The inner goddess, and Fifty Shades references were also very overused and aggravating!<br /><br />All in all I thought the writing was horrible. There were many times where a felt as if a 16 year old girl wrote the book by doing a little research online about BDSM. But with that being said I have to give it up the the author for selling so many copies of this book and the other two. I guess it doesn't really matter how horrible a book is if you can sell it~ I am thankful I didn't buy this book and I WIL NOT be reading the other two.give it up the the author for selling so many copies of this book and the other two. I guess it doesn't really matter how horrible a book is if you can sell it~ I am thankful I didn't buy this book and I WIL NOT be reading the other two.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I was very excited to get this mobile and we were so disappointed when it didn't turn. The music played as advertised but I think the leaves were too heavy for the little battery powered motor. It rotated only until the part where the leaves were supposed to lift up and then it stopped. I would give this 5 stars for color and cuteness, but only 2 for music quality and 0 for the fact that it doesn't work at all.<br /><br />Too bad.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first book and couldn't wait to get started on this one and it didn't dissapoint.  Looking forward to the movie being made for the second book.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I didn't like this book, the writing is simplistic and lacking in any real creativity. Knowing that this \\"story\\" was \\"created\\" from the Twilight books makes it an even poorer read. The author needs to come up with her own ideas.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game rox. bad thing is I installed TinyVillage for FREE and completed the tutorial. It said I would get 32000 points in about ten minutes. 30 min. later all I had was 147 thousand points. Anywho this game rox
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The writing is nutty (she NEEDS an editor!), but for some unfathomable reason, they are totally addictive and I read them all. I feel like the last one DID tie everything together and it was a happy ending.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app and I think it is great for all ages me my aunt my sister my cousins and my friends all think the app is wonderful don't listen to others BUY THIS APP!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game rocks I'm new but it's addictive and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Hope they release more content!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Wow.  I must say, it has been a long time since I got hooked on a series of books like these.  I couldn't put each book down and the third was no exception.  When I had finished this one, I sort of felt a bit lost now that I had finished.  Excellent - highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a book wondering if you can keep reading and then before you know it your reading all 3 books in a matter of a few days. Couldn't put it down. Loved it. Wish there were 1 more book. Would love for this story to continue!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun game. like that u earn credits while doing nothing. decent graphics and hasn't crashed yet. earns credits quickly and efficiently.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book & purchase was great! I read it in like a week!( which is good for me because I hate reading) so you shouldn't debate on getting this book, cause you will love it:)
B0086DBE62|3.0|There is some humor, but in general the movie is quite lame.  If one does not want to have any thoughts or feelings, but just rather than staring at the ceiling would like to stare at a screen, be it a TV or a computer, this is the movie to see.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this is a fun and addictive game but crashes more than you can play need to force close at least 4 times a day also wish there were more free items to get
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Heard so much about this book.  Found it repetitive, boring' so much so I skipped a lot of it.  Was going to buy part 2 and 3 but going to spend my money on more interesting reading.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart, it does speak volumns about mothers and their children. Not an uplifting story, rather melodious.
B004DSX5B6|2.0|The wood saw, a tool I use frequently, is a very poor cutter of wood.  Bear Grylls would certainly not find it to be acceptable as a survival aid.  The wood saw on my Victorinox Swiss Champ is much superior.  Also the vertical belt loop on the pouch has started to disconnect itself from the pouch.  Either not originally attached properly or the loop material or its attachment method is too flimsy.
B00004XMTJ|3.0|I wanted to perform Cats from the moment I first saw it as a child. I have danced my life away ever since. Broadway does not always lend itself to video. The director would have done better to shoot the musical from a fixed point in the audience rather than trying to conform a stage play to film. The close ups take away from the genius of choreography and staging that made this a stand out musical. The costumes and \\"cat\\" behavior only work from the point of view of the theatre audience, this is the perspective the director should strive for. Unfortunately the director ignores the benefits of theatre production in order to deliver a uniquely video experience. If you are a beginner to Cats I am sorry you have this poor introduction. Please wait for the revival, it will come! As for me I will take Cats any way I can get it. I'm hooked!
B00884GR0W|5.0|i have the light version bout to get this one i advise u to get this one it really fun there is glitches which there is one good which is with the boat u can keep tapping it in ur invorty and u can keep going up up up till u stop GET THIS APP PLZZ U WILL ENJOY IT IF U LIKE MINECRAFT  and the only work need is better placing the blocks it wont always let me put them down
B006P0FIGU|4.0|This movie was great for what it was intended to be:  mindless fun action.  I am surprised by all the negative reviews that complain about how unrealistic and unlike the books it was.  Hmmm... the flying ship on the cover didn't give that away to you?  If you like movies like Tomb Raider, The Rundown, etc., then you will probably like The Three Musketeers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it and its so addicting I would recomened this set of games to anyone. that and now I cant get the other half off
034580404X|5.0|Fifty shades trilogy were the best three books I have read in a long time. I was completely hooked after reading the first book. I would definitely recommend these books to anyone looking for a great story.
0307888908|5.0|In the Start Up of You, cofounder and chairman of the social networking platform LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman and writer Ben Casnocha provide insights into how to jumpstart your professional life in a fast changing world. This is a refreshing break from all the literature about writing resumes and cover letters. Instead, it offers insights into how and why a large majority of small startups in Silicon Valley are so successful. The book urges for a new way of thinking for you to succeed in business and to gain back control over your professional life.<br /><br />What I find so interesting in this book is the fact that it is simple to follow the concepts of success tabulated here. It offers historical case studies without being too winding and mixes these with contemporary stories of business success. I also like the idea propagated about the paradigm shifts in the work economy and to gain a competitive advantage one has to embrace these shifts.<br /><br />While the book offers solid examples and strategies for jumpstarting your professional life, it speaks from a point of view of privilege. It is primarily a book about success Silicon Valley-style. I am a little bit disappointed that the authors leave out the inspirational stories of other ordinary and less privileged entrepreneurs.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|links great with Chrome on my laptop and it's just a small check on the address bar. Thanks Google! now on to android.
0800179501|5.0|In Karate Kid Daniel moves from New Jersey to California and encounters the attention of karate student & bully Johnny.  Johnny and his comrades from his karate class team up on Daniel and bully him.  Daniel awakens in the apartment of the building custodian, Mr. Miyagi,and learns that he knows karate.  Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach Daniel karate as a way of self defense.  Miyagi appears to ask Daniel to do random things but it's later revealed that things aren't what they seem as Daniel realizes he's been learning karate all along.  And of course what film wouldn't be sensible with the interest of an attractive girl, which Daniel & Johnny compete over, of course.  Great film with action, romance, and heart.  Recommended.
B000SZH7RQ|5.0|Wonderful CD combining John Lee Hooker & Canned Heat. Great historical session of two of the best in th blues worjd.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was very intense and not necessarily in a good way but then again not in a bad way either. If you are in anyway squeamish then I would not suggest reading this book. Though, despite the rather intense sences this book had a great underlying mystery that keeps you wanting to know more and also to know why. One can get very lost in the relationship between the characters So, I would say a good book over all.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it kills enough time and I like it. it has enough options and rotates, if you ate looking for a card game to kill time this is it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like the game and it's very easy to play with single tap card moves. However (and it's a big NEGATIVE) is the pop in ads that are really hard to get out of. I found another free app with free solitaire that I am using. will most likely uninstall this one.
0345803485|5.0|I am sure glad I gave it a try.  The story is dark and addicting.  The best for me are the e-mails from Christian. Have started second book and know I will keep going.
B00005JXY3|5.0|In Karate Kid II Daniel travels to support Miyagi in the second film in this amazing series.  Upon arrival in this exotic land Miyagi meets his old friend who is holding an old grudge while Daniel is bullied by a local karate student.  It was good to see Daniel want to be their for Miyagi after all that Miyagi has done for Daniel.  In the progression of this film, Daniel bonds with Kumiko and they become involved.  With Miyagi's friend Sato bent on revenge, Sato does everything he can to force Miyagi into fighting him.  On the night of the fight a storm comes and which acts as peacemaker for these two friends.  And Daniel stands up to his bully and defeats him in this great film.  Recommended.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|this is a good hidden object game. it is not too challenging . a good game to relax with. easy and fun.
B00783NWB6|5.0|Love the movie and the 3d is pretty good. I have pre-odered my next 3D movie from Amazon as well, The Avengers!
0525478817|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but this one definitely deserved one. It's one of those books that you can't really put down. At first I thought it was for teenagers, and I wasn't sure if I should keep on reading, but chapter after another, I was getting more connected. The book shows the real meaning of true love, sacrifice, and loss. Thank you John Green for this magnificent book. I was really touched.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Omg this little monkey is soo cute and my baby loves it not only i dnt lose it but everybody comments on its a toy he can play with but his pacifier as well to fall asleep :) love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kid's loved the movies now they love the game they ask to play it every day. I admit I play too
B000P0J09W|5.0|I remember watching this movie a lot back in the day.  A two parent household including kids are going to be basically forced out of where they live unless they raise the money they need to give to their landlord.  One of the young men in the film stumbles upon a treasure map and a treasure hunt ensues.  The map needs to be decoded as it's written in Spanish.  The gang finds themselves at a unsuspecting little bar which is actually where the treasure is.  They must navigate through various boobie traps in order to reach their treasure.  I enjoyed the friendship and relational issues throughout the movie.  I thought it was really good.
B0086700CM|1.0|(im the sign-ins daughter)I played this on my sisters phone (htc droid incredible 2) it was fun so i tried to download it on my phone (LG optimus 2)on my google play store and coulnt find it so i downloaded the amazon app-store. i was so exited to play it when i was siqning up but the when i tried to download it,it wouldnt work.it said that amazon was having problem and to try again. i tried and tried and it still didnt work so i uninstalled it.

B0073XORCY|5.0|The more I listen to this the more I love it.  I certainly had my doubts.  A sequel to Thick as a Brick?  A Tull album without Martin Barre'?  I thought it was sure to fail.  Tull has been spotty at best for years.  How could Anderson possibly create a worthy successor to such a masterpiece?  I thought Anderson was too old to rock and roll.<br /><br />Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This is a brilliant recording, and the new guitarist is outstanding.<br /><br />Give it a try.  I'm betting you won't regret it.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|They shipped it the day they said and the product was as they described it it looks good and i love it :)
B0085YNML2|2.0|I just LOVE these 5stars reviews that make the app sound as if its fantastic, the best app they ever seen and like its the next big thing....<br /><br />...I don't know about you but they should let developers rate their app.
B000HF0IIC|5.0|This film seems more packed because it has Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face.  With the addition of Chris O'Donnel as Robin.  I thought it was a good action movie.  Maybe not as good as a comic book movie as it could have been, but on the other hand I'm not a comic book reader, I just enjoy the film.  Chris O'Donnel really did his job well, as he's wrestling with the events that just unfolded, the death of his parents.  I would recommend this film, but a true comic book fan might not appreciate it.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|'nuff said...<br /><br />I'm a huge Frank Ocean fan and I really don't feel like I could ask for more from him as an artist at this point. The mixtapes have been fire, the album is amazing, and I just hope he keeps it up.
0553103547|5.0|I wasn't really into fantasy novels. But, after reading a game of thrones, my whole perception of the fantasy genre changed. This book is AWESOME! While Reading, I feel like I'm actually in the story (I have a big imagination) and I love the cover page. When the book looks good, it gives<br />MOre motivation to read it. The only downer about the book is the bits of uninteresting segments, but I suppose every book has that. All in all great book and defiantly recommend reading it. I loved it and bought a clash of kings, and plan on reading the entire series if it's as awesome as a game of thrones.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I used to be a big fan, but this album is just going to far into space.  Like other reviewers I was excited to hear Fiona come out with new tunes...Tidal was my fave!  This album...for lack of a better description....is just plain weird.  It's not like listening to music at all.  I felt like it was more of an experience in someone TRYING to be weird or TRYING to prove they are different...and the result is simply not something I enjoyed or care to hear again.  The sound of clatter, boom, clang?  I am returning this CD...something I don't usually do when it comes to music that I can learn to appreciate.  This one, I know I never will.  Sorry Fiona fans...it's a big letdown here. I know she can and has done so much better than this piece of awkward confusion.
0307730697|5.0|Once I started reading \\"Fearless\\" I couldn't put it down.  It should be required reading for all americans.  It was inspirational and allowed a small glimpse into  the small fraternity of elite warriors that put their lives on the line everyday for us all.  It showed me that anything is possible if you truly believe and committ yourself to accomplishing your goal.  We all lost an incredible human being when, Adam Brown, was killed in action.  He had a profound impact in his short life and will be sorely missed.<br /><br />TMAC San Diego, CA
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I found myself to be wrapped up in this book immediately.  It was a quick and entertaining read - perfect for a beach trip or even a staycation.  There were times I wanted to smack Rose and times I wanted to give her a hug.  Loved this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is a great app for people of all ages. it is quite fun and addicting. I love playing it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fantastic series and the acting is great. It starts off a little slow but then really gets good later in Season 1 and in Season 2. I can't wait for Season 3 to come out soon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series started off a bit slow, but once it picked up it took off! What a fantastic and fascinating story! I can't wait for what comes next. The author refers to himself as a nobody, but he is sure to be a superstar soon! Best $5.99 I've ever spent!
B0086700CM|3.0|its way better on my phone on my kindle it doesn't pick up right and I got a high score for every single subject my name is savannah1126 on the high scores check it out !!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!
B00005YUPO|5.0|Please refer to the review marked,\\"Goo Goo Ga Ga\\"; this review describes my experience with Baby Einstein/Baby Beethoven. I have not seen Baby Einstein/Baby Bach (even though I did order it for my granddaughter aged 6 months), but if it's anything like Baby Beethoven, then it's sure to have a mesmerizing effect on her-and the above mentioned review shall apply...
B005ZUR724|4.0|I havent bought it yet cause im confused on the price. It says $6.99 but some are saying its free. When i hit the button to get the game, how much is it gonna charge me?? Please help me understand cause i would like to play this game!! Thanks!
B005ORVMT2|4.0|Please note, this is less a review of the music but rather of the discs themselves. The box set I received contained a defective Fly By Night CD, with the glitches described by Amazon reviewer SteveWK. I contacted Amazon customer service requesting a new-run, non-defective box set and they immediately sent a replacement one. I was disappointed to find that the Fly By Night CD contained in the replacement box set was also defective. I decided against contacting Amazon again- they clearly have a bad batch and are either unable or unwilling to verify which stock is defective and which, if any, is not- and instead sent an e-mail directly to Universal Music Group (the address was helpfully provided by customer and product reviewer L.Johnston). I received a reply the same day asking for my mailing address. Three days later, I received a copy of Fly By Night and was pleased to find that it did not have any of the glitches encountered on the sets I received from Amazon. The whole process, although being rather frustrating, ended well. So, if you've received a defective Fly By Night CD, save yourself some hassle, forego Amazon customer service \\"solutions\\" and instead contact UMG directly via e-mail.<br /><br />I can't finish this \\"review\\" without commenting on the quality of the music. I'm no hard core audiophile. I listen to music primarily on my iPod through headphones or via a speaker dock. That said, the quality of this set is a step above my old Rush collection, both on a CD player and through an iPod. These new remasters do sound better than earlier CD versions, including the last batch of remasters. The music is a little louder and sounds cleaner. For example, the narration on the Necromancer, from Caress of Steel is clearly audible now, whereas on my old copy, I had to strain to make out most of what was being said, even at high volume. I don't find that any one instrument on any of these mixes is either overpowering, or lost. Overall, I am quite pleased with the sound of these new remasters. I don't detect as much of a sound difference on the Sector 1 set as I do on the Sector 3 set, which I also own (and ordered through Amazon). Signals, one of my top five favorite Rush albums, sounds MUCH better on this new remaster than it did on previous versions.<br /><br />Anyway, if you love the music of Rush, have a few spare bucks, and don't feel like waiting around for some super audio DVD (or other format] version to come out at some [nonspecified] time in the future, I recommend you invest in these great box sets. If you do, I hope you don't receive a defective copy, but, if you do, try dealing with UMG direct. I hope this review is helpful.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works as expected. Great sound and range. Only complaint is a lack of support for integrating with TeamSpeak. Hopefully, that will be available soon. I wasted money on two other wired headsets before I finally spent the extra money on this. No regrets.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Season 1 hooked me. Season 2 devestated me. Season 3 didn't do much for me. It took me some getting into Season 4, but man, was I blown away. Best acting and best story-writing hands down. I did not survive Series 4 intact. Thank you.
1451608659|5.0|What a fantastic story!  Having been enthralled with Dominique from a young age, this story gave great insight into the life and struggles of an ordinary girl who achieved extraordinary things.  I also bought a copy for my mom because because this is a great book for mothers, as the love between Dominique and her mom, and the new love she has found between herself and her recent daughter, are great undercurrents that drive the narrative.  It is also a fantastic story of faith, redemption, and grace.  And oh yeah, it also tells the behind-the-scenes story of one of the greatest Olympic teams in US history.  I give it a perfect 10.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had heard a lot about the book and knew what to expect. Creative. Sexual. Interesting. There wasn't much of a deep story. But that's not why we are all reading the book!
B0036OS3EM|5.0|the boots are beautiful !! mi wife love it,the only problem is that all the girls in her office want the same !!<br /><br />beste regards
1597801585|1.0|i know you have to give sci fi books a couple chapters to sink in. imagining a new world and understanding new terms takes time and patience. but after four chapters i did not make any progress. it is written in gibberish. why should i need a thai dictionary as a companion book? nothing is explained. ministries, white shirts, gene rippers, calorie men. still a mystery. it got to the point i felt like i was working to enjoy it. and it wasn't paying off. i tossed it in the garbage and just looked up the plot on wikipedia to see how it ends. even a dumbed down explanation is annoying to figure out. more confusing than a game of thrones family chart.<br /><br />sorry. i guess it wasn't for me.
B00846REIS|2.0|Although I read this book in its entirety in just a day or so, I felt cheated and robbed.  Thi author has clearly made an attempt to ride Fifty Shades of Grey's coattails in this story of two emotionally fragile people who find themselves unbearably attracted to one another.  The character traits she describes in Gidean are almost verbatim those of Christian Grey.  Gidean is Christian minus the finesse and romance.  Gidean is crude and assuming.  Unlike Anastasia, Eva is a bit more experienced and self-assured in all things sexual.  The similarity between the two female heroines is far less noteworthy than between Christian and Gidean.  the events in the novel are so similar to Fifty that I am amazed there aren't copyright issues!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!(collecting information on prospective lovers, sexual tension in elevators, disturbing nightmares, therapy visits, every woman ogles the gloriously beautiful male....... ) Really, the list is endless.  Having said all that, I did read the book and it was entertaining enough to keep me interested, but I did feel cheated after finishing it.  It's not Fifty, not by a long shot.  Maybe if it had come out before Fifty, I wouldn't be so jaded.  Anyway, if you bear these thoughts in mind and keep your expectation low, then you should be ok.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and entertaining but I wish I could win more acorns without having to pay for them!! good for playing together with kids!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game the fact that its free and very easy to learn really distinguishes it over other games.<br /><br />GET THIS APP!!!
B004I8WD6E|2.0|the case is tight fitting, which is good, but it base sharp edges. Hurts my ear when I use it and it has like an unfinished lip all around that is very uncomfortable to use. I don't recommend this product.
0765324857|4.0|There was something gnawing at the back of my mind as I read this book until I realized \\"I know the ending already\\". Once I got past that it really helped and started to flow. I knew the characters already. I wasn't being dumped into this complex society with so many intermingling and complex characters. What I had instead was a Rosetta Stone so to speak.<br /><br />How did Rapture even come to be? In the literal sense. How was it even possible to build? What made Ryan do it? How did each one of the many characters in the games find their way to Rapture? What started them down the paths we picked up on in the games? Everything was sufficiently explained to me, and it made me want to pick up the games and play through once more.<br /><br />If I had one issue it would be the incredible time span the book covers. Obviously it would be impossible to document every day, or even every week in the evolution of the city, but you will have to keep track of the timeline carefully.
0345536886|5.0|John Grisham has long been one of my favorite authors. Time zooms by and I realized that there's a novel he's authored that I've not yet read. That's why I love my local library; I checked this book out and thoroughly enjoyed it!<br /><br />The plot moves at a good pace. Characters are easily understood. I connected to David Zinc, who is introduced as a David who is almost defeated by the huge Goliath law firm. When David cross examined the witness, I found myself smiling. I love the way Grisham writes legal thrillers.<br /><br />Folks, I recommend this one.<br /><br />Note: contains some mild profanity.
B000002LJA|5.0|I have often listened to music on the radio going to work and back home but my brother gave me the first copy of Back on the Block in cassette. Yes, I know that was during the dinasaur age but I needed to up grade with a CD, probably still dinasaur age but I love all of the selections.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|great game lots of fun and a good story line it<br />I would recommend this game to anyone who loves action packed games or just has a love for spider man
0345803485|5.0|I abolutely loved 50 Shades of Grey, so much so, that I bought 50 Shades Darker and 50 Shades Freed, the other two books in the series.  The interaction between Anastasia and Christian is fantastic.  I couldn't wait to read all three of them.  I have now started to read the first book over again and am picking up on suttle things I missed the first time.  This is so amazing because I have never re-read any books ever. I found all three of them to be very entertaining and so worth reading.  I highly recommend these books to everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|worthwhile app to have in order to prepare for your day or for the week in advance. would recommend this to anyone looking for a free option.
0143121006|5.0|Midnight in Peking is the story of the murder of Pamela Werner, a young Englishwoman, and the investigations which followed.  Pamela was the adopted daughter of a former diplomat and Sinophile.  Still a teenager, she was visiting her father during a school vacation when she was brutally murdered, her body disembowelled and gruesomely left near the Fox Tower, known to the Chinese population as a haunted and sinister spot.  An investigation followed by both Chinese and British police agents, but no culprit and no motive was ever identified.  After the official investigation closed Pamela's father continued to dig for answers, eventually identifying a man he believed to be his daughter's murderer, though without being able to convince the authorities.<br /><br />Paul French has created a wonderfully atmospheric book which well evokes the atmosphere of a vanished world: pre-World War II China, a country which had been dominated and exploited by Europeans for most of the past century, and which in the late 1930s was being invaded and even more cruelly exploited by the Japanese.  French reconstructs life as it was lived in Peking by privileged Europeans, downtrodden Chinese, and stateless White Russians.  He well conveys the sense of frustration Pamela's father felt as little to no progress was made in tracking down her murderer, as well as the turmoil Peking and the rest of China went through as World War II began and intensified.  A lengthy Afterword sums up what is known about the ultimate fates of Werner, the police officials, the probable murderer, and the many other colorful characters which populate Midnight in Peking.<br /><br />This is a true story, although it has all the hallmarks of a suspense novel, and it does a valuable service in reminding us of this forgotten tragedy and the small part it played in the long history of China.
B00846REIS|5.0|My neighbor borrowed my 50 Shades and told me about Bared to You. I immediately went to amazon.com and read the reviews and downloaded the book to my pc. After 50 Shades, what the? What are you going to read next? Kind of difficult to go back to Janet Evanovich's Ranger and Morelli. I NEEDED MORE! I love your style of writing. You thanked EL James for leading the way. Showing class, style, and woman power! I don't want you to stop at #2. I would like to see Eva and Gideon go further. You have created so many different avenues for drama in their relationship I can't wait to read more. Of course, the sex DETAIL is powerful, forceful, and you feel like you have to catch your breath right along with Eva and Gideon! Damn it! I found myself taking on the same jealousy genes of Eva. I want Corinne gone. :D Thank you Sylvia Day and Amazon.com
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is extremely fun because it is fast pass and full of action. Temple Run also has thousands of patterns which makes it more intense.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have been having a lot of fun with this game. I especially like that when you are out of moves it will shuffle your remaining tiles. Almost like you just can't lose.
B000X8KGQM|5.0|This is really the case. The music here will move you. As will the movie. If you have never seen The Mission, do so very soon. It is one of my top 2-3 favorite movies ever made. DiNero's conversion scene is one of the most powerful Christian statements ever in a film.
0345803485|1.0|What is the big deal about these books?  I read the first one and won't waste my time reading the others.  Boy meet Girl, tons of porn......this story has been around for years.  Porn is out there if you want it; when did it become mainstream?  Not what I expected at all.
B003UESJHE|1.0|They pan and scan hacked this fine film from its intended 1:85:1 to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens.  DO NOT BUY.
B0083GCK5G|5.0|As a certified Boomer ( born 1948), I grew up with The Beach Boys. I bought every album they put out from mono  to stereo.I 've heard a lot of music. Some moves me some doesn't, but Brian Wilson ALWAYS moved me. He tapped in to how it is to be a teenager and translated it to a sound that he created and never has been equaled.This album is the same. To me it is his swan song.I don't believe he has anything left to say,and thats just fine. He's said enough. God bless you Brian, there willnever be another like you.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|With owning a smartphone, a tablet, a desktop computer and a laptop; having all my notes gathered in one place and accessible anywhere I am is invaluable.<br /><br />I share notes with my husband, and friends when I'm online. I have memory issues and I use Evernote for little things like phone numbers given during the course of a phone call, I can just grab my Kindle Fire (Android powered tablet) and save notes to myself without hunting for pen and paper.<br /><br />Because I am physically disabled, I can't write,  but typing on a tablet is easy and Evernote helps me remember all the little things.
B0063GORYU|5.0|When I was youngster, I used to play Spider with actual cards. MobilityWare's implementation is slick and easy to use.
B007PS0DTI|3.0|Plot was a little thin.  The action was a bit boring with the usual slash and behead Lycans.  Guess well have to see if baby makes three in the next movie when they catch up with Michael.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is really fun ! keeps me busy when I have nothing else to do. I highly  recommend this game
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I have been looking at this product for MONTHS and I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have bought it! I'm a die-hard Friends fan, and this collection EXCEEDED my expectations (if not more). If you're a true fan like me, just looking through the images of the picture book take your breath away. And, the cds are neatly organized and reflect upon the growth of each of the characters.<br /><br />Brilliantly and conveniently packaged, and great quality (even from the 1992 episodes!). I highly recommend every single Friends fan to purchase this series collection. This was the best purchase I have ever made in my entire life!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading this book you seriously can't stop!! I loved this series!!  I cannot wait till the movie comes out
B0049VZ222|5.0|Love the series. Hated to see the horse go down but I guess it provided a necessary distraction. Glad I have these to watch when I can't watch TV.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well constructed plot and character rich fantasy. Magic seasons the story and does not become the point of the story. I am not going to write about the storyline, enough has been said - just pick it up and read it.<br /><br />The price is better than right and I hope to see the sequel. However, unlike series that never end and cliffhangers that leave you hoping for a next chapter that never seems to come (GRR Martin) - this novel is complete unto itself.<br /><br />Regarding Typos and E-publishing -<br /><br />Although there are a few typos, in this case they do not interfere with the reading. People that need to take a star off (or 2 stars off) for an incorrectly chosen homonym need to remember - we the Kindle consumer have chosen to bypass the mass market $8 per book publisher.<br /><br />This direct to consumer market is in its infancy. I remember pulp science fiction from the 60s and 50s when that market was young. They had similar editing issues and we still bought and enjoyed the novels (for 50-75 cents each).  We were the pioneer readers that drove that industry, and now science fiction and fantasy are no longer the geek centered creepfest they used to be. They are widely read and accepted and yes, honored. This market will mature as well. So get off your red-pencil high horse and enjoy the ride.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the only thing I don't like about this app tho is that it has auto rotation and it asks you to rate it
B000FCKIFU|4.0|This Kindle eBook was very interesting.  I had read the other Camel Club books by David Baldacci prior to reading this 1st one!  Baldacci is a great mystery writer.  I would have read it as a library loan, but there was too long a line to wait for it as my first wait was about two months, so I purchased it from Amazon.com.
0345529057|5.0|arrived earlier than expected and made a perfect gift for my son who has read a later volume and wanted to read the first volumes of this series
1572816112|5.0|*I hate it when people leave mega long reviews... just make it short and sweet*<br /><br />Pretty unique but didn't like everything in the LWB. Some of the art is just ugly.<br />Most of the art is weird or creepy but I love it and it's why I got it; guess you can't have a deck that you'll like 100% but nonetheless, I really like it :)
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is one of the best scifi films made in the last 20 years, the acting is great and the sets are amazing this will look great on bluray and it's going to be loaded with extras.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|this game will keep you on your toes. it is mind excercising and hand and eye cordially strengthen because of the frequent use of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game and it is free. I do not like all the ads but overall it is fun to play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was offended and removed it from my reader. I was disturbed by it and would not let this occupy a place in my mind.
B006RED4GA|2.0|Fell asleep watching it until the volume blared during a 'ghost appearance'. Fell back asleep and it did it again! Watched end next day. Boring.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|The best album Paul Simon ever recorded. His collaboration with the African musicians was pure genius. We had the cassette for years. Decided on the CD so we can play it in our new car.
B007ZRHKHC|5.0|This was a really great book. The author keeps you drawn into each word! I have just recently ordered the 2nd book in the series Fifty Shades Deeper and I can not wait for it to arrive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's pretty much all already been said. LOVED the book. Couldn't put it down and then out of nowhere it just...stopped. I was reading it on my Kindle and didn't realize the 'end' was coming up so quickly. I actually thought something was missing from my digital copy at first. It's like the entire 'last chapter' never got written...or was lost. HUGE disappointment after a very enjoyable thrill ride. Not the lasting impression I wanted.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Great acting from all actors; Original screenplay with meaningful story line-nice development of plot. Plus the special features are also relevant & interesting.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this for my little sister birthday.<br />Not only that it came way before time due (the shipment was for Israel) , but it was in excellent condition and she is enjoying it very much.<br />Overall I had an excellent experience! Thank you!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Both the Sony MDR-7506 and V6 sound very good,  yet the 7506 seems to have a little more aliveness  in the midrange and a fuller yet well proportioned bass than the more linear sounding yet still nice Sony V6 headphones.  The 7506 also seems to play slightly louder than the V6 at the same volume setting, making them a little more efficient - although both sound good and play plenty loud with an iPod.  Of course, a headphone amp always makes great headphones like these sound even better.<br /><br />Both headphones feel very comfortable and neither one of them presses down too hard on the head.  I have a larger than average head and have no complaints about discomfort.  Both Sony headphones allow the headphones to fold inward and fit nicely in a compact pouch.<br /><br />On balance, because of what I perceive to be better sound, I prefer the MDR-7506 over the V6 and feel that the 7506 are well worth the extra $20.  I also like the full sized non-compact Denon AH-D2000 headphones, and although I give the Denon's a slight edge in sound, I seriously question whether they are worth the extra $200.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I appreciate that this calculator app was free, and that it does what I need without any glitches.  It almost seems as thought the Kindle Fire should have come with this already on it, but I'm glad I found it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book keeps you engaged the entire time.  The story line flows well and the ending provides you a preview of what can occur in book three.
030746363X|5.0|this book works straight and simple its like magic i have lost 22 pounds and can now do single hand chin ups in short i am at my best fitness level ever
B002UBRFDC|2.0|However well written, it felt like a chore reading through the book, rather than an enjoyment.  It wasn't bad, but the story could have been told in 1/2 the pages.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Was my first experience reading Kate Morton and wanted to read more of her novels. She manages to bring to the XXI century the greatest classic-style literature: romance, a bit of mistery, written in such a way that you can't stop reading. It is a must-read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game with unique features which makes it interesting. The creatures have personality. It is better than tap dragons. Making families with suggestions from Ice Age charcters interesting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|play it it is a great game and I think you should play it. I had lots of fun playing it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book and I have prepurchased the next book.  I love a book and you hate when you get to the end.  I just recently started reading these type of books and I am addicted.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|So far (2 weeks) this cable is fine.  Sadly, my original Kindle 2 cable disintegrated. The insulation just crumbled.<br />For a not-so-cheap device, Amazon should do better.  At least, offer a discount for those of us buying a replacement cable.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great case! Awesome in the water, got it fast and easy! It can video, take pictures, and do most functions under the water fully!
B0018M6J90|3.0|I wanted to see this film because I enjoy watching Frances McDormand's performances. I would describe this movie as more of a stage play on the big screen than a typical Hollywood film. As for the story, ordinary yet resourceful Miss Pettigrew lives the life of \\"the other half\\" for the day as an assistant to a beautiful, exciting young socialite. Miss Pettigrew may be plain, but her down to earth pragmatism comes in handy and is appreciated not only by the young socialite, but by a certain someone.
0307891372|5.0|Thanks again Amazon for another timely deleivery. I find this book much needed considering I know now how to do the quests in Skyrim. This book makes it easier to do the missions and gives ample details in all the quests which are several after the main quests are done. I highly recommend this manual for anyone who struggles with the quests in the game. Thanks Amazon!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|So trashy and badly written I cant finish it. Tasteless, unrealistic and totally unengaging. Patheic main character and wishy washy storyline. The author needs to read a Wilbur Smith or Bryce Courtenay and learn how to tastefully incorporate sex in to a believable storyline with likeable characters or better still get a real job! Total waste of time and money.
1401937519|5.0|I have been working with death and dying for many years.  The experiences that Anita shares are similiar to many of the people I have worked with.  She shares her experience in a very clear way. She shares her experience in a non defensive way for you to do with it whatever you do with it. It is a book that will change the way we do medecine, the way we do the dying experience and the way we live our lives.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Bringing Up Baby is a fun romantic comedy with superstars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. Grant plays a no nonsense, science minded type and Hepburn is a free spirit. The two of them have a time trying to keep up with a large cat named Baby. It's a great older movie that really is humorous and offers eye candy for viewers who admire the stars, you pick who the honey is.
0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it and re-read it many times. It had been a few years since my last reading and when my wife and daughter came home with a 1960's collection of his novels that they bought at a garage sale for me for only a mere three dollars, I decided to give it another go. Conclusion: it is still great.<br /><br />This was Hemingway's first novel. It comes in around 90,000 words, is paced very well, and shows the foundation of Hemingway's ground breaking style of the time. The book is simple, primarily made up dialogue, of which Hemingway is a master, and broken up with stark descriptions of the country. The Sun Also Rises was an instant hit when it was published by Scribners in 1926 and made Hemingway a newly discovered star among critics and readers. It is, in my opinion, his finest work.<br /><br />I have read all of Hemingway's work. He is most certainly the king of the short story, a fine novel writer, and superb letter writer. He holds no punches when it comes to character and allows the reader to form his/her own opinion when it comes to them. Several times while reading The Sun Also Rises, I put the book down and commented on how much I loved the book. What I enjoy most about it is that Hemingway allows the reader to read between the lines, not an easy task and one that I try to do in my own writing. I like that not everything needs to be explained; that assumptions can be made. I enjoy forming my opinion on the matter. As a reader, I should be able to judge and convict at my will.<br /><br />So, for those that love Hemingway and if you have not read The Sun Also Rises in a long while, I recommend picking up this classic and burying yourself in 1920's France and Spain for a while. It will make you laugh and cringe as Jake and the gang tear up the countryside in search of a good time while trying to come to grips with lost love, forbidden love, and new found love. Oh, and the ending is as perfect as one can be. I have not read a more perfect one since.an be. I have not read a more perfect one since.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|this is the the worst game ever! its a complete copy of city story. it forces you to play with random people around the world that you don't know. makes you pay with real money and doesn't even tell you. I repeat WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061537969|5.0|This is the best dog fiction I have ever read. The story is heartbreaking with funny and uplifting moments, imaginative, and charming, and it has a highly satisfying ending.<br /><br />Yet, I have to add that I almost quit reading it at the start. The reason is: In the beginning, in a  phone conversation,  the ailing old dog Enzo's master hinted that he was taking Enzo to the vet to put him down. This was too difficult for me to handle, but for some reason, possibly because the prose is so spectacular, I continued with the story and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The story is told as a chronological flashback from the first person point of view of Enzo, who is highly intellectual and witty for a canine.  His master Denny is a race-car driver with a humble background, and his relationship with his dog involves watching a lot of TV shows, especially the Speed Channel and DVDs of car races.  Denny later marries the love of his life, Eve, and they have a daughter, Zoe.  After Denny loses his opportunity of becoming a champion due to an accident on the track, he works as a customer service representative at a luxury auto establishment.<br /><br />Enzo feels he has become the caretaker of the family and enjoys this responsibility to its fullest. Unfortunately, at this point, Eve becomes sick and the family is torn apart. Denny faces the possibility of losing his daughter to Eve's parents.<br /><br />The author has illustrated the themes of loyalty, hope, and moral behavior through the main characters and highlighted those themes through their negatives by the actions of the secondary characters.  According to Enzo and Denny, or the author himself, the art of racing corresponds equally to the art of living. This has made sections of the book quotable, such as, \\"These are things that only dogs and women understand because we tap into pain directly...\\" and \\"So much of language is unspoken. So much of language is compromised of looks and gestures and sounds that are not words. People are ignorant of the vast complexity of their own communication.\\"<br /><br />Just one short sentence at the finish line: This is a great book.
B007TTFXC0|5.0|In the summer of 2007 when I heard Amy Mac's first album \\"This Is the Life\\", I couldn't believe how great it was, nor could I believe why nobody seemed to have heard of Amy Macdonald.  Times have changed, and expectations were extremely high for her third studio album.  I had hoped for songs similar to those in \\"This Is the Life\\", a folky feel, catchy tunes, rousing choruses, hooks and melodies, stories told with authenticity and charm,... plus something new.  I am not disappointed.  The something new is contained in tracks such as \\"The Furthest Star\\", \\"Across the Nile\\" and the tear jerking \\"Left that Body Long Ago\\", tear jerking as it portrays an experience unfortunately that many of us share.  The opening track \\"4th of July\\" sets the tone for the entire album, a song with a wonderful upbeat folky Celtic feel about visiting New York City. There are many highlights in this album, each song stands up on it's own.  Buy this album, get in the car, put it in the CD player, and then cruise to a beautiful place.
B008K8H9C6|4.0|This game owes a lot to the game The Incredible Machine. Similar items and puzzles abound, but for fans of T.I.M., imitation isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />This game tasks you with creating Rube Goldberg devices to solve a wide variety of puzzles. You are given balls, ramps, pipes, and balloons to solve level goals... though due to the constantly changing level requirements and styles, it is often hard to tell what those goals are.<br /><br />Pros: Interesting puzzle variety. Colorful graphics. Multiple solutions. Level editor means a constant influx of new, creative puzzles.<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes unclear goals. Some graphical glitches. Very slow difficulty ramp. Repetitive soundtrack.<br /><br />Final word: While the puzzles are not as devious as those found in The Incredible Machine, and the gameplay is not as addictive as Rovio's own Angry Birds, Amazing Alex is still a fun game to pick up and play. And with the included level editor and user generated puzzles, I expect this game will only get better over time.

0553582038|3.0|I received the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire series as a gift from my husband because we enjoyed the TV series so much and a coworker suggested we read the actual books. Enough has been said about the first three books, which are obviously a great read. I wasn't looking forward to reading this one though because of all the negative reviews. However, I just finished reading it this afternoon and I actually kinda liked it! I had zero expectations and already knew Tyrion, Jon, Dany, etc. weren't going to figure prominiently in here and so I wasn't let down by their non-appearance. I liked being immersed in this world so the ancillary characters were more interesting to me than I thought they would be. However, the Cersei chapters wre the weakest part of this whole story, and since she dominates the book, that's why I only give it three stars. The writing in those chapters felt forced, awkward and unengaging. Cersei really became just a caricature. Also, her thoughts repeat themselves over and over again- how many times did I read that she wanted to slap someone?!! About the 'prophecy' of her girlhood? How she dislikes absolutely everyone who crosses her path? Jaime repeated himself too but it felt more natural in his situation, since I think most people get into a rut like that when faced with heartbreak. I also am heartily sick of dead characters coming back to life- even when they are characters I have liked in the past. Stay dead already, mmmkay?<br />That said, I will probably buy A Dance With Dragons (in paperback, mind you) because I still do like the series, even with some glaring flaws.

B007XNAQ6A|5.0|Someone mentioned the sound in their review, but I have to say that I don't think I've ever heard a live album that sounded this good.  Nick on the keyboards comes through like a champ, the guitars and percussion are clear and crisp, and the voice of Simon Le Bon is quite amazing live, considering other performers can't seem to match their own studio quality sound.  Simon's still got it after 30 years!  There are no big risks here in either the play set or the arrangements, and after listening to four differnt live albums of theirs, I kind of wish I would have gotten a few more of their newer songs live. I'd love to hear \\"Mediterranea\\" or \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\", but they did give me \\"Before the Rain\\", which I really love.  Of course they couldn't do a live show without \\"Hungry like the Wolf\\", but I'd have preferred perhaps a few more less heard songs, but I'm really glad they included \\"Rio\\".  Back to this sound issue the one reviewer seemed to berate the album for, just listen to the keyboards on \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"All you need is now\\" and the percussion on almost all the songs, but particularly \\"Wild Boys\\", and you won't be disappointed.  The harmony and backing vocals are well done, and I am very pleased with this purchase overall.  Most live albums from other bands have had a few listens but end up on my shelf because their studio counterparts are just better (including some of DD's own live albums).  This one will likely last quite a bit longer.  Keep those crystal clear notes flowing Simon!

0812816641|5.0|I read this book as a teenager, almost 40 years ago.<br /><br />I still use the technique for remembering a list of items every time I go to the grocery store, and I almost never miss an item on the list. Of course, you could just write down a list, but that's hard to do when your wife calls you while you're on the way home to say, \\"Could you stop and pick up milk? And oh by the way we need tomatoes, and yogurt, and chicken breasts\\" etc. You could just go OK, OK, OK, and then forget half the things she told you to get once you are in the store ... or you could read and apply the simple techniques in this book and be the hero by, for the first time ever, showing up at home with everything she asked for! LOL<br /><br />This book can truly make you look like a genius. A while back I explained some techniques in it to my granddaughter, then gave her a list of imports/exports from the Sudan. There is nothing less interesting to my granddaughter (aged 11 - almost 12) than a list of Sudanesse imports/exports. Yet she was later able to recite the parts of the list where I gave her a tip using a technique from this book. (If they export ALL their sugar, they won't be able to make any cakes with the wheat they import - one example).<br /><br />This book helped me prepare for tests in school, and has helped make life more convenient at various times since.<br /><br />Good stuff here.
B000HZHPSS|5.0|Star Trek VIII: known as First Contact is about the borg leader being identified and them trying to stop First Contact after warp drive is intoduced by Z. Cocrin. This is a fast pace Star Trek Movie most of the movies by Star Trek have attempted to show many advancements in special effects. By showing off the vairous ships and docking in space. This is one of the better Star Trek movies it stays with a story line and show the charters and the relationships developed over the years. Jon Luke is one of the best Captains as he is a actor of the old style well educated in the acting arts. Kirk an ego maniac and Jane Way an over bearing captains. Jon Luke shows the emotional side of a captain. I like this movie also because it shows the charter flaws and strengths. One of the best Trek movies. Nemisis being the other.

B004VB3UYW|4.0|The R statistical analysis tool has much to recommend it to students, researchers, and commercial data analysts.  It contains a powerful set of analysis and graphics commands and a constantly-growing number of add-on packages produced by its large user community.  R and most of its add-ons are also available for free under an open source license.  It is a realistic and readily available rival to major commercial tools such as SAS and SPSS.<br /><br />As with everything, there is a downside.  R is accessed through a command line interface, has an overwhelming number of commands, and its syntax is difficult to learn and remember.  R users, especially novices, will find this cookbook of tremendous help.  It contains many brief sections, each of which lists example R code for a specific analysis task.<br /><br />Tasks supported range from downloading and installing R through more complex data analysis.  The sections I found most useful were:<br /><br />- Finding Relevant Functions and Packages<br />- Performing Matrix Operations<br />- Editing a Data Frame<br />- Generating Reproducible Random Numbers<br />- Plotting Multiple Data Sets<br />- Predicting a Binary-Valued Variable (Logistic Regression)<br /><br />Paul Teetor has produced a well-organized and useful reference book.  The sections are straightforward and the example R code is no more complex than necessary.  The explanations in each sections are instructive, yet concise.  Numerous cross-links between sections allow readers to understand related tasks when writing more complex code.  There are even a few sections on common R error messages and useful programming tricks.  I recommend this book to anyone working with R who already has some background in data analysis with one or more other software tools.<br /><br />Note:  The book comes with an offer from the published to purchase upgrades as new versions are released.  This seems like a good idea, but I have no experience with this from O'Reilly.

B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|I love Gina from American Gladiators and MMA of course. I was so looking foward to see more of her in this movie, but after 20 mins I turned it off.  The script was awful, I am not a fan of Tatum because of his lack of enthisiasm on roles. That really made me shut it off.  Great stars but that did not help the movie. Hope she gets more roles with a better script so she can shine like I know she can.

0061743526|5.0|Harper Lee has created a timeless masterpiece, by using the eyes of a ten year old child, as the story teller this makes it easy to read and get lost in. Creating one of the most noted litary figures of all times, Atticus Finch. A man of convection, courage and compassion through him, his children see how unfair life can be while teaching them by example how to overcome the challanges of life in a small southern town. Every fathers day many shows rank the best fictonal fathers, and Atticus Finch has alway been number one. For a good reason.<br />Every adult needs to read this book even though you probaly already have at one time or another.  I believe everyone should see the world through the eys of a ten year old child every now and then.

B006VP1OYO|5.0|Ah, at last. This is my first time hearing the Feed Me With Your Kiss and You Made Me Realise EPs. I'm really enjoying them, they're even more raw than Isn't Anything. In fact I just dug out my copy of that album, and I can hardly believe the EPs were recorded and released around the same time. To me, it sounds like the album is MBV first discovering a new sound and tentatively experimenting with it, whereas on these EPs it sounds like they'd mastered it.<br /><br />About 20 years ago, I used to tell my friends that I was going to start a new band that would sound like Husker Du meets Godflesh, thinking I was very clever to come up with such an odd combo as \\"heavy noise meets catchy hooks\\". I don't remember if I really had a firm idea of exactly what it would sound like, but when I hear songs like Slow and I Believe, I realize just how far behind I was at the time.<br /><br />Extra bonus: an extended alternate version of Glider, one of my all time favorite MBV songs. I don't think I like it as much as I did years ago when I first bought that EP, but it's still pretty damn good. Definitely one of the most unusual songs in an already unusual repertoire.
B007VGXS8M|3.0|Ok so it takes 68 minutes to load the game is ok but its a waste of money so please trust me and dont get it if you are over the age of 8. Thank you!
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed the series.  Don't read it if you're looking to increase your IQ, but read it if you could use a little escape from the humdrum.  I'm not overly critical that a guy like Christian Grey has not nor will ever exist...it's a STORY people. Fiction. At first the sex scenes were exiting, but then I started to get more interested in Anna and Christian's relationship, hoping that it all would work out for them.  Thanks EL James for giving us a happy ending.....

1466401885|1.0|I could not finish reading this train wreck of a romance. Actually I got 10% away from the end and skipped to the last page. The author is trying to make abuse romantic. There is no happy ending in fact it was horrible. I liked the beginning of this book but the more I read the more I hoped that The female character,  Abby, would take her life back. The middle had my hopes up but just like reality the victim runs back to the control freak/ hot headed womanizer.. I am surprised with the ratings of this book and sincerely hope that females today do not feel that this is love.

B007ZCQJOM|4.0|It seems that the opinion on Beach House's fourth album is a bit mixed. There are two definite camps: both of these sides have equally valid criticisms and objections. One group of listeners praise Beach House for their focus on tone, atmosphere, and chord shifts. The other, more critical group, believes that BLOOM is awash with cheap Casio synthesizers and 80's nostalgia. Because I believe that both of these groups have valid opinions, I would suggest that those who are interested in Beach House's BLOOM sample the album first. Here on Amazon, listeners can stream bits of songs for free: these short snippets should be enough to inform most decisions on which of these two camps he/she will fall into.<br /><br />With that said, I fall into the first camp: I really enjoyed BLOOM. While perhaps it may not reach the same heights of their previous album, TEEN DREAM, the duo have released another batch of solid, consistently enjoyable dream-pop. The band's music is checkered with stylistic flourishes: it's midtempo, atmospheric, and yes, \\"dreamy.\\" By using a combination of traditional instruments (guitar, drums, etc...) with electronic instruments (synthesizers and keyboards), the band sounds strange, but never processed. There's an organic layer to the band's sound that keeps it grounded. For some listeners, this combination may seem dull, boring, and sleepy, but for most fans, it's quite beautiful.<br /><br />BLOOM begins with \\"Myth,\\" a song that seems to dictate the course of the album. The progressions in the music are repetitive, vocalist Victoria LaGrand's voice is breathy with a pinch of reverb, and the percussion is overtly rhythmic. The songs and instruments seem to coalesce together; the songs become an album, the instruments become a sound. This is great for BLOOM, but many of these songs sound strange out of context (if you were to shuffle them in with your media library). I would have liked to see the band experiment a bit with their sound and style, and for the most part, the songs here won't bring any surprises to listeners already familiar with the band. The band's sound is reminiscent of the New Wave movement from the 80's, but BLOOM isn't pockmarked by the trappings of its production; it feels uniquely modern.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Beach House, this album is a fine one to start listening; for listeners that are fans of the band, this album is what you would expect and a very worthy follow up to TEEN DREAM. Fans of M83, Exitmusic, Memoryhouse, Band of Horses, or Wye Oak will find plenty of material here to enjoy. Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Wishes,\\" \\"Lazuli,\\" and \\"Troublemaker.\\" These songs give listeners an idea of what the rest of the album is constituted of.<br /><br />BLOOM sounds best through a nice set of headphones or in a good car stereo. While this is true for most music, the treble in Beach House's BLOOM is only accentuated through most speakers (i.e. stock laptops).he most part, the songs here won't bring any surprises to listeners already familiar with the band.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this story because of the content I'd heard about.  I had not seen the movie as I prefer to read the book first.  Once I started in, I couldn't put it down.  It was so refreshing to read something totally different that kept you anxiously turning pages.  The reader just has to know what happens next!  \\"The Hunger Games\\" is one of those books that has you asking yourself \\"Why am I reading this?\\" and yet you're pulled into the story with no escape.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006PGL7OQ|4.0|Is it hallucinations or supernatural perception or some combination of the two?  Marital trust, possessive friends, and judgemental neighbors are all common themes but this movie maintains a tone and a story arc all it's own.  At times it's a little bland and subdued but still well worth watching.
B007V508CC|4.0|The essence of Maroon 5 resides here, albeit \\"technified\\" in places. This is more evident on the first few tracks of this disc and even made this fan say \\"what the...?\\" for a moment.<br />Then \\"Sad\\" comes along and smacks the radio cliche away a bit.<br />As this is the deluxe, a track demanded ever since it popped up after Songs About Jane at concerts, \\"Wasted Years\\", is also featured. Sadly, a few of the lyrics were changed on this disc for little apparent reason and the tune is \\"softened\\" a bit. Shame because I like the rockier side these guys are capable of, and the live delivers (or used to) quite nicely.<br />Overall, good solid album. But it is poppier again, so you've been warned. They do it right though, unlike most of the modern clowns that call themselves \\"music\\".

B005ILWOZA|5.0|I have his first two albums and he never lets me down. He is a genuine artist that will stick to who he is no matter what everyone else is doing. It is hard to find artist like him these days that will captivate you and won't change with the times to appeal to other people. He seems loyal to his fans and to himself. I can't wait to hear his next album and yes I will buy it from amazon because I can't find him in the stores in my area.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|The G155 is an outstanding product!! i bought it for my deployment to afghanistan and it was durable enough to make it there and back with 0 problems. the video quality is very good and the sound was actually impressive for what you're paying. I have been using this for my PS3 slim and it fits everything in the convenient side pouches and closes very securely, i carried it about a mile everyday and the case still looks fairly new with very few scratches. The weight is very manageable and pretty light for what i was expecting. The only down side was the black levels were pretty low...so what was meant to be black was a little gray but besides that small fact it is an amazing product that i would recommend to anyone looking for a good portable gaming device.  So at the end of the day i have had this Gaems G155 gaming system for quite a while now and have had no problems with the device or with the durability, so 2 thumbs up, 5 stars how ever you want to rate it this product will top the charts!
