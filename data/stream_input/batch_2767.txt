B000Q79HTC|5.0|This movie was action packed from the get go. It was worth watching.  Can't wait to watch the whole serious.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game. Is great but when it auto updated to the new version it downloads fine the plays video the sets forever saying it is loading and stays that way for hours without letting you play that sucks
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This movie stays close to the other Bourne movies. The action was great. It makes you wonder if this could truly happen in real life.
030758836X|1.0|I was so disappointed in the book. Honestly - I didn't care for the readers or their crappy \\"accents\\" either.<br />The whole thing dragged on, and I kept thinking... This has to get better... WRONG. Terrible ending. Can't believe all the hype of this ridiculous book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love reading books that are well written and have some interesting landscape, so to speak, about them. Reading about other cultures and families are always interesting.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|The Help is an amazing story - that was not told at all by the movie. They left out the SERIOUS dangers that these women faced. There was no character development with Minnie, Leroy, Stuart, Miss Celia... Very disappointing. Skeeter's mother was made out to be a good person with a good heart deep down in the movie, but the book shows what a terrible person she really is - which made Skeeter's decisions and life even more difficult.<br />I'm happy the book is getting so much press - but REALLY don't understand why the movie is.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It has all the usual elements (Vampires, Werewolves, Demons & Angels - OH, and of course Humans) but with a variant story line that makes it interesting enough to want to read the next book.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I dont know music. But what you can do with this little tool is mesmerizing. Excellent app. Very simple and fun to use and create music.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|A wonderful top-flight musical in the great tradition of other rockers, such as Grease, Hair, and Jesus Christ Superstar. Beautifully produced and performed. Enjoy! You will be glad you did!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The special effects were far superior to that of the 1939 version, the acting was passable and the action was excellent. The best part is, it tells us why all the original Oz characters were what they were, and does a good job of it. The plot was linear and cerebral, verging on childish and cheesy, but for just a little clean fun and a nice feeling inside when you're done, it's pretty good.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If you are a dog or pet owner, thus book will especially touch your heart. There is something about an unconditional love they can give, and The Art of Racing in the Rain shows just that. A quick read, almost too quick.
B00CXQL828|4.0|Definitely one of the big hits of 2013 to date. Three highly proficient musicians with well-documented pedigrees have merged to produce a big-sounding record. It's great to see Ritchie Kotzen finally get some mainstream and national recognition, as he's been hiding in the shadows for many years as an obscure solo artist. Kind of reminds me when Chickenfoot came together and Satriani finally got some attention, thanks to aligning himself with the right people. Sometimes that's all it takes to make it in the music business.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect but I hoped that I would like it. I found the first two episodes a bit upsetting but I watched the third one and that's when I saw something intriguing enough to continue. Now I find it quite fascinating. I was shocked at the explicit sexual scenes and I DO NOT LIKE the witchcraft in it, but those were a sign of the times that they lived in. I can always fast forward that. All in all, I would say that the show was well done.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Maybe it was because I like romances, but I couldn't get the hang of the plot and quit reading after trying two times.
B0089LOG02|5.0|unusual topic, well-written, based on u.s. history event that i never heard of before. i loved this book and recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Why is Khan so white?  Why don't they just use his blood to save everyone from everything?  Why is anyone afraid of opening a warp core anymore, now that we know it just takes a little shot of Khan blood and everything's fine? Why does the camera shake so much?  Why is there so much lens flare?  Why the hell hasn't V'GER come along and done us all a favor and wiped out this wanna-be Roddenberry vision of the future?  Indeed, this movie leaves us with more questions than answers.
0061537934|5.0|wonderful writing, wonderful story, you will laugh, cry, and think about your life a little differently.  A 'do not miss' story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was a fun game before but after the update, it's so much more. ITunes always gets the updates first, but Amazon caught up with this one finally. The update seems to have smoothed out gameplay, too. It's a lot less jumpy. And, you get the two new places to play in the game. Very nice.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The case works well for using the Kindle in different positions and also for charging it. ( I miss the charging light on the Kindle e-book, tho.) I keep the stylus I bought under the elastic band, which holds it securely. I like the color but forgot I got the same color in a different case for my Kindle e-book. So it was a stupid choice.
B008Y73940|5.0|Very entertaining movie if you like courtroom dramas. Although the correct result appeared obvious early in the movie, it contained a very unexpected turnaround which made it more interesting.
B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|Although very well acted, it is not as good as the original English version with Ian Richardson & other great English actors.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie is a perfect length, perfect for any age children to adults & the life lessons with in the movie make it a must watch! Completely worth the money!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This does not work on television sets older than six years-old. The issue is with the HDCP. Your older TV set will not display any images that come from this device.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|Not too many places carry this CD.  I was glad that we found it on Amazon.  It was the exact CD that we were looking for and it made the recipient very happy to receive it!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I had higher expectations. It was ok. Parts were funny.<br />Quick story of her life, not very deep. Quick read.
1781162646|5.0|At 71, and a lot of education, I can say: This is the best book I have ever read.  Stephen King is a master; but this time he out-did himself.<br /><br />This is, simply, a great work of fiction.<br /><br />Not for cry-babies.
B003DNH6DK|4.0|Great feel-good movie. Although it strays a bit from the actual story, I still enjoyed the movie. I am a big Sandra Bullock fan.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This series has a fantastic plot. The minute you think you have a good grasp on what will happen, the whole game changes. There are so many amazing characters in this series, many with a surprising amount of depth. Many characters continue to evolve through out the series and it is interesting to watch how your opinion of them changes based on the events of the books. Highly recommended to anyone.
B00BD62X14|4.0|I enjoy music in a foreign language. This is sweet, some songs<br />sassy and sexy. Great for a change of pace.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the premise of The Hunger Games that originally got me interested in reading this. I do not feel that it disappointed. You can relate to many of the characters and really feel for their struggles. I great start to a good series.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|Just started watching these all over again since my Fiance has never seen them. This is a great movie with action, fight scenes and a great mini cooper car chase. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great action flick!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Though this was my least favorite of The Hunger Games Trilogy, it was still a good read. I felt this book did not engage me nearly as well as the first two. There are parts of the book where the plot slows down and it becomes a bit dull. In other points the book rushes through plot points so fast, you have to go back and reread to get it all. In the end, it was a solid end to a good trilogy. If you enjoyed the first two books, you owe it to yourself to finish the series.
0810994739|5.0|My son loves this series of books, whenever he needs the next book we turn to Amazon. As always, agreat purchase!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the first book of the series. I loved the second book. It is darker, characters are deeper, and it contains a much more complex plot. Highly recommended.
B004ZNA7WY|4.0|Pink Floyd's last album contains some good tracks, although I didn't find any of them to be spectacular.  If you are a big fan of the Floyd, then you should own this album,
B009K0P10K|5.0|Whether you are watching the revenge season or not ordering the instant video is fast easy and money saving.  Great if you are an amazon prime member and get them free.
B00406O7YK|5.0|I cannot get enough of this movie! Ms Steisand steals the show. She is amazing.<br />What else could you ask for in a musical?!
B00005O5CM|5.0|You will just like this film. It may seem frivolous on the surface, but this is a feel-good film with a like able heroine who you just want to root for and who you want to see overcome her obstacles. It is also funny. It will also be a treat for those fans of legal films and courtroom stories.
0385523394|2.0|The book was not too interesting and struggled to keep my attention for long periods of time.  More of a documentary than an interesting read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very entertaining. Great for different age groups. The game will adjust the difficulty based on the player's age. Highly recommended
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Although WW II is a long ways away in time, the first person stories told by the author are probably timeless.  The conditions we put our armed forces people in without understanding what they are going through is a fascinating read. E.B. Sledge has done a remarkable job of portraying the relationships of fighting people and how they cope. What we call today PTSD, or combat fatigue back then, becomes more understandable and gives the reader a better perspective of people who suffer from it. The phrase &#34;horrors of war&#34; become more clear in meaning. As a sidebar, the author mentions only occasionally the disconnect a combat vet feels when returning to civilian life, but it is a powerful insight into what some of out returning vets experience, and offers insight into their mental state. An easy read that more people, especially policy makers and families of vets, should read.
140006922X|1.0|Obviously written with prejudice against biblical accounts, which in action gives even more credibility to the Bible itself. It is strikingly odd that thousands of years later, a man would try and state another man's motives opposing actual accounts written of that man. It's like me refuting Benjamin Franklin's personal assessments of George Washington having never met either of them hundreds of years later. Who is he to think he knows Christ like a witness? Answer, the author is highly unqualified and would be laughed at by those who knew Jesus, as the author has spent zero time with Jesus. The only reliable accounts are biblical accounts, first hand accounts. Thevauthor Thinks he is wise, but he is quite frankly caught up in a love affair with his own hatred of Jesus Christ and he has written a book of what he wishes to be true, but not supported by any first hand witness accounts of Jesus... Wouldn't even be admissible in court let alone a basis for one's belief system. Good grief.
6305736650|5.0|This movie was made by real movie stars with a great story.  Great unforgettable lines and characters.  A movie for all times.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is the fourth book written by David Baldacci, I read. Kept me on the edge. I loved it, will be reading more of his books I could lay my hands on

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sufer is the best game for people to have fun with no punishment for braking the gaurds rules. But then when you get hit it shows you have consequences. I love subway surfers its an very enjoyable game.it has amazing graphics awesome music and funny characters. I think everyone will enjoy it. But that's my opinion.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|My teenagers and I loved the idea of not only figuring out the answers but figuring out the question!!! We got frustrated at times but that's what kept us playing.

B00006IX0R|4.0|Good to hear old favorites again. Great sound and voice. Almost all of my favorite songs, without a doubt. Awesome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's mine and my family's favorite game  it's just like subway surfers but absolutely more fun
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun game and my son loved playing it. But it keeps downloading the game and after a few weeks it won't play. It downloads then says &quot;loading&quot; but it never moves on to play the game. Needless to say I'm not happy. Enjoy it while u can.
0142001104|5.0|I found this book after it was mentioned in [[ASIN:1594631905 To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others]]  and I'm glad that I did. Combining stories, examples, as well as practices  to try, this is one of the more useful \\"self help\\" books I've read. It was easy to read, entertaining at times, and always thought provoking. Surprisingly, many of the practices in  the book seemed relevant to things I've learned about Agile Software Development, and also some of the leadership concepts in books like [[ASIN:0932633021 Becoming a Technical Leader: An Organic Problem-Solving Approach]]. Given how easy this book is to read, and how powerful the practices and ideas are,  I think it would be hard to find someone who I would not recommend this book to. Even if you don't have the energy or desire to consider applying the practices, you'll find things to think about, and a couple of good stories to share.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Frustrating at first.  The person who starts the trail is totally unprepared and annoying.  Presumably, this is the author's design, but it almost sinks the book.  The problem with this and all autobiography is that if you end up not liking the author much, it's hard to like the book
034580709X|4.0|Exciting to finally read the first Harry Hole novel!  This is the new English translation, the original was published back in 1997.  For the most part, the story held up.  Quite a page turner!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best series I have watched in quite some time. It's quite interesting and captivating to follow the lives of these people. Quite entertaining. I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|The first two chapters were riveting, building the \\"silo\\" world. I was particularly taken with the trek of the Mayor, down and up through the layers of the Silo. While the ending was predictable, it was cloaked in tragedy and was very affecting.<br /><br />Once the author introduces his \\"Mary Sue,\\" Juliette, the story goes pear-shaped. Juliette is the worst sort of wish-fulfillment character: so beautiful, so brave, so perfect. In contrast to the more mature and conflicted stories in the first two chapters, Juliette's story is so blatantly \\"cinematic\\" that it borders on parody.<br /><br />I liked the first two chapters and would recommend them to anybody. But the rest? No.
B00D41AJ7G|2.0|The puzzle asks you to think as you would when painting Easter eggs: decide which layers of paint to put on first, what to cover, what to put on next, etc. It's a reasonable puzzle, but it became more tedious than fun.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Heart warming family fun. This movie made me cry and had me rooting for Ralph and for Ms Penelope to win.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I wanted to like this, its such great source material. But I kept telling the actors to hurry up and say or do whatever they are going to say or do. Oz is supposed to be a kind of likeable rogue, but I never liked him. Great production values but weak performances all around except Mila Kunis, and she didn't have much script to work with.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Interesting cliff hanger.  Kept our attention till end. Some dialog unclear.  Worth watching with great graphics. Tom Cruise looked great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|YOu get to battle bosses. you get to go through different stages like outside, This game is like subway surfer. I recommend it to everyone who has seen Despicable Me , 2. I  have loads of laughs and fun at the different stages.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Awesome job depicting a person with autism and the struggles families go through on a daily basis dealing with the issues that occur from this.  Yet, with hard work, trust and dedication to your child miracles can happen!
B001LX2J22|4.0|This movie is great. The positives definitely out-weigh the negatives. I will say that this is not not a perfect movie, and there are some glaring flaws, particularly in the third act, that you will probably notice. This is certainly the second best movie in the Lecter series, the first is Silence, obviously. It had to prove something, that it could be better than Hannibal, and it did. Kudos to you Red Dragon, you saved the series. Oh wait, Hannibal Rising... Jeez...
0345529057|5.0|so far loving the book series but can get rather boring at times- can not wait until the next one
B001BANK32|5.0|And the master of human behavior. And the master of narrative. Yes, I am a huge fan. I first read this book decades ago and I think I enjoyed it more this time. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Crazy DVD that I can watch over & over. The scene with the older guy is out of this world!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun l played for hours! I had a problem with loading took awhile for me but once installed fun fun fun! like how it adjusts the game for your age by asking your birthrate!
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|What fun to watch baby girl discover her feet.  I love to introduce new toys to entertain my new grand daughter.  I have just as much fun watching her as she has playing with her feet.  Great purchase. I love all the Lamaze toys.
B00466HNHM|5.0|Kevin is one of my favorite actor<br />I love this picture until the first time I saw it<br />I recommend to every person like Kevin
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|loved it.  I thought this was a very cute, emotional, uplifting, heartwarming, sad, happy, fun movie to watch. wanna see it again
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I love the voice of Whitney<br />Whitney has a great feeling when sing.<br />Recommended to every one who like music
B00BF11STU|5.0|this was a terrifying movie to watch, scared me and made me worry about americans in harms way, so dangerous
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This book is on my list for one of my favorite books, because I read like crazy, it is a long list!  I was so happy to see this book on sale for 1.99 for the Kindle! YAY! My hard copy has seen better days, really hardly holds together any more.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This was the very first movie that my son ever sat all the way through in theaters and I can certainly see why. The animation is beautiful and there's a great story line. This is a really nice adaptation of the older Lorax story that I loved when I was a kid. We also have the soundtrack which is great to!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I really hate watching TV, but Dexter has stolen my heart!  Luckily I can watch the series anytime I want, like when a bout of insomnia hits me.  I really like the Amazon instant streaming!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Its a really great game and it really makes you think.I think it is really great for concentration and its really attracts and interests me. (:
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins is one of my favorite authors. Couldn't put it down.  Fascinating Plot and well drawn characters as always!
B000IDCJK8|5.0|One of the his best works ever! Great story and music score as well. Make sure you have this in your collection!
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|Glenn and Don H. come off really badly in this documentary.  Deservedly so, it seems.  I  won't be paying for this documentary to further line their pockets.  Yuk.
B005544V6A|5.0|Excellent entertainment. Fast paced episodes with good story lines. Interesting relationships developed between characters.  I think of it as a modern Madmen. Not that I believe a junior associate could lie about credentials to big city firm and get away with it, but it does make for a fun show.
B0035RFYT2|5.0|I Bought this for my 13 year year old son.He loves wolves.I think he's hooked.Really cheap for wolf lovers everywhere!!!
B006HAJ99K|5.0|This movie was created back in the day when HBC - Helena Bonham Carter actually acted in movies. When she was British and honing her craft, instead of the cameo movie nonsense that she does currently. The movie settings are beautiful and idyllic. The costumes are rich and lush.<br /><br />Linus Roach, (who was wonderful in The Chronicles of Riddick is also grand in this, even without all that black leather and spiky armaments)...<br /><br />It's a sad tale, but certainly one worth watching. I love this film and I am glad that I purchased it.
B004LUS390|1.0|please fix this bought app and can not down load it as for now I will change the reveiw when its done
193700788X|2.0|I did not buy this at Amazon - I borrowed the book. I am so glad I did not waste my money. First of all, the writing in this book was completely different. Had she done this before, it would have been alright but it does make you suspicious that she did not even bother to write it herself.<br />Secondly, Eric really becomes an afterthought character and Sookie's evolution of her emotions never rings true. I was not surprised at who she picks at the end but it was written as if Sookie decides that because she is going to take a relationship slow, it is going to be real. It sort of goes like this - &#34;Sookie makes the right decision because suddenly so and so becomes a jerk.&#34;<br />If you were a fan of this series, borrow it from the library if you really need &#34;closure.&#34; But frankly, I think the series should have ended sooner.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This works alright but when I empty it the flap underneath falls out and I have to fish it out of the trash.  Not what I had in mind.
140006922X|5.0|This is an inspiring book that gives a lot of information that I didn't know.<br />I will be recommending this to my bible study group
B000OPO6VU|5.0|This was the first album I listened from Emerson, Like and Palmer. I love it From the begining until the end.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|This is a really well-developed adaptation of DC Comics' \\"Green Arrow.\\" There are plenty of tie-ins to other DC stalwarts, such as Deathstroke, and they give Oliver Queen a very interesting back story. Well acted, very well written, with a great first-season mystery told through serial, adventure-of-the-week stories and great flashback sequences. A must-watch for any fans of comics and great TV.
B00007KWHN|5.0|One of my favorities album from YES, always with me in my car and in my work at all times.
B008XG1X18|4.0|As all other reviews Pintrest is great. they just need to find a way to help you search your favorites.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this on my tablet for my 8 year old and I've found myself playing it because it's a riot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can those Minions be any cuter? I think not! My child will get her Kindle back...eventually (lol)! Ba nah nah nah!!!!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I bought these expecting the worst, and I was pleasantly surprised. Captain Kirk and Spock have great interactions and it's clever and fun and sweet. The quality of the recordings are great.
B0032BMSXQ|5.0|After learning about the inequities of bib shorts on long rides (Ride the Rockies 2013), I researched bibs for something that would provide comfort for the long days in the saddle. I have couple of Asos bibs, and they're as advertised - best for long rides. But tough on the wallet. On successive days I needed something else to alternate with the Asos. These Gore Ozon bibs were very reasonable and, based on a few other Gore products (jacket, tights) I decided to try these. I rode 50 miles yesterday in 90-degree heat and have no complaints whatsoever. They fit well and the chamois is great, well padded in the right places. I was comfortable the whole ride, which is a refreshing change. They run true to size (I wear XL in these and most other bibs - 36 waist, 6'3&#34;, 210#). The inseam is slightly shorter than some of the others but it is not an issue for me. I also have tried Pearl Izumi Pro, Specialized Pro, Garneau (I like these but haven't ridden a long day in them yet) and Asos. For the money, Gore bike wear is a great value.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works like it should. I mean I'm reviewing a calculator? what can I really say?It's far better than our president!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I've competed 3 games by this maker and I'm pretty impressed this one is my 2nd favorite !!! Some of the scenes have even startled me and make it more interesting I will continue to play big fish games graphics are really good on my kindle fire it not to hard to navigate where you need to go in this one I played another one where I was constantly hitting the help guide to get me through it I'm not on this one, the story line is good enough to get you to where you need to go next the seek and find is challenging enough that I don't just hit everywhere to find the items...I'm addicted to these games now love them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Quick read but super awesome! Can't wait to check out the movie :) I would highly recommend this book. :)
B001G5ZKZS|1.0|I loved Rush back in the 80's and 90's but I can't listen to these guys anymore. Just like Vapor Trails this stuff sounds like the efforts of a band that has run out of ideas and is stuck spinning their wheels. There is too much good new music out there to spend time listening to songs that seem so flat creatively. I deleted Vapor Trails after one complete listen through and this CD is headed for the same fate. Sorry guys.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I love this story and enjoy every minute of it.  It is seldom found in the market now and I wonder why.  Seems that there are other new shows that kids are crazy about.  I am very glad I found it in Amazon.
1476733953|4.0|I love this book but had to remove a star because of serious flaws. First, the good news: this is an extremely engrossing read, but only if you're comfortable inside your own head. What I mean is, the atmosphere of the book is deliberately stifling and claustrophobic (a couple of thousand people living for generations in an underground silo that extends for 100+ levels).<br /><br />There are secrets about what the silo is, who built it and why, and how long the residents have been there. Anyone who tampers with the status quo, even as mildly as uttering forbidden words, is sent outside, never to return. Therefore, much of the action takes place in small rooms, while climbing the endless stairs, or simply internally in the characters' thoughts.<br /><br />As in a Jane Austen novel, where the minutiae of daily life are examined in every detail, much of the book is fairly leisurely, taking its time to notice everything, from the worn stair treads to the damaged pixels on their external cameras. Those pixels are important in large ways and small, and I won't give a spoiler by explaining why. Just keep them in mind...tiny pixels, small lives, going nowhere much except up and down the stairs.<br /><br />Overall, this is less about a dystopian post-Apocalyptic world than about the narrow lives we all lead, our divisions into ranks of wealth, caste, employment, neighborhood, all of these things reflected in the divisions in the silo. It's about how we fear or face the truth, whether we choose to act or follow the lead of others. It's about power: the financial, emotional and legal power of the privileged, and the physical power of our environment. And here's where some stars come off the review.<br /><br />I expect to suspend disbelief when reading science fiction, but the writer has to create an infrastructure that adheres to the science of his fictional world. Mr. Howey doesn't do that. I'm not a plumber, electrician, carpenter or particularly knowledgeable about computers, yet I spotted endless errors in the set-up of the silo that interfered with my immersion into its world. The most obvious problems appear in the first chapters (by the way, the first part of the book is the best, simply for its great introduction to the story). A character passes a room where children are playing, their crayons and chalks scattered. After many generations, there couldn't possibly be any crayons and chalks...let alone paper. It turns out that paper is used routinely, rather than sending messages by computer. Yet there are computers everywhere. Well, what about those computers? Who is producing them, and from what materials? No one. Turns out, those computers date back to the beginning. Seriously? We're talking about hundreds of years at the very least.<br /><br />That brings us to raw materials in general...like the argon gas used when expelling a person to the outside. Where are they getting fresh supplies after all this time? The only parts of the scientific basis for survival in the silo that make sense to me are the recycling of food, air and water, and even that is a bit problematic.<br /><br />Plenty of reviewers have pointed out similarities to other books that involve life underground, but although their points are valid, they don't trouble me. There are certain constants about the situation and any book that features subterranean life has to take them into consideration: how to supply food, water and air; what to do when supplies run low; what people do who want to know what is really Out There.<br /><br />Someone once wrote that there are only two plots: a stranger comes into town, or a familiar person leaves. This book manages to incorporate a bit of both, very successfully.<br /><br />Other complaints about \\"Wool\\" include the fact that the writing is rather plain and characters tend to get killed off once you're invested in them. Actually, I think both things are positives for the book. The plain writing makes it suitable for readers of wide ages, but more important, I find it reflects the restricted lifestyle inside the silo. I wouldn't expect flowery or literary writing in a workman-like setting such as we have. Plain words are even more striking when there are words that are forbidden to the residents. As for killing off characters, it reminds me of The Game of Thrones series, where no one is exempt from dying. It also emphasizes the constricted lives of the silo residents, who can only reproduce (according to a lottery) when enough current residents have died or been evicted. It's part of the way things work.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but that is because, overall, I find this a fascinating book and I won't be surprised if it becomes a classic. Just because there are flaws in the set-up does not mean it isn't a very special work, and I recommend it highly.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|It is hard to predict what will happen more than an hour ahead, and hard not to know less than a hlaf hour ahead of every event. I love how feelings, awareness, and cultural movements of the late 20th and early 21st century are already deeply in place in the early 20th century - even among the nobility. If you love cardboard cutouts, you'll love Downton Abbey.
B003G4W49C|5.0|At this point in time, I believe I have read Ender's Game somewhere between 5 to 7 times. I love this book!
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd wasn't meant to be a likable comedian, or a lighthearted chum under the armor.<br /><br />Negative. Dredd gets it done and makes NO apologies, which is thankfully the attitude of the scriptwriters. This was truly a collective triumph for the entire cast; actors, writers and special effects inclusive. ***If you love pulsing, kick ass musical scores, get Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack.***<br /><br />Karl Urban -- despite the viewer never seeing his face -- gives a perfectly gritty, unremitting performance that the comic book crowd has been clamoring for. I honestly never thought I would feel that way about a performance in which you never see the top-half of a character's face. However, Urban bled seemlessly into the armor and the persona that is Judge Dredd. He was every bit as terrific and flawless as the savage, unforgiving environs of Mega City One.<br /><br />Lena Headey turns-in what should have been an Oscar-nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress. Unfortunately, the famed &#34;Academy&#34; isn't the least bit interested in rewarding actual performances unless the proper lobbying, knee-padding and whining ensues. Headey plays the twisted, hard-as-steel drug kingpin Ma-Ma. When her syndicate is compromised by Dredd arresting her top lieutenant, she seals-off the entire 150-story mega complex and proceed to hunt-down Dredd and his rookie partner.<br /><br />Simply, the action is heart-pounding, realistic and paced without going over the top or getting repetitive much less boring. The story is far superior to the vast majority of action movies of late. No, the film doesn't have Marky Mark or Vin Diesel or the Rock -- but this is in favor of Dredd, as it doesn't become bogged-down in being a vanity project of a &#34;Too Faster, Too Furiousestest Part XVI.&#34; Dredd is damn near equal to 2008's &#34;The Dark Knight.&#34; Yes, it's THAT damn good.
B0096HJXXI|5.0|This movie inspired me to go to medical school.  A very faithful telling of the ah.P. Lovecraft story. It's sequel tells the second half of the story. Jeffrey Combs is superb as the intrepid Herbert West.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've enjoyed every minute of this series, from Season 1 through Season 3. I had seen so many glowing reviews and decided since I could watch for Free with my Amazon Prime membership, I'd give it a look. It has evoked every emotion possible. I cannot say enough. It is soooo worth your time!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good challenge...hate being forced to rate the app...so this is a not a voluntary thing...and to tell me how many words to use...really?

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids and I love it ! Hard to believe this is free. It can be addicting. How can you not love the Minions ?
B0000WPADK|3.0|It is a kit to make the train and I thought it was the train all put together!  So I guess I need to read the details next time before I purchase.

B004YW4L5K|3.0|The book was interesting. I liked the characters and was interested in what would happen next. It was recommended to me and I thought I would like this more than I did. I think I wanted more actually. It is a difficult book to describe.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was advised to read this book. I'm not a huge sci fi fan, but enjoyed the plot. I can see where this would make a good movie.
B002N57KG2|5.0|Love this movie...  Of course, Burt Reynolds teamed up with Dom Deluise and a lot of other major stars to race across the US in various modes of transportation - encountering all kinds of fun and excitement along the way.  Funny from coast to coast.
B003568FR6|5.0|I've been jogging two miles, five days a week for three months now. I was starting to get a bit bored with my routine and worse, I noticed that my weight loss was reaching a plateau. I wanted to add an additional exercise routine, both to spice things up a bit and to re-fuel my weight loss (I'm 5'2\\", and currently around 142 lbs; my goal weight 125-130 lbs). I was honestly more than a little skeptical about buying a work-out video from Ms. Michaels, primarily because I so loath reality TV weight loss shows (I'm sure you know the one I mean). But I decided to give these particular videos a try because you can buy one at a time. I figured I'd start with Level 1, and if I hated it, I'd only be out $1.99.<br /><br />Level 1 definitely got my heart rate up, and I was a bit sore the next morning, but I didn't feel like I had worked as hard as I would have liked, so I bought Level 2 to try. First, let me say there is a pretty substantial jump from Level 1 to Level 2. That being said, it was a great work out, and was actually really fun. Jillian is, for me at least, the ideal trainer: she pushes you but is also supportive (without getting sappy and touchy-feely, which I find patronizing). She's good-natured and isn't above joking around and having a good time during the work out, but she's tough too. Basically, because she doesn't give you any outs to give up during the work out, she's saying that she believes you have it in you to finish, and I love that. I'll definitely have to spend some time at Level 2 first, but I'll be coming back for Level 3 in no time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We have 2 Chromecast devices, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. My wife is forever showing me photos and video from Facebook and YouTube. This perfectly throws it from her computer to the TV where I can see it. My 8 year old son uses his voice controlled Nexus 7 to watch YouTube game videos and such and he is now able to throw them to the TV when no one else is watching TV. The thing just works for us. We have a Roku box and that is how we consume Netflix and Amazon video as well as some streamed Plex movies and other shows. The Chromecast is very close to replacing the Roku if Amazon would update their app as well as a few others. The Roku box is awesome, don't get me wrong. But I can see this replacing Roku quickly as apps are updated with the Chromecast functionality.<br /><br />I did have one small setup glitch though and had to use my smartphone instead of laptop. Other than that it has been silky smooth.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Sad to see this season end. Love this show! You will not be disappointed....counting down until January. I love Downton Abbey!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great fun to do in your free time or you are bored.  Get this fun and great app.
B000085RPU|5.0|I had to get this movie for my brother for Christmas. It's his favorite movie and I'm glad I was able to find it for such a great price!
1439110123|5.0|This is the most comprehensive history of oil (and pretty much everything else) ever written. Yergin has truly written one of the most important books ever. The Prize goes through the history of mankind from the late 1800s up until the 90s. The Prize explains our history through the perspective of oil and energy, and allows us to understand our past, our present, and even help project the future. Because oil is so historically significant, readers will explore not only oil and energy, but also science, engineering, economics and world markets, some of the greatest businessmen in history, war and military, politics, and the incredible events and circumstances that have made oil so vital to our world. You will also come to realize just how much of an impact oil has played in our society. If you want an understanding of the world since the dawn of oil, this is the book to read. I also suggest reading Yergin's newer book, &#34;The Quest,&#34; which follows up on The Prize.<br /><br />Although the Prize is very long, it is worth the read.
6305428050|5.0|I will definitely keep coming back! Since renting old movies is out of the picture, finding them at good prices is great. I'm glad I found it here.
140006922X|5.0|First, I have read the book. I purchased an imported copy from a local bookstore in Mumbai. Second, please do not write a review for a book you have not read. If innocuous works of research harm your faith, please attend services at your local Church/Synagogue/Mosque to pray for guidance from your Lord.<br /><br />Now to the book!<br /><br />Dr Aslan's work is more about the socio-political environment in Jerusalem the surrounding region than it is about Jesus the Man. He deduces that Jesus DID exist because Josephus wrote about it in 'Antiquities of the Jew'. What follows is his explanation of how Jews worshiped during that time, the different stratas of Jewish society, so on and so forth. However, it is the disenfranchisement of the rural poor that drives the narrative. Dr Aslan argues that is was this disenfranchisement and suspicion towards Imperial Rome that led to Jesus of Nazareth to actively proselytize his so called \\"zealous\\" views. I would like to point out here that the word \\"Zealot\\" is NOT defamatory in ANY sense. Anyone who believes otherwise needs to pick a dictionary.<br /> (FYI, Zealous means ardently active, devoted, or diligent; full of, characterized by, or due to zeal)<br /><br />To me, however, the most spectacular part of the book was the conclusion that Jesus was, infact, crucified by the Romans and not the Jews. Dr Aslan argues that if the Jews were to punish Jesus, they would have stoned him to death as was their custom then.<br /><br />2000 years of anti-semitism and the murder and prosecution of millions of Jews, all for nothing.<br /><br />Do read this book about an incredible man who changed the course of World history and who still holds profound influence on billions of people.
B00D0SEGMC|4.0|Generally this is a good app: off line navigation and file storage is very handy. What I do find cumbersome though is the app navigation. It’s frustrating going back and forth between menus, so there could be an improvement there with related menu availability. Also the navigation from-to menu needs a lot of work; like being able to pick from your favorites menu and not just giving the current grid location. I don’t think it should be faulted on the information on the OSM as these are not Google Maps and have a limited amount of up-to-date (live) information. Finding a specific point, again it’s not Google, can be time consuming, but this app will get you in the ball park and get you very close.<br />Oh, and a help/user guide function would be very nice to have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey's post apocalyptic world is extremely well thought out and believable. The characters are strong and narrative. This series is much better than the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie!
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|This is a good CD.  Good songs with good hooks.  It's a bit unambitious, but ... good.  I need three more words... done!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I loved this game so much played everyday for a month. Now I did some update and it gets to the gameloft page and then shuts down I miss the game so much. Don't buy anything
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I had to update this app, and it did not function like last time I had the app. I wasted my whole time waiting for it to load, I tried exiting the app, And it still did not work, I tried deleting the app, then download it again, and another issue, then I restarted the kindle, Another issue, and then I shutdown my kindle, opening the app, and I started getting stressed that I actually waited a whole 1 hour. Such a disappoint to Gameloft
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It can show kids how to feed,groom ,clean  and play with there horses. Any age could play this game . You could play with your best friend too.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I will watch this over and over and over and again and again.  What a timeless series!<br />Just got my sister hooked also.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found it hard to put down.  Moves and counter moves by the protagonists kept me guessing - and riveted. The end was a big surprise.  The story was revealed by a very different technique than any book I have read before.  I would definitely recommend it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I enjoyed this suspenseful story. Finished it in less than a day. I recommend it to anyone who likes a gripping , pulse-quickening story with a satisfying ending.
B00821OX98|5.0|Spielberg should produce MORE television. I hope we're not going to keep having Close Encounter moments. I just hope as the series develops it'll rise above the genre. Good characters. Made me laugh and cry at the same time!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another wonderful novel. My heart was held hostage all along! It still hurts and sings.<br />Of your books,The Kite Runner was my first and I can hardly wait to read others.<br />Thank you!
B009NX61JY|4.0|Streisand at her wittiest--very subtle,very touching;if one is a Streisand fan, you'll know that this is not her best, but it is most enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. very addicting.  whenever I get stuck my kids come in and we play it together. really makes you use your brain. but not too hard just hard enough. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great if you enjoy playing magic on the go! Good game with a lot of content for free and for additional purchase&middot;
0439023521|3.0|I read the whole trilogy.. was a great read.. however, after reading it all, I was sadly disappointed with the ending.. Now that I know what happens, I won't be watching the other movies.. I don't agree with 'who gets the girl'.. actually angered me.  It's hard when you develop an attachment to particular characters and things don't go the way they 'flow' in your mind.. It's like having your favorite characters killed off.. I don't think I will subject myself to anymore of this author's writings.. still was a good read...until the end.
B00821OX98|2.0|Decent concept, but the writing is insulting.  The characters say and do the stupidest things constantly.  The depiction of human nature in this series tells me the writer thinks we are all idiots.  The acting is substandard also, but i guess there is only so much you can do with the script.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so hooked on Downton Abbey I was sad before Season 3 was finally out.  Now, its my nightly thing for my Kindle viewing. Fabulous character and story development. Start with Season 1 to get the full story line.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Just good old fashioned kick-ass Rock and Roll. It has that certain something that makes me unable to take it out of my cd player. I expected something good from these 3, but I did not expect what is bound to become a new classic.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|GREAT ALBUM.. WAITING FOR NEXT CONCERT......hoping for a video compilation.. or collectors set! Wishing for a meet and greet.. in OMAHA  next visit..
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This album was rather unexpected from yours truly, I knew that Black Sabbath was releasing a new album, but I had no idea that it would be a real legit \\"return to form\\" if you will. The quality of the first half is actually quite impressive, and the last half is still really good as well. I didn't think Ozzy was going to sound as good as he did many years ago, but he actually does a good job on this album as well as the great Tony Iommi and company. All-in-all, I'm really impressed with what I hear on this one, Well done!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It looked like it would be a fun game but I couldn't get it to run for very long. It would freeze and shut down. Didn't work.
B004IDG97S|3.0|Just enough good actors to make it tolerably good,  The best actor is the ABC robot. I want one,  right now... he really is the way war robots ought to look like.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game lots of hidden pieces to find. Works your brain out. Simply put I wish there were more levels.
B001QJUX24|5.0|The best Western John Wayne ever did.  Watch out for that knife, boy! That'll be the day.  It's has some over the type  stereotypes, etc, but John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter (and Ward Bond) make you forget the glitches.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I love the weather channel app on my iPhone, but they recently changed the look and function of this app for kindle and its terrible.  The new layout is counter intuitive, the ads and new &quot;scenic pictures&quot; get in the way of its functionality, and the graphics look amateur.  I'm just waiting until the weather channel makes another upgrade and changes it back, ad I'm sure they eventually will.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! Be warned it is addicting! Play at your own risk. Lol yay for minion rush!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Good for passing time or or relaxing<br />I wish I didn't have to log into FB to rank against others
B004CURZFC|5.0|Overall great picture and told story for all kids and the family to enjoy watching together. An inspiring kid movie!
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I'm not going to give a synopsis type of review for this movie because the plot barely budged past this guy watching the films he found in his attic.  While Ethan Hawke is a great actor and did a great job, that's about all that made the film worth it.  I feel like the folks that made this film just had pieces to the how to make a scary movie equation and that's all they used.  You're walking around in the dark for about 90% of the film, you've got your scary music, your jump-scares (which are cheap shots if you ask me) and your creepy children.  I feel cheated.  My girlfriend was playing a video game nearby and I'm pretty sure I was more interested in her game than this movie.  If you're bored and have absolutely nothing else to do, then I'd say sure, why not, but otherwise, skip it.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|The movie is rather stupid and full of vulgar nonsense. Turned it off within twenty minutes and used the dvd as a frisbee
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|This album is great start to finish.  Very talented band.  Had chance to see live and are a super show
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Tom Cruise bores me to tears in this predictable dung-heap of a film.  Rent it for $1 from your local video vending machine - you'll be sorry if you make the purchase.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I had never walked The Good Wife until recently.  Excellent combination of the legal and political and a good dose of personal drama.  Highly recommend.  Lead actors are all excellent.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I bought this CD for one song only.  Happily, I found I like all the songs on this CD.  Recommend you buy this CD.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|Good thing it's free as I haven't seen it filter out anything yet. The ads that were on the sites before - and taking time to load - are still there! This product on Chrome and Firefox works reasonably well. Here it's useless.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Not a great movie but good action and you get to see the stars of the 70s, 80s and 90s.
B005Y8KWNS|4.0|The two times I have used this app went well after I figured out how it worked. Maybe I missed more instructions as I tapped around during my test drive. I will leave another review after I have used it more often.
B002RTMXIY|4.0|I like it this movie because I like this type of movies specially since it is supposed to be based on a true story.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|In testing I found:<br />  - Opened PDFs from 1 page to 442 pages, very responsive even with the large doc sizes<br />  - Opened and annotated PDFs while offline<br />  - Able to annotate locked documents, including my company's Employee Manuel<br />  - Print uses Google Cloud print (requires printer to be Google Cloud Print enabled, which is relatively rare, or connected to a computer with Chrome installed so your network printers aren't an option)<br />  - Reflow takes a 2 column doc and makes it look like a single column, but in doing so you lose the ability to zoom and graphics are no longer displayed correctly<br />  - Able to add and name multiple bookmarks in addition to displaying list of predefined bookmarks<br />  - Annotation tools include highlighting, underlining and strikethrough text; add comments with author's name; add circles/ellipses, boxes, arrows and free form lines; add comment boxes<br />  - Nice search feature that presents a list of all places the text is found, allowing you to tap each in turn until the correct place is brought up<br />  - Allows browsing device for documents and gives ability to rename them<br />  - Can change the display from normal to sepia to \\"night\\" (white text on black background)<br /><br />My only real complaints are:<br />  - I wish it had an undo feature as I couldn't figure out how to undo breakthrough, highlighting, etc.<br />  - It would be nice to be able to email a document directly from the app after making annotations<br />  -I don't know why the app needs access to my list of accounts<br /><br />Overall, very useful little app.<br /><br />Device: Kindle Fire HD
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put the book down. It reminded me of a filthy harlequin romance. I guess I am dating myself.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|One of my favorite authors.  I have read a few Michael Connelly books.  This  story was a page turner, believable,  and full of action.
1603429999|2.0|All the sweater projects in this book are for sample sizes. The instructions for making them larger are not sufficient. All you get are some technique suggestions and nothing worthwhile to practice them on. I am returning this book!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing, especially for children's literature. I can read these over and over again. These books are so pertinent and mature they make Harry Potter seem petty.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|DEXTER IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV ALONG WITH BREAKING BAD.  THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER ARE PURE GENIUSES!
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|Ok, I saw 9 minutes of this film and bowed out.  I'm just not certain how so many people gave it 5 stars.  This is Farenheit 451 in a remake format.  Funny thing is, even the sets and the filmic elements feel the same, with the large flame-throwers and such.  Ok, so now they've included art and poetry, and all emotions, not just books.  So stamp out the imagination as well.  Wow.  UN-realistic and cheesy.<br /><br />Are all those people on Thorazine?  Sort of reminded me of a Veterans Administration Hospital I once visited.<br /><br />I am loathe to call this anything but cinematic waste.  Read Farenheit 451, and you'll be spending your time more wisely.<br /><br />Agitatus
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|When the whole line of movies started, Insidious, Paranormal Activity, and Saw. The producers and directors got together to do many films. Some of which the best include Sinister, Mama, The Possession, The Purge, and The Uninvited. This movie falls short of scares because the basic premise is explained at the very beginning of the film. Which really leaves no room for any sort of mystery, or surprises. The acting is excellent I must say, and the only reason it's rated R is for a few graphic scenes with vomit, slit wrists etc. And it involves children which is also touchy at times. It's not that the movie is horrible, it's just more of the same demonic possession, getting pulled out of bed by your feet, whispering voices type of film we've all become a custom to seeing. I always enjoy films from the makers of the original films, but this one just didn't do anything for me. I think Sinister and Mama are actually much better, and spookier than this. Even though I don't believe in any of it, or scare easily. I actually think what you don't see is much scarier, and loud thumps are much more terrifying. Seeing the lady from The Haunting was a pretty pleasant surprise, as was seeing Patrick Wilson from Insidious.<br /><br />Actually i think the continuous innate screaming at the end of the movie was really what got people afraid in theaters. But it gave me a major headache. So much so that it became annoying, and i was like ok enough already!! So basically I just can't figure out the high ratings of an 86% from critics, and 87% from fans. I thought the other for mentioned movies deserved much higher ratings. Along with others I didn't mention. The only thing much different was the inclusion of the Salem Witch trials. Other than that it's just pretty basic. I also found the birds, exorcism, holy water and crosses to be pretty cliche'. But as I said it has enjoyable parts, but just don't buy into the hype all the critics and fans are raving about.<br /><br />Other great movies of this genre.<br />Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark<br />The Unborn<br />A Haunting In Connecticut<br />The Ring<br />The Grudge<br />The Messengers<br />Silent House<br />Drag Me To Hell<br />The Mothman Prophecies
1455523003|5.0|&#34;Nothing is what it seems to be&#34;:perhaps a hackneyed phrase, alas, in this case a most apt description. Trust Hitchens to sense a phony. Pity those who are made to suffer needlessly. Piety at its worst. Another Hitchens classic expose.

B00171AN8K|5.0|I bought this album knowing a couple of songs off of it, but not a lot. Ever since purchasing it, I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. There are so many great and catchy songs on the album. Some of my favorites are &#34;The State of Massachusetts,&#34; &#34;Fairmount Hill,&#34; &#34;Shattered,&#34; &#34;Surrender,&#34; and &#34;Loyal to No One.&#34; If you're any kind of Dropkick Murphys or Irish Punk fan, I highly recommend this album
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If you ever thought there was more to life than what we were taught growing up. This book answers the questions you have been seeking. It's a great start, to a new brighter future!
B001NB4Z6K|5.0|As a casual U2 fan, I decided to buy the album to get to know some of their stuff better. Almost every single song is great and it's a good gateway into U2's music. I have been listening to the album a lot and am now encouraged to check out more of their music. If you're interested in getting to know more of U2's music, I definitely recommend checking out this collection.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|This is just the right mix of characters and their quirky personalities to make the show funny and fresh every show.  Of course, you have to suspend disbelief that this group would ever happen in real life -- although the creator says it is based on his experience at community college -- but it's not supposed to be a documentary.  It's a comedy that appeals to this mid-50's suburban 'hippie' (so my son says) housewife who also loves &#34;Friends&#34; and &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; (and Survivor and Big Brother and Amazing Race).
B004VMUS9G|5.0|So nice not to have to figure out the hotel's alarm clock or leave a wake up call at the front desk.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I love all the Camel Club books and this one gives a good view of all the characters.  The story line is great and it is hard to put the book down once you start reading.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I immensely enjoyed this book!  I love reading books by Neil Gaiman.  They transport me to the secret places within ourselves.  This one reminds me of my childhood and how children view the world.  We may never return there but some days we remember how we thought as a child.  This is a must read book!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|One of the best TV shows ever.  It still holds its power and moodiness.  Pre-Blue Velvet David Lynch!  All atmosphere... and donuts.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so glad that minecraft has made its way from the Pc and Xbox and into the Mobil devices. If you buy this game it is defiantly worth $6.99. You won't regret getting the game! :)
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Not too hard to be frustrating and not so easy to be boring.  Story line is interesting and I love the puzzles.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Oz has a great story line and great special effects and costume. It keeps you captivated from beginning to end.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The Quell games have become my new favorite games for my Kindle Fire. These games are unlike any I have ever played before. Don't be fooled when the games start out easy ... as you proceed they really bend your brain! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and something different.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not since Monarch of the Glenn have I beem hookef to a show like this!  Julian Fellowes does it again.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This movie is awesome.. From start to finish it definitely keeps you on edge.. It brings me back to the classic horror genre we all knew growing up... It has a Amityville feel to it that you will definitely embrace if you were a fan of that movie. It's a great storyline and Ethan Hawke was especially good in it.. Another 21st century horror that won't disappoint! I only gave it 4 stars because there are some spots where it does drag a little. But they're minimal.
0143116738|4.0|I haven't read it but it is the next book or the one to be read before FINDING YOUR ELEMENT.  I can't wait to read it.

HOW ABOUT AN UPDATE THE MAKES NO ADDS ON THE ADD FREE VERSION, OR AT LEAST MY MONEY BACK!!! The makers of this app are liars. Don't get it . . .
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I loved the graphics and the story line. As a lover of the original, this provided an interesting tale of how it all began.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this app is the #1 app in block apps and minecraft is #2.on this game u can get vichicles and guns and there is spawners very good app
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />&#34;Mockingjay&#34; was my least favorite in the series. Although I appreciated the detail in the story, sometimes it was too much. Peter turning against Katniss was unexpected and provided a nice boost to the story. The irony of Prim being blown to bits by Katniss' allies in the revolution is entirely too much and the story resolution is anti-climactic.
030758836X|5.0|This was a can't-put-down thriller filled with twists and turns.  I really didn't see the ending coming. Now I want to read Ms. Flynn's other novels.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I do't know how I missed this when it came out but have been watching on my Kindle Fire and am totally addicted to it and I haven't even gotten through season 1 yet!
1451695195|3.0|While the book was a quick, interesting read, I don't think it lived up to its promise as stated in the title.  This is just one man's opinion. He doesn't give any definitive 'proof'.  Perhaps if his interpretation wasn't from a Christian perspective, I would think more of his conclusion.  While I do believe that as everything in the universe is made of energy -- including us -- we are always present in some form or another, the 'Heaven' he thinks he's proven is a stretch.
0446572985|4.0|David Baldacci is my favorite author, in part because he writes with such detail and depth.  He clearly does his homework before putting pen to paper so that he can vividly describe the layout of the town, the weapons used, the motif used in restaurants, etc.<br /><br />However, in this book, he clearly missed a homework assignment, but I'll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />Like all good thrillers, The Innocent masterfully crafts improbable or impossible situations into a spellbinding narrative.  A lone professional assassin gets paired up with a street-smart teen-age girl - who could imagine such a tale?  Baldacci does and the ensuing story is captivating.  The assassin - Will Robie - is a very believable character.  A bit too believable and might make people think the US Federal Government actually works the way it is described in  this book.  However as a person, his personality kind of fits the public's perception of the kind of person who would commit their lives to protecting US interests.  Therein lies the rub....<br /><br />There are a number of what I can only describe as prejudices in this book.  Rick Wind - the former soldier - opened a pawnshop in the \\"bad\\" part of town.  Naturally, he was African-American.  In fact the only African-Americans in this story are all in the \\"bad\\" part of town, not one FBI agent, not one DCIS agent, waiter or bartender at Donnelly's, nada.  But the biggest and most flagrant violation is when it comes to the Saudi Prince.<br /><br />The Arabic name - Khalid bin Talal - translates to \\"Khalid, son of Talal\\".  No real prince named Khalid bin Talal would call himself Prince Talal as the character does in this book.  He would call himself Prince Khalid - as would the citizens of his kingdom.  Perhaps Baldacci knew this.  But it has always been his practice to explain such details that his audience may not know or may have mis-perceptions about.  So I have to conclude this was one detail Baldacci didn't do homework on.<br /><br/>Small point, yes, but that's the downside of such detailed writing.  Issues like this will crop up and affect how the reader comprehends the book.<br /><br />Overall, I think The Innocent is well worth the time to read.  Once you start, it will be hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded this today to the kindle fire but it didn't work. Stuck on &quot;loading&quot; with audio from the cutscene in the background. Unfortunate, regrettable, but not despicable.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I love this game it was  challenging and fun! I would  definitely recommend this to anyone! I give it five whopping stars
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The animation, 3D cinamatography and acting are great.  The storyline is creative and excellent.  It's classic Chris VanAllsburg!  I recomend this movie for the young at heart, ages 3 to 103.
B00CKZX0AA|4.0|This was a very good soundtrack that accompanied an amazing film. Some strong \\"adventure\\" music alongside slower melodies for the powerful dramatic moments.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Classic game played well when it wasn't crashing. This always happened during advertisements or just after I used tokens for a game but hadn't actually played yet. So either a design flaw or sheer brilliance by the designers to get me to spend money to avoid the ads or buy more tokens.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|its really fun and keeps me not bored. the colors in it are beautiful and really looks like the movie. I love it and recommend it to anyone who love building your own town. its like that only under the sea
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great game. Would definitely buy more like this. Kept me entertained for quite a few days whenever I had an hour to kill.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|this app is a great intro to some exercises- it has several options but after you have used it once it required mt to purchase the updated app- you cannot use all of the intros before you are done
B00DHMXJUG|5.0|Good song especially for kids. They love it. (Ages 4 and 7) they instantly perked up when they heard it play.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|If you'd like to laugh and take a different sort of trip down a historical road, guided by a Swedish fireworks expert, this book is for you. Hilarious and clever, a great light, intelligent read.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|If you have grown up watching these big name stars playing tough guys, than you need to see this and the first movie.  Nothing beats seeing these actors working together.  The plot was a bit goofy, but that is not the reason I watched it.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I was very disappointed in the movie.  I had just finished the book which was a great read.  I wasn't aware that this wasn't the whole book but only the first third.  I won't be there to watch the rest when it comes out.  To much violence that just goes on for no purpose.  Don't waste your time read the book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We loved the series &#34;Firefly&#34; with Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau.  This movie ties everything together very well and without making you guess what's happened to the crew.  It's an outstanding movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction!
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Awesome cast engaging story line, keeps me waiting for the next twist!<br />And talk about twists and turns - i thought there were lots of surprises with more to come. .........
B0007TKNL0|5.0|We loved this movie on the big-screen.  Now we own it on DVD and are thoroughly satisfied with it.  We especially like the bonus features.

B000GYI32M|4.0|We originally bought this because we enjoyed the series.  The quality of this product is great.  If you love &#34;The O.C.&#34;, go out and buy it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Good puzzles; but, needs to be more puzzles per pack; and background needs to be lighter dark. These puzzles are great for my Kindle!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love the historic value of the episodes, the vintage fashion, hairstyles and make up, manners long gone away...  I am drawn to anything so very entertaining that nearly feels like a documentary.
0385349947|5.0|Easy to order and it came in really fast too. Love reading it now. I will try out the audio book option next time see how it works.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I liked this movie, it was an enjoyable tale and had a fairytale adventure feel to it. Granted it's not the world's most wondrous action flick, but it is still very enjoyable. Kids can probably watch it with their parents. The actors are all good in their roles. I had a fun time watching it and it was something I'd gladly watch again whether I had kids that asked me to or not.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It has been fun searching for clues and figuring out how patterns and random items help you get out of each room. You feel as if you are a detective putting all the pieces together.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is another in the chain of great Marvel action movies!  Great deal with the Amazon Prime free streaming.
159463176X|3.0|I really like his writing, A++. However, the story falls into shambles toward the end. Very unsatisfying. My most memorable part was when Pari (the daughter)imagined that Pari's (the sister's) life as an adopted child must've have lacked a foundation and the cohesive thread of family. Funny, that's what I thought about the story. If that was by design then hats off to M.H.
B008133MDK|3.0|I really enjoyed season 1, but season 2 not so much. The ending left the door open to another season, I think.
B00BJS7104|4.0|it was a good film etc etc but I think it was a little over hyped. Maybe my expectations were too high.  Fun to watch but at the end of the day I don't like movies that, as a white male, make me want to kill myself.  I hate seeing how terrible people were treated at any time be it Schindler's list or django or 42.....it's just not something that lifts one's spirits.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is so much fun. It would be much better if you didn't have to wait so long to get coins for continuous play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.....wakes me up......keeps me searching and intrigued.  The levels are hard and makes you concentrate. You really have to pay attention to detail.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|The replacement cord is so far, sturdier than the original cord.  I thought about giving this 5 stars, but since I am often on pages that require the Fire to be upright while I use it and charge at the same time, I think if the cord had a longer length of bendable section at the micro USB end, the cord would be perfect.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This is the best cd in the history of the world I am a HUGGGGGEEE michael jackson fan and when I saw this I was amazed. It comes with him live in burchurest and 4 other awesome CDs of him! :) BEST CD EVVVEEEEERRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I love the franchise, love the rock! I had already seen it at the drive-in and found it to be a must-have for our family. We have all the others besides tokyo drift....for obvious reasons.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I cant seem to get enough. Glad there was an update for it. Keep it coming. I love this game!!
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|Loved it obviously, they did great, I am a very huge fan of the original movies and was worried this one wasn't going to be very good, but I loved it great graphic effects and awesome plot.
B000BJS97G|5.0|This book is pretty intense and romantic. Definitely for  an adult audience, something I would recommend to female readers to read in summer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game similar to temple run that helps get through those boring times of the day.  Totally worth the free cost :P
B0011ZWMVS|5.0|I listened to this throughout a roadtrip and it is so relaxing to listen to.  Definitely would buy the soundtrack again.

1440503257|4.0|It has a lot of random recipes that hardly have anything to do with Harry Potter, but it's pretty fun overall.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great characters, great stories and not a lot of gore. Gives you the suspense, but leaves the gore out. You feel GOOD at the end of the show! Not many crime dramas can say that. Keep them coming PLEASE!!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|So nice to read about the main characters form the first book again. Everything starts adding together. Looking forward every time my eyes close for the night, and to the next evening where I get the opportunity to read the book again...
B00821OX98|4.0|I think this has a good chance of being a great series. It will all depend on the writers and inaction between characters. Haven't seen them all, but hope for more stand alone stories. Difficult to follow if you miss one.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|Not a classic for me but we already know it is for many people.  I'll keep watching as it is entertaining.  A second observation is that he series indirectly offers insight into English culture, sense of humor and perceptions of America.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Although Eldorado and Rio Bravo are escentially the same movie with a few changes, you gotta love it. Its a rainy afternoon feel good western.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|All art requires a willing suspension of disbelief, and if you can manage that, this is a fun romp of a movie!  It's not for the squeamish or for the young, definitely an adult version of the fairy tale.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Typically categorized for young adults, I found this book to be the perfect summer read - great for the imagination!
0375851569|5.0|I am in the process of getting the entire collection.  I am glad that these books are still around to read to my daughter.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Typically categorized for young adults, I found this to be an excellent summer reading book - I highly enjoyed the series as a whole and would recommend them to others looking for a fun, imaginative read :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use including the advanced functions. What's better is I was fortunate to pick it up when it was free paid app of the day!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|After months of putting off watching this movie I said, &#34;Why not?&#34;. Low and behold a pretty solid movie showed up. Its a lot less Sci-Fi than advertized. Was it overhyped before it debuted?  Yes. Is it better than average? Yes. If you even sorta like this, then youshould watch &#34;The Words&#34; w/ Bradley Cooper & Zoe Saldona.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Unlike most people, I hadn't actually heard any of the \\"hype\\" placed on this novel, this was just in a list of books I might like, and I purchased this along with several others.  Now, in hindsight, I would have to say, A:  I'm not sure exactly where all the hype is coming from, and B:  I think IF I had heard all that hype, I would have been doubly disappointed.  First off, I will start with the good things about this book, so that the people that desperately want to love this novel can be appeased.  The book is very imaginative, magical, and VERY, VERY descriptive of the surroundings.  This book will undoubtably be made into a movie because it describes the circus, the clothes, and the minutia so poignantly, that one could recreate the visual aspects of this book to near perfection.  However, while I agree that these are strengths in MOST books, in THIS BOOK particularly, they actually help to overcome the bad qualities, which are abundant.  OK, so now the bad (fanboys (or more likely, fangirls) can just stop reading and go about your business please).<br /><br />This book is terrible in every way that makes a book great:  Plot, Characters, Dialogue, Setting, Relationships, AND, its way too long; a good editor would have chopped 100-200 pages out of the middle of this novel, where the book really begins to drag.  The plot is non-exisitant, you discern from the first 10 pages that there is some kind of magical duel going on between the two main characters Celia and Marco (which isn't even their real names to begin with, not to mention they change names and faces throughout the novel).  I'm not going to give any spoilers in this review, but suffice to say, the \\"magical duel\\" is mostly semantics.  The characters are dry and unfeeling, I couldn't relate to any of them on a personal level, nor did I really care about any of them, even in the end.  The only really likable characters are the kids:  Widget, Poppet, and Bailey, and they are a footnote through out this book, little more.  The dialogue is clunky, what you would expect from a first time writer, at not point did I feel that it held up the characters or gave them any added feeling.  The setting is beautiful, like I said before, the circus is very unique and cool, but even that does little to add to the plot, its just window dressing, and even the characters say during the novel that the setting of the duel is irrelevant, the circus just added a unique addition because it is a public place.  Finally, the relationships in this book are so overly, disgustingly forced that it felt like I was reading a Harlequin romance.  Honestly, in my personal opinion, I think thats why this novel gets so much praise from so many, this thing is a fantasy novel, wrapped around a Harlequin romance, so it has all the cheese and cliche of the romance, with just enough gothic to set it apart, sliding it into the fantasy section.  I think most pure fantasy readers will not like this book.  People that love romance (especially \\"love at first sight, doomed\\" romances) will like this book, and of course, people who just LOVE what people tell them to love, they will LOVE this book unconditionally.<br /><br />So, why 3 stars instead of 1?  I am giving it 1 star for its unique and descriptive setting (the only real positive in the novel); 1 BONUS star for a decent ending, despite all the badness that came before it; and finally, something I usually don't do, I'm giving this 1 BONUS star because Its highly possible that I just missed something, because I have to tell you, I nearly put this novel down around page 150, and did quite a bit of skimming to finish this, especially in the middle.  I really think the middle 200 pages of this book could have been reduced considerably.  There is just too much fluff and minutia in here to warrant a score higher than 3, and I know someone will disagree, and I'm not going to argue about it.  This is my personal opinion, and I am welcome to mine, just as you are welcome to yours.e to yours.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very challenging. I actually had to use the hint button. Love when a game isn't that easy. Hard for me to stop playing.
0307960471|2.0|I read several of the 1 and 2 star reviews to see if they matched my conclusion on Phantom.  Virtually all the 2 star reviews did.  I, too, have read all the books in the Harry Hole series, and until now was never disappointed in any of the them.  Phantom was a game changer.  It was just a very poor effort on Nesbo's part.  I was sooo glad to finish.  Probably, Nesbo is, as well. It was a waste of my time. I have no idea what those readers found who said Phantom is his best.  Perhaps there's some phantom prose that I missed.
0399255370|4.0|My little ones actually have favorites! They each have a color to side with as the story leads toward its eventual resolution. Cute, fun, and a great way to teach kids to &#34;think outside the box,&#34; even if this time it's a crayon box...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes time fly by. I normally play this on breaks and when I am waiting for someone. It is fun for all players.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I like that there are other books written by this author that take place in this same little quaint town.
0811870987|5.0|The imagery in this book is so amazing!  I bought the book so that I could take some of the photos and frame them in a large grouping.  I got the idea from Houzz.com.  It is going to be fabulous! I received the book after only three days of ordering and can't wait to get the frames now to hang the pics up!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Playing this game is fun and passes the time. Great for a free game download, don't pass it up if you like manning.
0307276902|1.0|This book had so many lies and flaws, I would not know where to begin. I finished it beacause I don't like to leave things unfinished. Don't waste your time and money. There are many good nonfiction books out there. Oprah, what were you thinking???
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Poignant story -very well written.<br />Could not put it down--wish it had had a happy ending, but I suppose it was the only ending possible.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I got this as the FAOTD, but now know it would be worth the money.  There are aspects of the game I don't like, but it has such a mix, there's something to appeal to everyone.  I'm still not finished with the game.  Pros:  Love the scenes and the more &#34;cerebral&#34; puzzles.  Cons:  Hate the arcade-like games and think some of them are simply too long -- like the squares one (board should be half that size OR stealing should not be allowed) and the later equation game.  As others have suggested, save the orbs (?) for games you truly hate or can't get.  Also, the items list sometimes says that two things aren't used together, when in fact they are.  Try switching the drag order when you're pretty sure they go together.  (I had to find this out via walk-throughs.)
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Works quite well with my Kindle fire HD.<br />Perfect for viewing the tv-shows and movies.<br />Closes to protect the kindle.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I enjoyed reading The language of Flowers as it describes the psychological development of a child to a young woman in the Foster Care System.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|By now there really isn't a whole lot more to be said here. Some people object to the subject matter or Walter White's moral choices, but then that's largely the point, isn't it? As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week, I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was. To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented, really. There's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense, but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat. Everything comes together so well: Acting, production, writing. This is one of the great works of the screen, big or small. Highly recommended.
B002OUT604|1.0|I downloaded the wrong song from the list by the way it was written down and my lack of reading it fully
0316017930|2.0|Summer reading, once again demonstrating that those selecting summer reading spend less time selecting the material they inflict than actually thinking about their students needs.  Of all the wonderful and thrilling reads available this pedantic piece of semi-scientific fluffery isn't worth the time or effort.  Better off reading a textbook on statistics than dwelling on those living at the edge of the bell curve.  Flip a coin, what's the chance it will land on its edge?  That's the chance a High School student will have of enjoying this book.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|What can I say, Booth and Brennan are a great team. They are &#34; the cats pajamas&#34;!  All you have to do is watch and you will be hooked.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Enjoyed the overall story lines.  Not riveting, but good overall entertainment.  Would recommend watching it, particularly when you can stream
B008Z9L94O|5.0|This was a gift for mi amor and he loved it. The art is lovely and the layout seems to flow well. Totally worth purchasing for any fan of the band, this album, or vinyl collector!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|someone gave me a book on tape of this book to listen too (read by will wheaton....he does a great job reading this story btw)...i feel in love with the story and the characters...Anyone who enjoys video games/MMO's/D&D, the 1980's...a great fun story, will surely enjoy this. I got two copies of this book (well three if you count the BoT) one for my kindle so i can re-read it...and one hard copy for the BF who only reads paper copy books still...he loved the story as well.! :D<br /><br />do yourself a favour and give it a go, its a fun, fast, enjoyable read :D
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Want to watch GoT but scared all of the hype is a turn down? Well, the hype is right, and in Blu-ray it's even more fantastic. From the characters to the setting, every single detail is just stunning and well worth the price and time.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Hulk character stole this movie from the scene-stealing Robert Downey Jr., which is not easy to do.  It made me look forward to the next Marvel installment.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great plot. Had me saying man I didn't expect that. Jude law is great. Zeta jones is great.  Very interesting moving.
B008602KQI|4.0|hopelessly sentimental.  I didn't read the book (and am not likely to) so I don't know how true to the author's vision this movie was.  It was obviously designed with the sequels in mind.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Enjoyable, cute game. Good for kids, but adults will find it fun. The neon effect and the tones are cute.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that this CD came with a full lyric card!! I love having lyrics of my favorite songs. I used to find lyric cards with vinyls. Yes, old days. Have you seen a CD with lyrics of all the songs lately!? Is it real? It is hard to believe, but Train has done it! Thank you!<br /><br />As to the songs, I keep listening to my favorite songs, Drive by, 50 ways to say goodbye, and Mermaid.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great read, especially if you lived through this time. A little to &#34;long&#34; I wanted the book to finally end.
0765325950|4.0|First and foremost I found A Memory of Light to be a great ending to one of the best and most intricate fantasy series I have read. The level of detail and foreshadowing in the earlier books is amazing. The whole world came alive for me, and a part of me will miss it now that the series is finally ended.<br /><br />That being said, the first half of A Memory of Light seemed to be a bit disjointed and unneeded in moving the story along to me. Compared to most of the other books in the series it felt bland and boring. There seemed to be little flow.<br /><br />Then came the chapter \\"The Last Battle\\". From that point the story seemed to accelerate to an ungodly pace. I could not stop reading.<br />*from this point there will be spoilers. Skip to the end in order to avoid them.*<br /><br />I must say that each time a major character died it was a shock. Sure, I understand that it is the end of an age. Sacrifices will be made. However when Suian, Gawan, and Engwene died I was left stunned. It seemed as though every couple pages would bring another death. Part of what made this worse is that Grendael, Moghedien, and Maseema do not die. Sure, they are no longer free to continue in their evil ways, but it feels worse that they survived while good people (no matter how annoying) died.<br /><br />The ending, though quite satisfying, also left a strange feeling in me. Rand appears to have burned the ability to channel out of himself, so how is it he is able to light his pipe just by thinking it? That is something that never happened in 'the waking world' so why should it happen now? Also, I figured out that he and Moriden switched bodies, but it really isn't explained how that happened or would even be possible. Obviously it can't be use of the one power since he no longer has that ability. Furthermore, if Min, Elaine, and Avienda want people to think he had died, they shouldn't have acted so indifferent to his death.<br /><br />The story itself still had some surprises left.I somehow forgot about Mat having 'died' at one point, therefore his link to the Horn  was broken. I also thought that Mazrim Taim was Demandred. I misread that and forgot completely about the Sharan.<br /><br />Overall A Memory of Light is an incredible ending to the Wheel of Time series. I would recommend it to all fantasy readers as well as every fan of the rest of the series. Had it not been for the way it started out I would have given the story 5 stars.
B008602KQI|5.0|I bought this as a gift because I liked the copy I had previously ordered from Amazon. It was well received.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game for everyone to enjoy... It was very challenging! I can not wait for more levels to open up...
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is one addictive game. I play it just about every time I can get my first gen kindle fire away from my 6 year old. Highly recommended.  works great as time killing game but choose what time you wish to kill because you will loose track of time. lol
B0049J2CKE|4.0|I liked it. Not a work of genius but a nice way to pass some time. Kind of creepy having all those rats in a kitchen.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish the creator would provide some help hints.  If you get stuck there is no way to continue. I was enjoying the game until I got stuck.
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|A well done movie by Ron Howard.  Great actors.  A must see if you want<br />to really learn about what happened with Apollo 13.
B00CKKDZ2S|1.0|total waste of space. I like to see what some free apps are about. Well, like I said waste of space.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I LOOOVE THIS GAME! It is soo addicting and completely worth the money. I would give it five stars but it makes my Kindle Fire HD shut off sometimes for up to an hour. Other than that, I love it! I also have it on my iPod touch and so does my sister. Great buy!
B00E8B1358|2.0|Preliminary Comments...<br /><br />After checking in with his right hand man, Michael Bay... Mr. Lorenzo di Bonaventura ordered all stops pulled and gave the green light to use up whatever pyrotechnics had not been used in the Transformers franchise in this, the latest installment in the G.I. Joe saga.  Sadly... as has become the beaten path in Hollywood, I am sure that there will be a third installment.  Unfortunately, because they blew everything up with the materials they had in this film, future writing will have to take a hit... Not that it possibly could, as I think that I imagined more creative G.I. Joe scenarios in my childhood years than was stitched together in the editing room of Paramount Studios.  However, in fairness... if you like Dwayne Johnson's bulging biceps and Adrianne Palicki's over-promoted bosom coupled with overpaid cameos featuring Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum.  This is your film.<br /><br />The Stars...<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson.  I will always smell what The Rock is cooking.  He's had some decent films in his career.  Think Fast Five and perhaps Faster.  Let's all forget Doom.  As Roadblock, he turns in a decent performance as a leading man.  But, when considering what he is being asked to do in this otherwise disappointing big budget catastrophe, that's not asking much.  Again, not faulting him for signing onto the project... but, his acting certainly got no help from the writing staff.<br /><br />Byung Hun Lee.  Definitely a lot of potential for the Storm Shadow character... if the production staff would remove themselves from the set and say \\"Byung, you are an awesome actor in your own right... just adlib/improvise.  It will be better than we came up with.\\"  Notwithstanding the monkeying on the part of director and entourage, he turns in an acceptable performance.  And if you're a lady, don't worry.  There are plenty of shots that would make even the most avid Wolverine/Hugh Jackman fan say \\"Put a shirt on, for crying out loud.\\"<br /><br />Jonathan Pryce.  He's fallen a long way from selling me Infinitis and foiling Pierce Brosnan with his nefarious plans for world domination.  I can't complain.  He had to play two roles.  And he only had enough character development written for one.  Sensing a pattern here, yet?<br /><br />Adrianne Palicki.  Who?  You might be saying.  I don't know.  A few chaotic scenes into the film that come after an awkward slide show force-feeds you all the requisite information you need to digest the toddler-created plot, she becomes one of the faces hogging up screen time.  Critic's note here... in the interests of being somewhat impartial I should note that I did find her attractive.  That being said, I don't think that her acting skills had much to do with her role/part.  I would like to see if she could pull off a more serious role that didn't focus so much of John Chu's camera time on her cleavage.  But instead... someone, somewhere in the studio said... \\"Hey, we have too many dudes in this film.  We need to add some ladies.  Otherwise this is just G.I. Joe: The Expendables.\\"<br /><br />Channing Tatum.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if you can really list him as a star in this film.  I won't mention why.  No, actually I will.  And if you still choose to watch the film, don't come crying to me when you find out that he's only in the first quarter (if even that) of the film.  If you're looking for more Channing action, go rent Magic Mike.  And then you won't miss him at all in the remainder of this film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis.  Or General \\"Joe\\" Colton who is the original inspiration for being called \\"Joes\\" even though he was never mentioned in the first film... at all.  On an aside, I think that Bruce must have bumped into Nicholas Cage at some point recently who informed Bruce that it doesn't really matter what the quality of the films is that you sign onto... you still get paid regardless.  And so, in an endless series of near fiascos, Bruce tacks this one ontohis CV after turning in decent performances in films like RED and Moonrise Kingdom.  Please note that he will not be reprising classic Willis awesomeness like we saw in Sixth Sense and Die Hard (but only the first three).<br /><br />The Plot...<br /><br />Sadly, there were some fairly opportune moments for this fledgling story to leap off the pages of a teenage fanfic writer's high school notebook...  But, the team that Mr. di Bonaventura got together decided to selectively pick and choose what they wanted to lift from the first film and run with that.  I'm not sure that they realized a need to improve upon it and embellish it somewhat.  And, there might be more to it... like an inability to sign some of the talent from the first flop.  Err, I mean film.  But, I suppose when you have people like Christopher Eccleston snub you... you're probably not going to be expecting greatness out of this film.<br /><br />So... the actual plot.  Cobra is on the lamb.  They've been getting theirs handed to them because the Joes are super awesome.  This sounds a lot like Transformers.  Hmm.  But wait!  There was that hanging chad we left in Florida... I mean, that loose end from the first film.  Oh, that naughty Zartan.  Impersonating the President.  Then we take a turn from two-dimensional to one dimensional thinking when the writers decide... \\"Hey, let's have the 'President' just eliminate the Joes... And it will setup the most epic revenge plot, ever!\\"  So what should we call this... hmmm... Retaliation?<br /><br />No guys, that's just what I'm calling my review after sending my $5 to Amazon to see it.<br /><br />Over/Under/My Recommendation...<br /><br />If you're really bored.  And you have seen just about everything else on Demand.  Give it a go.  Because obviously you're not in it for quality if you have rented that many films.  Otherwise, wax philosophically on your childhood years playing with G.I. Joes and watching the cartoons... which may have had better writing than this film.  In some ways, this film make the fanboys that produced AVP Requiem look professional, and that takes some skill.<br /><br />Bottom line... save your money.  It'll be in the \\"Great Movies for $1\\" bin at Wal-Mart by Christmas.his CV after turning in decent performances in films like RED and Moonrise Kingdom.

B005HEVBGG|5.0|Just catching up on the years that I missed while working.  I'm really enjoying it now.  I'm already into season 4.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I play it and my kids play it. Very challenging and never boring.  Simple to use and the various difficulty levels are great.
B001TW69J4|5.0|This is the first AAL album I've heard (it was their first was well), and I'm totally blown away.  The compositions are amazing, the guitar sounds are really tasty, and the programmed drums are very convincing.  If you're a fan of progressive, guitar-driven instrumental music, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this record.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I really love this cd. It is very uplifting and soothing. Love to listen to it before bed.<br />Very happy about my purchase.
B00AQB2A3I|2.0|Not my cup of tea, but might be yours.  FWIW, I enjoyed Porcupine Tree's &#34;The Incident&#34; record much more than this Steven Wilson outing.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|it was a very interesting concept with lots of good plot stories and a happy ending, overall a good movie
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Game is fun until you either have to spend money to buy more bubbles, or join Facebook. Would not recommend
0385340990|5.0|I was so blown away by the story and the historical aspects of the book.  The fictional story was terrific and combined so many aspects of reading the I enjoy.  History, the times of WWII, the autobiographical aspects plus I learned about an island that I had not previously known existed.  Leaving me with a desire to find out more.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Written so well! Who could not like it? Powerful female heroin, and funny enough that even my princess hating boyfriend liked it.
B008IGANGO|5.0|Mostly my love for the movie is built on the years of watching the syndicated series.  Love the characters and the spoofs always in the works.
B00A9C3RNQ|4.0|Very funny, falling a little short of hysterical, but quite a good watch. Both stars are perfect for their roles.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Even though I knew where the movie would end, it played just as the book was written.  Great characters, story, well directed, and well acted.  Just what I would have imagined from reading the book.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|Very disappointed. No closure to the last book. Just leaves u hanging. She has no intention on writing another book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3.  The entire show is edge of your seat, action and drama with believable characters and plot line.  Can't get enough of this incredibly well acted, directed show.  Love Claire Danes in this!  Love the tension and passion.  Incredible.
0634060384|5.0|This is the &#34;official&#34; collection. Differs a little from the bootleg versions that are not &#34;legal&#34; but it covers much of the same material. Should be in every Jazz musician's portfolio
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game. It's fun for hours. It's complicated enough for me but easy enough for my seven year old to enjoy.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I got this fast.  It looks nice and it works at the first tim I plug it in. So far so good
014241543X|2.0|I enjoyed this book for the most part.  Portions of it held my attention, especially those about the condition of the main character.  I was not pleased with the amount of fowl language in the book.  It did nothing to support the storyline and I felt like it was unnecessary.  I would not recommend it to others.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Used it again on vacation, that way  knew how to dress for my sightseeiing journey, will use it alot I'm sure
0439023521|5.0|After watching the movie, I decided to read the book.  I was not disappointed! This is one of the best books I've read in a long time!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|It was a good movie to show older stars, but boring after awhile with fight scenes. Lost interest. Not as good as first movie.
0439023491|5.0|I can not say enough about the books in this series. They are all incredible! I absolutely could not put this book down. Highly recommend!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|At level 18 my game froze and when I rebooted my kindle it was back to level 1.  I lost 5 islands including a gemstone island, 22 habitats, over 60 dragons and worst of all approximately 1300 gems on account (plus some I'd spent in the game).  Worse yet, I had recently purchased gems and did not receive credit for them.  When I contacted Backflip to ask them to please give me credit for my purchase, Blackflip sent me a standard form email stating they would not help me.  I guess they think it's fine to take people's money and not give them what they purchased (I.e. steal from their customers).<br /><br />The game is pretty and fun, right up until the moment when it freezes and takes everything you put into it.<br /><br />There are plenty of other pretty and fun games out there. This one's not worth getting hooked on.
0439023513|5.0|I loved every book in this series.  This one started a little slower than the other two, but I was not disappointed.  I was also surprised but pleased with the way the author wrapped everything up.  The only problem I have with it is not knowing what to read next because everything else pales in comparison!
B0063M22QO|1.0|This is definitely for beginners only!  Completed the first level in no time but was unable to move onto any others without even more $$.  Not worth paying for.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie brings back memories from when I watched it when it first came it. Great movie for the whole family.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Card has an amazing talent for describing the most fundamental elements of the human condition.  He makes you care about and at times even empathise with every character he writes.  This is one of the best works of fiction written in the modern age.
B005ZUR724|2.0|If the game was free, and didnt at every step entice you to buy in game items with cash. I would not have a problem with the game servers constantly being down, or the endless synchronization with the server. But we paid for this game, and let's be honest a lot of us have purchased runes. In return we as customers get constant server downtime. We also get little or no info about what is the problems or even an estimated eta on a fix. Hard to give it more than 2 stars. Buyer beware.
B00BHMF578|1.0|I did not watch this movie as the Amazon<br />channel questioned the validity of my credit card. The movie never down loaded.I have 2 valid credit cards listed with your company. I am a prime member. I am very disapointed with the amazon movie system.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I didn't start reading until recently and haven't finished yet.<br /><br />The books were recommended by someone that has read them after they heard I liked the HBO series.<br /><br />That being said I like the writing style. It's an easier read than I imagined. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Love this movie. Although the singing is not great (compared to stage productions) this movie tells the story line so well. Although I also have the London stage version it is hard to figure out cast members & what's going on. Everyone who loves Les Mis should buy this movie!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|It is amazing i have never seen something so cool that i wish it was six star i love it
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Bought it because it's so cute but can't figure out how to play it, just says build a reef??? How? Also can cost $ if you use certain items.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|lots of action good movie,Getting the 3d was the best, the dvd and ultraviolet digital copy is worth the cost
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I think I would read anything this author offered - this is yet another in his line of culturally perceptive works of art.  His writing style is both engaging and thought provoking. I would recommend this highly to my friends, book club members - anyone looking for something that brings good solid writing and heart wrenching and redeeming life experiences to light.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|You take an open mind into seeing this movie and you will not be disappointed.Good scifi writing and action.Cast are all top notch.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Really love this series!<br />Gideon and Eva's steamy relationship will have you all hot and bothered with twists of angst! Must read series, can't wait for the next book!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I don't particularly like hidden objects games, but this game is a lot of fun.  I totally enjoy the storyline, and the puzzles are quite challenging as well!  Well worth the money!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We watched as a group and everyone loved the characters both upstairs and down.<br />The actors are wonderful and the setting is gorgeous.
B00CX7TOTQ|3.0|\\"Sometimes things become part of you whether you like it or not.\\" Benjamin Ford (De Niro) is a former American soldier who served in Bosnia in 1992. Emil Kovac (Travolta) is a former Serbian soldier who served in 1992. Twenty years later Ford lives alone in a remote cabin trying to forget the past while Kovac has been searching for Ford for twenty years. When the two meet up again a new war begins, this time it becomes personal. I have never really been a Travolta fan and lately it seems that De Niro is very hit or miss so my excitement was tempered for this one. I have to say I really did enjoy this and the movie kept me interested the entire time. The movie is basically just these two hunting each other in the woods while they try to get inside the head of the other and try and understand why this is happening. The only real problem with this is that when Kovac catches Ford he lets him get away and vice versa so it gets a little repetitive but that doesn't really detract too much from the enjoyment of the movie. Overall, kind of a cross between First Blood and the Killer Elite. I enjoyed it. I give it a B.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|There are so many reasons why I loved this book-- the main characters are well defined and they are both so easy to love and root for.  The story is gripping and I found it difficult to put the book down.  Even after I finished, I found myself thinking about the book and its characters.  I love that it's set in the 80s (omg... there was a time before texting, emailing, and cell phones!?) Definitely brought me back to growing up without these modern conveniences.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Rainbow Rowell and I plan on reading more of her books since this one left such an impression on me!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|fun to play. having trouble putting it down. I have to get up and go do something.<br />Extremely clever concept!<br />My whole family is addicted and can't put it down.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game because I like games that have action and because I love Iron man. And I like cheese.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|It's got a sound that rock/pop radio abandoned in the mid-to-late 90's, and that country radio had forgotten about 2005. Digging these guys--I will be buying more albums.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Breaking Away is an overlooked movie that has some classic lines.The movie shows life in a small town in the midwest and deals with the late adolescent years. It has many hilarious scenes and holds up well after 30 years! The Bloomington, In. scenery is beautiful and the music is wonderful.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Awesome. Loved how the book was set up and how it flowed. I also deeply enjoyed the in depth political, military, and societal analysis of each country in the book. Great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. it is great for horse lovers! I enjoy all of the mini games in this game. I would definetly recommend this app!
B005529EI2|5.0|is that I don't have to change discs on long, brilliant movies like this one. I already had the extended edition on disc, but I watch it again so often it was worth buying the Amazon video both for watching it when not at home, and for not having to change discs!
B008XG1X18|1.0|Not at all what I thought. Why would anyone waste time viewing pics/photos from complete strangers? Is this Facebook part II???
B001I45UFC|5.0|and the Chronicles of Narnia are classics that Kindle makes it easy to carry around with you all the time on one's Kindle, tablet, or laptop.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I reread this book after many years and have realised that, despite its age, its a great story, well written with great characters. Deservedly a classic!  Perfect holiday reading.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|aiming takes some getting used to, but game play is fluid. very nice graphics with challenging levels. get this one!
B002MFULQO|3.0|The video and audio both worked very well.  However, I found the movie boring so I didn't watch it all.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This one's a real page-turner! If you're looking for a mystery that smartly written and keeps you guessing, this book is for you.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|The premise has the potential to continue develop complexity, so there is a promise of a few good seasons.  The scoring of the scenes is tight and suspenseful.  I am so caught up in the story that I forget the virtuous performance of the leading actress playing all those roles.  I watch little television, but this is right up there with X-Files, Numbers and Lie to Me.  If you liked those shows, or Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, you are likely to be interested in this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My friends put me onto this series and I am so hooked.  It is done so well and I enjoy all of the characters.  Way to go Downton!
B003G4W49C|3.0|The book is an enjoyable fantasy. A bit dry at times with the training dialogue. It's an interesting light read.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son, by Adam Johnson, is one of the most compelling books I have ever read. It is the story of a man's journey from childhood throughout his entire life. It is a story of North Korea in the recent past. It is a story of evil, brutality, the human need to connect with others, the meaning of love, and ultimate triumph.<br />This book is not for the faint of heart. In it, unspeakable atrocities are described in vivid detail. What is more disturbing to me, is the cold determination of the abusers, and their ability to justify what they do in the name of loyalty and national security. It makes me weep for the slippery slope we have embarked upon in our own country. Photos of our own soldiers torturing and humiliating captured \\"enemies\\" too often came to mind.<br /><br />But Mr. Johnson is a master storyteller, weaving glimpses of hope, humanity, and even love, into the story so that one is compelled to continue. I began to feel I was in the story, and it was very hard to put it down to do mundane things like laundry, grocery shopping, and cooking dinner. It is easy to see why he won a Pulitzer prize for this book.  The picture of North Korean life reinforced my gratitude for living in this wonderful country, but it also highlighted areas where we have so much to improve: the poverty and lack of decent education of so many of our citizens, the high rate of people incarcerated compared to the rest of the Western world, and the level of violence in our country. There are large areas of our country where people live with just as much fear and despair as the citizens of North Korea. This book has compelled me to do more to work toward improvement here at home.<br />I highly recommend this book, but warn that it is not an \\"easy\\" read. I had to pray constantly as I read; for the millions (billions?) of people throughout the world for whom the life described is a reality, for the wisdom to see whatever part I play in creating this awful reality, and for the courage to work toward peace and safety for all.ourage to work toward peace and safety for all.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I got it and at first it was AWESOME cuz my kindle hates YouTube and this one worked but now it keeps saying it has stopped  so I don't really care for it now
B005DJREJS|5.0|The premiere is promising. looking forward to watching more episodes. Not too teeny bopper, just the right amount of juxtaposition.
B000SNW0HA|5.0|It's rythm is excellent for each track and it is a good album. I like the beats of the songs. I think this songs are GREAT!
B007EECSFA|5.0|A beautifully crafted piece that keeps you on the edge of your metaphorical seat. The jumping back and forth between time periods can be confusing unless handled with great care and Ms Morton does it with grace and eloquence. Take your time with this one. It is over way too soon.
B0020M99LC|3.0|I'm not a cynic or a hater. Maybe the movie was over-hyped, but I found this to be a mediocre film.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|David Tennant continues to impress in season 4 with even more crazy antics! His side kick is more dramatic than previous companions, but is still interesting.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Spoiler Alert! Is it me or did Tom Cruise never admit to being Jack Reacher. I swear every time someone asked him if he was Jack Reacher, he went around the question. Even when he was talking to the guys holding the attorney hostage, he never admitted to being Jack Reacher. LOL! He even bought new clothes at a thrift store and threw out the ones he had on.  This guy was definitely off the grid.<br /><br />I liked this movie it was dark and sarcastic.  It was the anti-hero. Tom Cruise did a really good job playing Jack Reacher. I myself wouldn't want to cross Reacher.  The scariest guys in movies are the guys who are way too calm, because most of the time that means there crazy and will mess you up bad.<br /><br />That said, there could have been more to the story line and little more action which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Other than that is was a good movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I heard Aslan interviewed on NPR a couple of weeks before the Fox News debacle hit the press, and put it on my Library list. When the idiots hit the fan, I changed my mind and bought it on Kindle to read immediately.<br /><br />As a Christian, one of the things I find most intriguing about the story of Jesus is the inherent conflict between Jesus the man and Jesus the son of God. In the Gospels, Jesus himself struggles with his burden. Up to the last minute before his trial, begging \\"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\\" (Luke 22:42 NIV)<br /><br />Yet, in most Bible-based teachings, and indeed in the books of the New Testament following the Gospels, that aspect is ignored in favor of Jesus the God. Jesus the man is forgotten.<br /><br />Reza Aslan's book resurrects Jesus the man - Jesus the human person, born of Mary, nailed to a cross, killed for his people. Whether you believe those people are all believers of his time and those yet to come, or you believe those people to be the Hebrews locked in conflict with the Roman Empire, that doesn't change the courage and conviction with which he acted.<br /><br />I find Jesus the rebel troublemaker so much more appealing than the glowing holy infallible Jesus burned into stained glass windows and untouchable by the masses.<br /><br />If you love Jesus and want to understand the story of the man before he was known only as Jesus the God, this book is well worth your time. I also recommend you check out [[ASIN:1456839403 Kissing Fish: Christianity for People Who Don't Like Christianity]] for a refreshing viewpoint on the religion of Christ.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoy watching period dramas.  This one is especially nice with the colorful costumes and equally colorful characters.  Love it!
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|A Great story of courage perseverance and luck. Very easy and quick read. A must for lovers of WWII history
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It was amazing I enjoyed it all the way till the end recommended to all who need a good book
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Very nice pool setting for little kids, with the inflatable toys and the slide. Good for hours of fun in the water. ( kids 1-4 maybe can enjoy completely)
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great to read during the summer season of blooms.  I took two days to finish this sweet read as the author told the story of pain, fear, loss, tragedy, forgiveness, redemption and love. All the characters were well developed, relatable and real. I think communication through the use of flowers should be added  to \\" The 5 Love Languages\\". ...making it 6. But then, for Victoria, Grant and baby Hazel (reconciliation), that would be the flowering cherry on top. That makes 7!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is truly despicable how much fun this game is.  Smooth graphics and of course all the hilariousness of the minions
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Addictive and fun!  My sons and I challenge each other to best each other's high scores.  A lot of entertainment value for $1.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome, I play it for hours and not even realize it. I recommend this game for all ages.!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you ever wanted your world to be styled by you without having to pay billions, this is definetly your game, because now you only have to pay $7.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This is of course all purely opinion, but, I love this movie.  It is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in a while.  Star Trek has really passed over to the Action genre.  I went to see this movie in the theater with no expectations, and I was blown away.  The imagery and visuals are terrific.  the story plays out nicely, leaving you wanting to know more as the movie progresses, which is key to hold someone's attention.  I love the soundtrack.  My father-in-law loves sci-fi and I highly recommended this to him as his favorite movie for 2013.  Hopefully he likes it.
B00005O3VD|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!<br />I'm a big Barbara Streisand fan and wanted to have this on DVD!
0399162097|5.0|Karen Joy Fowler has written a powerful and moving novel about families, growing up, loneliness and loss. I recommend it highly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Highly entertaining series about a hot shot lawyer who just made Senior Partner known for his ability to 'close' deals who meets a man with the ability to remember everything he reads and turns him into an associate at his law firm, even though the man never graduated from Harvard Law or any college at all.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I really don't know what happened, but I played this game once since I downloaded it, and now it won't work.  I'm really disappointed, because it seemed like it wad going to be a fun game!  If there's a fix for this, I wish you would hurry up already!!!
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|I have all their material - love them.  I am a big fan of true talent, song writing and arranging, and solid performance, rather than manufactured sound we see in most of our 'artists' today. Lad=y Antebellum delivers.
0307346617|5.0|Loved it. Great reading. I dont really enjoy reading books but this really kept me into the book. I would recommend this to my friends
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a laugh out loud movie! The movie was entertaining from beginning to end! I would watch this movie again!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Perfection in cinematic form. It really doesn't get any better than this. Very few movies are as riveting and entertaining.
B008O037RG|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl for my boyfriend and love it!  I had to buy another copy just for me to have.  Vinyl records give it a very unique addition to the sound that you don't get from the digital formats.  I also love that they also give you the MP3 downloads with the vinyl for a more portable format.  You may say that you're buying vinyl just for the look...well it is completely worth it.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book really opened my eyes toward the power of happiness and positivity. I am looking forward to utilizing these principles in my life and bringing a more positive outlook to my work place.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|The movie was excellent. Its a movie that I will go back and watch again. I have really enjoyed the movie. Thanks Charlene Dill.
1594136440|3.0|This debut novel is well researched historical fiction, with some good character development.  It illuminates an aspect of slavery that is often overlooked - indentured servants.  It's an entertaining read, but somewhat predictable, especially with the prologue included at the beginning.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is only one of the hundreds of books I ever read, and reading this, this book pulls you in, immersing you into the story. It makes you feel what the characters feel. It is one of the few books I have ever read which made me have feelings while reading, and frankly, this is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and possibly the best book I will ever read. I recommend this book to people who are not emotionally fragile, for this book gave me one of the strongest feelings I have ever had. Joy, excitement, sadness, anger and more. Hope this helps.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Very fun and challenging puzzle game. Worth the .99 cents. I want more levels or a part 2. Great way to exercise your brain. Very fun and addicting. Some levels may seem impossible, but you just have to reexamine all the tools.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I wanted an alternative to the dualshock controller because I cannot compete in MW2 with the PS3 controllers sticks.  I thought this might be the solution because the sticks are farther apart.  The controller material feels nice in your hands but all of the controls are set up high.  They are on a weird angle from your hands.  The sticks themselves are way to tall for my taste but the overall flawed part of this controller is the fact that it disconnects very often.  It has almost no range beyond 12 feet and if there is ANY obstruction between the controller and the receiver then it will drop the connection.  I'm saying you can't even have a sock sitting on a table.  If it is in the line of sight for this controller it will drop the connection.<br /><br />They need to smash the whole thing down so it is flatter, shorten the sticks to about 1/2 their current height, and get a solid connection to the receiver to be considered worth while for hardcore gamers.<br /><br />**EDIT 8-10-2013***<br /><br />Observations after the first 50 hours use.  The left analog stick gets 'stuck' (literally physically) in the up position.  Maybe it will wear in and not get stuck after more use?  I do not see what it is getting stuck on.  The diamond buttons are really good.  The d-pad misfires often.  It happens most to me on the down side of the pad.  Dead zone is not that bad in my opinion.  It does rumble but it's not very powerful.  It is definitely a worthwhile controller for the casual gamer.  Hardcore pro's will want something more precise.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I enjoy hidden object games, they're a fun way to spend a little while. This one had its good points, a reasonably fun storyline, some good but functional puzzles. My gripes come in on a couple of points- 1) playing this on a kindle fire is made incredibly frustrating by having taps meant to grab a cornered object mistaken for a signal to open and close a hidden compartment several more times, and 2) puzzles that seem to have no logical solution, making it a slog of guesswork and waiting for hints.<br /><br />Overall, it was an interesting way to spend a couple hours. I just wish it had reached its potential.<br /><br />(Edited for spelling.)
159463176X|4.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />This book covers many generations and different families as we go back and forth in time. The story starts off in Afghanistan in 1952, and 3 year old Pari and her 6 year old brother Abdullah are walking with their father to Kabul - ostensibly for him to get work in construction. We learn that the siblings mother had died when she gave birth to Pari and that they are extremely close; in fact Abdullah has pretty much been the one to take care of Pari.<br /><br />Once in Kabul, the children and their father are driven by their Uncle Nabi (the sister of their stepmother Parwana) to the home of the wealthy Wahdati family. The couple have no children and the beautiful and very modern and elegant wife seems oddly mismatched to the stern and detached husband.<br /><br />From there on, the story continues across time and continents as we follow the lives of these people and learn about others who become involved in the story and in their lives. We go to Paris and the Greek Isle of Tinos and eventually to San Francisco.  We learn the sometimes heartbreaking stories of those affected by war and poverty and disease and about those who work to make things better. We learn about differences in culture and lifestyles and about lives that are not fully lived because of restrictions placed on them.<br /><br />The title really does perfectly describe the scope and feel of this book - the echoing of the lives of these two children off of others and onto whole different sets of lives.<br /><br />I was a fan of [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] and [[ASIN:B0084I2PEO A Thousand Splendid Suns]]  When I first started this book I thought it was going to be my favorite of the three, but I found that the pace slowed down a little bit as the book continued. At no time however was it not interesting nor did my attention waiver. I also found myself tearing up at the end and this doesn't happen to me very often.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed about the book is that things are not always predictable and that the author doesn't need to have perfect or happy endings - they are more realistic and complicated.<br /><br />I read this book for book club tonight and I am looking forward to a good discussion.  Recommended for book clubs and for those of you who enjoyed this author's previous novels.joyed about the book is that things are not always predictable and that the author doesn't need to have perfect or happy endings - they are more realistic and complicated.<br /><br />I read this book for book club tonight and I am looking forward to a good discussion.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|All women should read this book and have the men in their lives read it too. This book is definitely a great start to a controversial issue. Instead of ignoring gender issues, we should recognize that there are issues and bring them out in the open. Then we can start having meaningful conversations and bring about real change for men and women.
B000002J09|5.0|Its a nostalgic cd. The songs are well crafted and composed. This cd is well a classic it brings memories and enjoyment without fatigue.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It's simple and fast and I enjoy playing it will waiting in my doctors offices.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's awesome but sometimes hard.  I still think it's amazing though.<br /><br />I think its awesome. But its kinda hard. I still think it's cool.
0679805273|5.0|Pass these out annually to graduating seniors.  They love it and the message it portrays.  Definitely recommend it as a gift.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I'm sorry but this is the only way BSG should be watched. Way Pricier than it should be but I have one of the best series in the best format to watch. Awesome.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Good story, I have read all the books in the saga so far and really enjoy the passion and emotion.
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|Blu-Ray is the ultimate way to watch anything and this movie is no different. I like all of the FF series ,,, if you like cars and racing this can't disappoint.
B000002VMD|5.0|She had an awesome voice. and it shows on this album. Usually not a huge fan of soundtrack albums unless like Forrest Gump they are compilations. But Houston can carry a whole album.
B0069P0DU2|5.0|Excellent, good product¡ perfect for party . I leve it<br />I bought for the party for my Chile, al people llover it
B000QUEQBS|5.0|This is a gritty political thriller. Great performances and a lot of action. Danny Glover as the bad guy along with Ned Beatty. Michael Pena does a great job as a rookie FBI agent. But Wahlberg is great as the shooter
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have bin waiting for 7.2 forever so please update even if you think it's a waste of time me and my friends can't play together and could you seriously fix the glitch/problem  that kindle fires can't connect and host with each other
B008EKON56|2.0|The sound of this little device is good, it performs much better than earphone jack while attached to my car.<br /><br />While there're 2 problem:<br />1. It's not stable, sometimes it will suddenly stop working (music stopped), and then click play again on my iPod the sound starts to playing from iPod's speaker... I then need to try pause->play multiple times then it begins to work again. (I tried to re-plug and I'm sure it's attached to the iPod very firmly, but doesn't help, I tried my iPhone 4s also, same problem)<br />2. The USB charging DOESN'T WORK at all. It just doesn't charge, either iPod or iPhone.<br /><br />I like the shape of this device very much, but not the quality.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Glad I finally took the advice and started watching. Season two already started. one two three four five six seven more words...
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I can not put down this game.  IT makes me want to beat the last score.  Love it, love it, love it.  A great game.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This is not the real game its some random cheat guide. The kindle fire needs to catch up with apple and other electronics. DO NOT GET IT!
B005LAII4E|2.0|First of all I'm absolutely stunned by the 4 and 5 star rating by some people. I'm assuming they are mostly from kids under 30 that just love the Rock and know nothing about Gi Joe. In my opinion,this was not even a Gi Joe movie. Did it have action,yes,but what happened to the continuation of the story? It could have been so good. Instead they throw a couple of A list actors in,some good action and hope it draws a crowd.. Anyone that knows anything about Gi Joe,is that they are 3 levels ahead of the military. This was clearly shown in the 1st movie,none of which was in the 2nd. They dumbed the 2nd one down. When Cobra initially attacked Duke and Ripcord in the 1st movie,it was a wtf moment. The tech was so superior to what the marines had. Everything that made the 1st one good ,was not present in the 2nd one. I wanted to see what happens to Destro and Cobra commander next. I wanted to see more tech. I do have to say the satellite tech was really cool. The fight on the mountains was cool too. But why not bring back the original cast and continue the story.. What a disappointment! Stephen Sommers directed the 1st one,the 2nd one was directed by someone else,now I understand how it got messed up. Its like Bryan Singer directing X-men 1&2 and then Brett Ratner totally screwing up the 3rd one.
3836538725|5.0|An exceptional work from an exceptional man with an exceptional team. Looking forward to see the documentary on how it was done.
B00E193TM2|3.0|I have really enjoyed all of FFDP's releases, but this one. Here is why. Overall it does sound good, and like b-tracks from their last CD, but they had nothing that was fresh or creative unless you call increasing the number of juvenile F-bombs dropped in one song an improvement (really.. do you listen to yourselves?). There were a lot of remixes as well, that were weak repeats of the original songs that weren't up to FFDP quality anyway. I just hope the second part of this record is more redeeming than the first. I'ts like they ran out of ideas and just threw some leftovers from the trash can of their last CD. Sorry, but the truth sometimes hurts. I still love FFDP as a band, and will hope for a better compilation on the next release.
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I like the app well enough.  I liked lemmings.  Twice now,  while reading on my kindle fire, I close the book and the app icon has mystically appeared at the front of the queue (carousel?)  I wonder if/how it turned itself on.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Very well done. However, was a bit disappointed listed among the dead. What else can I say other than it was  a very good movie.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Good show for adults.  The costumes are very cool and it makes me glad I don't have to live in that time.
B002RB7VMA|4.0|Upbeat with such a great sound. The way he redid some of my favorite songs is like fresh rain to what I once saw bringing new emotions and ideas.<br /><br />The only thing I prefer is the live versions of his work.  This seems oddly mechanical for such a great mix of instruments and voice,  hence the 4 star.
B00006469V|5.0|The opera came in perfect condition. Marvelio did an excellent job of sending it on time. The musical piece was tremendous just as I anticipated with all the Wagner operas I have purchased to date. The latter parts of the opera are just simply ethereal and heavenly.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I went thru 3 routers, belkin, linksys, and netgear....NO ONE OF THEM WOULD RECOGNIZE THE CHROMECAST DEVICE!<br /><br />but<br /><br />My next door neighbor has a 10 year old linksys without security......and i recognized the chromecast right away.<br /><br />I think there is a major problem with newer routers and the customer support for all three companies is terrible.<br /><br />Has anyone else had this problem, do you know of a fix???
B0037VNX44|5.0|Tom Hardy is amazing. Truly a legend. Look forward to seeing more from this actor. He's compared often to De Niro and Brando, but he's a legend in his own right. Brilliant. If you haven't seen Warrior yet, please see as well.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have taken up his food lifestyle suggestion.  Have been on for 3 weeks.  Have not lost the same weight that is listed but maybe need another 3 weeks to validate.<br />Not so hard to eat this way.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love having all my craft supply lists in one place. And it syncs with my Kindle Fire. Love it!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This is like the Lion and lion;s Game.  The series continues.  Same as the others with nice plot.<br />Will read more of DeMille.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|There doesn't seem to be a way to figure this game out!  I have yet to &#34;escape&#34;. That's why I gave it such a low rating.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book kept me interested, but it dragged a bit, but was still interesting.  I didn't like the ending very much.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts you out on easy mode but by the time you get through you know you've been challenged. I keep going back to do them all over again!  Never bored.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had been wanting to watch this show when it was on network TV - just never made it happen. Now that I've finished the first season, I can't wait to catch up it the current season!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This was the first game I downloaded and I continue to go back and play it. I like the &#34;Adventure&#34; mode and like the fact that it's not timed.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I am comparing bot movies for an upcoming Gatsy paty I am having.  There are great things about both movies.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Second game of Angry Birds I ever played and it was free!  Now I know why they are so popular. Great game!
B007EE4XKI|4.0|Love any thing star trek. It's good to know data is still alive somewhere in time. I hope to read more about data.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I watched this movie years ago, and know that it is loosely based on events that happened after the Munich killings.  Having said that, Spielberg is a movie producer, not a historian.  He doesn't claim that this is factual and it's based on a book.<br /><br />To the critics of the movie for supposed political implications, I think you are taking some of the events or dialog in the movie and turning into something it is not.  People have a right to question their actions.  Murdering people, after all, I hope would scar anyone, even if for reasons they feel is justifiable.  And that's the dialog.  But this theme is not constant through the movie, and at the beginning when they get their first kill they are all celebrating. So this theme of questioning their actions and comparing it to what the terrorist did hardly shows up at all in the movie, so I don't feel it was important to Spielberg as much as it was to show that people have inner conflict about continually going around in a secretive way and killing people.<br /><br />The movie follows a team of assassins as they track down members of the terrorist group that was involved with the Munich killings.  They are not SEAL team trained, then CIA trained, assassins.  They are what Israel decides is a team that can blend into European society and carry out a mission with enough skill to get the job done and not get caught.<br /><br />To me the movie seems plausible and the characters seem plausible and that's all that matters to me when watching a historical fiction movie.  The movie is suspenseful, dramatic and in my opinion very well acted.<br /><br />And to those who doubt there would be friction between assassins and their govt. officials, well, OK you have your right to think as you may. I can easily see why a govt would want those assassins to be very much under their control, or dead.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I get more compliments from this case. You just don't see it in stores. People say &#34;if I had known you can get a case like this, I would not have bought the big bulky one I have now.&#34;
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought it was a spin on your classic murder mystery.  I loved the way it is told...I felt that was unique.  I would definitely recommend to others
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It was great to read a book that was both entertaining, and instructional - a glimpse at how many people from Germany, Russia, England, and to a lesser extent, France and America experienced WWII - both before and during the conflict.  Highly recommended.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Love this show! Needs a little more nerdy stuff like previous seasons but still very funny! Love the cast and their charachters!
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|I completely fell in love with these two awesome guys James&Bob! The second book is great as the previous one! And I really hope there will be one/two/three more:)
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Item Received as described, quickly and in perfect condition. Gave as gift to my step son and he was VERY happy. No complaints here!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was entertaining and well written. But if you are buying it to see what happens next in the show you will be disappointed. The show has taken bits and pieces of the book and run with it. Piper is even less likeable in the book than she is on TV. But it is still an interesting read. It took me a little longer to read than most books, but I never wanted to quit on it like I have on some others. All in all, I would pay for it again.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Item Received as described, quickly and in perfect condition. Gave as gift to my  son and he was VERY happy. No complaints here!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and I play it all the time. I like how they put the game in different locations each month, overall, it is a great game!
B00CW665VI|4.0|It was interesting that the story was written from the man's perspective. He was really confused about his situation but muddled through to get his woman.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|great historical fiction<br />lovely scenery and castles<br />beautiful costumes<br />fabulous acting and actors<br />an action packed drama that keeps you coming back for more!!
B004RKXNDU|4.0|Not my taste really, but for someone who likes this genre, it's a good base.<br />The writing shows why Le Carre is a favorite.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I thought it was great  writing. Entertaining. Thoughtful. Interesting point of view. Would be a good book for book clubs.
B007SGM084|4.0|There is far better writing out there but the books somehow still pull you in and I find myself googling to see who will be cast in the movies.  Wishing for a Henry Cavill, Olivia Wilde combination!  They did a lot for my marriage, definitely put me in the mood for romance but if you are looking for great erotic literature, this is not it!  It's a fun fantasy with a nice dark thread running through it to spark your imagination.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a really good app. I was having issues with the battery indicator on my kindle and this has been an awesome alternative. I highly recommend it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Got if for my GF's birthday she loved it the album and video, she's a big fan of Michael Buble!
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|For those who met Bon Jovi on top (Slippery When Wet, New Jersey, Keep the faith), this phase that lasts since Lost Highway is difficult to digest. I think the main problem is the production, which makes everything very Pop, with no weight. There's nothing about \\"rock\\" in the albums. I missed Keep the faith, for example, with great rocks as If I was your mother and Fear. Or even These days with Something for the pain and These days (the song). The band lost its heart and soul, it is all artificial, to please new fans. PLEASE, bring Alec John Such and Richie Sambora back, grab Bob Rock to produce and make an album in the style of Keep the faith. 90% of fans expect it. Quit this comfort zone. REVIVE!
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin have given two of country music's greatest stars a great tribute. I can sit back and hear Don Rich in the background that's the kind of job Vince and Paul did on this CD
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is kinds like subway surfers but you have so many different places you can switch to. I would daily that it tops subway surfers. I recomend this to all ages.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn is fast becoming one of my new favorites. She has interesting subject matter, and memorable characters. Couldn't' put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a really great game for kids and adults who love games like temple run. I really have had a good experience with this game and I have gotten very far. Unlike other running games Subway Surfer is very reliable and never stops. I really love it.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I had more fun at this movie than words can say. This soundtrack is evocative of that enjoyment, and keeps me going at the gym. It's exactly what you want.<br /><br />One caution: driving with this on may result in traffic advisories. Just FYI.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show and it keeps me coming back for me. Cant wait to finish watching the rest of the seasons!!! Go Prime membership!!! lol
0375842209|5.0|When the narrator of a book is Death (yes, THAT Death), and it's the story of a young girl in late 1930's and early 1940's Nazi Germany, you can figure that a lot of really bad things are going to happen. They do, beginning with the first few pages. But there's light and hope and even a good bit of humor in this extraordinary, brilliantly written book as well. The author has a particular gift for unexpected word choices that startle you for a second before you nod and go \\"yeah, that's the perfect image, that works.\\" But what else would you expect from a book that's so compelling in its portrayal of the power of words to affect the world? Recommended.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is super fun, I just wish there was more free levels. You just start really enjoying it then you have to pay. It seems all the hidden objects games are like that.
0143116738|4.0|Because this book is filled with stories it was fun and easy to read--plus being inspiring in a way.  It's good to read a book that encourages us to follow our passions--and even to think about what they are!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you are a fan of the TV show CASTLE, you will like it as you will be able to hear the voices of Castle and Beckett thought the book.  Otherwise, it will depend on your level of expectations and sophistication for a police procedural whether you will enjoy the book and this series.  I found the mystery engaging and the character rapport delightful.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|had a herd tome when hey did update, bit worked fine when I cleared my catch. really fun and addictive.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have poor eyesight,  yet I'm able to play this game with relative ease. For me, that's a big plus. I skip the dialog,  and find the game play very enjoyable. I recommend this game.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|The trio of Kotzen/Sheehan/Portnoy are not new to the game. These three names have rocked arenas around the world as well as bars, clubs, and other small venues. I had heard Richie Kotzen when he was in Mr. Big with Billy Sheehan and had liked how they gelled in their second album together. Richie only sang a little but I knew he had some pipes. Billy had also done projects with Mike Portnoy, so when I heard that these three would be working together I had a hint it would be something special As my title says, they do not disappoint. Rather than drone on about this and that point of their album I will simply say this: go to youtube and listen to the various tracks that will be posted there. If you like it, buy it. These are good guys making special music in a sea of mediocrity. They deserve our support.
0762451319|5.0|I feel that the other reviews have been a bit unfair, or at least had different expectations. This is not a large product. It is one of those small boxed sets that bookstores sell by the register. As such, the books are always a \\"bonus\\" and not the main attraction, so to speak. If I thought I was ordering a normal sized book, I would have been disappointed. As someone who really likes those small sets, this is an excellent value.<br /><br />Hot Topic sells products similar to each of the individual items, but at a higher cost. The tattoo set is very similar, only slight smaller, than one at HT for $6.50 on its own. They have a similar necklace (only it is longer and a solid black vs. gunmetal color for $14.50. In the past, they have sold similar movie magnets for $3ish each. Thus, the value in the set is obvious.<br /><br />The necklace is a shorter chain, but I actually love that. I have a very small neck, so it hangs on me as an 18\\" typically hangs on someone else. I'd say it is probably 16 inches or so, but I did not measure it. It most certainly is not shorter than 15 inches. The pendant and chain are a nice gunmetal color, extremely smooth, and well made. They're very shiny and pretty.<br /><br />In previous bookstore-register boxed sets I've gotten, it is typical to get a necklace and a small book or stickers. This set gives you that and quite a bit more. If you look at it that way, it is well worth the cost and you get quite a lot.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|poorly written, soft porn. My wife suggested I read it, I would prefer a technical manual approach with equipment needed, appropriate anatomy and physiology section. I'm struggling to finish it because I told her I would read it.

B008UX2UIO|5.0|It's the second time I read this novel (first in Spanish, now in English), and it is brilliant mixture of humour and social criticisim. I really think the normal peope should found  Confederacy of Dunces? to make another world possible. which is in the hands of four authentically unbrained.
B004G6009U|4.0|It's a great movie.  The price was good for the Blu ray, DVD combo.  I always love a great sale.
B004LROUNG|5.0|There were times that were slow in developing the plot and thus one might be ready to give up reading this book since it wasn't like the other Grisham books but...<br />Reading on to the end the plot got more and more interesting and I really enjoyed this book.<br />I would recommend that one read this book!!<br />Rosemary

B00DP3IESY|3.0|surprisingly good plot for a Tom Cruise movie.  Still, never really reached escape velocity, but reliable Tom Cruise entertainment for his fans.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|My friend's son played for a about 1/2 hour and then the game stopped working.  Gues that's all you get for free.
B003O86FMW|4.0|While not as good as the first book, and pretty predictable, this is still a lot of fun.  It is good sci fi - an elaborate world, yes, but still a primarily character driven story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved it but wanted more, thought it was challenging, got hooked then there were no more levels.  a little upset with not bring able to continue.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like how this game actually makes you figure things out. It's not the typical &quot;tap without thinking&quot; kind of game. It's one of the best free ones out there.  The only down side is how few levels there are.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I enjoyed the game , it was fun and entertaining ,not surprised by anything feel like I have been there done that. But still liked it
B0006L16N8|4.0|X&Y is coldplay's third effort and they keep the same sound as they did on their previous two albums. An album filled with beautiful melodies and gloomy pop/rock songs and is an instant classic in coldplay's discography as well as pop/rock music in the 2000s. If you loved PARACHUTES, and A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD then you will love X&Y just as much, if your newer to COLDPLAY and enjoyed their new sound such as MYLOXYOLO then you might not COLDPLAY in the early 2000s.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is like crack to them.<br />They build little houses & little towns.<br />They also like playing multiplayer also .
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Been a longtime fan of COLDPLAY their first 3 albums remain some of my all time favorite albums. I was somewhat dissapointed with their previous album \\"VIVA LA VIDA..\\" which had its moments but just wasn't as good as their previous 3. When i heard there was a new album from COLDPLAY i wasn't thrilled about it cause of their previous release, MYLOXYOLO is a different album and they take a different direction and the band expands musically. This album is filled with synthesizers hardly any guitars and the absence of the piano/guitar/rock that made coldplay, not mention a collaboration with RIHANNA, which is horrible move in my opinion and COLDPLAY are starting to seem like a band just cashing in big money and not making music the honest way and pushing some of their old fans away but bringing in some new fans at the same time. I am a huge fan of this band they are one of my biggest influences musically but they have let me down with their last two albums, and just hoping COLDPLAY will go back to their roots for what their known for and made them famous on their next album.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|THIS APP FROM AMAZON STORE WORKS VERY GOOD WITH MY HTC SENSATION 4G.<br />WARNING!!! THERE IS ANOTHER ONE IN GOOGLE PLAY THAT DOESN'T WORK. SORRY GOOGLE.
B000069AUI|5.0|A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD is one of most perfect albums ever recorded, it flows perfectly with big choruses, hooks, and beautiful melodies. \\"IN MY PLACE\\" is COLDPLAY at their finest moment, and one of the most beaufitul songs ever written lyrically and musically, some may disagree but it's my personal opinion. A RUSH OF BLOOD also has the band at their high point with \\"THE SCIENTIST\\" a personal favorite of mine. I remember watching the video for that song and i was immediately shown a whole different side of rock music. A RUSH OF BLOOD is a must have for any fan of rock music.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|My family saw MU in the movie theaters so i thought it would be good to buy Monsters Inc. so the day my 10 year old son watched it with 5 year old son my 5 year old son hated it it was for them to share but now it's my 10 year old son's Dvd. Mike and Sully ROCK together.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|VIVA LA VIDA... is one of those albums that show coldplay taking a different direction then their previous releases, and a variety of different music elements making the album one of coldplay's most experimental albums yet and the band growing as a band. The album is not their best and not one that you instantly fall in love with from the first listen especially if your a fan of their older sound like i am. Their gloomy sound is surely missed, but overall VIVA LA VIDA is a fun album and listen, it takes time to grow on you as well as to accept COLDPLAY'S new music direction.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing! Relaxing and soothing sounds for every taste! Love the authenticity of the nature sounds it provides
B000SEI230|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks has out done himself. You will not be able to finish this book without tears. Inspirational.
0061906220|5.0|My daughter and I love reading this book together!  It has a great, fun message and reads smoothly and easily.  Would definitely recommend it.
B009AMAGQM|2.0|Okay, I was going to give this movie 1 star, but at the very end literally saved it. So, it's a 2 star movie for me.<br /><br />I liked the main actresses in this movie. She hot and I love those girls that were dark make up, I don't know why, but I'm into that...even though I'm not dark myself. lol<br /><br />For the movie, I thought it's your standard Twilight movie, but not with Vamps or Werewolf's, but with Witches. A very average story with boy meets girl followed by hardships, followed by break up and what you know. You think it's coming but it's not coming. They don't get back together sort of. I can't tell you what happened, but I do like the ending, and like in my other reviews I write, the ending is really going to make to really like this movie or not. So, I liked the ending, but the rest of the movie really got tiring to watch.<br /><br />I only recommend this movie, if you like watching hot girls/guys and like seeing the same old love story with a twist at the end.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|it worked great thed first time I plugged it in to both the computer and the wall unit.  My old was frayed and I didn't  want to start a fire

B000N4SHOE|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I instantly fell in love with it & just had to have it. I am an artist who sometimes has trouble getting inspired & this movie did just that. Every character played in the movie was magical & unforgettable. I had know idea how incredible a person Miss Potter actually was, she is now one of my idols :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Everyone should read this book and be kinder than is necessary!  Especially anyone and everyone involved with students  in middle school.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|As modern scary movies go, this one is particularly creepy and chilling. There isn't an over abundance of special effects, so the imagery is actually scary. The story has a great pace and works up to being more and more scary, instead of diving into something grotesque like so many movies do now. The only draw back I see with this movie is that the story is not so engrossing that I'd want to watch it again. The interest rests more on suspense than any actual character development. It manages to be well acted while delivering a very superficial level of depth to any character, preventing any real emotional investment in what happens to them. I'd buy it again though, and since I don't plan on watching it again, I passed it along to a fellow scary movie fan who I know will get a kick out of it.

B00CS7ZIHI|2.0|nothing new to hear...here.  the content doesn't seem to be evolving or maturing on this album.  better luck next time
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Despite all the notoriety of the interview of the author by a Fox News interviewer, Reza Aslan may be a Muslim but he is openly fascinated with Jesus and his historical times.  He is a religious professor who has the research background to bring to life the times of Palestine under Roman rule and what was common or uncommon with the native peoples.  He does not reflect an anti-Christian bias nor an anti-Jewish bias but a determination to bring to life the times of Jesus and who he may have been or why he was considered a threat.  I'm sure those who believe that the Bible is 100% accurate and totally the word of God will not be happy but history is factual rather than spiritual.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|If you like hidden object games you would like this one.  I GAVE it a 4 star, I would rather not have all the talking in the game.
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|As an ardent fan of the indie artists that have been coming out of Oxford, England since the late 80's/early 90's and into the present (from stalwarts like Ride, Talulah Gosh, Swervedriver, Dustball and Radiohead to current gems like Spring Offensive, Wild Swim and Rhosyn), I had read plenty about Foals before I actually took a listen to their first two albums. Antidotes (their debut) was up first - after playing it through, it became clear to me, straight away, why they were already considered to be legends in the making within Oxford. Their knack for infectious/spastic guitar riffs, bombastic melodies and frenetically charming drum sections more then made them an instant favourite with my ear drums. Then came Total Life Forever, a comparatively dialed down yet funky and soulful follow up (Spanish Sahara is worth the price admission all by itself) that more than lived up to the hype it produced following its release.<br />It was back in autumn of this year that I downloaded Holy Fire, as by then, I had a become a HUGE Foals fan. Upon first listen, I couldn't decide what to make of it. The general sound of this offering was quite unlike the first two (as seems to be a natural transition for any artist that wants to remain fresh and innovative) and it took a bit to for HF to really sink into my musical subconscious. It was around the 5th time I listened to it all the way through, that I began to realize how brilliant this album is. It's rare when you can go through a record, track by track, and you discover that it's seamless in terms of its quality. Standout tracks for me include Bad Habit, Out of the Woods, Providence and Stepson. With Holy Fire, Yannis Phillipakis and Co have not only raised the bar for any budding math/disco rock outfits waiting in the wings, they've provided further evidence that the UK is miles ahead of the US when it comes to music that's actually worth buying.

B00008S2VG|3.0|The best thing about American Life are any remixes, live versions and/or out-takes of the original recordings. This album ends the boring, and danceless 'Ray of Light' cycle. I lean more towards Madonna's mainstream, shallow, pop/dance music. I respect her growth as an artist/human, and I am quite intrigued by her need to venture out, and take risks. However, there are several things gone wrong with this album, and I'm not sure where to start first.<br /><br />Let's begin with the Audio, the actual sound of the music & vocals. I think the songs are too acoustic. It sounds as if they've been stripped down to nothing. It's like the engineers removed every ounce of imperfection [no problem], but it's completely over-done. There's no reverb, or echo, no dynamic to any of the recordings. It sounds like Madonna is literally, coming out of the speakers, like she's on a live microphone. Her voice is so near to the speaker that it's unappealing, and unlistenable [to me]. I do not like this effect at all. This can be experienced on tracks such as 'American Life', 'Love Profusion', and 'Intervention' without question. They're so acoustic that it sounds as if she's singing inside of a coffin. There's no other sound except for her voice, and the guitar. What makes it so much worse is that the music/vocals are overpolished, and tweaked to perfection. Every pindrop of sound has been filtered out, and silenced. I believe this is the sound they were going for. This was also noticeable on Music, but too a lesser degree. The final results are too sharp in sound. It's like photoshopping an image, and the intensity of the filter is too high -- it goes from refined to overwhelmingly, piercing and needing to be toned down.<br /><br />Another situation is the horrible use of autotune. I should make it known that I absolutely adore the use of autotune, especially when it's done right. I think it adds a very modern, or chic sound to contemporary pop music. However, as with anything it can be abused, and misused. In Madonna's case she has no idea how to utilize this element. Take a Listen to 'Nobody Knows Me' -- the crackling/crumbling sounds are insane, and are destructive to the song. Her use of autotune has ultimately butchered this track. I cant even listen to the American Life version because of how awful it sounds. She really needed to ease up on the autotune, or the engineers layered something wrong. A great use of autotune would be 'Die Another Day' amongst several other great songs by other artists. The autoune in 'Die Another Day' was used to smooth and even-out her vocals to robotic pop perfection. She almost sounds like a human-robot opposed to 'Nobody knows me', in which she sounds like a malfunctioning robot who's losing batteries are corroded. This same disaster can be heard on the GHV2 Club Mix of 'Secret' [terrible]. I thought the point of autotune was to iron out the wrinkles, and to create an automated vocal, but they created more wrinkles and imperfections by not going with idea that 'less is more' and 'a little goes a long way'.<br /><br />The problems with American Life are not with the content, or lyrics. It's to do with the the audio effects, and the instrumentals that aren't connecting properly with these songs. Actually, I take that back, I do have an issue with two of the songs lyrics in particular, 'X-Static Process' and 'Mother and Father' she uses HIS name in vain [we cant have that] Especially, on a Madonna album with a Parental Advisory sticker [I think not]. I also do not have an issue with use of acoustic-guitars in place of what we would normally expect from her, but the songs are already not very melodic -- as a result, there's no real backdrop to the songs. It's just a boring and bland production.<br /><br />...But, there's still hope for American Life. Listening to 'Love Profusion', 'Die Another Day', 'Intervention', and 'X-static Process' as remixes, or Live versions [the reinvention tour] has shown a great amountof justice for these tracks. I've found some really upbeat house, electronic, electro, and live remixes that put an entirely new spin on the tracks. DJ's are like doctors in the music business, they have the ability to bring a song back from the dead. 'Nobody Knows Me' live edit on 'Im Going To Tell You A Secret' is incredible. The album version fails, miserably.<br /><br />The only songs I can appreciate their original state would be 'Die Another Day', 'Intervention' and 'Mother & Father'. 'Intervention' is tainted with the extra-near vocal arrangement, but it's not as intense as 'Love Profusion'. However, the dance mixes of these songs are a lot better in my personal opinion. The 'Easy Ride' dance mix is also enjoyable. I know I'm shifting all over the place, but personally 'Die another day' is one of the best Madonna songs in her catalogue [notice, I said ONE of the best], the  orchestra/symphony in the music is untouchable! a revisit to 'Papa Don't Preach' [classic].<br /><br />I don't feel that American Life is a bad album, but I stand firm when I say these lyrics/vocals are not complemented by the sound of this music. There's poor taste in music in any genre. Natalie Imbruglia, and Liz Phair's music is acoustic and guitar ridden, but the results are spectacular. It's not that I believe Madonna does not have the ability to sing over guitars. But, I feel that these acoustic styled songs in particular aren't great. Or, perhaps I should I say 'these songs are not good as acoustics, but rather dance songs'. I still could be wrong about that though. I never knew that a few changes in tempo could give a song so much life the way it's been done for the ones on this album. I also didn't realize the effect that the actual music has on the message of a song. If the music and audio aren't great there's nothing there...<br /><br />As for the album in it's initial state, it sucks. The exception to that idea would be 'Mother & Father', 'Die another day' and 'Intervention' [my opinion]. The rest of the album sounds much better remixed because the vocals are remastered and layered to some official dance beats. I gave the album 3 stars because it grew on me through listening to the remixes so, I know all the words -- I can sing a long when I hear the originals playing which is very rare. I dont even need a normal copy of this record. Not her best album at all musically, or Lyrically. Vocally, it is ok. I'm not too fond of the Ray of Light-American Life vocals which she abandoned with Confessions on a dancefloor (thank goodness)<br /><br />...and for all the Madonna wannabe's and sheep, do not waste your time leaving catty and 'queen-like' comments beneath my review. This is MY review, Amazon gives a choice of 1 to 5 stars for every product on yhe site. Not just American Life or any other Madonna record. Its called a review for a reason.

B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Great game that keeps you entertained for hours and hours! There is one BIG issue that has yet to be fixed and I have tried everything... it will not let me link my game with Facebook to update all my progress which makes the game useless to me. Please fix this as soon as possible so I can enjoy the mobile version on Kindle fire HD and rate the five stars it has truly earned on PC.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|All through the first half of this movie I thought I had it figured out, several times and several ways. Then things kept getting further away from how I thought it was going to climax and end. This was an anniversary present for my wife, she thinks it's fantastic, and I agree.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love this series and voraciously watched all 3 seasons on Prime Instant Video this summer. Don't want to ruin it for newcomers to the season, but what a horrible season finale! This is truly a copy of American soap operas- the happy, married couples are not permitted to stay that way for long. Aaargh!

B008RJ6TTC|4.0|One of my favorite programs is the 1970's Columbo. Virtually every episode is memorable. When ABC aired a 1990's version the results weren't nearly as good in my opinion. Still they are worth watching once. The 1970's episodes, I've probably watched dozens of times by now.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Great film,<br />Made me laugh every set of the way.<br />This is when comedy started to go down ward but this film made it
0385344228|5.0|I don't like giving too many details when I review books as I don't want to give anything away. All I will say is that this was a page turner. I usually don't finish a book in three days, but I did this one. Very well written with compelling characters and a terrific story. There were a couple of tiny plot holes, but nothing that would keep me from wholeheartedly recommending it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This nothing like anything I've ever played, most of the time I don't have the patients for puzzles but this is a puzzle and in some ways its not, its also kinda scary but awesome scary omg.

B000025THW|5.0|This is a tremendous album, surpassing what Prefab Sprout did before and certainly after. The only album that is close is Steve McQueen, which I also highly recommend. Take a listen to the samples and if you like what you hear, pick this up. If you enjoy lush 1980's pop, you can't go wrong with this title.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I really liked this graphic novel because it wasn't based on just shooting zombies it was about humans working or against each other, it was very emotionally heavy.
B000MCIBAW|5.0|It seems like most people believe that either the first Doors album or LA Woman is their best. While both of those are great, I have to go with Strange Days as my favorite. I think it's more consistent and while it doesn't have any song as great as Light My Fire or LA Woman, it doesn't have any filler like Alabama Song or Been Down So Long either.<br /><br />Again, all three are terrific, I just believe Strange Days is a little more consistent from beginning to end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|They fixed the download issue and now it works great again. I love this adorable little game.I just wish it didn't cost tokens to start from different locations or for all the costumes, or at least made them easier to earn.
B0000017CA|5.0|One of the most profound, albeit extremely dark records ever recorded.  Every collection should include When The Kite String Pops.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|The book is good it teaches  a lot  to  KIDS  that really a good  good books during THE I  lilmama
B002UM5BXW|1.0|Only one chapter in the second part of book was perhaps worth reading. This is a poorly written book that was dragged out by constant repeating to fill a bunch of pages and or satisfy the needs of the publisher. The book is vulgar, offensive, and babbles on and on with despicable people and stories that serve no other purpose than to inflate the ego of this writer.  Shame on him. He should apologize for this.  Not even good porno well written. Really bad!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is uper addicting and exciting i love the way it shows eaxh emoji differently from the other games out there
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Julianne Margulies and Tim Noth are great!  I especially enjoyef the way they accurately depict the idiosyncracies that judges can possess.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Where do I start? I really loved this book. I had high hopes going in, and at a price like $3.99, I can't complain about my purchase at all.<br /><br />Hazel Grace Lancaster was such a refreshing change in YA lit. Many heroines I come across are unrealistic or annoying, but Hazel was easy to connect to and root for. Her character wasn't dumbed down for readers, she was funny, and I loved the conversational tone her narration had.<br /><br />Augustus Waters.... oh, Gus. He is one of my favorite male leads ever. He's not your average good looking lead. He's intelligent, funny, charming, and an all around good guy. Like Hazel says, he's no Prince Charming, although sometimes he likes to try, but his best moments are when he's just being his human self.<br /><br />I loved Hazel's mom, and how dedicated she was to making her daughter's time left on earth as good as possible. She celebrates every single holiday on the planet so Hazel won't miss out, and for once, parents play an important POSITIVE role in teen lit. No disappearing parent syndrome here.<br /><br />The plot was good and kept my interest, although it was occasionally a bit slow. I had a hard time finishing it because the ending emotionally affected me (I take my reading very seriously) but it was a beautiful story.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book. If I could give this more than 5 stars for making me bawl like a bitch-baby just THINKING about the book after reading it, I would. Will definitely be reading again!
157912626X|5.0|This review in on the hardback edition pictured here. (Black Dog & Leventral Publishers)  It is a library find.  I love the new editions by this publisher and am grateful that our library can afford them as I cannot.<br /><br />Anyway....<br /><br />Reading `The Body in the Library' again after the passing of many years was a good reminder as to why I am such an Agatha Christie fan and why I have read and reread her books over the years.  First let me give a very brief description as to the plot...there are other very fine reviews here that go into that aspect quite well.<br /><br />The body of a young and pretty girl is found in the library, on a hearth rug in the home of Colonel and Mrs. Bantry...two thoroughly respectable British subjects and leading citizens of their well ordered little world in a small village.  Now one know who the girl is, where she came from, why she was killed (Strangled) and most importantly - what on earth she is doing in the Colonel's library!  And thus we have our mystery.  As chance would have it, this murder happens in the village inhabited by the inquisitive and extraordinarily observant Miss Jane Marple, an armature sleuth of the first order.<br /><br />As the police search widens and more and more suspects are introduced to the story, a second body is discovered nearby in a burned out car.  This body, it turns out, is one that belonged to a local village girl.  They mystery deepens.<br /><br />Now there are those that claim that detection mysteries written by Agatha Christie are \\"formula\\" books; they follow a strict formula.  I strongly differ from that opinion and suspect that those that make that claim simply have not read many of Christie novels.  Mrs. Christie uses as many different methods of presenting her story as there are books she has written.  Yes, there is a murder in each and of course an investigation but that is about all the \\"formula\\" there is.  Christie set the standards for mystery writing; standards which are still with us to this very day.<br /><br />While I am a bigger fan of Hercule Poirot I am never the less fascinated with Miss Jane and her little world in which she functions so well.  I love the wit and understated humor that Christie inserts into all of her writing but more so in the Marple books than those feature the little guy with all the gray cells.<br /><br />There are plenty of very credible red herrings in this work and it leaves the reader guessing right up to the end where Jane Marple, using her vast knowledge of human nature, solves this almost unsolvable set of murders.<br /><br />This is a quick and relaxing read and very entertaining.  To slip into Christie's world for a few hours is a delightful little trip for the mind.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksll with us to this very day.<br /><br />While I am a bigger fan of Hercule Poirot I am never the less fascinated with Miss Jane and her little world in which she functions so well.

B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Giant robots fighting Lovecraftian monsters. That is all. GIANT ROBOTS FIGHTING LOVECRAFTIAN MONSTERS.<br /><br />That sentence tells you pretty much everything you need to know about \\"Pacific Rim,\\" which is Guillermo del Toro's loving valentine to Japanese monster movies and mecha anime. It isn't a deep movie, but it doesn't pretend to be -- it just wants to entertain you with giant robots beating up grotesque sea monsters, and it succeeds at that.<br /><br />When an interdimensional rift allows monstrous kaiju to attack Australia, the US, Japan, China and Russia (for some reason, no Mexico and/or Chile), those countries band together to create Jaegers -- giant mecha suits to destroy the kaiju, with mind-linked pilots inside. Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) was one of the pilots, until his brother was killed and the American Jaeger \\"Gipsy Danger\\" was wrecked by a new, stronger kind of kaiju.<br /><br />When the governments stupidly abandon the program (they're building a WALL!), Commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) takes the program rogue -- refurbishing old Jaegers and recruiting old pilots. He convinces a reluctant Raleigh to co-pilot the newly-repaired Gipsy Danger, but both Raleigh and his Japanese copilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) struggle with their traumatic memories.<br /><br />In the meantime, Pentecost is planning to somehow drop a nuke into the fissure and close it for good. As the dwindling Jaeger forces are battered by new and stronger kaiju, wacky scientist Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) discovers the horrifying truth behind the kaiju invasion -- and what will happen to the human race if they aren't stopped for good.<br /><br />\\"Pacific Rim\\" does have a decent sci-fi plot about alien monsters attacking the world, but let's not pretend that is the movie's core. The real draw here is watching giant robots punching glowy sea monsters in the face, and then clubbing them with a convenient steel ship. Why? Because Guillermo del Toro is a nerd and loving it.<br /><br />It also tends to be a bit over-the-top cheesy (\\"Today we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!\\"), but del Toro does insert some quieter moments where the characters reflect on the horrors that have propelled them there. And the plot -- yes, there is one -- manages to be both simple and twisty, with a string of unexpected revelations about the kaiju and where they came from.<br /><br />Admittedly the movie does fall short in some places -- the Russians have about two lines, and I don't think the Chinese triplets had ANY. Also, the comic relief scientists can be a bit grating, especially since they are American and British stereotypes.<br /><br />However, the other characters aren't -- they're depicted as strong but damaged people, and there are moments where we see them reflecting on how they came there. Elba is powerful and restrained as the noble commander, Hunnam is a solid rugged hero you can root for, and Kikuchi is a lean, quietly intense presence as a young woman whose life was forever changed by the kaiju. And yes, we have Ron Perlman as the weirdest Chinese gangster you will ever see.<br /><br />If the idea of robots bashing monsters fills your geek heart with glee, \\"Pacific Rim\\" is the perfect movie -- its only goal is to entertain you and blow kisses at Japanese entertainment. Definitely worth a watch.it.<br /><br />It also tends to be a bit over-the-top cheesy (\\"Today we are CANCELING THE APOCALYPSE!\\"), but del Toro does insert some quieter moments where the characters reflect on the horrors that have propelled them there.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a masterpiece - a bit haunting because of the brutal aspects of life in North Korea but so tenderly written.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was highly anticipating the new season after having watched the first two this winter. It did not disappoint me. I love the characters and the beautiful way that the era is brought to life.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Cast is great... episodes keep you coming back for more.  I am waiting for the next season to be available.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A little to detailed dragging out the story. Classic ending. It will be interesting to see how it is handled in the movie.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Fun and suspenseful movie. It's always a fun turnabout when the desk jockey analyst gets to be the action guy... If you like this, you might like the short-lived (incomplete single season...) series \\"Rubicon\\".
B00AREIAI8|4.0|yea son soooooo fun fun in the sun no doubt broski keep it up Mann too much fun cant containit
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Though a lot of people bash this movie, I just don't get it.<br /><br />It's not trying to be intellectual or overly deep, but ... it's fun, uplifting, and a great mix of stories. And occasionally moving.  Worth a watch for sure, and can be a nice story to revisit.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I don't usually get into drama shows for the simple fact that I become addicted and can't stand waiting a week to see the next episode. I totally dig Suits though.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I needed something to watch while waiting for Downton Abby to come back on.  This series is wonderful.  Lots of \\"characters\\"  that you come to love.  Even some familiar actors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is cool I don't know what else to say so yeah unless you are weird you will like this game
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is no where as good as minecraft for Pc and i don't even play this anymore that much now that i have PC and i was expecting to be able to connect this to PC but now that I know both of them i get that it can't be connected for big reasons. but or those people who are looking for a way to play minecraft on your kindle then this is 100% right for you.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I already own the paperback copy, but I wanted the Kindle version as well! Amazing and I'm glad I did!
030789701X|5.0|It's a really, really awesome book. It packed with all kinds of stuff that made me learn what to do in the game. I call it the elder scrolls bible. Thank you
1400069289|2.0|Wasn't practical enough.  Not much I haven't read elsewhere.  Overall a disappointing read.  A book to maybe skim and then passalong but not to live by.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is the first Nevosoft game I've played...it was pretty fun...but I was able to finish it in one day. There are a few bugs...but they consisted of the characters losing their voices occasionally...but, other than that, the game played well. All in all, not a bad game...esp since I got it for free :)
1781162646|4.0|This was a great beach read.  Fun, at times poignant - a mystery, but not a real &#34;dark&#34; crazy story like King can be prone to.  King delivered the summer paperpack he set out to deliver.  I would definitely recommend picking it up.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|An earlier version of this script may have been a bit hard-hitting and illuminating as to the US involvement in the dirty wars of South America.  But, it appears, that has all been focus-grouped out of the proceedings.<br />Bland.  Unfunny.  Almost embarrassing for all involved in the project.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|The Stargate series are always a fun sci-fi watch! Each show brings something new while the overall story unfolds as well.
B000L53D4O|4.0|The item arrived in very good condition and my granddaughter enjoys playing with it even though she hasn't figured out how to walk with it.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|I simply loved this movie.  It was so much fun, especially the 2nd time I watched it. I wonder why critics were so harsh on it, but then I remember many wanting Mr. Reeve and Mr. Donner's version of Superman in this movie.  I though was in awe and just floored.  Everyone in their respective roles were fantastic, with shout outs to Costner, Crowe, Adams, and the definitive 21st century Superman-Henry Cavill. See this with an open mind and a willingness to talk about the movie.  6 out of 5 stars
B004EKCNMA|5.0|This was a great purchase... I would definitely recommend purchasing this one. Jim Carrey really is great at character roles
B008OURHPY|5.0|This woman is a gem. She is so talnted and poetic with her craft.<br /><br />There's passion in her music… and that's lost in some of today's music.<br /><br />Support great music!! Gotta love, Lianne!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this. Lots of action from beginning to end. It was fun to see the comic characters I had read about as a kid.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Kimbra is a beast!! Her music has musical climax and it definitely stand out from the music today!!<br /><br />Whether you listen to her live or not… her music satisfies that hunger for REAL music!!<br /><br />I absolutely enjoy her music. Definitely worth the purchase!!
B00371XIJE|5.0|Grand daughter is 6 years old and wanted to watch this movie over and over. It's a good family movie.
B007704HO6|5.0|An easy to read book, written in to the point language, but with enough heart and soul to make you never want it to end. I'm not a big reader, but I loved it, and couldn't put it down. An honest and heartwarming read. Thank you James and Bob.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Better at continuous play than most app games.  You don't need to harass your friends or waste real money on fake money to play all of the content.  Those things help, sure, but aren't required line most annoying games. Overall the game play is balanced and fun. Other players can affect your city but can't ruin it like in other similar games.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Great author! She explains her journey on the trail so vividly as well as comparing it to her journey through life! I enjoyed reading it & couldn't wait to see how she ended up.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to Harry - now I just want/need Jo Nesbo to write some more books!
B009DCOU9S|1.0|There are positive and negative about this game but the fact that one has to be logged in to the Amazon app store in order to play the game is a deal breaker.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This is a thought provoking movie!!  We loved it and will watch it again soon because there is so much depth to this movie.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I really enjoyed the focus on a youth solving the problems with an outcast underdog mentor. Great lessons in this tale.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really would give it 4 1/2.  It was a page turner in spots.  I would recommend it to friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is like watching history unfold in front of you. Done in a captivating way.<br />I did not like what happened at the end of the season after Matthews baby was born.<br />One of the big reasons I like watching the series is gone.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was just okay.  Interesting to read, but near as good as his first book, &#34;the Kite Runner&#34;.  I am not sorry I read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My children decided to invest some of their savings on this game, and it has been totally worthy. The game consists basically of adding and destroying blocks to create your own world. Players set their own goals and adventures. Some modes are more challenging than other, so it is great for any age.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|It wouldn't stream fast enough. I spent about 10 minutes to see1-2 minutes of movie then gave up the third time I had to wait for it to buffer.
B002BJGYUS|3.0|The case was in pretty good condition, however, two of the discs had problems with skipping. One of the disks wouldn't play in my computer (I am hoping it will work in the DVD player). I would recommend just buying the season new (I can now find it for the same price) or spending the extra couple dollars. It's worth it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|After refusing to watch for so long, I finally caved. What have I gotten myself into? I really enjoy David Tennent, but I'm the kind of person that stays true to the original character that hooked me. I miss Eccleston.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|good game and fun but needs updated really bad. would be more fun if it were updated like the version you download on phone.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Let's say most of material was cover in the fourth novel. T.he subjects didn't nee d to be repeated. Too many of good guys have died.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two continues on as the first. Intriguing. I couldn't stop reading and moved on to the third very quickly.
B000ITF86E|5.0|My favorite John Wayne movie. Hilarious! I love the mud pit scene, can't stop laughing! &#34;I have a touch of hangover bureaucrat don't push me&#34;
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I appreciate all the hard work/effort that the author put in to make this such a successful read. I recommend<br />This one.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Yum, Chris Evens is a great Cpt. He has his shirt off and really that's all that matters ! Oh and the movie is good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I only played this for a short time but it keeps you wanting to play it more to see if you can get out of the rooms.I would recommend this game.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Just finished watching and thought this was one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  Well Done, not over the top, and much adrenaline pumping then most of the big explosion blockbusters out there.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this tool to keep my machine clean. It shuts down games that you forget to shut down and also cleans everything up. I think that this is a very much must have to keep everything clean.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is by far my kids favorite app. They love the power ups especially the fluffy unicorn...that one is my fave too. Do yourself a favor and download this app.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I was much younger when the original series aired and I am enjoying watching all three seasons of Star Trek again. Gene Roddenberry was a man way ahead of his time and he developed a series that never outgrows any viewers.
B004NS710C|5.0|Great story. It was watched with a retired railroader and it kept him entertained as well.  Loved how the story told of real life family relationships that are strengthened through difficult life trials.
B005HSL626|4.0|My daughter is 4 and son is 7 and I am....well, we won't go there, but thing is this game is fun for any age.  It is a great time passer.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|A relaxing and educational app.  I would recommend this for adults and children. Love the screen shots too.  A great way to pass time.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Schwarzenegger does have his classic moments and there is the &#34;superhuman&#34; bit near the end in typical Schwarzenegger fashion but the supporting cast and action scenes are up to date and innovative.
B005IQZB14|5.0|From the first page I was totally engrossed with Cheryl's story. I loved the book and have been recommending it to my friends.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I wish it hadn't taken so long for the first Harry Hole Novel to become available in the US...great read & background gave me even more reason to want to read every Joe Nesbo book written, almost there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|When you have time to waste,it's a fun game. Lots of options and goals to complete. Also doesn't take forever to get necessary items
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love this book and I'm only 11!! I had to read it for school and I'm gladiator did! It's great!
B00536OCYG|5.0|It is one of the best story albums ever.  Sadly,  my copy arrived badly warped.  Returns on Amazon are no problem, so I got my money back. I look forward to ordering again in the dead of winter.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome and I cant stop playing but I takes a while to load and it costs a lot of gems
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Basically the second half of my second season discs skip and its so annoying! i haven't gotten past the 3rd season yet but I don't doubt that i'll find that more discs skip. I'm pretty unhappy and wish I didn't make the purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game takes a lot of thinking  & I like that. I would recommend it to all of my friends!
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|My grandson is way into games, and he asked me to get this one for him as a present for something he did for me.  He loves it, and told me so.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Help on the levels I need are not available. This is totally useless! I am in the low 100's and the help doesn't start until level 400 up.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Makes retrieving your Gmail on your Kindle easy, quick, and productive. One touch and you are there! No problems with loading and working with emails so far.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|As the title goes: 2 months = 8 visits to the pool = US$ 140 wasted.<br /><br />Do not buy and believe the bad reviews. It's does what says while it lasts, which is an unacceptable short period since its not cheap. I don't know why this company is still on the market: not worthy of the Reddot award or anything else.<br /><br />The experience: The 1st charge lasted the 2 months, now since it won't turn on I recharged it and tried to upload more music. Then it appeared a big battery icon and a message: \\"Usb not recognized\\". And the battery, even after being plugged for 4 hours, lasted, shut down, for only 5 minutes. Now it doesn't even appear the big battery icon, the message that it is not recognized and above all: NOW IT WON'T TURN ON. So there goes 140 dollars to the trash.<br /><br />Also don't waste your time at the web page since if you click here: [...]<br /><br />you will get the<br /><br />\\"OOPS..

Please visit our home page instead.<br /><br />Sorry for the inconvenience\\"<br /><br />and since I live un Perú, right now there's nothing I can do, only to advice that you shouldn't buy this item.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you'll love this game! Gives you plenty of options to choose from in play format and requires you to think!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Bought this cd when it first came out. I don't think a day goes by when I don't still listen to at least one track on this cd. I enjoy every song; I don't even have to skip over some tracks as you frequently do with other artists. There is a nice variety of fast and slow paced music, but Adam Lambert's voice just shines through on every track. It's not possible to wear the cd out, is it?
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a fairly good clock app. The ability to set multiple alarms is convenient and the weather being at your fingertips is great! Just wish it had more alarm sounds to choose from.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Really enjoy the race the clock feature for gold stars. I love to play mahjong and this is a very good came.  I have my grandkids all hooked....they are very smart and started playing at a very young age.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|Let me start by saying this is a pretty cool lego set! My only problem with this set is the lego figures do not fit inside the DeLorean unless you remove there hair. Other then that it seams to be a pretty good set.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|this movie was everuthing I hoped it would be and more. I didn't get to see it in the theater but was I purchased it myself because I can watch again whenever I want.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game looked easy,piece of cake?  It is so much fun and very challenging. Definitely use two thumbs  and catch lots of air for more points.  Engine  upgrades are very important as well. Have fun!!!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Great read I love Harry Bosch. This novel kept me guessing till the end. I look forward to the next one. M. Connelly  novel.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Typically quirky Tarantino product: at the same time, silly and ingenious.  Brad Pitt is ridiculous, perhaps because his character was written that way.  Christoph Waltz is, as he always is...fabulous.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though this can is a step down from the computer game it has all of the needed features great game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun!!!! It reminds me of Jurassic park for some reason I really do not know why. But get it now.<br />- unicorn Beatle girl who is awesome
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Not all free reads are good ones but I can recommend.  An abrupt ending which I didn't like as I wanted the story to continue - at least a bit into Connor's and Megan's future.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a racing game until minion rush! Awesome to  My kindle when I get bored!! Thanks for uploading this game!!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is addictive. Once you start you can't stop. It is fun to try and beat your friends scores.
B00C8YOIR2|4.0|I received a copy of this book in return for an honest review LoP. I thought that Mr. John used an interesting concept when writing this book - a dead medium. Very original and creative. There were parts of the book where I was wondering where it was going, but then it all came together. All in all a good read, but it could use an editor to make it a bit smoother and to make some corrections. The main character, May, was a very straight-forward person, honest and hardworking when she died, and that didn't stop after she died.  I liked that May ended up having more people who were her friends after she dies. They all work together for a common goal and it gets more interesting from there.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|(Mild spoiler alert). Typically by the third 'book' in a series like this, some things are overdone while other parts of the plot or cast that I resonate with have started to wither. This does not happen in the third installment of the &#34;Mistborn&#34; saga. And I'm enjoying it, although the constant, massive amounts of explanatory backstory can get a bit timeous. I get that they are required for us to fully-grok the rules of. Whatever &#34;balance&#34; can ever be achieved between Ruin and Preservation before it all comes to a head. But still, sometimes less is more.  On the other hand there's the editors from Accounting telling you the minimum number of pages per chapter, per book, so I also feel for the writer. But still...
0399255370|5.0|I read a lot of book with my kiddos and I like a lot of them, but I must say this is one of the cutest books ever!  I laughed the whole time.  BTW, it's a gift for my boys so I haven't read it to them yet - I don't think I can wait to give them this one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was broken-hearted by Season 3's finale and now can't wait for Season 4 to see how everyone copes with the tragedy.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I am old and all of the foul language is not a normal part of conversation to me.  I bought it to see what all the talk about Channing Tatum was about.  Perhaps I will learn in a different movie, certainly not this one.
B00821OX98|3.0|I'm still watching this series and am having trouble getting through it.  I don't get the crustaceans.  What's the deal.  Why aren't they trying to figure this out with a little more vigor.  I'll fiddle around with it  a little more but with the world and humanity at stake you'd think there would be a little more cooperation between factions..unlike the current congress.
B008476HBM|2.0|I did not read this book in school, so I decided to give it a try.  It was written in 1813.  I am so glad I read it on my Kindle because you can see the meaning of words when you don't know them.  There were a lot of words I was not familiar with.  Ms. Austen writes in the manner they did in those days and it is very hard to follow.  I had to reread pages to get the meaning.  Also, we are so removed from the society as it was then, I could not get excited or interested in the story of classes of people who have so many rules and are so intent on getting their female children married off to the proper husband.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|This was just so unique and fun and revealing every cine nut ought to have it in his/her library.  It's so metaphorical in a technical cinemagraphic way.  Well, not to over analyze..it's sure worth watching.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Easy read.  Interesting and timely subject - NSA.  Combo tech and spy thriller.  LIke the way characters are developed in two separate story lines.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|An amazing look into the meaning of \\"the old boys\\" network.<br />\\"New\\" when not understood is not worth thinking about!  Duh!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's really fun I love this game it is a lot harder then temple run. I have only hare this app fore only 1 day now
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My favorite line was ITS SO FLUFFY, it was cute movie, and i am in love with the mions, steve carell does a great job!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So realistic. I would play this all day if I could. Love it. Make more free games like this please.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|Great purchase! Love Queen! Would buy again. Its 2 cds when you purchase the entire album so I hope you enjoy
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Finished season two and I am hooked. Beef watching on amazon prime and now I can't wait for season three!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a fun simple game! always enjoys the minions anyway. you will be entertained and its free. get it and you will haveva blast.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|What a waste of time and money. I didn't find a single moment that made me laugh. It is dull and stupid. Don't believe the stupid marketing nonsense like I did. Please find something that is much better to spend your time and money on. I have been duped too many times now by what the marketing machine says, only to be very disappointed. Please, don't be fooled like I was.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|If you like SCIFI action, this is it! I don't understand the poor reviews but really enjoyed it and hope for sequels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The casting was superb as well as the acting. Ten out of five stars re: the dialogue........look forward to Season 4
0312427646|5.0|Every anglophile should read this book.  It is delightful, witty, and insightful all at the same time.  If you enjoy irony without sarcasm, this is the book for you.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|It doesn't have the same charm as SG-1, but it is a great addition to the series as a whole. I strongly recommend it.
B004X4RU9I|5.0|one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Its not an entirely accurate account of history but the movie is better than good. For me if your a martial arts movie fan this is a must see.<br /><br />if you though crouching tiger hidden dragon was good see this!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you love period pieces, Downton Abbey is a no brainer.  With an incredible cast, well written characters and beautiful setting it is really a masterpiece in miniseries.  Maggie Smith is hilarious as the smart, outspoken Violet.  I loved hating O'Brien and Thomas, even my daughter is hooked.  It is worth seeing!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|If you are looking for a great read this book is one! I recommend it for all ages :D ...
B004UPALT6|3.0|For a remake of the classic it was an ok movie. Good enough to watch once around Halloween but not more often.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I had a wonderful time playing this game. I would have gladly paid 2.99 for this game. I was happy that it lasted so long and it was challenging but not too hard. Amazon please make more games like this be the app of the day. Will definitely look for more games by this maker
B008JFUO36|4.0|Highly recommended! I paid 14.99 to watch it in my home projector screen and was very happy with that decision. Besides, Tom Cruise looks his best in a pilot seat, which you get a lot in this movie!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Grim, gritty and finishes on just the right note. A deeply satisfying film with absolutely incredible animated fighting sequences. Definitely one of the better Batman animated movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting game for all ages! Easy to understand once started. I recommend to anyone wanting to have a little fun.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I am not into science or science fiction at all, but I love this show.  It is a fresh approach to the sitcom genre.  It is well written and well acted.  Cheers!
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I ecpected more and better 3D effects. More like n the theater, but it was OK. Will watch this movie over and over.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Not a boring momentum reading this nook!I wish that the two other \\"clubs\\"--the senate and the house would be as helpful to each other as the ex-presidents are to the office of any given sitting president. Our country would be truly great!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I could not put this book down. It was riveting would make a great made for TV movie. The ending.... I would have never guessed. Read it you won't be disappointed.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Made me jump several times and hair on end through half movie. Good scary movie. Not too gory, sexy or vile.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Update:  If you are a Kindle, Android player you might want to skip this game.  Have not had an update since spring.  No gifts, no bonuses, no support.  Friends are the only reason to keep playing now.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|To those wo have had the chance to listen to J. Cole's first album, Cole World, they would agree the rapper has not lost any of his ability to produce a solid album.<br /><br />Productions are soulful varying from jazzy to a more piano keys sounding. The novelty of Born Sinner when it comes to production is the use of some chorus that add an epic touch to it.<br /><br />Again I am firm believer a consistent album requires very few featurings and this album follows the same pattern. However asking 50 Cent to join Cole on a New-York anthem song can be seen as a gamble based on Cole's close relationship with Jay-Z... but New-York Times might be one of the best song thanks to Fifty's solid hook.<br /><br />From start to finish this album paves the way for a modern hip-hop that differentiates itself from other cats out there like Drake & co. J Cole sweats Hip-Hop. You can tell as he sampled Da Art Of Storytellin' by Outkast.<br /><br />I would like as well to salute his work on \\"Let Nas Down\\". This is an example of how you can transform what could have become a stupid beef into a positive, creative experience. He used Nas' criticizm on \\"Work Out\\" and turned it onto a jazzy song with thoughtful rap lines... that I am sure Nas would love to listen.<br /><br />Keep it up boy. You hold the torch high!
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is awesome u should get it if I'm good at it everyones good at it and its a really fun game
B0087GYY92|3.0|Remember how Galaxy Quest nailed everything that is ridiculous about Star Trek?<br />Red Shirts has very similar goals but is just a little bit more in-bred and therefore inaccessible, never more than when the book takes the silly Deus Ex Machinas that power so many Trek plots and puts them to work in service of its own.<br />The result is probably more fun for Trek devotees than Scalzi fans.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this game although it gets kind of boring if u play it 24 7 its fun when u first start it though!
B0041CGP02|5.0|Love Bon Jovi's music.  Been a fan of theirs for years and years.  I would definitely recommend buying it to someone.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|It is a great game that requires some skill and patience but if you are into strategy games with planes this is the game for your skill level. As your skill level improve<br />.you move up from the year 1954.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really cool because you get to put lava in places and build awesome things! You can also put wells and moats around your house.
0061537969|5.0|Never thought I could love dogs anymore than I already do, but then I read, The Art of Racing in the Rain/  You'll see!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ozzy, geezer, and tony what more could you ask for. The sabbath vein has been opened and bleeds unstoppable.  Great
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book depicts a sad but engrossing tale of the pitfalls of life and how love conquers all. Truly  a wonderful story!
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Its a typical aic album, rocks you to the bone and spits out your remains. Another classic soul shaker. Awesome!
B006LXQID8|5.0|Great movie, fun to watch, would recommend to anyone looking for a fun movie night.  If you don't like subtitles, it's ok.  You forget they are even there.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game I think you<br />Gtfthgjnvftjng Getty your Pandora and meet with heating system is supported the future is supported in the magic of puzzles to make york Times article on delta air force base and meet the
B007IK44CK|5.0|Could be best MI yet.  Great action, great story, great characters, great direction, great action, and oh yea, great story.
B00AYB16EO|3.0|Its a ok kind of movie. I wouldnt pay yo go sre it. But og a friend has it jusy borrow it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app for my Kindle fire. I've been using the website for so long but when I finally switched over to the app it works fantastic! So much easier to use! Wish it hadn't taken me so long to make the switch!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love the acting, and the character development. And it shows conflict between the people in the groups and the reaction to aliens.<br /><br />I would recommend it to any aliens/apocalypse or just action fans. It's really well made.<br /><br />It's kinda like The Walking Dead, just with aliens not quit that awesome like TWD, but it's good, and full stars from m, because it's getting better:)
B003TTCURU|5.0|I love it!!! I am so hooked on this show! I can not wait til season 10 airs! So excited!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This thing was such a great help for the videos I made while on a cruise to Alaska with my extended family.<br />Did a lot of shooting while following my subjects and it was great, also very handy for keeping the camera safe with a convenient stand for setting the camera down. It's light and sturdy and the camera mount is adjustable for and aft so the center of gravity can be adjusted depending on the camera used.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down once I started. I played it for probably 8+ hours yesterday &amp; I had only reached around 70% of the way through. So the play time value is off the chart!<br /><br />I am not a big app buyer, due to finances, but when I do buy an app it is a &quot;gotta have it&quot;. Even though this was an Amazon App of the Day freebie yesterday, I can say without a doubt, I would have gladly paid for this one!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Nice to have a game that actually makes u think. I loved it so much want a sequel.very exciting and fascinating love the animations well
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Unexpectedly entertaining.  Truly a fantastical story.  Makes me want to write about my own craY life!  Thanks for an imaginative read.
1741794609|5.0|It was our first time to India and it provided the insight and direction we needed to give us the confidence to travel in this enchanting country. One more destination off the Bucket List.
B001EBWING|5.0|I had never seen Casablanca and I had to watch it for an apologetics class. I loved it. Although over dramatic it still was very well done and I can see how it is classic. It does not matter what age you are this film will be a hit with everyone even though it is a 'vintage' film.
0375869026|5.0|This book should be on every child's reading list for school. It has a great message and can help children understand and have compassion for others. I have 5 grand children and will make sure all of them read this good book.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Just listen to the samples and if you don't love it, it is because you just aren't into this kind of music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Trying to read all three in the series. Reasonably priced for my kindle reader. Will be ordering more. will rate the final story after the third book.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|another masterpiece from one of today's best bands. Many people don't like this band but I for one love them!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Early to bed and early to rise, then to my surprise, I stumbled on this great  movie this morning.  I loved, \\"The History of the Eagles\\", they were so creative.  It is so eye opening to see them  maturing under the eyes of history.  It made me realize the difficulty when creative people want to share their excitement over their own creation and how disappointment leads to break up...  It is so hard to stay quiet, and learn to co exist, but these guys have grown up!  Wow, it is nice to hear them back together, their integration of talent has given us some fantastic music...Love the Eagles, wish them well and hope you will take a peek, then buy the movie for your collection.  It's worth it as a gift for a friend who loves the Eagles...now you can't say I never know what to get for my friend at Christmas time.!
B00BKTFABE|2.0|This thing was starting to work. At first I loved it. But now it keeps saying, &quot;Cannot connect to camera. At first it was great and now it's junk.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Does everything as advertised in product description.<br /><br />Very informative, and excellent at showing the levels for usage.<br /><br />Product is a keeper. Well done.
0345529057|5.0|Started series years ago and now my son has taken it up.  Great investment to just get your own boxed set since significant time is needed to read the series.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Great for the family. This is one movie that must be in your collection and the kids will absolutely enjoy.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|In depth story this is not. Not so fun a movie for adults. Kids said ok.  Would not buy but rent.
B00E193TM2|5.0|As is typical for a FFDP album, the guitar sounds are so thick and meaty that you almost feel them as much as hear them, the bass and drums are thumping and loud, and the vocals are angry, aggressive, and raw. Which is awesome if you are a fan. The riffing is super-tight as always and keep things pretty interesting throughout. I didn't expect to like the rock-rap version of the \\"Mama\\" LL Cool J cover but surprisingly I did. It really was a ballsy move for them to do it considering the amount of hate they surely would have expected to get from metal purists and fans who don't like deviations from the formula (or just people who despise hip-hop!) but it works for me. FFDP has always straddled the line between metal, hardcore, and rock and this release is no different, but who really cares what you call it anyway? You either like what you hear or you don't. Me, I like it. A lot. 4.5 stars.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Poor film with little to no reason to ever want to watch again. Left feeling unhappy instead of yay! Went to a movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very fun game with challenging puzzles in a great 3-D environment. Just wish it was longer. Can't wait for the next one!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to come out on Prime.  The books are great and the show is just as interesting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is a must see season on Downton Abbey. If you haven't seen it yet your jaw will drop, and if you cry, your tears will well up from the first episode to the last in the most memorable season yet on Dowton Abbey. The war may be over, but the action and drama certainly isn't in this must see season. There is much to do back at the estate, once the war is over and that means perhaps some changes for the members of the family, many changes that is.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An amazing story that I couldn't put down.  I read a lot of books but this one will stay with with. I will definitely recommend it to others.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love the fact that you could just get the weather report right away without having to put on the tv or the radio.
0743525043|1.0|I cant speak for the text...but about the abridged audiobook version:<br /><br />A lot rambling and platitudes. The audio quality is very poor. Whats with the obsession with classical musicians and rock climbers? The speaker (who is the author as well), has boring monotone voice.<br /><br />--I have a strong feeling if you are looking to buy this, you probably already have good \\"flow\\" (the act of arranging your life and its daily activities into a order where they are seamless, so they become an unconscious acts, or at least require minimal conscious effort).--<br /><br />DO NOT BUY AUDIOBOOK..you will come away confused, and/or felt you lost valuable time to do something else more productive. Also listening to it while driving may be dangerous, it is very tedious and boring; you may fall asleep at the wheel (I almost did).
B004GYY714|5.0|We are in an area where radio reception is spotty, and while traveling it's nice to have uninterupted music - This app does it all!
B000092Q7O|5.0|I was afraid to bat my eyes because I thought I might miss something.This movie is just great. If you don't see this movie, you will regreat it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love and courage are dominant in this book...the characters so real and the story line so strong that you keep reading to learn more.  A very good read!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I was surprised to see how great these actors all were. Katey Sagal is amazing! She is one bad B!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not much to say other than if you like how the corporate world works, law firms in particular, egos, romances, ironies, a few good laughs....  Some very intense negotiating and it is very hard to guess the outcome...
B00138CYD4|5.0|I have been wanting this CD for months in the store but it was $11. It has every song that a Santana fan would love plus multiple others. To have this CD is a great treat so thank you Amazon for first partnering up with Sheetz and then giving mind blowing bargains.
0307949508|5.0|I read the first one in the trilogy, &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; on loan from a friend.  This one was a great follow-up.  I am now reading the last in the series, &#34;The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest,&#34; and find it equally entertaining.  A great series to take your mind off things for awhile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In this world of blocks you can create anything you wanted and find diamond gold and iron you see it for yourself
B005HEDI3K|3.0|that little circle deal  spinning around and the picture and sound stopping is annoying as hell.<br />youse guys need a better server!!
B007V4530A|5.0|I found this book very helpful, the references to TED on line talks were great,<br />Thank you for the book
B0000261RJ|5.0|&#34;Sacred heart&#34; is classic DIO. it is catchy and does have spashes of keyboards but it still rocks! This was an era that, for me, was priceless. &#34;rock n roll children&#34; another day&#34;sacred heart&#34; some songs featured on cd.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I've finished already. i would like to see a lot more rooms. hope it updates soon so I can continue.
B001AUKUS6|5.0|YES crank this one up!! lay it down you're in love whatever RaTT &#34;invasion of your privacy&#34; WOW!!!everything here is hard rock and attitude. This is my era of music..I can't write a bad word about RATT because without them I would of never made it thru HS!! Brings back a time when Rock n roll was everything and nothing else mattered at all!!! Thankyou RATT THANKYOU!!
055358202X|3.0|Am I the only one getting really, really tired of how Martin never uses an \\"e\\" or an \\"i\\" or anything else that might sound remotely like a \\"y\\" in a name?  After near four thousand pages, I've had it with all the y-ning.
B001HADE00|5.0|BREAK THRU cd for this band called RATT!! love this cd too!! lack of communication..back for more..round and round..again..brings back a time that makes me feel very proud to LOVE ratt n roll!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Year after year this continues to be wonderful television.  Great drama, fascinating characters, and interesting glimpses of the very class oriented society of England.  Look forward to next year!
B002M87V0A|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore. Guaranteed to put you in a good mood. You'll still be singing the songs after the movie is over.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent stories, cast, production<br /><br />This series was one I missed when it was first shown, so I'm delighted to see it now-- especially on my Kindle Fire!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sun's are two of my favorite books and Khaled Hosseini has added his latest to that list! There is something about his novels that always stick with me, and this novel is no different.
B000B8L6LI|4.0|Good for what you pay for. If you are looking for a high quality edge on nice knives you might want to consider the diamond sharpening kit or 4 hone stone set.
0345529057|5.0|New books, new book smell, lovely, as a sweet sweet dove in the summer time. baby cheeks of love flutter as an aria.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such an awesome show. The acting is great, the story line is great and the humor is so good. Thank you Amazon Prime for including it in your programming. The new season promises to be great!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great app, use it all the time, great way to get the weather. It is also very accurate with the forecast.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Don't waste your time or money. What I thought was going to be a fun movie to watch was just plain terrible.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is only the second one of these types of games I've played and I am having a lot of fun. I'm not too far in it yet, but I have not experienced any technical issues. The graphics are nice and the story line is fine, even if a bit simple. All in all, I'm having fun and will look for more games from this company.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|What a diamond in the ruff. I cried like a little girl!  This is a must see for anyone, just not dancers!
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I feel like I can write a novel reviewing this book. But sadly, I can't write too much or I'd give some of it away! If anyone is looking for a good novel to read (maybe more than once?) this would be a good one. But make sure you have time, because you won't be able to put this down.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is all set in a land of &#34;I Can't Believe That Just Happened!&#34; in a sort of late, medieval Venice. At first, what you'll come to realize are flashbacks, completely throw you off. One minute you're in young Locke's life, the next you're in the present. All I've got to say about those is PAY ATTENTION. It'll make sense soon.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I an really enjoying this game. The puzzles are fun and the game interactions are fun and easy. The graphics are really good
B004SVM7BW|5.0|Despite that highly negative and presumptuous review earlier today warning people away from this app, I installed it and enabled airplane mode on my phone, and confirmed that it works without Internet. Internet and accounts access is for those who want to access their Google Drive PDFs from within the app. The app is very refined and fast, and I welcome cloud document access. Not sure why this app would only get one star.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is fun especially if you're a hidden object junkie. I wish you didn't need to stop to let energy rebuild or buy to keep playing.
B000VYNYN0|4.0|Sam Raimi made this movie before he became famous (Spiderman etc.) and it contains enough clever touches, classic horror scares and Bruce Campbell giving a classic camp performance.  The blu-ray is crystal clear.  Even the very dark scenes are well-defined and there is very little color crush otherwise.  Considering its age, a great edition to one's horror library especially on blu-ray!
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Harry Nilsson remains one of the 20th century's most gifted singer/songwriters, but for the most part completely ignored by the masses.  Core fans were given a few remastered titles yet most of his catalog was only available through expensive imports.  This beautiful box rectifies that with almost everything Harry recorded for RCA.  Absolutely fantastic mastering and packaging which recreates in loving detail the original album covers.  The real treat is a seemingly endless array of bonus material added to the original albums, plus three individual discs packed with rarities.<br /><br />  In late 1971 I first heard \\"Without You\\" on the radio, completely blown away by this singer I never heard of before; so off I went to buy the album.  After hearing the album Nilsson Schmilsson, I discovered not only did this guy have a pitch perfect voice, but he could rock.  From there, I went backwards to hear his early work, then followed him throughout his career until he left us.<br /><br />  Harry Nilsson collided with almost every type of music there is, while never emulating others.  What is clear is a diversity of genres explored throughout his career.<br /><br />  This wonderful collection finally gives Harry his due.  It offers the world a chance to discover an amazing artist.<br /><br />  If you know Harry's music, this box set is essential.  If you love the hits and have an adventurous spirit, this set will knock your socks off.<br />  Many thanks to everyone responsible for putting this set together; job well done indeed.<br />  Highly recommended to anyone who loves genre bending music.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Bob Marley is the best-loved reggae artist in many minds, and these are his best-loved songs.  Great intro to the reggae style, and an album that can be listened to and sung along with over and over.  It's impossible to feel bad while listening to this album!
B0068RHSZO|3.0|I think the missing element to his otherwise high quality production (acting and script are mostly top notch) has to be atmosphere. Whether it's horror or a suspense/psychological thriller, it needs to have a feeling that it transmits to the viewer with every shot, and Dream House just doesn't. (think Christian Bale's commitment to his role in The Machinist and you'll know what I mean)  It is shot like a commercial.  I don't mean a lot of jumpy cuts, but a smooth glossy detached finished feeling that is utterly wrong for the subject matter. The same could be said for the casting of Daniel Craig (and his too still Bond-like physique) in the central role.  He does fine with it, but he does not inhabit the character.  The audience doesn't inhabit the house, and one has to suspect the director is at fault for that.  I did enjoy it, mostly for the potential of the ideas here rather than the execution - recommended (for rental)  if you liked Shutter Island or the Shining (2 far superior films, but in the same ballpark story wise)
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the back-story but wish there was a little more between the invasion and the first episode (spinoff off season opportunity?)  Thank goodness the network executives gave this time, because I had fears it would be the next Firefly.  My only complaint, and I'm not alone, is that each season is so short.  Each season is like a sample plate at the local grocery store when I want a cartful of entertainment.  Come on man!  Supernatural averages 20+ episodes a season! =)<br /><br />Having said that, I'm headed to Comic-Con as Tom and will try to be so true to his look that I don't need to explain &#34;who I am&#34; =)<br /><br />(As a bonus, much of what I'll be wearing to look like him comes from amazon.com)
B000005J56|5.0|Thanks
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|And free!  :) I'm sure everyone can agree. Besides it Uno. Can't really change up a classic game too much!<br />Enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game for any age. the entire family enjoys this game from my parents to my niece and nephew. it really helped on long trips.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|I am not of a mind to write reviews on demand.but my required headline should show that I loved this DVD.  I Thought the orchestra was a liitle to melodramatic in a couple of passages. I would recommend this verions of Wertherit to any opera lover who is too old to have taken part in the sexual revolution.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|This is a good show and this product is just as described.  Honestly dissapointed with Blu Ray in general but this product is exactly what it should be
0307956350|1.0|Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever tried to read. Not only is the main character a complete idiot, I never believed for a moment that she was ever CIA. You have to be an intelligent writer to create intelligent characters and Pavone's characters are clearly as stupid, senseless, and boring as he is. Not to mention that he has a powerful wife in publishing, which only seals the deal on this totally uninspiring piece of crap. This crapboiler is really nothing more than typing. Never thought I'd see the day, but there you have it, a book that I'd like to wipe my ass with.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I have become a Bruce Willis fan after seeing his first Die Hard.I was this at the show , so that should tell you how much I enjoyed  it.So make sure you buy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and challanging. even my 9 year old loves it! just wish it had more levels. can not wait for more levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the coolest game ever. I love it I play all the the time. My mom said it was a good strategy game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I would definetly recommend this game to a friend it is great and u can interact with friends and show off ur dragons
B008G3N71W|1.0|It was about a man and a woman, evidently he wanted this girl to be a horse. He had her beaten into submission, she ate oats and slept outside, naked, in a barn. There was no love involved. He even had a horse's tail made for her to wear. Absolutely awful...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just updated it so now all the characters from the original temple run are on it! It's so cool, plus I have over 300 gems and my high score is a little over 7 million because it's so addicting!
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch has done it again! They said they were going back to how they did Way of the Fist, and they did! From the lyrics to the guest vocalists this has got to be their best album yet!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|And now there's a game about the minions. I absolutely love it and I keep switching from the lab to the residential area and I have the baby minion. So cute!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once you've watched Season 1 you won't need me to tell you that Season 2 is must-see tv. The incredible ensemble acting continues, with the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith leading the way.<br /><br />If you're a romantic there are some incredible love stories: Lady Mary and presumptive heir Matthew, Lady Sybil and rebellious chauffeur Tom Branson, and my personal favorites, Anna the maid and valet John Bates.<br /><br />The castle, the clothes, the scenery are all first rate. There are plenty of reasons why this is the most-watched series in the history of PBS. Give it a try and you'll be hooked, too.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I can write ANYTHING so easily! Plus I can color-code which makes me very happy. I love this app, because of how easy it is to use. I'm glad I got it
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|Bought this app for my two granddaughters ages 4 and 6 it's super cute and they love it! The graphics are great!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is mostly my younger sister's game but it's ok. I prefer the 2nd one better because the graphics are better
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Easy enough to enjoy! But challenge enough to think about it! I love the graphics that come with it as well! Got as free app of the day but I would have bought it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this dragon game with all of these dragons, the variety seems endless! It's so fun to breed them and watch them get bigger as they evolve!
0142407542|5.0|What a fab follow on to the original! My son can't get enough of it! He insists on both Gruffalo books for bedtime reading
030789701X|5.0|After 2 years of constant use my old paperback issue was of course falling apart. Combine that with the fact the first issue was missing DLC content I went with this edition in the hardcover. It is very nice and appears to not be just randomly pieced together. It feels like it will last me a few years at the least.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love it and play it all the time. I like all of his music and enjoy when he sings on The Voice
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Some of the story lines were a little slow and boring. However, last season's ending makes it difficult to wait all summer for the next season to begin.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  After reading it I looked at the other titles by this author and picked American Gods.  I loved that book too.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Maybe its my phone but it seems slow geting from one portion to the other of this app.<br /><br />I also like to see other locations when we travel.  But once I put that location in the its always there and it slows down the rest of the app.  I would perfer if it knew my location and gave me that weather first and then I could choose another location if I want.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|The cast is right off the set of Saturday Night Live for the most part.  Sigourney Weaver is in one of her early film roles and doing comedy (strait) with Bill Murray hamming it up.  Dan Akeroid and Harold Ramous wrote this little gem and it's a lot of fun.  Annie Potts doesn't get as much screen time as everyone else, but she makes her moments count, as does Earnie Hudson.  How can you go wrong with this cast.  Enjoy!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Can't wait for the next one to see what that one has in-store for me!<br />  Like seeing the little village come into it's full form. The colors are bright and detail is amazing!
B002KVCA1O|5.0|64 years old and my first Stones album. Weird. Glad I bought it. Couldn't help but enjoy thinking about where I was when those songs first came out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is amazing I really love it and I am glad to be able to get from amazon before season four comes out can't wait to see else happens in this season and the next.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so fun. I love playing it. Nocking the minoins of the lab floor. Buying costumes for the minoins.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much! The author brilliantly drives the story with different characters lives and melds them together for a satisfying ending. It makes you question how you would react to similar events, if they ever happened to you. The epilogue was a real eye opener too. Loved it!
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Why can't they have Candy Crush Saga for Kindle Fire? I play it on my cellphone but would like to play it on something bigger. Please have it available on Kindle. Everyone is enjoying it on their tablets why can't I.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Bingo blitz started as a lovely game.  Now they are only concerned with making money.  Although advertised as a free game, you can only play for a few minutes daily unless you buy additional credits.  They have posted saying they want to attract \\"High Rollers\\" since being bought by a casino last year.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|If you enjoy British style literature, you will enjoy Downton Abbey.  I am enjoying it tremendously.  I enjoy rules and regulations and stations of life and historical events.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I LOVE this album. There are only two songs on the entire album I don't like and I am very much so looking forward to part two.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's very interesting and you want to keep playing it over and over again! I love it! The minions make it sooooo fuuuun!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games that don't require multiple players to play and that are challenging yet that are not to.mind boggling.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|After all the hype I thought it would, be entertaining, but I was wrong.  I just couldnt get into it because I really dont like ballet or plays.
B0090SI4OC|5.0|I was not able to play the Blu-ray movie in the set, the DVD played fine.  I was only disappointed by this fact.  It was not the seller's fault, this is a production problem.  I exchanged the movie twice, they did not play.  I even rented this movie in Red Box, same problem.  I had updated my Blu-ray player also, and tried it on two different players.  I did watch the DVD and the movie was great!<br />I have been waiting to see this movie since I heard they were making the movie.  I also loved the book.  I hope they fix the start up problem.  Buy it in DVD, I got my money back on the BR  and ended up buying the DVD.  I never have a problem with exchanges when I buy through Amazon. This is why the 5 stars, it's about the movie.  Loved the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my daughter show me this game and I can not stop playing it I have everyone kin my blue playing very addictive
B005LAIIA8|5.0|Another great Tim Burton story.  Heart warming story in the Tim Burton style.  Loved the little Frankenweenie dog, anyone who has loved a dog will relate to the boys love of his dog.  He brings back the dog, and then other animals get brought back, but not like his dog, things go wrong.  You have to see it, cute story, very good!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved all three books. I have got to say catching fire was my favorite book out of the series. The whole series keeps u guessing and wondering what might happen next. Hoping that what u have planned in it head happens. It was a great trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book! I'm ready for the next one. I didn't want it to end at all. Nothing like I've read before!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Grandbabies were glued to the screen and best of all, NO NIGHTMARES!!  Really wish is was for sale thru Amazon??
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought a stroller that had no cup holders or handle caddy so I got this with it. Fit on the stroller great. Only downside is that you have to unstrap at least one end b/c it doesn't fold with the stroller. It bends, but, I got sick of bending it back into shape when opening the stroller. It's held up to my abuse however, so that's something.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this to easily add material requirements for sewing. Great app. It would be useful for anything that works with fractions.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The game is fun (the animations are hilarious) and the game play is not too difficult. Different type  of puzzles keep it from being boring.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really enjoy watching the Weather Channel.  The app is a natural extension to this.  App is also very easy to use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works  perfect for what we needed it for , large size numbers great for tired eyes adds are small and don't bother you when using app.<br />  Thanks for a usefully app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well written fast reading can't put it down . Very good book I loved the characters it was very easy to get involved with the characters
B000HL2J0G|4.0|We enjoyed MacGyver the first time around.  Now, more than a quarter century later, we can enjoy the series again.<br /><br />Unlike such series as Lost or Under the Dome, each episode is complete in itself.  No extended and unending soap-opera-like production here.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|I watched Red (Part I) so that I could get an understanding of the characters and I'm glad I did as I was able to appreciate the dynamics between them. Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman were a good team and the overall plot and action scenes were pretty good.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works much better than original the new design is better  they should have designed it this way when it was first made
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What a great little movie.  I need a good laugh and this one supplied it along with a pretty good story line.  I have to se DM2!
B005544TRQ|5.0|truly addictive show, can't wait for season 3 on Amazon Prime. It's already on tv, not Hulu or Netflix, sad
B00846WWVM|3.0|The characters are cute and it's fun to use when I got some time to kill. I would recommend this for a quick game to use.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|We have watched over and over...great family movie.me and my husband love this movie.we never get tired of watching it
B00006FDCD|5.0|Movie was good for a TV movie but highly suggest you read the book. Tim curry owned pennywise the clown.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is the best ever. great graphics lots of extras I love the colors and the levels never stop. I wish more games where like this one.
B00CXL6XP0|3.0|I like it, but dont love it (sorry guys). I'm still happily stuck in the &#34; Operation Mindcrime & Empire&#34; world! I love them still. This is closer to  them, than previous post Empire albums with the replacement singer for Jeff Tate and he is great, like Jeff ! I listened to previews for both Queensryche's newest release's and liked this better than the Jeff Tates stuff.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, and ponder about life. It truly is a good book, and I would definitely recommend reading it. 5 stars for sure.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|real world advice that really works - and works well! I am so glad I readd this book - and will re read - and go back again and again - so I can stay super human and have great sex (at over 50)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read but have a difficult time holding on to a book. I can prop my phone and order up a book and read again. The books are a reasonable price and there are many choices. I am very happy with the kindle ap
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use this quite a bit. Simple to organize and i love using the voice to text feature.<br />Voice to text on a razzer  max  works great.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Need to explain how the game works, couldn't figure  out how to play too frustrating to figure how to play
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I am  a sucker for a musical..  And this definitely delivered.  Great musical performances and an interesting story..  Kathryn McFee was terrific.  My biggest complaint is that there arent any more episodes.  They did do a second season, but I heard it wasnt as good as the first, and they are currently not available through prime.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Really enjoy figuring out how to do the balls. Had a little trouble with a couple of balls  most had a challenge.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This SLR camera backpack met my expectations. It is very functional and easy to carry. I have received numerous compliments on it.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Campy, clever, and fun. A great production considering it was done on a cloud source funding plan. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|I bought this trilogy for my granddaughter. She loved the original disks but she & the rest of the family are enjoying it now on blue- ray. Clearer visually & perhaps improved sound.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Wonderful movie done by the only person who could really make it work.  I am really looking forward to the next installments.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I liked it okay but it seems the trailers made it seem more than it was.  It is clean and that is one thing I like about it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I believe this to be a nonsensical book, with a misleading title. A recent article in Esquire Magazine explores the bona fides of the book and finds them utterly wanting.  I have no trust in the claims of the book.
0316017930|5.0|This book gives positive insight to simple (yet complex) ideas and thoughts that, if taken seriously, can transform our mind and in essence our life!
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Worst book I've ever tried to read!  I have told anyone who asked not to read it.  So, so disappointed.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Secretariat is a great story of perseverance, passion, and courage. We loved, loved, loved it!! Beautiful horses too! Highly recommend! :)
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|We read it together every night. It was very well written and illustrated.  The story is charming and elicited a discussion about which colors we use the most and why.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|The movie is a little long, but well-acted, and the storyline is great!! Wonderful, inspirational movie. Definitely glad I watched, and would recommend to anyone!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband and I both, really enjoy this show! There is a lot of entertainment, and intrigue with the shows characters.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|Good, clean fun! Never gets old...I laughed and laughed and laughed!!! An excellent movie for when you just want a good chuckle... Highly recommend! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a really fun game if your just trying to kill some time :) kind of easy but it's not a big deal, like a scavenger hunt through an apartment building.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|It's kind of fun because a lot of well-known &#34;heroes&#34; come in one place. However, the plot has absolutely nothing special or meaningful. There are just too many distractions. It's either the story is so one-dimensionally boring or the director didn't do a very good job.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Very nice graphics, and nice game.  Pretty challenging too, but not too hard so you can finish it.  I will buy this game in the future.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game. I thought it was challenging enough to keep my interest, yet not too hard to frustrate or discourage me. I look forward to finding out what's to come with subsequent games that are coming up.
0500289077|5.0|This is the kind of book you will always go back backto for ideas! It presents the most famous photographers' work and thoughts about street photography. It has a great section on Cities which, in my view, is exquisite and timely since most street photography takes place in cities.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is amazingly cool and also its free so that's a bonus get this app right now<br />people get it
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Overall the show is pretty good. Sometimes the antics are a little over the top but what do you expect?
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|it was to young for me to stay with it but for the younger kids it would be good very colorful,
0767827902|4.0|I have never seen this movie but it was recommended by a friend who said it was great. I have been unable to see at this time.
1451695195|5.0|Given the author's scientific based background, this was a very interesting and insightful book. This book helps to strengthen one's faith in an after life even though there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of a higher power. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This was easy to install on my Android phone. I have used it several times already and really enjoy it. I would recommend this app to anybody
0345529057|5.0|I love this series and the covers on the books are still the old ones even though the box is the new design which was perfect for me. Best deal
B009CF6FEE|5.0|Ferrel was the star on SNL and he is the star in this movie. You want to laugh a lot? Get this movie.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Hidden object puzzle based games are always fun and I give this a five start review not to easy and not to hard. But I am a little stuck on 17-2
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Decent game good graphics nice for younger kids but not all that challenging.... my four year old has only been playing for three days and is bored with it...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I liked this book a lot! But the ending could have been a little better. Plus the title of the last chapter was\\" glinda the good witch grants Dorothy`s wish\\" so it was pretty obvious what was going to happen and it kind of spoils it. Well you know whats going to happen anyway if you've seen the movie. And I don't know anyone who hasn't seen the movie. But other than that it was really really good!
B00B935SUY|5.0|The era...the music...the artists...the interviews...the stories. I appreciated being given a snapshot of a bygone age in music. The songs I grew up listening to, singing, dancing and dreaming to. Brings back so many fantastic memories. Thank you, Dave! The moment the credits started rolling, I picked up the phone and called my brother (we bond over books and movies) and told him that Sound City is a MUST watch documentary.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Get it! This game helps you organize your mind. It makes you think about spatial relationships... and it has pretty colors.
0446576220|5.0|What a great testament for all entrepreneurs on business startup l, failure, and the committee to excellence. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to instill a culture of passion, transparency and superior customer service.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|The story is strong enough to keep you watching; Maggie keeps you listening. Would have liked more music. Liked the ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is tons of fun and, with the updates, manages to stay fresh and engaging.  The voice acting, music, and visuals will immediately remind you of the movies and together they reinforce this game's fun feel. Make sure you have plenty of room on your Kindle Fire or it'll annoyingly lag.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Good actors given some moments of intelligent dialogue over powered by the demented Tarantino's 12-yr-old's mentality of the joy of gore. Good actors, important & tragic story, belittled in the interest of gory special effects. Not worth one moment in time.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It was awesome because the picture looked real and I love the walking dead the tv show and its pretty awesome and that look real too and I like you don't read a lot
B0000046W9|5.0|If you are a Getz fan, you will love this collection!  The sax and guitar play are superb, the vocals wonderful.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Entertaining reading but at the end of the day, there is no book that can really tell you what and how to find your calling to escape an unhappy job or in your retirement years
0756404738|2.0|I liked 'The name of the wind' a lot. Or, rather, I think the first third of it was great, second third was good, and last third was just Ok.<br /><br />On that scale set by 'The name of the wind', this book is just below C-grade. I am setting two-star to offset those thousands of raving reviews from people who either never have read anything well-written or just simply are trying to help the author sell the book.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book is not its length. I don't mind reading 993 pages of a good story. But I do mind reading 993 pages of a story which should have fit in 250 if the author was not too focused on minute details such as describing on 10 pages how Kvothe went out with his friends to a bar. The weather was bad, they bar was crowded as usual, they talked about how one of his friends has problem wooing a girl, they drank what wine, they got drunk, and they went back.<br /><br />Great, why was that included in the book? I have no idea. There was no real story development in that scene, no conflict with an antagonist, no character development, no nothing.<br /><br />To put it another way, imagine a movie where you sit through a 20-minute drive scene of a main character driving on a highway to a shopping mall while stopping by to get fuel (oh, forgot his wallet but he had a $100 in a pocket), then stopping by to get a bit at Burger King (the main character liked the fries but was too proud to admit it), then helped an old lady to her car, then heard good news story on a radio, and then finally he found a parking slot in the middle of third row and went into the Macy's.<br /><br />Irritating.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I've listened to it a couple dozen times and I come away with an even great appreciation of Gregg's talent. The reason I think that is because, while I normally LOVE anything TBone touches (he's a genius) he left a wee bit too much of his mark on this one. And INSPITE of that Gregg rises up and makes it his own. I anticipated their pairing, but it is ultimately, and surprisingly, Gregg who makes it work. What do I know. Maybe TB made it that way.  Buy it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|There were other suggested additional DVD's of the later Columbo movies but they are not necessary. This collection has everything. It also includes a few of the Mrs. Columbo episodes which are a good addition. It was a great experience seeing all these episodes again and in chronological order. Watch the developing damage to his car and his raincoat, it's pretty funny. His relationship with his Beagle &#34;Dog&#34; is a great ongoing joke. Another thing to notice besides the stars of each episode are the great recurring minor characters that furnish a lot of the comedy in the episodes. Peter Falk really perfected an all time great detective character.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When you consider that the majority of people who watch this series, ends up loving it, it is a wonder that it was ever canceled.  But sadly it was, and this partially completed first season is all we have to enjoy (unless you count the movie that came later on).  But at least what we do have is entertaining.<br /><br />Firefly is the space cowboy series originally thought up by Joss Whedon.  Following the crew of a smuggling ship (or really whatever job they can get) it shows them trying to keep away from the central government.  Which proves tough to do with their line of work and the fugitives that they are transporting as well.  Add in Reavers (crazy space raiders) and not so friendly locals and space is just not a safe place.  But it's a place that feels like home to the spaceship Serenity and her crew.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Nathan Fillion - Malcolm Reynolds<br />Gina Torres - Zoe Washburne<br />Alan Tudyke - Hoban Washburne<br />Morena Baccarin - Inara Serra<br />Adam Baldwin - Jayne Cobb<br />Jewel Staite - Kaylee Frye<br />Sean Maher - Simon Tam<br />Summer Glau - River Tam<br />Ron Glass - Derrial Book<br /><br />Mal Reynolds is the captain of the Firefly ship and he's a no-nonsense but fair kind of guy.  He's also got a reasonable sense of humor and he's such a great leading character that you always want to find out what he's going to do next.  His first mate Zoe and her husband (the ship's pilot) are also interesting characters.  Although I think Zoe is a little too serious at times, especially when you compare her to her jovial husband.  One of my favorite characters is Kaylee, the mechanic of the ship, because she is so sweet and down to earth.  She really provides the \\"nice\\" that the crew of the ship needs.  Jayne, on the other hand, is the muscle and is somewhat dumb, but funny in that dumbness.  The Tam siblings provide some interest, but when it comes to being watchable, I find them the least enjoyable, but when it comes to that series, least enjoyable is still quite good.  Inara is the only one with legitimate work, but it's very interesting and I've seen her job likened to that of a geisha, which I think is pretty accurate.  The last main character, Book, is the preacher, but he has a lot of secrets.<br /><br />The whole space cowboy thing could have been very cheesy, but it's not.  Because of the depth of the characters, settings of the worlds, and the way the plot works, it is wholly original.  I loved that the crew didn't like the main government but had to learn to work within the confines and restrictions of their world(s).  The sets were very realistic and not overly showy.  Even the technology seemed not out-of-this-world and realistic.  And while there was a main plot that ran through the whole series, each episode was a good stand alone and had its own adventures.  Even the bad guys were pretty scary; a government that thinks it's doing good and evil space people that have gone mad.  Gives you a shudder just thinking about it.<br /><br />The special effects, for this being in its first season, were pretty good.  They used a lot of the same sets so they were able to really get it detailed.  The inside of the ship was well done.  I also really liked the music in the series as well.  It followed the country theme more, although there was some ballroom music.  The main theme song was great, lyrics and everything and kind of sets up the whole tone for the series.<br /><br />An excellent show that should have never been canceled.  It's one that I come back to time and time again.  I honestly love everything about it and can't personally find any flaws with it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013enjoyable is still quite good.

Even the technology seemed not out-of-this-world and realistic.  And while there was a main plot that ran through the whole series, each episode was a good stand alone and had its own adventures.  Even the bad guys were pretty scary; a government that thinks it's doing good and evil space people that have gone mad.  Gives you a shudder just thinking about it.<br /><br />The special effects, for this being in its first season, were pretty good.  They used a lot of the same sets so they were able to really get it detailed.  The inside of the ship was well done.  I also really liked the music in the series as well.  It followed the country theme more, although there was some ballroom music.  The main theme song was great, lyrics and everything and kind of sets up the whole tone for the series.<br /><br />An excellent show that should have never been canceled.  It's one that I come back to time and time again.  I honestly love everything about it and can't personally find any flaws with it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2013
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I have never seen the movie...and I got to enjoy it at the Library with a group of people....we had chocolate milk and chewy ginger cookies....it was great fun to watch...
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have several calendar apps, but this one fits the bill the best.  Give it a try and I think you will agree.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a challenging game. I didn't get bored playing this. Each floor was different and kept me guessing to solve the escape.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I am satisfied with the ePrint app. I have used the feature to print from my cell phone while not at home.
B000W237RE|5.0|This album is a masterpiece,and one of many by the Allman Brothers Band.<br />Live at the Filmore and this Eat a Peach were breakout albums by a band that is a treasure and timeless.<br />Both live and recorded the Allmans are one of the best.<br />I got a tattoo of a mushroom,just because of this album.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Sometimes you just have to watch a love story.  And this one was really good.  Robert De Niro was really good in this romantic role.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Bought two of these. After waiting six weeks for delivery they finally arrived. Opened the first one--unable to pair with my iPhone via bluetooth. Rebooted everything, but no luck. Second one paired right away. But, after about 8 hours, it won't reconnect. Very, very disappointing. I'll update this if and when the problem is resolved, but Withings had better respond to my service email asap or I'll return these for something else.<br /><br />By the way, it does look like a nice tool, but what other reviewers say about the screen being impossible to read in the sun is true.<br /><br />Update -- 8 August<br /><br />Figured out the connection problem on the second one. Could have been solved with clearer documentation. Basically, just hold down the button for three seconds and the connection will start.<br /><br />Withings customer support gets 5 stars. Not only did Mathieu carry on an email diagnosis session on the weekend, when the problem couldn't be solved they overnighted a new device immediately. Superb. The new device paired with my phone on the first try.<br /><br />The device itself is quite nice. Based on a few counting exercises, the pedometer appears to be extremely accurate in counting steps. The sleep info is intriguing and worth some study. Now that the data is there, I'll have to play around with what factors might lead to better or worse sleep. The pulse meter seems finicky--sometimes I have trouble getting a reading.<br /><br />Overall a worthwhile purchase.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|He just pops up in different places and scares the scrap out of you not for children at all!!!!! Play it at night if you dare!!!, but it really is scary!!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|If there is such a thing as adult fairy tales... This is it. I loved this book. I rarely re-read a novel but this one I will. I only wish it were longer. I am sad now that it's ended.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|great war movie.. a must watch for war movie lovers, specially those related to submarines. The story line is all about german u-boats and its toughness below 250 meters in the water and how captain helps keep his crew's moral high in tough times and how crew comes back together in tough situation.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I am looking forward to this gift set, I don't have the 3d tv yet but I do have a Blue-Ray and The Weta Statues are Amazing. I think this set will be worth every penny I spend on it......
B007SGM084|1.0|Okay, I wasn't a fan.  You don't need three books to cover this useless nonsense.  The plot line could have easily been covered in one book.  The rest was sex, sex, and more sex.  Don't get me wrong, it can be steamy and exciting at times.  However, by the third book EL's descriptions of passion become redundant, recycled even.  Everyone needs a little zest in their life, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the constant bedroom antics.  I actually began to skim through most of those scenes to get back to the lack-luster plot line.<br /><br />And let's just say for arguments sake, that people are okay with the constant sex in the book, but should we really be okay with the obsessive, stalker tendencies of Mr. Grey and the fact that the &#34;heroine&#34; is content with the way she is treated?  All I kept thinking while reading is, &#34;This glorifies controlling men and makes women think this is what they need in their lives to feel loved!&#34;  Seems a bit socially irresponsible to have this kind of content so easily accessible to young, impressionable minds.  As an adult, I can take it for what it is... fiction.  Albeit, in my opinion, useless fiction.  But I do feel it should be more difficult for those under 18 to read.  Again, all my opinion, take it as you will.
B00007LTIC|5.0|When Going For The One was released, Yes had been in a semi-hiatus state and was coming out/back, would do several world tours. Additionally, I was a teenager and was too young to have seen Yes in their greatest form (in my opinion), when Bill Bruford was their drummer. The masterpieces the earlier Yes produced would never be duplicated, as Bruford's sublime contributions put the drums on a par compositionally in the overall band's sound. So when Tales of Topographical Oceans, and Relayer came out, I pretty much didn't pay much attention. Later, I was more mature in my listening habits and bought Going For the One when it was released, on vinyl.  I saw the Wakeman-reunited Yes a couple of times during this period of time.<br /><br />I enjoyed GFTO immensely although I didn't consider it to be on the same level as The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close To the Edge.<br /><br />Fast forward to a few months ago when I put this vinyl Going For the One on for a spin for old time's sake. Would I have the same opinion? Well, I think tastes change. I believe that, in a lot of ways, Going For The One is the best Yes album that has the Howe/Anderson/Wakeman/Squire/White lineup. Furthermore, I am putting it in Yes' top five all time. I might even rate it slightly higher than Fragile, but, probably not. Opinions are all over the place and an individual will definitely not agree on this, but I think Wondrous Stories and Awaken (side 2) is probably 20 minutes of some of Yes' best ever.<br /><br />Subjective judgement: This album revisited improves with age. And it is a GREAT album. This is a review for the vinyl copy of Going For The One. I have not bought this CD (yet.)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute game....love those Minions....especially Dave!  Graphics are good. Similiar to Temple Run game.  Sounds are great also. Grandkids love to play it!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Ok so I loved this game and so I paid 99 cents for the world pass and there was nothing
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love Stephen King and although this is a relative short story, it is all Stephen King.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Didn't even watch the whole thing.  Love all of the actors but don't waste your time.  Stick with the original
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was not the Cujo type of Stephen King but what a tale!!  The story was thoroughly engaging with several side plots that flowed really well.  The ending surprised me and I loved for that to happen!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Tons of twist and turns in the plot but Matt is awesome here and all in all it is a good movie.
1599218011|5.0|Has a lot of information - all put together pretty well! Easy and fun to read and follow. Could have used more menus for this type of new adventure ... that would have helped, but enjoy what she has recommended. Luckily my husband is a good sport - and says he can handle a change - because I'm worried about his health. Recommend!
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|One of the better ones in the series.  Great music and awesome dancing.  And of course HOT BODS which is nice.
B005HSL626|5.0|Oh wait, yes I do. Fruit ninja is a hilarious game of hacking and slashing various fruits while avoiding bombs. This type of mindless fun can go on for hours and hours without ever getting boring. There are a ton of achievements to keep you playing, and you and your friends will spend your weekends trying to beat each others high scores.<br /><br />You should definitely buy this game.
B002JC9RMY|5.0|Love the lead.  He is cute as hell.  And the movie itself was great fun.  Hope that they do a sequel
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|Loved the by play between David Tennant and Catherine Tate.  They were fantastic together.  This is one I would recommend.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Glad they are doing another one.  Lots of fun as a prequel and very well done by everyone including the actors.
B0089AD8IO|3.0|It was nice that they brought back Doctor Who.  But I felt that it needed more character development, but nice.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great special effect and great actors always makes for tons of fun in a movie.  Really enjoyed it a lot.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|A good way to end David Tennant, as the Doctor.  It was good to see him stretch a bit more.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Every single person in the cast was phenomenal.  Have always loved Maggie Smith and the rest were wonderful as well.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really liked yourgane but can u plz leave some more of those those things fron were u guys play
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Great characters and  a hot male lead is always nice.  Hope that they do a sequel but from what I read it wasn't well received by the book readers so isn't likely.
B006LSZECO|5.0|U will love it easy read page turner. Looking for more books just like it , i could not out it down once i started it. Read the book in about a few days
B00DU74U74|1.0|Could not even get past the first 15 minutes.  The host and alien talking to each other all the time was just horrible.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|So worth it,  I had tried the free version and was immediately intrigued I  was never bored or frustrated best game
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Jeremy is hot so it was worth watching.  Special effects were great and it was even funny in spots which is fun.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved all of the twists and turns that the book had to offer. There were many surprises in the book that kept me entertained! Another home run by Rick Riordan!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Predictable but well done.  Both leads did a good job and I would recommend it.  Not super but well done
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|This album is better than the previous one, personal view...one of her best album! I love it so much that I listen to it now everyday.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! Graphics are great and the minions are super cute! Would definitely recommend this game, fun for all ages.
0800141849|5.0|I'm a big Jeff Bridges fan and he's hilarious in this. I love Streisand too. Thank heavens you can still get some flicks in full screen. I don't like missing body parts.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|It's a great boy movie. Plus I like it to. Who doesn't like race cars.  Watched it like 20 times this month
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting Great plot.  Very interesting time period.  Like looking in on anther world.  I find the downstairs folks much more interesting people.  Funny how that works.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Even though this movie dealt with divorce, it was comical and fun.  It was interesting how all the personalities came together.
B004GJIL34|5.0|The empire of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland is obsolete and on the decline. Bobby Sands the IRA martyred and subject of the movie, lamentably died and suffered in vain. He was a member of parliament (MP) duly elected, but was imprisoned for his stance against the illegal occupation of British armed forces in his native country of Ireland. The movie focuses in the brutality of his captors, the appalling living conditions (their cell filled with human excrement and urine from the prisoners) protesting the constant beatings and harassment from the guards. No civilized nation could possibly tolerate such sadism perpetrated so impudently by the guards. Now that the dust has settled and the British troops removed, the empire hubris insistence to add Ireland to their official name; it should be and Northern Ireland.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie had me both intrigued and laughing at the same time.  Well done!  I am looking forward to watching Red 2
B004LQGXPA|5.0|General George S. Patton was a soldier who led his men into battle, with the fear of God in one hand while hating the enemy on the other. I firmly believe that he was a godsend in a time when the whole world was at stake. At times, I’d like to think of him a success in the many Pyrrhic victories where defeat was not an option. Of it, there are many samples in the movie. A history learned scholar the general had a touch of the most needed hubris, but he humbly prayed to God who doubtless was on his side. George C. Scott was born to play his role in the movie. I first saw it during its premier in 1970, and enjoy watching it with relish every-now-and-then, and now than I’m older, I seem to appreciate it better and learn new lessons from such a great American leader. As Greek King Pyrrhus of Epirus, it might be another one or two thousand years before we get to see another man of his caliber leading free peoples against tyranny and despotism so rampant in our world throughout the ages.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|I just needed an extra battery because I take so many pictures. This way I can have two charged and ready at all times. It is perfect!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I have enjoyed the Irish Wolfhound Oberon very much. He made the book for me. Everything from the dog's perspective.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|Perfect gift for my nerdy electrical engineer father and I to watch and laugh with. Definitely going to be getting the other seasons as upcoming presents for him!! &#60;3
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I would love to be able to stream all the seasons 1-10. Please get the rest of them. Thank you!
B003VS0CWY|5.0|Love that this came with the DVD and blu ray discs. Video quality is superb as well as the sound.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Love this stylus!  I like having the alternate size tips and this particular stylus has lasted months longer than any other.  As someone with arthritis in all fingers, a good stylus is a necessary in order to use most &#34;touch&#34; devices.  Very pleased all around.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|it is an cool game my daughter loved it she told me she wanted to be an doctor that's so cool
B005544TRQ|5.0|Casting is perfect and the writing brilliant.  It has sensitivity, humor, and always a great story line.  I just started watching it on Amazon with Season 1, and I'm hooked and on a Suits marathon! It's intelligent TV, for a change.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|First off, I often complain that silly, escapism, action films are too political.  Since the country is split about 50/50, why turn off half your audience?  This film has a lefty slant that it didn't need.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Action happening at a mile a minute pace.  Likable characters.  Humorous situations set against unfathomable challenges and carnage.  This movie is silly, unbelievable to its' core.  The heroes accomplishing one unbelievable task after another.  Twists and turns.  Take the kids, they won't groan at the politics, they'll just love the unimaginable situations, the resulting miracle escapes and heroism.  American exceptionalism as viewed from the left.
006220629X|4.0|Not as good as The Shadow of the Wind, but a good sequel nonetheless. I made the mistake of reading this BEFORE The Angel's Game. I probably would have enjoyed Prisoner of Heaven had I read The Angels Game beforehand.
B003ES61EE|2.0|I wanted this to clear camera lens. No instruction provided. The small tip's covering was unraveling. I did not trust wiping a lens's glass element with it.
B0086700CM|1.0|I don't get what people are going on about I have played better games. of course but others enjoy it, good for them. but its my opinion and it doesn't suck.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This movie was so very bad. We should have read the reviews before wasting the time to wince I mean watch it. No redeeming qualities on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|saw my friend playing this n looked fun so i wanted it for my son but it wont get past the download page. waited 2hrs. very dissapointed
B008MN6WP4|1.0|was not properly described correctly.  The regions were not listed right so it would not play in my blu ray nor anyone elses.  Was dissapointed.  Will however say that Amazon took care of the problem , thank you.
B0060D11OU|5.0|Is there really anything you can say about Andrews and Van Dyke.  Unbelievable.  So perfect.  I told my 8 year old that she has my permission to marry a fella like Burt.  And Julie Andrews was removed from the stage version of My Fair Lady when it went to screen the same year she did Mary Poppins.  But who won the Academy Award for Best Actress?  It wasn't Audrey Hepburn!
B001NLL93W|5.0|This was a great series! I picked it up because I heard about the film coming out and always like to read the books first.... Now I think I'm as jazzed/ my expectations are as high as they were for Harry Potter! LOVE LOVE LOVE
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Not a great movie for this hearing and vision impaired viewer. Many dark and dreary scenes. But why would anyone pay attention to a movie review from this bookworm?
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was a great series! I picked it up because I heard about the film coming out and always like to read the books first.... Now I think I'm as jazzed/ my expectations are as high as they were for Harry Potter! LOVE LOVE LOVE
140006922X|1.0|This book is garbage.  A slap in the face to Christians, very dangerous, and irresponsible.  Unfortunately it's a sign of the times in the turn of our society to liberal thinking.  Lord help us!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was a great series! I picked it up because I heard about the film coming out and always like to read the books first.... Now I think I'm as jazzed/ my expectations are as high as they were for Harry Potter! LOVE LOVE LOVE
0785153942|2.0|I've seen the movie twice and wanted to know more about this pretty cool universe, so I bought this in hopes of feeding my insatiable apatite for Pacific Rim. Sadly, I'm pretty disappointed in Beacham's first go at comics. After reading through, I felt like this didn't need to be a graphic novel at all. The imagery didn't add anything substantial to the material. For the most part, this felt like illustrated exposition. Each section was glossed over and the gravity of the situations didn't come through because the characters weren't given enough time to explore their drama, which felt stilted anyway. I was cringing halfway through. During Pentacost's section where Mako asked to pilot a Jaeger, I literally said aloud, \\"Wow, this is really dumb!\\" I was on the verge of closing the damn thing during Caitlin's sparkly \\"pons\\" sequence. I would have been fine with a list of all the characters that showed up in here, a brief description, and a bullet list of their motivations.<br /><br />Using 5 different artists was really confusing. Since this is all knew lore, and with each section being as brief as they were, the art styles never had time to sink in. It was especially jarring seeing Pentacost drawn differently from page to page. It just brought me right out of it. It wasn't like each art style was markedly different either. I would give it a pass if each section had a clear art style that reflected the content of that section, but it just looked like no one cared for visual continuity at all. The layout of the pages were poorly constructed also. Frame layouts and action shots were stumblingly composed. Visually, this comic was missing the scale of the movie. All the shots were so tight.<br /><br />I feel like the high praise of this is spill over from the movie (which I love by the way). This graphic novel was a step backwards. There's just too much going on for something so short. If this is any indication of upcoming expansions to the Pacific Rim universe, I'll gladlystay in the bubble of the Movie proper.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story was captivating and I  became engrossed with the story from the very beginning.I read the entire book in a weekend and was sad when the story was finished, I wanted the story to go on  and on.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviews that this &quot;upgrade&quot; has not been a positive for me. The &quot;NOW&quot; screen is difficult to read and the maps are hard to navigate and I was very happy with the older, simpler version.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Our whole family is addicted to Downton Abbey. Season 3 continues the saga of an irresistibly compelling aristocratic family and their heroic household staff as they modernize to keep pace with the social and technological revolutions of the 20th century.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Love this game you have many hours of fun puzzles are fun I can't wait to load the next game. Keep up the great work
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Some rather racy language, but great songs on this album.  I seem to be humming them nearly all of the time.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Washington played a good role here as he always does in his movies, rent it or buy it, it is worth the watch.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Just terrific, love all of the songs, especially mirror, but they are all great.  If you like Justin Timberlake, don't hesitate, just buy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enough of a challenge without driving me completely bonkers. When you just want to pass some time, this game is a terrific boredom buster. Now that I've rated it, I hope it will stop nagging me to do so. The 'rate me' nag is the only minus I'd give this game.
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|Predictable during half of the plot, gutter humor centered on swearing and reference to male body parts for the rest.  Rather dull and not very imaginative.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book held my attention from beginning to end.  It was fast-paced, and described the dysfunctional behavior of the two main characters in a gut-wrenching way.  As the book ended, I smiled a sigh of contentment.
B008EAWRPY|5.0|This journal makes it easy to want to write everyday. Super quick and to the point, you won't get stuck not know what to write down... It makes you ponder the little things which we all know, turn out to be the most important. :) love it!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Definitely a story driven but developers were very in tune to mess with what worked and tweaked and improved the game<br /><br />1. Graphics are break taking on the PSVita and nice almost seamless integration with the animated series with cut scenes...my only grip about this (minor albeit) is the length sometimes reminds me of Metal Gear Solid where I feel in some ways I am watching a movie rather than playing it.<br /><br />2. Nice work on music and ability to change different tracks was wise.<br /><br />Overall superb job, I have not finished it and I feel I am addicted to the gameplay (there is a lot of gameplay).
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love Amazon because of the variety of products in one place.  And then I joined Prime, OMG Prime is the best things ever.  It has paid for itself 5 times over.  I definitely will be renewing.  Oh did I mention the variety of movies and TV shows and books. I can watch from my computer, TV or phone.  The other day, I was in a meeting and bored out of my mind and I tuned in to The Good Wife, I was lost in the show.  Someone asked me a question and I didn't know what was going on.  Oh for my Amazon. LOL
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you like this genre even a little bit you will enjoy it!  The whole series is very addicting, save the day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is a lot of fun but it needs more levels now! I can't wait for the update. I love how this game makes you use your brain.
B001PPGAIK|4.0|The Australia backdrop is just stunning to watch on my HD 40 inch LED TV.  Very much enjoyed this movie.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|If you like the blues, great artists, car chases and a silly plot...this is your movie.  A classic American film.
B001974DG0|5.0|A book that lives up to all of the positive reviews.  One of Koontz`s best works that keeps you turning pages the whole way through.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a great book. If you or your kids want to understand \\"Wicked\\" it's a must read.  It will explain things the book \\"Wicked\\" references that movie fans will not necessarily understand or know about.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey's reputation goes before it and it is completely justified. This is one of the finest productions ever to be televised. The Cast is perfect and it is wonderful to see Hugh Bonneville taking the kind of dominating lead that he so richly deserves. Elizabeth McGovern is eye-opening in her role as the saintly Cora, and Dame Maggie Smith gives us another of her immortal characterizations of British tradition and wit. The rest of the cast, most of whom were new to me (save for the great Jim Carter) are revelations. I cannot recommend this series more highly.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It won't let me play.  I click on the cards and they start calling the Bingo # but the # of cards I want to play with won't come up.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Grown Music.  I really like that description.  Thought-provoking, intelligent, well-crafted rap/hiphop.  Seriously, I am not even a huge fan of this type of music and I adore this guy.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I really loved this book. It was a different setting than I am use to reading. It is vey sad and dramatic but I still enjoyed reading it. I will definitely read another one of Hossseini's books in the future.
B000L53D4O|5.0|This was on a Gold Box Deal of the Day for Fischer-Price items.  My daughter was just starting to furniture cruise as it arrived and she loved it.  It is the perfect size for a tony walker and she picked it up very quickly.  He sister would help her turn around or avoid the kitchen.  It goes TOO fast on hard surfaces for us but perfectly fine on normal carpet.  She used it heavily from months 7-8 and was fully walking in month 9 so now she uses it less.  But she does drop down and play with the front now, which is very cute.  Some kids get more or less use out of things.  At the price we paid, I am satisfied with this purchase.
1451695195|1.0|This was probably the most self-serving and boring book I have read in quite some time. Most of the dribble related to the author's credentials and many medical-related accomplishments. It did not give any significant insight into the so-called 'other side.' What a crock!
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Loving the new alternative music out now.  This is one of my husband and I's favorite new bands.  Discovered them on XM Radio's Alt Nation.  This is in regular rotation in the house (yea for music safe to play with the kids around!) and in the car.
0062124293|5.0|So here's the thing. I'm 61, liberal, and a feminist. Caitlin Moran is 35 or so, writing a funny British book about feminism. I had no expectations. I'm not a great laugh out loud person, but at one point I laughed so hard I snorted tea out my nose!. Not to be recommended.<br /><br />Underlying all this fabulous humor was a lot of perspective about the next wave of feminism, including  topics I will discuss with my grown daughters who don't necessarily think they are feminists. For instance, the ways that internet pornography, seen by pretty much all kids, has changed the way people see their bodies.  It gave me perspective about what it might be like to be a woman in my kids generation.<br /><br />You may think this is a light read, but I'm surprised at how much I have thought about the topics afterwards.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This collection is great.  My wife and I had never watched the Godfather collection before and it was a treat to sit down for 3 evenings and watch.  The actors are great
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once Upon A Time Season 1 takes you in to this magical story of true love. This show has great characters, AWESOME story lines, and memorable moments. A fresh spin on the fairytale characters we all know and love this show is at the top of my list for #1 show of the year.
B005LAII4E|5.0|This was a really good movie.  Although it is ficticous, it gives one pause to think if such a thing could occur, ie., technology becoming so advanced that someone could actually take over as president.
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|I rented this movie with 2-3 others a while ago hoping for one decent movie out of the bunch. We made the mistake of watching this one first... (the peace you feel after watching this movie is awing, like you actually were there) when we attempted to watch the other movies we were bombarded with unnecessary cursing and just bad acting. I could only compare this movie to a peaceful camping trip deep in the woods with someone pretty, funny, and entertaining.<br />P.S. I have watched it 3 more times since and it still has the same affect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for when your bored , exciting , thrilling . MINION RUSH IS WAYY BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN &amp; SUBWAY SURF !!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love the story between Travis and Abby. It is a love / hate relationship at 1st but in the end true love concurs all!
B008JFUO36|5.0|Oblivion is a movie of human yearning for something that cannot be verbalized, but the heart is sure must exist somewhere just beyond the horizon. Tom Cruise's character longs for something, although he's not sure what, and his amazing portrayal of that subtle emotion along with the beautiful effects and scenery combines to make this one of the best movies of the year, and hands down the best sci-fi. I pre-ordered the DVD and can hardly wait for it to arrive so I can watch it again.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Really fun game. My son and I can't stay off this game. Very exciting waiting on the babies to be born.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Over all a good book.  I would have liked to know what was in the picture though. Maybe this will come back up in a later book.
0553296981|5.0|Anne is brutally honest and insightful. Well translated, well written. By turns humorous and tragic. A classic for a reason.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I like playing hidden object games but this has more talking than play time. It was free so I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoyed playing it. Some levels are harder than others but that's what makes it interesting. Would recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It would be nice if pressing return made the next line visible.  Also, using an apostrophe to show possession shouldn't be an error.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I love Adele and her music and love all the songs on this CD. I ordered a new one. But after opening I don't think this CD is new. It was not sealed although it was in plastic wrap. I am going to exchange it for a new one. That's what I paid for. Not used! and also I can tell it been played before because there is a slight crackle in the background, and it's not my speakers.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|downloaded for my very intelligent 2year old grandson but i couldnt even figure it out. i wouldnt recommend.maybe if you have much time....to figure it out..
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Wait for this to come out on TV, it's a big disappointment. Watch the original three if you are looking for a Die Hard fix.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love the Weather Channel. It was the most accurate of all of the apps available. Now with all the new and improving they've done,it will tell me that dry conditions will continue even though it's pouring rain. The map doesn't show the clouds producing the rain and the temperature is about 10 degrees off.  And what's with the rewards?  No matter what they give me, I don't want to use this app anymore. Lame.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|See subject line. This movie is more suited for preteens. I was expecting some measure of entertainment, and didn't really get any. Save your money.
006224454X|3.0|I enjoyed the premise and the way the story unfolded. Unfortunately, the 'surprise' was predictable and a bit of a let down -- but until then, it was a good read.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Saw this maybe 8 months ago. It still runs thru my mind. When American Idol came along last a season, I was also struck by the young man who could not speak well at all, but man, he could SING like Caruso. The 'stupidest judges ever'- told him he just wasn't cool enough. Really mean /and stoopit.<br />Anyway, this is a beautfully made movie, anyone with any feelings for the imperfections in most of us will see the simple/impossible,yet true miracle. This film makes you want the good guy to win, even if he is of royal (bloody) British blood. Its believable and gives hope to anyone who has a this affliction.<br />It shows, again, to never say no to unconventional therapies. And it shows a  big secret, that the King of England himself, could not keep for long. Talk about pressure to just stop stuttering..<br />He wakes one morning, and against all odds, he is next in line and IS THE KING OF England.<br />Best movie in a long time. This year is better, for movies that is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Still enjoying this series immensely. I love how everyone intertwines with each other, upstairs and downstairs. Oh! I may have to watch that series when I've mowed through this one!
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|I saw these guys first in a Rolling Stone review which if memory serves was positive. I youtube'd Secular Haze (different album) and was completely drawn in. I bought the Infesstissuman album and played the **** out of it. Finally I threw in the towel and bought this one.<br /><br />I didn't like it at first for whatever reason but it slowly grew on me. Now I love it. I think these guys are way underrated and my only fear is that they will quit for whatever reason like The Darkness. The theatrics, the humor, the great musicianship imo - it all fits together brilliantly.<br /><br />Also I never thought there would be anything better than ABBA coming out of Sweden but these guys are def. in the running.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me:Minion Rush is a very awesome game! I play it all the time over and over again and I can agree that it's WAY BETTER THAN TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY SURFER!!!! Its not too hard to learn and good for all ages! &lt;3
B003YL4LYI|5.0|it was an amazing feat to have written these books - the characters become as real as any classic i have ever read. i am waiting on dragon scales for the next.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|A beautiful story, beautifully written. Have now read all kate Morton books one of my favourite authors, can't wait for the next book.
B0089LOG02|5.0|i had never even hear of &#34;orphan trains&#34; which operated at the beginning of the last century. Who knew that children were shuttled from the northeast to the midwest, put up on blocks and treated like cattle at auction? Anyone could choose any child and no questions were asked. They became immediate parents, and the children were taken off to whatever fate awaited them. But the book did have a happy ending. It only goes to show that those who have little appreciate much.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|An excellent facility that allows you to keep documents, pictures, etc., on the cloud and access them from wherever you happen to be, provided you have Internet connection. Kindle Fire owners get 5 GB of space.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You have to try this game , it so awesome , good have you try it you won't so playing ;c trust me !
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great great way to shoot a gun.I like how you reload and how the bullets go empty...AWESOME! I love it so Much.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The first time I played the game it was so scary it's a game that will just scare you and won't stop no matter if you put the settings to make the game less scary won't help I would think kids 10 and up should only buy scary also very fun
B00821PCJS|3.0|So, this looks like an interesting premise, and I like the actors. I usually like post-apocolyptic fiction, but two things have me convinced not to pursue this series. One, I'm sort of tired of watching series where we are ALL GOING TO DIE O MY GOSH IT'S SO DIRE. Which is not really Falling Skies' fault, so if you're not tired of that yet, give it a try. And two, I realize this is the fashion these days in cinematography, but enough with the stupid shaky hand held camera work people! Tripod. Look it up. If the audience is getting a headache from trying to focus on the screen, it distracts from the story. Really.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great sigma novel. If you like books with a good mix of history and science give this series a try.
B009MO5E10|5.0|We liked this movie a lot and I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift because he liked it so much. He's also a thrill seeker and avid cyclist so...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At school I always have a game to play at lunch time or in the morning when I'm bored, and this lasted me everyday for about a month until I found a new &#34;I'm bored app&#34;
B009DCOU9S|5.0|this game is more fun than the first one....and the hidden items are a little harder to find.....I would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game ever. I like all the characters the gifts. I will rate this game with all the stars
1741799449|3.0|It is a pitty that Lonely Planet didn´t do a separate guide for the two countries. The book is good, althogh it takes few risks in the choice of the places to visit as it is usual in LP books.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|for the price this is a steal i sharpened my mtech 117 and barly ranmy finger across and cut my thumb open and allifelt was alight presure i didnt evan notice i was cut untilli saw blood great peace
B00DU74U74|5.0|I decided to watch this mostly because I had always been curious about it. I thought it would just be another flick for me to watch. But from the very beginning this movie had me thinking about how I would act in such a situation. No I did not read the book, but I don't car about what differences there between the book and the movie. A movie is a completely different animal than a book and some things must be left out.<br /><br />  That being said, this film is one of the more thought provoking films I have seen in a while. The over lying theme of forgiveness takes you on a journey through your own moral self, and the musical score is perfectly tuned to this. A must see film.
B006S01GH2|3.0|Quaint &#62;&#62;&#62; visual feast &#62;&#62;&#62; interesting characters &#62;&#62;&#62; plot meanders &#62;&#62;&#62; second act doesn't live up to first &#62;&#62;&#62; gets confusing in third act &#62;&#62;&#62; by the end I didn't care as much
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|The cast is excellent, and if you are an admirer of Marvel comics superheroes, this should be one you might like. Lots of action and special effects, but without substance.
B001DUDKEY|2.0|This movie was very confusing.  You did not know what was going on and who was supposed to be with whom.  Overall I would not spend my time watching this movie unless you want to be confused the whole time
1400069807|5.0|Did not believe I had not written a review of Michael Moss's 'Salt Sugar Fat:How the Food Giants Hooked Us'.  I was certain I had, but...<br /><br />Perhaps, it is because I was so favorably overwhelmed by the dirth of information contained therein. It seemed that each page made me that much more aware, sometime shocked, sometime not...by the food industry and those entities that support and maintain such unscrupulous, power hungry, dollar $$$$$$$$! driven, manipulative forces.<br /><br />I have personally praised and recommended this expose to anyone who will listen!<br /><br />Because of its content, this is not a page turner.  One needs to 'digest' (no pun intended) the content and revelations set forth on its pages.<br /><br />You will become a better shopper, a better eater, and pro active in your choices.  It might even prompt you to write letters, speak out, and use the  power of your dollar to sustain yourself and your family with good and responsible food choices.<br /><br />You will view food consumption in an enlightened fashion...making better choices.<br /><br />Michael Moss does not guide or attempt to steer the reader on how to live or what to eat or what to buy.  What Michael Moss does is inform..it then is up to us to take the right steps.
B000MV9026|5.0|I gave Happy Feet to the local library as part of a kid's gift basket. The winning child loved it, and it was a super price for me.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|LOVE this book an everything else she has written!!!! I also got all my coworkers to read them!!! kept us on the edge of our seats!!!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|One of my favorite solitaire games, now an app &  with so much more than just playing golf solitaire.  The gophers & commendators are a hoot.  Not so terribly hard, but very challenging to keep you interested.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast player works great with my 2013 Macbook Pro 13\\" and older Vizio 42\\" HDTV.  Set up was easy.  Only problem  is slow internet speed and disruptions from Charter Cable.  As for the player itself - no problems.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Its finally answered!.after two books of hoping it was not true and wondering if there would be a twist that will right all wrong, we now know the truth. Yay. If you haven't started the series yet start it NOW!
B0018CMJSU|4.0|In the middle ages there was the moral tale - a way of nurturing good moral living. The Godfather tells such a tale, except from the dark side...  there is good and bad... one cannot sell one's soul to darkness without dire consequences.  That's a moral tale in my book.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game was fast playing.  There were great selections  as to the layout of the game and the colors  we're bright and easy to see. I look forward to playing this game for many hours....
B000GCFG7E|5.0|As usual... serpentine plot, believable character and lots of action. For a Reacher fan - does not let down from the previous novels. As usual, hard to put down as Reacher finds himself in tough situation after sough situation. Most enjoyable read.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game was too hard to figure out. I didn't know how to open it or make it do anuthing
0375869026|5.0|All classes were required to read this in my grandchildren's Intermediate School. I usually give most of my books away but this is a<br />keeper.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I played throughthis twice and there are 2 ending leaving inaba with the murderer behind bars and leaving inaba with the Tv world collideing with the real world and the you turn the innocent lives into Shadow ppl because the murderer wasnt stopped
B008602KQI|4.0|An evil tradition is portrayed in fascinating style with superb acting.  it is not suitable for the squeamish, but I heartily recommend it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is a great movie.  I was very surprised at how good the actors sang.  Great movie, definitely worth the purchase price.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I did not have the same issues as other reviewers did, with item placement sensitivities - things responded as I expected they would, and I haven't had problems with gameplay. That said, I'm glad I got this game as the FAOTD. A lot of the puzzles are overly simplistic, and I agree with others that there is just too much chitchat. Still, it's a longer game than I was expecting, and it's not unenjoyable.<br /><br />Some of the characters bear an uncanny resemblance to current celebrities and actors. I could swear one is modeled after Lindsay Lohan, and another looks like Sandra Bullock; there are others whose faces are familiar, but I couldn't quite put a name to those. If you decide to give this game a try, see if you can figure out who I'm talking about.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I liked the show, but the books are beyond wonderful. Powerful, emotional...I feel like I'm there. I could read 30 of these. Bravo!
B00C6B9PX4|5.0|A choice possession is this. Great value from Amazon. Sits alongside other great BR collectibles. Just hope a 4K version is not coming out :-)
1468179993|5.0|A good book if one needs help making sure they are giving the best presentation possible. I like that it used the TED talks as a model.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love love love this app!!!!!! Keeping this as my favorite  !!!  I seriously recommend this app to kids, adults, even old people!!lol passes the time by :) hope that helps
B008C20TDG|5.0|Very interesting and inspiring.  I was able to read it in 1-2 days. I feel they give enough tools to be successful.  Just wish there were a way to print the meal maps from the kindle version (there might be but I just can't figure it out). On day 4 and my inflammation has decreased and my blood sugar levels are WAY better!!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|three and half stars. Fun for a quick game. I like the  challenge of the timed games as well as the graphics. Not a traditional game format.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|ive played this game before and its really fun but it just keeps loading. I let it sit there for like 15-20 minutes and it still wont load. PLEASE FIX!!!
0385349947|4.0|I bought this to check it out. I was expecting the book to be full of a lot of fluff. Bu I was willing to navigate the fluff. I enjoyed her candor. She admits her inexperience at times. However, she also uses her facts ,well. This brilliant  young woman wrote a book worth reading.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Fun to use.  Easy features, nothing fancy.  I use it mostly to just goof around so I can't really give you a full-on professional review.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|The movie started out in black and white and small screen. This they carried to long. The story is good the acting is fair at best. I would have been upset if I spent $20 to see this in the theater.
0765365278|4.0|This book is a very slow introduction to a series that seems to show a great deal of potential. The world is a dark and gloomy place where civilization has corroded and seems to have regressed to petty feudal lords killing one another for power. Constantly hinted at is the thought that the world is nearing another Desolation, disasters that wiped out much of humanity numerous times in the past. Worse still, the world was saved those past times by the Heralds who have now abandoned mankind to its fate due to the indescribable torments they suffer between Desolations. Now mankind is on its own, disunited, and nobody seems aware of the pending doom.<br /><br />When I say slow I mean slow. The most involving combat of the whole book comes in the fist chapter. Sanderson has set up yet another brilliant set of magic rules, but since none of the leads have such powers yet he cannot make use of them. In this and so much else it feels like he is simply setting up for future books and not focusing on this one. The first half of the book in particular is a problem. Nothing happens and the characters seem distant. The most sympathetic one, Kaladin, has a long backstory that we don't get to see played out after the halfway point. Instead of seeming noble he just comes across as selfish and mopey. His backstory really should have started sooner to avoid this impression. I don't doubt that if I reread it again he'll seem much better, but when you don't care about the most sympathetic character until halfway through the book your first time there are problems. The other characters are less gripping. Dalinar is a self-righteous lord with no humor and an over-evolved sense of honor and Shallan is a selfish noblewoman with an occasionally amusing wit. They're both fine, but they're not the kind of character that really draws you in.<br /><br />Something that I am noticing the more I read Sanderson's work is that he is one of the best at setting up overarching stories, threats, and mysteries, but he is far less adept at creating the underlying plot to hold all this together. In this he is very much like Robert Jordan whose [[ASIN:1857230760 Wheel of Time]] series he completed. I very much want to know about the voidbringers, and heralds, and whatever else is lurking in the background to rear its ugly head. But to get even the first hints I have to read through a thousand pages of soldiers fighting over chasms and people debating the same thoughts endlessly in their heads without taking action. There had to be a better way to focus the plot than this! I'm not against long books, but I believe that every story has a natural length. This book could easily have been half as long and said just as much. There is a great deal in here that I cannot understand and seems to be included so that it can make sense in retrospect when he writes the inevitable sequels. This includes several chapters following one-off characters who are far away from events elsewhere, usually don't do anything, and advance the plot not at all.<br /><br />I had originally intended to give this book a much lower rating, but I did want to finish it just so I could say I had. And at around 2/3 of the way through the book finally starts to pick up steam. The last 1/3 of the book realizes a lot of the potential that the series offers, and even if the final fight isn't epic enough to justify 1,000 pages of setup, in the end the book does satisfy after spending so long disappointing. As I said earlier, Kaladin gains some character development that fully justifies his arc and the setup for the next book seems truly compelling. It's enough to close this book grippingly, but not enough to elevate the rest of it to five stars. Maybe future books will be better with much of the backstory out of the way. I suspect that he'll use them to simply add more backstory, but I remain hopeful.teries, but he is far less adept at creating the underlying plot to hold all this together.

1463707606|5.0|I bought this for my son. He has been doing origami for a couple years now and this book has helped him enter into a whole new aspect of it. He keeps paper in my truck so when we are in transit he can work on different projects. Highly recommend this for someone with an intermediate skill set looking to move to the next level.
B00005AQE8|5.0|To this day this album still gets regular spins. It never gets old.<br />Probably the greatest album from the greatest artist from the greatest label.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the game! Entertaining time kill. Never saw a movie but game is making me want to see it. Enjoy!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|The characters were so well drawn, and strongly reminded me of people I knew, that I had to see how it all turned out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I can't wait for more rooms to become available.  Level 10 was the hardest level, but not too bad.
