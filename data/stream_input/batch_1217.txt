B0028R3NCU|5.0|I had one of these in mexico while i lived there for 2 years on a keychain. They are well made and super convenient. I never had a problem the entire time with it reading or breaking. They are really convenient and small for college students, and i like the fact that its a reader for the micro sd cards so you arent limited to just this, you can put in your phone memory for photos music etc, or just keep word docs and school stuff on it. Great buy, good product. Like all things i imagine it wears with abuse, but i have this and keep it on my keys now too and its no problem.
B005E8KQPM|5.0|I'm only writing this review to offset the low rating this album keeps getting from people. Any REAL fan of Opeth has known for the better part of this year that this album would contain practically no metal. Stop acting so surprised once you've heard it. This album and fantastic and beautiful. Mikael has even said himself that this album would probably disappoint some fans looking for his trademark death growls. He even stated in an interview with Decibel that this was basically a \\"F**k you!\\" record. My hat is off to these guys. If this is the direction they choose to go, I'm on board.
0316017930|5.0|Our teenage daughter loved this book and since she is not a fan of non-fiction, I had to give it a try.  I was amazed.  This book is infinitely readable and captivating.  Besides the thrust of the book which is how timing, location and luck provide a helping hand for some people to find success, there are also lots of historical nuggets of information as well as interesting scientific facts.  This writer makes his topic interesting and easy to read and never boring or overly verbose.  After reading this book, I decided to also read The Tipping Point by the same author.  The Tipping Point is good but I like this book much more.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Though I love Jane Eyre this version didn't move me like the one before it! The end of the movie made me want to break my dvd and trash it! Although it was really good in detail in the beginning. And the cruetly that Little Jane endured was heart wrenching. I hated this adaptation. MY DVD watched only once is for sale! Any takers??!!!!!!!!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have read many books about our wonderful Seal teams, as well as books on other Special Forces as well. This ai one of the best, if not the best I have read. After you read this wonderful book, lookup some of the followup stories on events since this book was written. Marcus has a 3000 acre ranch in Texas devoted to the recovery & healing of our returning wounded  servicemen.  One of the most wonderful  events since the book was published was  the posthumoursly awarding of the  Medal off Honor to. Mixchael P Murphy, who willingly and knowingly gave his life in an attempt to save the lives of his men. He walked out into an open area where he was able to reach headquarters with his cell phone in the middle of a fierce firefight with the Taliban. He was fatally wounded in this brave act of calling for assistance for his men. He was shot numerous times, once having the cell  phone knocked out of his hand, and he picked it up and continued his rescue call, after which he turned to continue to fight until he was fatally wounded. But that was only his  final act after fighting overwhelming numbers of enemy forces rof several days.  The other 19 sailors and soldiers who died in this operation lost their lives due to the stupid Rules or Engagement that our civilian leaders who know NOTHING about todays war on terror formulate, sitting in their easy chairs in their isolated, air conditioned fortresses back home. If the Seals had protected themselves, they would probably have been put in prison back home, instead they were killed because they are not allowed to protect themselves. Our ignorant leaders don't care that the other side kills thousands of totally innocent civilians here on our home soil, as long as not one possible civilian is  injured anywhere in the world.  The rescue and protection given to  Marcus (the only survivor) by a mountain tribe who defied the Talliban to protect him until their elderly tribal leader  walked 40 miles through the dangerous  mountains toa US base to let the military know Marcus was alive and where he was being protected by his tribe. (The military had given him up for dead) This story provides more understanding of the complex lives of the mountain people of Afghanistan than anything I have ever read.  But the most heartfelt story is what was happening back home in Texas--it shows that there are still many good people in this coundry, despite what the media tells us.  I plan to re-read parts of this book again--something I never do. The book is that good. Everyone should read this book!
1594202710|4.0|Well researched and engaging.  My only comment is that the book is less about China itself and more about Chinese diplomacy in the Kissinger era.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|Mikael has taken the gang back about 35 years, what with the retro Hammond and mellotron sound and...is that a flute?! (Yes!) This is quite a fun album, indeed, with lots of surprises to go with the usual excellent musicianship. Mikael has always been quite the riff factory, and Opeth's latest is no exception. Although the songs are generally shorter, they still retain an epic scale with rapid changes. This brevity is indeed a welcome change of approach here, and this album is probably the least repetitive of their efforts. So if a song, or part of a song, doesn't appeal to you, don't worry, you'll be hearing something very different in no time!<br /><br />Despite what some others have said, I feel there still are heavy riffs to be had here, if not as bone jarring as on previous albums. The guitar is definitely thinner but crystal clear on this release, while the bass is very up front (nice to hear Martin so clearly). The guitar solos are tasteful and of course Fred shreds slickly, if sparingly. The song takes priority over lengthy solos, in contravention of most prog rock of the 1970s. Axe's drumming has really matured and he does some tasteful and inventive things on this album (take the soft double time on \\"Nepenthe\\" for instance).<br /><br />Back to that assertive keyboard in the mix -- Now that Per is gone, I wonder if this new direction will stick? And I wouldn't freak out over the lack of death vocals on this album -- Mike's vocals have improved much over the last few years and more agreeable to my ears. I can only hope we haven't heard the last of the death growl, though!
B00003000M|5.0|I am a die hard Marley fan, and I am very pleased with this CD and every CD I have of Marley.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I was absolutely riveted by this story. Ms. Setterfield has a hauntingly beautiful writing style that will stir your soul and have you rereading some of her amazingly descriptive passages. Having said that, you cannot imagine my disappointment in slogging through the final few chapters of the story. It was almost as though another rushed and inexperienced author stepped in to finish the book! All of the questions were answered, but all of the passion and poetry seemed to have been exhausted and none was left for the very hollow final pages!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I'm 22, and I love Tony Bennett.  He puts a fresh twist to these classic tunes, and all the people he duets with, sound great.  Every single duet on here is great, and Tony sounds great!  I mean 85 years old!  I don't think any other singer is 85 and still singing as great as they did 30 years ago.  If you like oldies or want to hear good music and lyrics without auto tune, pick up this CD, and you won't regret it!
B0050PYNO4|3.0|This was a send up to sci-fi movies containing many obvious and some not so obvious references to ET, Star Trek, etc. I liked the irreverent alien, Paul, who is the center of all this. Sci-fi fans should enjoy this, but I can't say if others will. Appears that a lot of effort went into making Paul play seamlessly with his human co-stars and the effort worked well.
B00005O7RE|5.0|Mariah Carey merry Christmas is the best Christmas album I have ever heard! She is an  extraordinary vocalist with talent beyond belief especially on \\"O Holy night\\"!
1416550550|5.0|\\"Wow\\" seems such an incapable word for such an excellent, well-written, and amazing book. But wow.  Yeah, it was simply that good. It was the right mix of family and history, love and relationships, and mystery and intrigue. The characters were likeable, or dislikeable, as the case may be, and I was drawn in from the very first chapter and itching to reach the ending. Although I admittedly was sad once I did. Every once in a while you run into a novel that was so good you'd recommend it to almost anyone, and I can easily say The Forgotten Garden is one of them. I ask myself how did I not hear of Kate Morton before?  As for Morton, I could not believe how seamlessly the transitions seemed to take place from one chapter, going back and forth in time from 1900 to 2005, and many places in between. Bravo to her for that. I never lost track and the clear transition seems to becoming a lost art. Also worth mentioning was the fictional stories written by Eliza Makepeace interspersed throughout the novel. Those in themselves were well written and added immeasurably to the story itself. Sometimes in novels those added pieces take away; these in no doubt enhanced the overall story.  I just cannot believe how much I enjoyed this book. When I first picked it up, it was because the plot seemed so interesting and it seemed a fun distraction that would keep me going. It was happily both.  If I could complain about one thing, despite the fact that it had to end, it would be how wonderfully drawn out the book was - not too long in my mind at all - and how everything just seemed to come to its ending almost abruptly in the final chapters. I have no regrets on that, and maybe I would have not enjoyed the book so much if it was not paced differently, but in some ways I feel it sped up too much at the end and every revelation was coming at me all at once.  Overall, one of the best books I've read in a long time, once I will encouragingly recommend. And definitely being added to my list of favorites. I look forward to re-reading The Forgotten Garden at some point in the future and also reading the author's other books.  Again, bravo, Kate Morton. Thank you. And, yes, Wow.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|Got this as a free app of the day and was pleasantly surprised at how addictive it was to blow up fish! Definitely try out the demo because although it was playable on my mytouch 3G slide, slightly older devices like, say, the motorola droid may not be quick enough unless it was overclocked since i experienced random slowdown when I was moving too fast.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I love the fact that Mile 81 has all the elements needed for a King novel to be on the bestseller's list. But aside from that, King managed to outline how young ones nowadays are easily influenced. However I cannot help but feel like something is lacking, yes the start was as whipping as it may seem but towards the end I felt like I just went through a wall all of a sudden. Ugh!

B004132HZS|5.0|I first saw Sherlock when I was perusing through my Netflix and saw it just waiting for me to click it. So I did.   I fell hard and I fell fast for this new version of a very old character. Benedict Cumberbatch is pure perfection as the observant detective. Benedict has something about him that draws you in; you don't quite know what it is about him that captures your attention but this guy has it in spades. And whatever mysterious thing that Benedict posesses has seeped into his potrayal of Sherlock. The caustic attitude, fast paced direction, sharp wit, and clever manuevering familar stories all make this version of Sherlock the best - at least in my opinion anyway.  Benedict brings a breath of fresh air and youthfulness into the character, which has always been potrayed as an older gentleman. This time, we get to see what he would be like in this century with today's technology and modern colloquialisms.   Martin Freeman is the unsung hero of the series by being the buffer for Sherlock against the...well, probably the world. His facial expressions are hilarious and are sometimes better than the actual line of dialogue being said.   The writers of Sherlock are very clever and their ingenuity knows no bounds. The first episode titled, \\"A Study in Pink\\" is a play off the title of the original novel- A Study in Scarlet. The title synonyms are just the first in a long line of play ons the writers have done with the original stories. They keep the characters and the essential plot in place while updating it for a modern audience.   While most agree that The Blind Banker is the weakest (and they would be right), the \\"weakest\\" episode is still stronger than most of what's on tv today.   Though Sherlock is supposed to be near cold hearted and indifferent as its obvious that he lives for challenges, in the Great Game we see him shaken just a tad over some of the things that happen. His reactions are subtle and often happen when no one is watching, which is great because itsticks with the character.  Sherlock is witty, charming, fast paced, caustic, and a whole lot of fun to watch.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I would purchase this dvd again.  The makers of \\"The Pacific\\" really bring WWII to you as though you are right there in the middle of every battle against the Japanese.  This movie will make you hate the Japanese as though never before.  It will open your eyes with a clearer focus on what our soldiers in WWII went through fighting in the South Pacific.  The details are very graphic and many scenes are quite bloody.  I would not recommend this movie for young children because it is very detailed and very graphic.  It will bring the war with the Japanese right into your living room and make you feel as though you are right there in the midst of every battle on screen.  It is worth seeing.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Great acting, fun story.  Looking forward to the next season.    Dexter is evolving and it is an interesting journey. He was challenged in his belief structure and really opened himself up.  Amazon also delivered exceedingly quickly.  We were so impressed!
B000KX0IOA|5.0|If you choose this movie to view, I recommend that you pay very close attention to the many political concepts.  India was a country taken down by one man Gandhi and his revolutionaries who did not fire one shot to do it.  It is amazing how much havock civil disobedience can cause in one country.  The overthrow of an empire called England.
B005ARYEY6|4.0|But I'm deducting a star for the packaging. As the first reviewer notes, there is no safe place for the booklet, which means that any of us who plan on keeping the set for a few decades will have to either contend with storing it safely elsewhere or remembering it's there.    Since this sort of item appeals mostly to fans, completists, obsessives, cranks (and we pay for the privilege) and since both the Dylan and Johnny Cash bootleg sets did this better, I'm a little put off. Mind you, just a little, since the music is an extension of Plugged Nickel, and as such sits right at the heart of great 20th century recordings.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I just knew when Peter Dinklage was cast as Tyrion that he would be perfect for the role!  A fine actor now has a well deserved Emmy under his belt for his snarky performance.  Not bad for his first time on TV.  If you haven't seen any of his movie performances, I would recommend seeing The Station Agent.  I won't say anything more in praise of this series because I don't have anything to add that others haven't already said.  I just wanted to applaud Peter for his fine work here!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome quality and fun bonus xtras!  Now I need a surround system to hear it on!  I have no complaints; and while I think George should leave well enough alone, the changes don't really bother me.  The tweaking of the movies is insignificant next to the power of the blu-ray's stunning picture!
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|Lovato shows her pain in her songs, which have a repetitive theme of being hurt. The title is ironic because she is very broken and the songs show it. Skyscraper is fantastic--a couple others are well produced--but for the most part it's nothing special. Not an album for her kid fans--too many adult lyrics and themes. And the cutting song with Band-Aid lyrics is just weird. She reminds me of a girl on the TV show Boy Meets World who used to sing sunshiny songs until she was rejected by a boy and then she turned into a dark lyricist who became popular. Same with Lovato--all of this is very dark and sad considering what she has done to herself, and the critics are claiming it's a great album.  Buy the Skyscraper single, skip the album.
B004N66XYE|3.0|[[ASIN:B004H0ZHD4 Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary Collection]] The new and very limited series (if you can call three episodes as series) is so underdeveloped you barely get to know them.  It is well done as far as acting and sets but leaves fans of the original series wondering who they are and what are they doing with the Bellamy home.  I did not understand why they would make only 3 programs.  It certainly left me wanting much more time to develop the characters.  If you have not seen the original series you will wonder what all the fuss was about.

0439023521|4.0|While I'm not a sci-fi or adventure enthusiast, I am a fan of dystopian novels like the Handmaid's Tale and Never Let Me Go.  The Hunger Games did not disappoint.  It has just the right amount of suspense but with an interesting, character-driven story.  When I started catching on to the violent premise of \\"The Games\\", I wondered how Suzanne Collins would pull it off, but she does!  An interesting and suspenseful page-turner, it made me excited for my commute to and from work, at first slowly savoring each page, but then giving in and finishing it at home over the weekend, knowing book 2 is mine instantly via my beloved Kindle!  I waited until I was finished reading before \\"IMDB-ing\\" the cast for the film to be released in March 2012.  Excited!!
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|\\"Catfish\\" is a disturbing, sad tale of a schmuck who is sucked into an internet romance. Though there is little suspense here, you do feel sorry for Yaniv (the before-mentioned schmuck) and more so for Angela, his Facebook friend in Michigan.

B000070IXT|5.0|I always saw these covers in the video stores but thought \\"I wont like that sci fi stuff\\". Then the other night I was scrolling through channels and saw a small part of one of them and loved it,disappointed that I didnt see another episode I became obsessed with watching it.I watched all the episodes back to back. I dont know why the critics didnt rate them higher. I think Milla is fantastic and I cant see any other actress who could play Alice. The fight scenes are incredible,amd all the other characters are easy to feel attached to also. I'm glad I finally saw all the movies, I just wished I would have given it consideration sooner.I would definitely recommend these movies.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|Well, I watched The Proposal one time.  I was disappointed that such a good plot was smeared with crude actions, language that made me blush, and gross nakedness.  What did I do with it?  I threw it in the fire!

B000KIPT30|5.0|Let me start with this amp is great. It is loud and clear. This is my first behringer product ever, I didn't like behringer before but this changed my mind on some of there products (not on there mixers, I'm am a Mackie freak!)    We use this amplifier to power a pair a headphones for a drum monitor and it works well, we use a extension cable (25ft) to plug them in but I am worried it could clip because it needs to be loud. It's a shame them couldn't of put a clip light on each channel but the get very loud so it isn't too much of an issue.    Power:  When they say \\"4 powerful headphone amplifiers\\" they really mean POWERFUL!!! I was 3 yards from the headphones and it turned it up and I could hear it pretty good for being 3 yards away so thats powerful. When you are using them in a drum application you need a lot of power and this amp is perfect. I'm worried the headphones will blow!!!! Only problem is it dosen't have a power switch so you have to unplug it to turn it off but it dose have a power light.    Sound:  This amp will get very lout without causing any extra hum or his. It is very clear for being a behringer product. As it says it is stereo.    Connections:  This amp has 1/4 trs connecters for all connections (not standard 3.5mm headphone jack you would find on your iPod or computer) If your headphones have a 3.5mm jack (like on an iPod) you will need a 1/4 trs to 3.5mm adapter like this:    [[ASIN:B0002ZPFD0 3.5mm Stereo Jack To 1/4\\" Stereo Plug (Black)]]    You will need a 1/4 cable to connect it. If you are connecting it to a headphone port on a computer or iPod or something you will need another one of those adapter and a 3.5mm cable. There is many ways you could connect this. Plug it into a line-level source headphone-source   One mistake I made was I only had a mono cable (only using the left side) so it only played in the left side. Make sure you have stereo adapters and cables (balanced)     Overall:  Pros:  Powerful.  Clear. Lightweight. Compact.Cons:  No power switch. No clip light.
0345529057|3.0|I bought the 4-book set, because I had heard so many good things about the books.  The first book was fantastic.  I was on the edge of my seat, and stayed up late nights to finish it.  The characters were very real, the magic was very minimal--more like superstitious religion, and the plot really moved along at an exciting rate.  The second book was also very good.  The third book started to get annoying and plodding.  It introduced new characters, only a couple of which ever quite caught my interest, and it seemed to just get in the way of finding out what was happening to the characters I was invested in.  The fourth book was infuriatingly bloated with characters and subplots which were boring and unnecessary.  Their contribution to the plot could probably have been summed up in 3 sentences, not 3 chapters.  The action ground to a halt.  I kept wondering if the publishing house had fired all the editors, or maybe just the ones who could say \\"no\\" to a famous author.  I have no intention of reading the rest of the series.  I think I'll just read a spoiler or two online to satisfy my curiosity about the characters that had me breathless in the first book.  What a disappointment.
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|\\"Nature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.\\" An art-house movie that has some very religious undertones. When news of his son's death reaches him, Mr O'Brian (Pitt) begins to reflect over his life and how he treated his family. Jack (Penn) does the same and does what he can to attempt to restore his relationship with his father. This is not a movie for everybody. This movie is filled with symbolism and I am not smart enough to understand all of it. The first half is basically just showing life in various stages (you will see what I mean when you watch it). When it gets to the scenes with Brad Pitt it begins to pick up, but still is slow. I'd compare it to the \\"Fountain\\" in the fact that the movie seemed to be artsy & overly intelligent for the sake of being artsy & overly intelligent. When a movie tries to hard like this one seemed to do it ends up seeming pretentious. Overall, very deliberate moving and full of symbolism that was hard to grasp all of it. Not that bad but not for everyone. I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - No *Also try - American Breakdown & The Fountain
0553582038|2.0|The first two books of these series were amazingly good.  The third was good, but dragged a bit.  This was so bloated and useless.  The characters you care about from the beginning of the series are not written about.  New characters that are boring and do not do anything for the plot are introduced.  (Who cares about the Ironmen?!).  I thought this was going to wrap up the series, but it just was filler used as an excuse to write more books and make more money.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yeah, lots of bad reviews on this one from the movie-snobs. The ones who think they somehow own the rights to these films. Star Wars, and everything about it, belongs to the artist named George Lucas. He can do whatever he wants to his creation and I like most of his changes. The sand-pit creature in \\"Jedi\\" is cheese-ball, but I can overlook it. The original 3 movies are just as fun to watch, and I am a HUGE fan of the prequels. Someone called them the worst sci-fi? Seriously? Wow. I find them epic and visually stunning. Anyway, I'm very much enjoying this set and the movies look and sound great on blu-ray.
0312427999|1.0|\\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is in my view  sad, dangerous and dishonest. It is sad because the author attempts to explain and interpret economic developments without even the minimum understanding of economic theory. Naomi Klein distorts the views of economic theorists like Friedman; she mixes up schools of thought and their positions and importantly, she has not the slightest understanding of what a market economy, i.e. the object of her critique is and how it functions. Thus, her book is polemical in the extreme and it lacks any acceptable economic analysis. The author tries to compensate this by providing details and examples, but her lack of conceptual understanding prevents her from arriving at any viable conclusions. This  book is dangerous, because it potentially achieves the very results that she criticizes the market capitalist system for. All in all, this book amounts to little more than far-left conspiracy theory. It is miles away from honest analysis and interpretation.

0380018179|4.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br /><br />I first read \\"The Thorn Birds\\" in 11th grade, as, according to my U.S. history teacher, \\"every lady in America\\" was doing at the time. From what I remember seeing in dentists' waiting rooms and on the nightstands in the houses where I babysat, my teacher was right. This book was huge in the late 1970s. I remembered enjoying it and I've been wanting escapist stuff lately so I thought I'd take another look. I enjoyed it again, but was a little more attuned to its oddities and faults this time around. I don't normally like to go into too many plot details in reviews, but because the plot so colored how I felt about the book, I am doing that here.<br /><br />\\"The Thorn Birds\\" takes three generations of the Cleary family from Wahine, New Zealand, to an enormous Australian Outback sheep station called Drogheda to London in 1968. Meggie, the main character, is four when the story starts in 1915 and the only girl in a poor rural family of six children. Her father Paddy is an itinerant farm worker who emigrated from Galway. Her mother Fiona is the scion New Zealand's wealthiest founding family. The eldest Cleary son Frank is dark, angry and different from his red-headed younger brothers and sister. Only out of love for Fiona do Frank and Paddy control their dislike of each other. Fiona, cut off from her family and its wealth but clinging to the dignity, manners and a few material remnants of her genteel upbringing, bears some secret sorrow and never displays emotion of any kind. This puritanical, hard-working, tired family never shows much affection, leaving the hyper-sensitive, volatile Frank as Maggie's only source of emotional comfort.<br /><br />As Meggie reaches age 10, the Clearys' lives change when Paddy's elder sister, Mary Carson, invites Paddy to manage Drogheda in New South Wales. Mary, a wealthy childless widow, promises Paddy he will be her heir. When they arrive at Drogheda, the Clearys are greeted by the startlingly attractive local Catholic parish priest, Ralph de Bricassart, who forms an immediate bond with Meggie. Father Ralph, who once dreamed of rising to great heights in the Church, has been sent to the Outback as punishment for having insulted a bishop. He has been working on Mary Carson for some time to try to get her to leave enough of her vast wealth to the Church so he will win the approval of his superiors and escape his rural purgatory. However, Father Ralph comes to so love Meggie and her family that he sets those plans aside.<br /><br />After the Clearys have worked at Drogheda at low pay for several years in anticipation of of their inheritance, Mary Carson throws a great birthday party for herself. Meggie has developed a crush on Father Ralph, and he knows it. At the party, Father Ralph sees that Meggie is no longer a child but a beautiful young woman. That night Mary, who is furiously jealous of Father Ralph's love for Meggie, gives Father Ralph a new will and tells him to open it after he sees her dead body but before he buries her. Father Ralph meets Meggie outside the party and they share a passionate kiss, but he tells Meggie he can never leave the Church. Mary dies later that morning. Father Ralph must decide whether to make known the new will, which leaves Mary's property to the Church instead of the Clearys but gives the Clearys financial security for life, or let stand Mary's old will, which left all her property to the Clearys as promised. Father Ralph, realizing that Mary's bequest will return him to the Church's good graces and clear the path for him to realize his ambitions, chooses the new will, cheating his beloved Meggie and her family of their rightful inheritance.<br /><br />Prior to Mary's party, Frank had, after a confrontation with Paddy in which it is revealed that Paddy is not Frank's biological father, run off with a troop of traveling professional boxers. After the party, Ralph leaves the Outback and moves up the Church hierarchy. Paddy and Meggie's favorite remaining brother Stu meet a gruesome death in a bush fire. This leaves Meggie emotionally alone at Drogheda with her aloof mother and her surviving brothers always off working the vast sheep station. Luke O'Neill comes to Drogheda to work as a stockman (more or less a cowboy in American terms).  Meggie marries Luke because he somewhat resembles Father Ralph. Luke, a miserly man, only wants Meggie's money. Luke takes Meggie to Queensland and takes control of Meggie's money, then hires Meggie out as a servant to a kindly couple while he goes off to travel the country working with a gang of sugar cane cutters. Luke tells Meggie he is saving to buy them their own sheep station in Queensland. Meggie bears Luke a daughter she names Justine, but Luke doesn't care. As Meggie realizes that Luke loves having money in the bank and has no intent of making a home with her, the marriage grows worse.<br /><br />The couple for whom Meggie works arrange for Meggie to go off by herself to a honeymoon resort without Justine so she can think about her future. When Father Ralph comes looking for Meggie, the friends send him on to the resort, where Father Ralph and Meggie consummate their passion.  After Father Ralph leaves, Meggie knows she is pregnant. She returns to Luke and sleeps with him one more time to alleviate suspicion that the child could be Father Ralph's. Then she tells Luke she is leaving him permanently and going home to Drogheda. Because Luke resembles Father Ralph superficially, most people, including Father Ralph, never guess that the son Meggie bears, Dane, is Father Ralph's child.  Meggie remains at Drogheda, refusing all potential suitors. She holds to her memories of her few days with Father Ralph, and lives out her days with her aging mother and her brothers who never marry.<br /><br />From this point the book meanders. A lengthy chapter covers the adventures of Meggie's younger twin brothers in World War II. Fiona tells Meggie that she knowsDane is Father Ralph's child, and Meggie and her mother become closer. We learn that Frank (who has, while offstage, gone to jail for murder) is the son of a married Maori politician with whom Fiona was in love as a teenager.<br /><br />Justine rebels from her time in the womb and directs irrational hostility at Meggie and Father Ralph (who remains a family friend while his career takes him up to the level of Cardinal and a post at the Vatican in Rome). Dane adores Meggie and Father Ralph and is near-saintly. Justine goes off to Sydney and then London to pursue an acting career. Dane enters a seminary in Rome, under Father Ralph's sponsorship, to become a priest. A German friend of Father Ralph's, Rainer, becomes enamored of the prickly Justine when she comes to visit Dane in Rome, and pursues her carefully for years. Father Ralph intervenes and gets Frank out of jail after 30 years. Dane dies shortly after his ordination, after rescuing some people who were in danger of drowning. Dane's body is brought back to Drogheda for burial, and Meggie finally tells Father Ralph that Dane was his son. Father Ralph dies in Meggie's arms at Drogheda. In London, Justine marries Rainer.<br /><br />Sorry, that was a lot of plot talk, but I think it serves to illustrate what's right and wrong with \\"The Thorn Birds.\\"<br /><br />Up until Meggie leaves Luke and returns to Drogheda, the story is for the most part engaging and thematically consistent. Author Colleen McCullough has her strengths. She creates a wonderful sense of place. Her descriptions of the lushly verdant, gentle New Zealand and daily life in  bitterly harsh Australia are unforgettable, if somewhat overlong at times. Her powerful writing occasionally attains elegance. The stories from Meggie's early childhood hook the reader on the characters and make us what to know about their pasts and their futures. She creates intriguing and/or sympathetic characters in Paddy, Fiona, Frank, Meggie and even the single-minded, selfish Luke. Mary Carson is an entertaining spider of a deus ex machina. Some people fault Meggie for being bland, but I think she's actually rather believable even though many women today would tell her, \\"Get over it.\\" Meggie has not been brought up to think she deserves or should expect much out of life. She describes herself as an average woman who wants average things: a husband, a home, children. Following her mother's stoic example, she takes the crumbs she gets with little complaint. Her ordinariness is, I suspect, a big reason \\"The Thorn Birds\\" was so wildly popular in its day. The slow softening of Fiona's armor and the revelation of her past is fascinating. The book raises some interesting questions about the nature of faith, and why some men are called to make the sacrifice of manhood that the Catholic priesthood demands. In light of today's scandals about the Church moving child-molesting priests to other locations rather than treating the problem or removing them from the priesthood, the episode in which Father Ralph disciplines a priest who has got himself entangled in an affair with a woman by shipping him off to the remotest part of Australia is telling--just send the problem priest elsewhere.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Thorn Birds\\" also has some gaping problems. Too many questions are left unanswered about the other central character, Father Ralph. What did he do that so insulted the bishop that his career was derailed into the Outback. More important, why is he so ruthlessly ambitious for advancement within the Church? If, as he says, he feels like a holy vessel, why does he need to be a cardinal? Couldn't he serve just as well as a parish priest?<br /><br />There is something undisciplined about the whole undertaking. Does McCullough want to educate us about life on outback sheep stations and in Queensland sugar cane country, or tell a story about her characters? We read dozens of pages about distances, gates, weather, dust, flies, birds, plants,sheep, and the smell of sugar processing plants. Some of that effectively sets scenes and illuminates the toughness of these people, but it gets boring after a while. Why do we spend all that time off with Meggie's younger twin brothers in World War II? Why does Meggie have so many brothers anyway? Other than Frank, the gentle Stu, and Hal who dies as an infant, it's hard to tell one from the other. Why do we spend so much time on the career and love life of the unpleasant Justine?  Why do we spend so much time getting to know Frank, and then he is, in a manner of speaking, kicked out of the book? The episode in which Paddy and Stu die and their bodies are dragged through the mud back to Drogheda goes on and on in gory, sticky, slippery, sweaty detail and seems unrelated to the theme of people giving their lives, through death or living death, for a moment of perfect joy. Meggie endures too much pointless tragedy for credence: her rowdy brothers destroy the beautiful doll she receives for her fourth birthday; her father runs her best school friend out of town after the girl gives Meggie head lice; Meggie loves a man she can't have, marries a man who could care less whether she's happy, and loses the men who do love her--her father, Frank, Stu and Dane. Little effort is made to have the characters speak in different voices.<br /><br />I don't mind that this book does not have a happy ending. Romance novels with happy endings are a dime a dozen. Romance novels with unhappy or ambivalent endings seem to endure--look at \\"Gone with the Wind\\" or all those \\"fallen woman\\" classics like \\"Madame Bovary\\" and \\"Anna Karenina.\\"  But I do think \\"The Thorn Birds\\" has the wrong ending. It would have been better had it been restructured to reveal Fiona's past earlier, to flesh out more of what happened to Frank, to eliminate all the material about Meggie's children's adult lives, and to end when Meggie returns to Drogheda for good. \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is more than OK, so I gave it 4 stars. With McCullough's raw talent as a writer and storyteller, it should, however, have been better.

B0018QOIXU|2.0|I ordered this CD after recently hearing some Adele songs.  This CD has won Adele awards, but I must say, I prefer \\"21\\" over \\"19\\".  In any case, her style and vocals are truly unique.
B00007BKVC|4.0|There seems to be confusion on versions here. I bought a copy from a reseller and thought I was getting the special edition but I didn't. I got the regular version without the documentary.<br /><br />What added to my own confusion is that there is only one instance of this movie on DVD, and Amazon doesn't have \\"Special Edition\\" in the title. But the product description says it IS the special edition.<br /><br />To add to the confusion, the user submitted images show both regular and special editions of the DVD.<br /><br />So I guess I'll talk about the version I have - the non-special edition version. At least the version I got has some special features. Two commentary tracks. One by the director Ridley Scott, the other by Susan, Geena and writer  Callie Khouri. I was hoping for a bit more insight into the writing, but there was still great stories that they told. With my audio setup, I noticed that the left channel had both Geena and Susan's voices clear, but the right channel wasn't recording Susan Sarandon's voice. Turning up the volume I could hear here in the background, but her microphone most certainly was not coming through my right speaker.<br /><br />The problem is the same for the writer. She is ONLY heard in the right channel, not at all in the left, not even at full volume.<br /><br />Ridley Scott gives an awesome commentary track. The only downside there would be it sounds kind of echoey, like's he's in a big living room.<br /><br />The film transfer looks fairly good however, there is some black space on the far left edge of the screen. I hope that doesn't mean the image was shifted to the right and some is cut off. My guess is that's the look of the full film space because that would be where the audio track would be placed on the film.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are nice. They are isolated from the film and you can view them all at once or view them individually. They also play the footage that was kept in the final film at the beginning and endof the cut scene to give it context, very nice. There are 16 deleted/extended scenes in all.

0439023521|5.0|I am just finishing the last few pages of the last book in this 3 book series.  I picked up the Hunger Games thinking my teenage daughter might like it.  I brought it home and perused the covers, then sat down and read the first few pages...then couldn't put it down again.  I had to scramble to find the remaining two books because I had no idea when I purchased it, that there were two more, ugh...but, Amazon delivered those quickly enough.  They are mesmerizing, a great fast read.  I can't remember in my half century, when I have been so enthralled with a book, if ever, let alone a 3 book series.  I highly recommend this book series.  I've loved all three books tremendously and am sad there isn't more.  To be so lost in a story that holds you on that you can't put it down is rare.  I do however disagree with one other review that stated the story was gruesome in nature.  It's a book about people trying to save themselves and their world, with a young female adult at the helm of the storyline. A girl who is immature, naive, and sassy.  It is not a Steven King horror novel, nor is it as horrific and distubing to read as one reader described.  It is an easy and enjoyable read for young adults to any age.  Hope you agree.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well, once again George Lucas has decided to milk his cash cow known as Star Wars.  As a Star Wars fan since childhood, I was looking forward to finally seeing Star Wars on Bluray.  After hearing about the changes he has made once again, I refuse to purchase this set.  Why did he feel the need to tweak these movies once again? It's like drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa.  I hate 90% of the changes that Lucas has been making to these films ever since he re-released them as the Special Edition Trilogy back in '97.  In the movies I saw and loved back in the 1980's, Han shot first, Ewoks didn't blink, Sebastian Shaw was the ghost of Anakin, and Darth Vader didn't have to say NOOOOO!! before he threw the Emperor to his death.  I don't even consider these films to be Star Wars anymore, at least not as I remember Star Wars.  The only reason I can think of to purchase this set would be to get the bonus features, most of which I suspect is probably available on YouTube if you look.

B005COO1X6|2.0|As a longtime King fan, I personally felt this story wasn't worth the 3 bucks they charged for it.  The villian is like a combination of villians King has used to far better effect in some of his other novels.  The characters are compelling as usual but are given far too little print space to really develop.  Worse still, 20% of the kindle pages are just a teaser for King's upcoming novel.  My advice: save your $3 and wait for it to come out in a collection.  It is not a worthy read as a standalone story.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I have been looking forward to this CD since first hearing Skyscraper in July and it does not disappoint! The CD has a mixture of songs; some are fun and upbeat, some are inspirational, and others just a good idea for a song. I like all of the songs, but my top favorites are In Real Life, Together, Hold Up, Skyscraper (including the Wizz Dumb Remix), Unbroken, Lightweight, Give Your Heart a Break, and All Night Long.   The only disappointment (in my opinion) is that Rascacielo (the Spanish version of Skyscraper) was not included in the album. One can download it from iTunes (or listen to it on YouTube), but it's not in the physical album.

B005CM9DX6|2.0|It's not metal, it's technically not 'progressive'...so...what is it? The only element inherent within this album that appears to warrant a 'prog rock' tag is the obvious King Crimson influence (among others I'm sure) as evidenced by the jazz-centric riffs, mellotrons, and random flute solos. However, where King Crimson was innovative and insightful, truly a breath of fresh air, \\"Heritage\\" sounds like a band attempting to emulate the haunting beauty of their prog rock predecessors, but falling way short of the mark.<br /><br />The more listens I give \\"Heritage\\" the more the nonsensical repetition and soulless meandering irritates me. Upon first listen I thought the album was great (4 stars perhaps) and expected the listening experience to exponentially improve, but instead found that greater attention to detail revealed many weaknesses. The compositions are tepid, aimless affairs and the entire album plods along at a snail's pace. The 'progression' feels forced and uninspired, as if Akerfeldt is trying way too hard to do something different for prog rock's sake. An interesting exotic instrument will occasionally make an appearance, but kick around just long enough to remind you of its presence and then depart, barring any sense of inspiration or purpose. Additionally, I was hoping the lyrics would at least be thought provoking, but unfortunately, no respite; from 'Folklore': \\"Hey you, will you be true/When you can see through what I do/Feel the pain in your brain, insane\\". The vocals are no better, not because they are clean, but because much like the compositions, instrumentation, and musicality, the vocals do not excite the listener (not me at least) and often sound like a generic, emotionless radio rock band's front-man.<br /><br />However, I greatly enjoyed the opening/title track, 'Heritage', where the solo piano effectively establishes mood and then abruptly ends without dragging. I sincerely wish the rest of the album stuck with that formula. 'The Devil's Orchard' incorporates a nice jazzy drum riff and syncopated rhythm; a stand out track. On the other hand, 'Marrow Of The Earth' is the definition of disposable like many songs on this album; nothing interesting or conclusive, just filler. Honestly, the entire album could be mistaken as a laborious jam session recording.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Heritage\\" is a self-serving album that consists of exactly the kind of material Akerfeldt presumably wanted to make, which is admirable, yet will inevitably end up splitting Opeth's loyal fanbase. I admire artists who don't pander to an audience and seek to please themselves first, however, I fear this album will end up satisfying very few. It's not particularly enjoyable from either a technical or pure enjoyment perspective (for me at least), but it could be worse. Needless to say, this one won't be staying in my collection for much longer. Alternatively, Arch/Matheos' \\"Sympathetic Resonance\\" is an excellent example of progressive metal that utilizes complex, intellectually and creatively stimulating compositions without relying on the old exotic instrumentation crutch; highly recommended.s a nice jazzy drum riff and syncopated rhythm; a stand out track.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|Change comes hard for some people - and there's nothing wrong with that. However, people seem to be reviewing Heritage for what it isn't, namely Black Metal, instead of what it is, namely Modern Progressive Jazz Fusion.    I'll just say it - I love this album. I love this direction that Opeth has taken. Yet for all it's unique differences, it is still Opeth through and through. Only it's an Opeth that uses Mikael Akerfeldt's considerable vocal talent do something amazing. He actually sings. And boy does he sing.    Metal is good and all that, and I love Blackwater Park & Ghost Reveries as much as any other human, but there is something to be said for artistic growth. If this is the direction Opeth is taking, than I'm on board.

B00005JN8Z|2.0|This movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. Robert Taylor, Peter Ustinov, etc. couldn't act thru a paper bag. The sets and the color are some of the finest I've ever seen, but with 2011 eyes, this is a joke. Ben Hur blows this movie out of the water.
B004G6009K|3.0|The story of Rapunzel is one of my favorite Grimms' fairy tale. The original story and many of its variations are quite dark. In the original story the prince calls for Rapunzel to let down her hair and sees her on the sly. One day she lets slip that her dress is getting too tight around her waist. (She's pregnant.) Gothel, the woman who kidnapped Rapunzel, traps the prince when he returns. He falls from the tower and lands in thorns, either blinding him or killing him outright depending on which cultural interpretation you read.<br /><br />Now I don't expect Disney to tell a story like that. It is Disney after all and the lost princess must remain virginal - while at the same time having an unusually close relationship with the animals around her. And, yes, the guy she loves in Tangled undergoes a life-changing (literally!) experience in the end. But for all that, I didn't like this movie as much. And I wanted to like it because as a writer I see a lot of potential in the basic story of Rapunzel. Rapunzel empowered<br /><br />First, this movie came apart for me at the level of the story. There were good parts to it, but overall the story didn't do it for me. I liked many elements but once again I felt as if I was watching another formulaic effort from Disney. Captured/lonely princess. Check. Evil grandmother/stepmother. Check. Funny and helpful animals. Check.  Handsome single man comes into her life. Check. Beautiful background and story boardinng. Check. But there has to be more than that. We've seen all this before. There has to be a story that grabs us. We're not all eleven year old girls, Disney. Come on. Get out of the rut.<br /><br />Perfect example. In the beginning of the movie Rapunzel's mother is ill and needs a magic plant to heal her so Rapunzel can be born. But in the original fairy tale the mother needs lettuce (sometimes it's parsley) and the king makes a deal with Gothel in which he hands over the baby to save the life of the queen. Now that's pretty dark right there. Even if he is motivated by saving the life of his queen, and must be forced to make that choice, Disney doesn't tell it that way. In this retelling, Gothel steals the baby from its crib. We lose whole subterranean plots and motivations in this one move. Gothel kidnaps the baby because she's evil and greedy. It's Disney. Of course she is evil and greedy.<br /><br />Finally, for the prince, in which this case it's a lovable thief, well, he serves the same function as all other love interests in Disney animated films. He's a plot point. Albeit a funny one in this case, and one in which Disney worked to flesh out -- but still a plot point. After all, Rapunzel has to eventually give her virginity to somebody, and it's not going to be that chameleon that rides her shoulder or Maximus the palace horse. Thus, we have the prince/thief/substitute-male figure who comes into her life in order to round out the story.<br /><br />As far as the character of Rapunzel herself, I did like her a lot. She went through the motions we expect her to and we're on her side. The sight gags of her doing things with her hair were funny and the running gag with the frying pan was cute. We like her and we want her to win her freedom and her love in the end. But the story that surrounds her doesn't click. It's not the story that allows her to find true happiness, it's Disney that makes it come true. Just like always. And so the movie loses a lot of its impact right there because we are never frightened for Rapunzel. Come to think of it, we are never frightened by any Disney movies anymore. Which was not always the case. Disney used to have a reputation of showing some fairly dark things on screen. Or at least stories that demanded, and gave, emotional investment and experience.<br /><br />We don't get that at all with Tangled.<br /><br />Part of the problem, I think, is the animation. Sometimes it is absolutely gorgeous...and sometimes we are taken aback by how bad it looks and the jerks and stopRapunzel gets tangled in Tangleds between scenes. To be sure there are many nice scenes (from an artistic perspective) in this film. The scene where the dam bursts, the dance in the market square, the flight of the paper lanterns all stand out. The clothing and texture of trees and stone and water are phenomenal. But the characters themselves...well, sometimes they look kind of rubbery. Like walking dolls made out of wax. I was disappointed in that. If you're going to go the limit to make clothing have proper texture, and move correctly upon the frame, then why not make the skin and shading on the characters more realistic as well?<br /><br />The music was another big let down. None of the songs were memorable. Even Rapunzel's healing song doesn't stick with you, and that song, more than any other, ties the arc of the film together. Most of the humor works and some falls flat. But that's Disney and that's their trademark and they're not going to let it go no matter how much we groan. At least we see some effort at background and characterization for many of the secondary characters. That helps round out many of the other flaws.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the one character that really stands out (and takes the stage away from Rapunzel when they're together) is Gothel. This is where Disney shines.  If there's one thing Disney knows it's \\"evil stepmother\\" and how to represent her as a multi-facted and three-dimensional character who is cruel, cunning, and manipulative. As much as I like Rapunzel, and the idea of story potential about Rapunzel, as a professional writer I am here to tell you that a story about Gothel is much more interesting. But, once again, we are limited by Disney and the parameters they set up for every film they make. We will never see a story about Gothel, or Rapunzel for that matter, the way it should be told from Disney. It's not what they do.<br /><br />As I said earlier I really wanted to like this film. But there's too much missing or awkward about it, or worse yet, formulaic. Tangled was billed as the 50th animated film by Disney. In all that time they have made groundbreaking strides in the technical department. But the story of Tangled is like every other Lonely Princess story we've seen from Disney and that, more than anything else, is why I can't recommend it.To be sure there are many nice scenes (from an artistic perspective) in this film. The scene where the dam bursts, the dance in the market square, the flight of the paper lanterns all stand out. The clothing and texture of trees and stone and water are phenomenal.

The music was another big let down. None of the songs were memorable. Even Rapunzel's healing song doesn't stick with you, and that song, more than any other, ties the arc of the film together. Most of the humor works and some falls flat. But that's Disney and that's their trademark and they're not going to let it go no matter how much we groan. At least we see some effort at background and characterization for many of the secondary characters. That helps round out many of the other flaws.  Not surprisingly, the one character that really stands out (and takes the stage away from Rapunzel when they're together) is Gothel. This is where Disney shines.  If there's one thing Disney knows it's \\"evil stepmother\\" and how to represent her as a multi-facted and three-dimensional character who is cruel, cunning, and manipulative. As much as I like Rapunzel, and the idea of story potential about Rapunzel, as a professional writer I am here to tell you that a story about Gothel is much more interesting. But, once again, we are limited by Disney and the parameters they set up for every film they make. We will never see a story about Gothel, or Rapunzel for that matter, the way it should be told from Disney. It's not what they do.  As I said earlier I really wanted to like this film. But there's too much missing or awkward about it, or worse yet, formulaic. Tangled was billed as the 50th animated film by Disney. In all that time they have made groundbreaking strides in the technical department. But the story of Tangled is like every other Lonely Princess story we've seen from Disney and that, more than anything else, is why I can't recommend it.
B004AYCWZI|1.0|I was excited to read this book because I have traveled in India and love anything about it. This book, however, was a real disappointment. My first clue that it wasn't going to be a great read was the way the dialect was written - I live in an area with a large population of Indian immigrants so I don't have to rely on my memory to recall their speech patterns, and this author has got it wrong. The characters sound more like a mockery of the accent than the lovely and elegant tones and lilts that I hear in their speech. I truly hate it when authors go off base with something that basic to the novel - it makes me feel disrespected as a reader.<br /><br />As for the story, parts of it are fascinating, but the author fails to give the reader the depth or broader picture of the historical events. I know this isn't an historical novel, but as reader, I expect that when an author invites me into an event that is life changing for the characters, then the event will own a significant part of the book.<br /><br />The book is basically written for *foodie* readers, and in that aspect the author delivers, but the characters got lost in the menu at times, and some of the significant issues, such as the first Indians establishing lives and businesses in France, were glossed over and even dropped later in the book.<br /><br />I won't read another book by this author which is too bad. He presented fascinating characters in an interesting setting, but he didn't deliver the meat (yes, that's my attempt at a pun) of a good novel.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I love this movie. The blu-ray factors are amazing on my l.e.d. t.v. I love all things blu-ray and I love this movie. Do yourself a favor.
B0017APPSE|2.0|I bought this movie prior to seeing the Tudors which I recently bought and LOVE and way after Elizabeth.  I know about poetic license but this pushed the envelope so far into make believe that I find it unwatchable now.  The Tudors like Elizabeth both used poetic license BUT with superior writing and a stronger reference to history.  Mary Boleyn was not the quiet, virginal (I don't want to go to court) girl portrayed in this film.    Eric Bana is pure eye candy and the costumes are well done.  After that there isn't much more to recommend this film.  I did read the book and also found it to be poorly written fiction.
B0041D843M|4.0|As the other reviews will tell you, this is a book of potentially immense value in fighting the diseases of affluence that plague Western culture. Honestly, I would like very much for the authors' conclusions to be proven true. I have a few questions, tho, about points that were not thoroughly supported or addressed:<br /><br />1. Is there evidence that a vegan diet must be very low in fat (10%) to be healthy? Unless I have missed something, all the high-fat diets studied were animal-based, and all the low-fat diets were vegan. Do we know that a vegan diet with a fat level of, say, 20% would not be as effective?<br /><br />2. The very poor, very rural areas of China with high vegetable, low animal, and low fat consumption must differ in many ways from Western society. For instance, do they have far less air polluton, cleaner water, less exposure to hormone disrupters via plastics, household chemicals, and agricultural chemicals? Minimal consumption of modern medicines? Non-hectic lifestyles? Can all of these influences be discounted?<br /><br />3. There must be tens of thousands of long-term vegans in North America who could be studied. A well-designed study would go a long way toward proving or disproving the author's thesis.<br /><br />I have not reread the book to confirm that I have  not missed something. If I have, please leave a comment and let me know. Thanks!

0439796644|5.0|This story is fantastic. It is about a horse named Joey who gets taken away from his owner (Albert) and is sold to the military.  Joey goes through hard training , battle, and losses and remained a sturdy work horse.  Even though the book is told from the horse's point of view, you get a great amount of details about the people around him.  There is also a big question: will Albert ever find Joey again?Through Joey we receive a message of hope and the search for peace  in the midst of a battle field. \\"The author\\", Michael Morpurgo is superb in his historical accounts of the use of horses and the role of the cavalry during W.W.1.\\"I would recommend this book to people who love horses and history.

0060763280|1.0|T. Harv Eker present a case that the secret to wealth is solely positive thinking.  Few would dispute the value of positive thinking, yet the book is severely hindered in three areas.  First, its essentially a collection of cliches.  Second, although positvie thinking is an ingredient in most successes, its hardly the only ingredient meaning the book is severely lacking.  And third, the book is littered with comments blatantly promoting the author's financial seminars resulting in a book with an agenda focused on further sales rather than content.<br /><br />If you need to hear things like \\"your money can grow only if you do\\" and \\"choose to think in ways that support your success\\" for you to achieve anything you really need to question your inner motivation. Yet the book is a constant barrage of meaningless cliche's like this that add no substance at all.<br /><br />If mere positive thinking truly was the only necessary ingredient to financial success then nearly everyone who picked up this book and thought positive would become wealthy, but that just doesn't represent reality.  The author would have you believe otherwise and even goes to the extent to suggest that focusing on anything other than what you want is a recipe for failure.  This of course is the same mentality that causes financial problems such as credit card debt by those who focus only on what they want without regard for the repercussions.  Positive thinking is important, but so is having the maturity to live within your means.  Suggesting positive thinking is the only secret to wealth is like suggesting you can make it to the NBA by simply having the courage to shoot the ball.  Of course you need to shoot to score, but you need to develop skills to shoot well enough to succeed, and this book ends without ever addressing any real action plan.  Adhering to the notion that thought alone represents skill cheapens the value of attributes that align with entrepreneurial success or disciplined investing; neither of which are easy but both of which require a lot more than just positive thoughts.<br /><br />The issue with this type of book is that its aimed at the lowest common denominator.  Its not easy to curb spending, its difficult to invest well, and its downright hard to make an entrepreneurial dream materialize.  Yet its easy to think positive, and thus books that suggest that is the only ingredient cater to those unwilling to cope with reality or are looking to rationalize their own laziness.  Is that really what you are looking for in a book?<br /><br />Financial success is achievable, but despite this book's claim it is not easy.  If you prefer the comforts of easy answers and one sized fits all ideas then you might as well buy the book, vote down my review, and join the sect of society of happy go lucky thinkers awaiting success based merely on their thoughts.  I suspect most folks here are intelligent enough to see through the folly of this and thus I recommend passing on this book entirely.  There is an abundance of financial books far superior to this that offer a more sensible approach to financial success.are easy but both of which require a lot more than just positive thoughts.

B005LY4B0A|2.0|Fun but screen locks up frequently on my Droid X.  Developer needs to review and provide fix.  Frustrating when you have to turn screen off and on every minute.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Movie-wise, the director wasn't that great. To my taste, he relied a little too much on Star Wars-esque flashiness and spell-shooting. Then toward the end, he wanted to cut short the important death scenes (Fred!) and lengthen the cheesy ones (Bellatrix!). But disc-wise, I'm thinking, \\"Really? This is the last movie of the entire series, and they wanna sell it on ONE disc?\\" I guess wait til the last minute and see if they release something a little more hefty to give it a proper send-off...? O.o
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Wow - first I have to say I am surprised at how many people slammed this movie! Lots of people saying how it was just for kids... well surprise surprise it is an animated kids movie!  For those parents struggling to find a great, fun to look at and listen movie for the kids that has no profanity or inappropriate jokes, this is it!  The vivid tale of a rare blue bird (blu) raise in captivity so doesn't know how to fly, goes to rio to meet the matching pair of rare blue bird to keep the species going.   Very cute and as a mom, I was loving the rhythm and music myself! Rented it but will def buy it
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Headphones are not meant to be run from crummy jacks.  I realize most people would never consider this, but considering how ubiquitous headphone listening has become, it's an essential fact we should share with others.  Furthermore, most good headphone jacks aren't even designed with the ability to properly drive the majority of headphones that are low impedance.  That's startling.<br /><br />I'm astonished at the measurements this headphone amp just produced through RMAA and how good the waveforms look in TrueRTA.  At the price this is going for, I recommend the E7 for anyone with good headphones.  Everyone.  If you own a good pair of headphones (or more than one pair), buy one.  Used, new, refurbished.  Just buy one.  Heck, it even makes cheap bundled earbuds sound better, which tend to suffer from severe bass roll-off (even more than is inherent to them) and unnatural highs directly from most laptops, home receivers, and portable players.  As bad as those earbuds are, it's curious how improved they are with this.<br /><br />Aside from its limited maximum output into low sensitivities AND high impedances, its performance is as-good or better than the Grado RA1, and you get a somewhat decent USB DAC and two whole separate headphone amps in the E7.  The digital volume control also has no significant channel imbalance at ANY SETTING.  Fantastic.  Like most headphone amps that have AC/USB and battery options, its performance is slightly better on battery power.  Both the jacks on top are independent, with only a slight reduction in some performance as they share a common power supply section.  That reduction in performance when both jacks are used is mostly less than when you're on USB power, by the way.  Even on USB power and with both jacks in use (which might be a good idea for some headphone pairs since the batteries can only supply so much current & swing at a time at high volumes), the performance still beats any other mass-produced competitor at this price level... and that's just comparing the amp section.  Seems like a no-brainer.<br /><br />The analog input apparently wants Pro Nominal (1.25V) or less to perform optimally, which is probably above 50% on Windows volume control with the Emu 0204 line output that is itself a little over 2V at 0dBFS, but I haven't tried boosting it in tiny increments to determine what the best level is yet.  82% on the Windows volume is the maximum for me to prevent overt distortion with a normalized signal, but the E7 surprisingly soft-distorts in the areas between 82% and 50% (1.25V is somewhere right above 50%, I think).  That's really good distortion characteristics for the aux analog input if you do accidentally go over Pro Nominal.  Try not to, but it's interesting to note it's a bit forgiving in that regard.  You still get significantly better measurements at or below Pro Nominal, it just doesn't distort quickly or terribly like, say, my old Biamp DJ mixers did when pushed marginally beyond that.<br /><br />This gets to my one criticism: the firmware could use an upgrade to add an input meter or clipping indicator.<br /><br />When using the USB DAC, just put the Windows volume control at max (if it's not bypassed automatically like on mine) and make sure the program you're using doesn't clip in the digital domain.  The non-ASIO 16bit/44.1-48khz Wolfson DAC in the E7 is not the last degree of detail or refinement and is maybe a touch warm over neutral, but it's got welcome intimations of the ever-mysterious PRaT and does the job better than those on most (probably nearly all) built into laptops and cheap sound cards.  It's a distinct and welcome difference from the Emu for some content and headphones in spite of its crudeness and lack of pedigree.  Hey, it's a sub-$100 amp & DAC combo.  Think of it as a bonus.  Since few laptops have dedicated line outputs, using the USB DAC does become a requirement to get the most out of the E7 amplifier if you do not have a better DAC, as otherwise you will be limited to the performance of not only the laptop's DAC, but the headphone amp in there, too.<br /><br />The E7 can drive any impedance headphone properly, even the lowest impedance ones.  If you need more volume on very insensitive AND high impedance headphones, the E9 (or E7 + E9 docked combo if you want to use the Wolfson DAC) is a solution for more brute output at a reduced performance.  Start with the E7, though.  It is true that for lower sensitivity and/or high impedance headphones at a higher price point, the playing field opens up and the E9, though competitive, isn't the automatic option.  And do not buy or use the E9 for low impedance headphones, as it's not designed for that.  If you have one of those expensive, hard-drive-based mega-capacity iPods in a similar form factor, then an E7 and an iPod line-out to 3.5mm dongle could be the easiest purchase decision you've ever made.only the laptop's DAC, but the headphone amp in there, too.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Sure it's a pretty film. The greens are really quite stunning, but that's all I can say about this film that has any sort of positive resonance.  Hal Jordan is a whiny, reluctant hero whose only real super power is the ability to annoy the viewer with his wishy-washiness.  The plot is about as thin and improbable as it gets--and that's with the full understanding that I'm talking about a super hero-based universe that doesn't really exist.  There are plot holes with enough gravity to create their own singularities: not even disbelief can be suspended by their power.  What little action takes place is short and scattered, little islands of activity floating in a sea of dull characters, bad writing and a serious lack of contextual consistency.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I bought this book not knowing much about it but being very intrigued by it just from the small excerpt that I got from the discription and I must say I was very pleased. At first I was a little disappointed because it turned out to be different from what I imagined it to be but was soon pleasantly surprised by the story line. It encompases everything you would want from a good book. Mystery, romance, thrill, magic, and imagination. This was definately a book that I was sad to see end but couldn't wait to finish. I only wish I could find more books that would keep my attention and devotion like this one did.

B00020X88O|5.0|First of all, I would like to start with a brief view of Showgirls.<br /><br />This movie is a total classic in my eyes.  Back in 1995, it was supposed to be taken as a serious drama that showed the seedier side of being a showgirl in Las Vegas.  When told that his movie was given the infamous NC-17 rating, director Paul Verhoeven said it stayed as is so not to compromise his vision.  Whether it was because of this \\"vision\\" or not, the movie was universally panned by critics and audiences alike.  It wasn't until about 10 years later that it started to get the notoriety that it has today.  Thanks in large part to VH1's digitized bras version, Showgirls reached a much larger audience since it was able to be broadcasted on standard cable.  Today it is probably our most current camp classic.<br /><br />Now, this particular box set is simply amazing.  No longer are we looking at this movie for it's dramatic purpose.  Well, maybe we are, but only because it's so bad it's good and has given us such classic quotes as \\"I'm a dancer!\\" and \\"I'm getting a little old for that whorey look.\\"  This box set knows it and gives you a set of shot glasses, drinking games, a poster of Nomi (topless) and pasties to play \\"pin the pastie on the showgirl.\\"  With these props, you are able to enjoy Showgirls the way it has grown to be excepted, drinking game and camp comedy.  There are honestly times that I pull out the box set just to show people what is inside.  For those who have seen the movie, they beam giggles and appreciate its camp.  Others who haven't seen it just marvel in it's splendor and almost universally say they need to watch it at some point.<br /><br />One suggestion, watch Showgirls before you buy this set.  Obviously I am a fan of this gem, but it isn't for everyone.  If you fall in love with trainwreck of a movie the way I have, this box set is for you!
0749942010|5.0|[[ASIN:030771652X Sister: A Novel]]This book was selected by my book club and was not the nice sweet story I expected from the title. Turned out to be an enthralling mystery.  Very well written and could not put it down.  Recommed this book if you are a mystery buff like me.
0307887898|5.0|I regard this book as a great lesson in SPEED and ACCURACY - two things essential to the success of startup or anyone who wants to get their products in the hands of customers. [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]] is the antidote to wasted time, wasted money and useless innovation (products and services no one wants.) For most entrepreneurs, including myself, we follow our instincts, become very attached to our ideas, or when we finally test our value proposition customers feedback is disappointing because they aren't as excited or receptive as we would like them to be. If you want them PAYING CASH and funding your product development this book is worth the read.  Think about it; everyone knows, or thinks they know what people want. Right? But you don't.  Think about the last few birthday gifts you received.  How many of them did you really want and how many of them are gathering dust or returned?  At its core this book is about market testing and although I've done marketing research and testing many times Ries's approach with the Minimum Viable Product, (MVP) and Validated Learning takes market tests to a level. You may have ideas about \\"what\\" and \\"who\\" and \\"where\\" you want to innovate, but before you build that concept Reis advocated you break it down into its smallest testable products and then get customer feedback from your targets. If testing your MVP means going face to face, door to door to get feedback from 15 to 20 people - that is much cheaper and faster than building an expensive prototype with all the bells and whistles.  Its become very difficult to find out what the customer didn't want if you already build in 10 features a product with everything you \\"think\\" the market wants. Speed to test is the key and in the process that will give you the data needed inexpensively to know what to build and for idea 2.0.  If you are testing your assumptions (at first) and measuring the right metrics, your innovation will move through a scientific process that Reis calls validated learning. Validated Learning is the other major concept discussed in this book and if you follow this process you'll avoid fooling yourself with what he calls Vanity Metrics.   Actionable Metrics are measures of real customer behavior and drive the scientific process to support Innovation Accounting, not to be confused with standard accounting.     The AUDACITY of ZERO - I have to say I thought this was a great way to explain this concept - Big resources and big numbers can be deceiving because of how and what gets measured; too many illogical connections can be made and vanity or just plan self-deception can cloud judgments about the new innovation.  Having SMALL numbers to work with (few prospects, customers and sales) can pour cold water on an innovation and if you are not measuring the right things could be bogus too. If there isn't enough hard evidence to support what works and doesn't work because you are only looking at prospect v sales you might not be looking at the right thing, yet. Each innovation, whether it starts in an established company or a basement workbench, starts at zero. Zero is a great place to be because you can test each assumption and test each hypothesis along the way for the true measure of value to the customer - it's completely honest; there is nothing to contaminate the data if you have clearly defined your hypothesis and measured your results scientifically.  I think there are two concepts that need to be acknowledged here:  The first is the concept of incremental improvement, grandfathered by Dr. W. Edwards Deming a consultant and statistician the United States sent to help rebuild post WWII Japan. He fathered, documented and implemented the idea and the Japanese took it on and made it their business and cultural philosophy known as Kaizen [[ASIN:0761129235 One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way]].  Reis is obviously a believer as one of his favorite references is Toyota and how they have become the world largest automaker, largely by small, incremental steps.  The second concept that Reis acknowledges is his idea of market testing, i.e. MVP and Validated Learning came from Direct Response Marketers and A/B testing [[ASIN:1440511845 The Ultimate Marketing Plan: Target Your Audience! Get Out Your Message! Build Your Brand!]]. This has been around for a long time, but I believe no one has put it into a context as simple as Reis has in [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]].   The short and sweet of this book is that if an entrepreneur simply throws out his or her idea to see if it works or not she will succeed. Because she will be proven right, it either worked or it failed. Success, right? But that isn't really the goal is it? An entrepreneur wants their product to succeed, fill a need and make a profit. Testing Minimum Viable Products (MVP)s and measuring results against predetermined assumptions will quickly guide you to what sells, to whom, at what price, how it should be sold and delivered. Minimizing build-out time and speeding up your profits.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yes I was a little skeptical at first of buying this blu ray set because of all the negative reviews on this site. But I used my own judgment and purchased this set anyways and I'm glad I did. The cover looks beautiful and the Box itself is well constructed. The picture quality is very nice and clean except for `New Hope' too much grain there but the audio kicked ass. Very nice (reference material)... I think Lucas and crew did an outstanding job remastering these series and also did a good job of including some of the deleted scenes and adding new scenes. I think Amazon should not let people write reviews if they have not purchase this box set yet.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|Bought this movie last week off of amazon.  The movie is great, saw it in theaters. The problem is the random pauses since I've placed the blue ray disc into my PS3. Seriously?!  I payed good money for this movie and I can barely watch it correctly.  These moronic security fixes don't stop hackers and just punish honest people that pay for movies.  Next time I'm just going to rent a movie from amazon instant play and avoid the film companies completely.    Here's a tip if your having this issue.  Just disconnect your ps3 from your internet connection.  Film is great nonetheless. If you don't want to deal this this nonsense I suggest you just get it through amazons on demand.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was a little hesitant about buying this set after seeing so much negative press on here before it was even released but decided to go with \\"the force\\" and see for myself and I am glad I did.

There are several 2D scenes so don't start freaking out thinking your tv broke or something.  If you didn't like the movie in 2D your not gonna like it in 3D either... just the nature of the beast I suppose.  I really liked the movie, I hope you give it a try.

B0052GACNM|4.0|Dear Music Appreciator,<br /><br />Here are some reasons to buy this new album by Tony Bennett:<br /><br />- You're already a Tony Bennett fan - that makes this kind of a no-brainer right?<br /><br />- You're already a fan of any of the artists singing duets with Tony Bennett on this album.  If you're a Lady Gage fan for example, and if Tony is good enough for Gaga, than he should be good enough for you shouldn't he?  If you're an Amy Winehouse fan then surely it will be a treat for you to hear her final performance.<br /><br />-  You bought the original DUETS album and played it till the songs had worn record album grooves into your brain.<br /><br />- You currently own, have owned in the past, or plan (or hope) to own in the future...your very own tuxedo.  Extra points for actually wearing the tuxedo.<br /><br />-  At some point in the past you think you may have left your heart in San Francisco (or any other major metropolitan city for that matter) - remember, Tony Bennett is the kind of guy that can relate.<br /><br />- You posses patience and an attention span born of a bygone era (the iPod kids might get bored with this album once the contemporary star novelty wears off).<br /><br />- You already know and love the songs here and would appreciate the chance to hear them sung as duets between a classic, master singer in the beautiful sunset phase of his career and more contemporary stars  who respect the h. e. double hockey sticks out of the classic, master singer.<br /><br />-  You would appreciate the chance to hear Tony singing with the woman chosen by Rolling Stone Magazine as the greatest singer of all time - Ms. Aretha Franklin.  Their duet together on this album is sublime and masterful.<br /><br />- The beautiful Carrie Underwood takes your breath away a little and you would welcome the chance to hear a simple and simply beautiful performance by her and Tony Bennett - their duet is the most natural, lovely, devoid-of-star-baggage performance on the album.  Somehow Carrie manages to sing it like a freshly discovered talent that no one's heard of before - she and Tony seem to serve the song and not their egos...<br /><br />- You are the kind of person that enjoys filling a room with a romantic, swoony atmosphere.  Press play on this album, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and drift away with a drink in your hand or with your arms around someone you love.

B000059MEK|5.0|Not too long ago I purchased the Daft Punk-Interstella 5555 DVD, and I enjoyed it very much. Mostly, I enjoyed the Daft Punk music and the visual animation was just accompanying eye candy. I had a problem with the audio portion of that DVD in that the music sounded very subdued on my stereo, not at all like the electronic music I was used to listening to. I advised that if anyone was primarily interested in the music, to opt for the Discovery CD rather than the Interstella 5555 DVD.I still stick with that advice.<br /><br />Well. I've now got the Discovery CD and I enjoy it very much. It's just an exceptional collection of songs. The CD sound quality is much better than on Interstella, but still not up to my expectations for Daft Punk. My previous experience with the Discovery songs was with the Daft Punk Alive 2007 CD, I might add, and the sound quality on the Alive 2007 CD is far above that of the Discovery CD. What goes? In any case, the earlier Discovery CD is a wonderful listening experience. Every song is a winner and it would be hard to pick a favorite. It's that good! Sweet, sweet music! If you really want to hear some of the songs decked out with exceptional sound, opt for the Alive 2007 CD.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
0345505387|3.0|First off, whose the new character? That was really confusing to me.  The colors used by the artist are rich and mysterious and quite lovely IMO, however, I am not a fan of stylized drawing be it human or animal and truly Jamie just didn't begin to look like the Jamie I picture him to be.  I have a book cover from the Outlander from when it first came out back in the day and on it is a picture of Claire holding the reins of a white horse that is fabulous and also on the back over is Jamie, side view, with a white shirt & brown vest by several standards (flags) & a Celtic cross.  This is amazing artwork and how I wish the same artist had done this graphic novel. I believe the person who did the artwork for the original book cover truly \\"got\\" the essence of Jamie and Claire.  The outside front cover shows Claire in a mirror on a table covered with an assortment of things.  So, while the Exile was dramatic it just doesn't say \\"Outlander\\" to me.  Just because it's Diana's is reason to own it for me but you know it sat around here for months and months before I even just now am forcing myself to read it and look at the pictures which leave me wincing because they are not the faces I associate with any of them. Since we have owned horses for over 30 years do find their depiction irritating.

0439023521|5.0|This is such an engaging, fun, and easy read.  I was captivated after the first page and couldn't put it down!  Collins did an amazing job balancing the brutality of what these Hunger Games entail and the interweaving of the human emotions involved in the main characters.  You instantly feel collected to Katniss and fall in love with Peeta.  I bought the 2nd and 3rd book a few chapters into this book!
0545091020|4.0|Suzanne Collins tells us that The Hunger Games trilogy was inspired by twin causes in her life: the pain of living while her father fought in the Vietnam War, and the Classical story of Theseus and the Minotaur, which resonated deeply with her psyche. This makes sense. My first impression, however, was I was reading an episode of the TV reality series Survivor, cross-bred with Golding's Lord of the Flies.<br /><br />I was about 20 pages in when I rolled my eyes and thought, \\"Great. Not another dystopian novel.\\" I'm starting to miss fantasy and science fiction where we get a glimpse of a good future. Recently, I've read Gibson's Neuromancer and Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl. I thought I'd just about had enough of icky post-apocalyptic futures, thank you very much. But I trudged on.<br /><br />Imagine a future where a rich city-state (\\"The Capitol\\") controls the thirteen districts that once comprised the United States. The story's Heroine, sixteen-year-old Katniss, is from district twelve (formerly the Appalachian range), where the populace is forced to mine coal. A thirteenth district was obliterated by The Capitol in the years that led to its dominance.<br /><br />As a form of punishment, the capitol puts every child between the ages of 12-18 into a lottery, where one boy and one girl from each district might be selected to compete in The Hunger Games. These games are really a death match between the 24 combattants; the last child standing is crowned the Victor. This is a form of punishment from the Capitol, to tell each district that they can, and will, do anything they like. The populace of each district are subjected to nonstop slave labor. The Capitol can, and will, do anything to dissentors--up to, and including, killing their children. Some premise, huh? You are sure to guess what happens: Katniss is ultimately selected to be the female champion from District Twelve.<br /><br />So far, I don't sound like I enjoyed the book much. Don't get me wrong: I did. I liked the story, and the love interest with the male champion from Twelve (his name was Peeta) was just innocent enough to captivate me. Katniss's wonder at the extravagance and excess of The Capitol was enjoyable, as well as the series of small victories that led her to be crowned Victor. (You didn't think she'd actually lose, did you?)<br /><br />Still, a few things detracted from the story. Katniss seems to go into times of desparation that pass \\"in a minute, or an hour, or a month.\\" Collins's description of the heroine's food was not-quite-erotic, full of \\"plump berries bursting juice into onto my eager tongue\\" and distracting. In general, thought, the writing was solid, if a bit melodramatic. Thematically, the novel seems to beat a tired drumskin: a plucky arrow-shootin' girl makes good, and shows the whole country what she's made of. It's a good, but not a great, exemplar of this plot. Still, I admit, it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />I saw that some people compared it thematically to Macbeth. Yeah. Right. I recently read where author Jim Butcher said \\"[writing comic books] is to novel writing as monosodium glutamate is to classical opera.\\" By no means is The Hunger Games simply a comic book. Neither, I think, should it ever, ever, be misconstrued as on the same par with Macbeth.<br /><br />I realize the third novel of The Hunger Games trilogy was just released. I have read it, and will review it soon. These things take time.  For now, suffice it to say that the Hunger Games was an decent, if a bit imperfect, start to a good story. Soon, let you know what I think of the rest of the series.<br /><br />Four of Five Stars.the male champion from Twelve (his name was Peeta) was just innocent enough to captivate me.

0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is a rare book, it is a book like no other, one that will stay with you for years after reading it, and will bring you joy every time you think about it. All I can say about this book is that I am very glad that I read it. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is like an oasis full of hope and life energy situated at the very center of a burning desert. The novella is short and written like an old fairy tale or mythic story, it details the spiritual transformation of a young shepard named Santiago that occurs after he meets an old mystic sage in the streets. In order to undergo the inner alchemy Santiago has to give up everything, just as the Buddha did, as the novel teaches the very simple truth that it is only when you give up everything can you have it all. I will write the prologue to the book here, it is short and sweet and always reminds me of the essence of the novel:<br /><br />`The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus. The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was called the narcissus. But this was not how the author of the book ended the story. He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty tears. \\"Why do you weep?\\" the goddesses asked.<br />\\"I weep for Narcissus,\\" the lake replied.<br />\\"Ah, it is no surprise that you weep for Narcissus\\" they said, \\"for though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could contemplate the beauty close at hand.\\"<br />\\"But... was Narcissus beautiful?\\" the lake asked.<br />\\"Who better than you to know that?\\" the goddesses said in wonder. \\"After all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to contemplate himself!\\". The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said: \\"I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.\\"<br />\\"What a lovely story\\", the alchemist thought.

0545091020|5.0|This is one novel that deserves the popularity it enjoys. Wow, is this book good!<br /><br />The main thing that makes this such a favorite is the suspense that Collins has woven in. I could not stop listening to this book! I kept trying to find more things to clean around the house to justify listening to it for \\"just another hour.\\" Of course, that hour turned into two hours, which turned into three hours -- needless to say, I finished this one very quickly and my house was sparkling for a couple of days. There is never any part where the reader's emotions are allowed to rest. Like Katniss, I was always on edge, waiting for her next challenge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. This makes it a fast read. Also, since it's told through Katniss's eyes and the storytelling is excellent, I was completely involved in the story from start to finish.<br /><br />Haymitch is by far my favorite character, with Katniss being a close second. I thought all the characters were wonderfully done. I got a sense of each of them without being told exactly who they were, what they did, and what I should think of them. Collins lets us draw our own conclusions by giving their personalities through Katniss's eyes and letting the characters' actions speak for themselves. I think this envelops all of the book, actually. She doesn't dumb down the writing just because it's young adult. It's complex, teaches lessons without being didactic, and (better yet) doesn't talk down to the reader.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciate is the realism Collins brings to The Hunger Games. Problems don't magically disappear and there isn't any forced happily-ever-afters. It's violent, brutal, and dark. Those who are squeamish will have a hard time with this story, but I think it's worth it. For one thing, the violence isn't there for shock value, as is the case for some novels, unfortunately. Rather, it's a statement about the government of Panem and what these people are forced to live with. I like that the characters are forced to work through their problems and actually deal with issues. It makes for an interesting story, the characters are allowed to grow and change, and it reflects the real world. Problems don't just disappear.<br /><br />The narration of the audiobook is also excellent. McCormick is so talented at infusing her words with emotions and getting the pacing exactly right. The voices for each of her characters are easy to distinguish, even if you're listening to it in the background. Her rendition is so well done, in fact, that I found myself pausing in my chores to just listen to her tell the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to everyone. Yes, there is violence, yes it is dark, but these are parts of the message The Hunger Games holds. This is one book worth reading.to work through their problems and actually deal with issues.

One of the best apps I have ever seen for a smart phone.    It was really cool to find a syndicated morning talk show that was discontinued in our area.  With this, I can just stream it now.  5 stars.  I plan on buying the pro version if it is worth it.

B005DZMP00|5.0|As a collector of DARK STARs, I pre-ordered Vol 2 the instant I learned that CD 2 begins with a DARK STAR...so the rest of the package doesn't matter (as much) to me.  However, I will say, every song on CD 1 is quite good, with crisp and clear sound.  Because the tracks were cherry-picked (each a fine choice) there is virtually no sense of \\"continuity\\" on CD 1, almost no between-song ambience; and because so many songs are crammed onto CD 1, there aren't too many JAMS, save for the last track, Playing In The Band.  Also, the song The Greatest Story Ever Told ends with a superfine Jerry solo.  As for the DARK STAR beginning CD 2, I must say, it is definitely one of the most BEAUTIFUL Dark Stars I've ever heard.  I'd actually call it astonishingly beautiful.  Even though it's relatively \\"short\\" (just under 20 minutes) that's OK because it's followed by a 30 minute OTHER ONE, with a juicy jam all its own.  Vol 2's \\"booklet\\" is virtually useless, so I would suggest this: do you have a stray Grateful Dead CD that you love and would \\"fit in\\" well with Europe 72 Vol 2?  If so, replace the useless booklet with said CD, and voila! You have a 3 CD package.  Specifically, you might consider the \\"single show\\" May 4, 1972 concert at L'Olympia Theater in Paris.  That show has a magnificent, 40 minute DARK STAR which has unsurpassed jazzy greatness.  Or, if you're feeling a bit more adventurous, I STRONGLY recommend the DARK STAR from the Rotterdam, Holland show of May 11, 1972.  The entire CD 3 is Dark Star!  And a real, real good one, too.  Statistics show that the Rotterdam Dark Star is THE longest Dark Star ever recorded....about 47 minutes...and all great.

I can see why some orignal fans of the Kid may not appreciate too much this more \\" mellow repitoire of cuts.\\" For me I judge on what I hear on the CD itself not past or future possible directions . It has to be one of the most immediately likeable cd's I have ever listened to ..NOT one weak track.   Maybe there are some country aspects to it but so what. I like to describe it as upbeat modern American music that makes you think of highways prairies interstates good times bad love booze etc etc or to put in another way music that symbolises the \\"stars and stripes minus ghettos and business city slickers!\\" Absolutely brilliant!
B0015QT78O|5.0|This is one of the VERY FEW TV shows that actually EXCEEDED the movie it was based on. That is very rare to say the least. I wish that some company that is looking for TV series to release on DVD, would check in here and see ALL of the positive reviews and 5 star ratings. People who remember this series, truely love the series. The only sad thing is that there was never really an appropriate ending to the show. This show truely had \\"heart\\" and values that seem to be lacking in so many shows today.   I think Robert Hayes was perfect for the role. He brought an amazing innocence to the part and had the warmth that the character needed. This is very different from some of his other roles. That is what makes for a good actor.   Christopher Barnes was equally well suited for his role. I genuinelly felt sorry that this boy could never establish \\"roots\\" or be a \\"normal\\" teenager in the series. I think the 2 actors teamed up VERY well. I hope somebody will convince Sony to produce the DVD series or release the material to a company who would like to do so.
0385534639|4.0|I loved this book. It was something I'd never read before and the author, Morgenstern is definitely an artist when it comes to world. The only reason I didn't rate this book was that I personally felt that the book had too much going on at once. This could have easily been an entire series of books, describing the characters in details, the circus in different locations, circus goers and enthusiastic- what have you. I feel like the reader was shorted in some aspects when it came to the decision to make this world into one book.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more from the author.

If you don't know her music - I can't imagine that to be the case if you're interested in Trucks/Tedeschi Band - take your first opportunity to listen to all that you can.  Tedeschi clearly did.  Killer vocals and slide guitar - all from one little red-headed woman.

But overall the movie sucked. I give it a chance and it failed horribley. But good idea for a movie. The reason I didn't like this movie is because I do not like Jason Saduekis or whatever his name is. To me he is not funny at all and Jason Bateman did not do that great of a job either. Bummer.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games opens with a bleak picture of our future. After some North American catastrophe that is merely hinted at, we are introduced to the nation of Panem, a glimmering but austere Capitol surrounded by twelve specialized and somewhat downtrodden Districts. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, hails from the coal mining District 12, where she and her friend Gale must hunt in the forests (illegally) for food and supplies their families wouldn't be able to afford otherwise. At sixteen, Katniss has spent most of her adolescence signed up for the Hunger Games, where two children conscripted from each District fight to the death for the honor of bringing home wealth, food and prestige. When Katniss' little sister's name is drawn for this years Games, Katniss volunteers in her stead. What happens next goes far beyond the needs of Katniss' family and opens up a greater world of danger, intrigue, romance and adventure.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins clearly has a plan that extends beyond this book. As the first part of a trilogy, The Hunger Games must set up the characters, locations, events and themes to service the entire overall story. However, at no point does the book feel dry or overly expository. The perspective of Katniss both allows for the introduction of the necessary elements mentioned and keeps us firmly in the narrative of the story at hand. It's a fantastic example of characterization and plotting woven together to create a coherent first act that manages to stand alone.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, Collins also does a wonderful job fleshing out the people of Panem. Katniss as a heroine is at once strong and vulnerable, intelligent and naive. She feels, talks and reacts like a real person, with palpable confusion in some moments and grim resolution in others. Her fellow tribute from District 12, Peeta, shows a great deal of complexity as well, along with some of the adults involved and the tributes from other Districts. The entire enterprise from start to finish has all of the hallmarks of careful construction, not only creating this new world of a potential future but also giving readers a reason to care about it.<br /><br />The sensationalism and spin doctoring of Panem surrounding the Hunger Games and the undercurrent of oppression and misery feels close to home. There are eerie similarities between the ways in which the Capitol interacts with its Districts and the rhetoric and attitude of certain elements in today's world in general and the United States in particular. Between this similarity and the presentation of Katniss, Collins draws the reader in and refuses to let go, compelling each page to turn as the action unfolds. When the book is over, the readers is satisfied with the conclusion but left wanting more, which is exactly how any book should end, but especially when more are planned to come after it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a wonderful book, deeply involving and a delight to read. And yet it's only the first part of a greater narrative exercise.  Subsequent books are poised to deliver more great characterization, a deeper exploration of the world of Panem, and more sleepless nights for the reader as they (that is, we) eagerly turn page after page.  Good luck putting this one down.the hallmarks of careful construction, not only creating this new world of a potential future but also giving readers a reason to care about it.  The sensationalism and spin doctoring of Panem surrounding the Hunger Games and the undercurrent of oppression and misery feels close to home. There are eerie similarities between the ways in which the Capitol interacts with its Districts and the rhetoric and attitude of certain elements in today's world in general and the United States in particular. Between this similarity and the presentation of Katniss, Collins draws the reader in and refuses to let go, compelling each page to turn as the action unfolds. When the book is over, the readers is satisfied with the conclusion but left wanting more, which is exactly how any book should end, but especially when more are planned to come after it.  The Hunger Games is a wonderful book, deeply involving and a delight to read. And yet it's only the first part of a greater narrative exercise.  Subsequent books are poised to deliver more great characterization, a deeper exploration of the world of Panem, and more sleepless nights for the reader as they (that is, we) eagerly turn page after page.  Good luck putting this one down.
B002DMJLTE|5.0|Loved watching this movie again but with the clarity of blu-ray well, it made it awesome to watch again.  This product came on time if not earlier than I expected!
0812550706|5.0|Excellent book!  I'm a big SciFi fan and was excited to see the recent NPR list of the Top too Science-Fiction, Fantasy Books.  I had read 7 of the top 10 already, but was surprised to see that #3 on the list was a book I hadn't even heard of (Ender's Game).  Had to get it right away, and I wasn't disappointed.  It initially reminded me of Starship Troopers by R. Heinlein.  Close to the end I was a bit dissatisfied with how the plot was seemingly ending, but then came the surprises!  What a great wrap-up and now looking forward to reading the next in the series.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We all know the movies...episodes 4 thru 6 are classics, if a little dated.  The prequels are not very good and make almost no sense.  We were interested in them just for nostalgia, to reconnect with our youth in seeing the story of Darth Vader.  But the movies look and sound good.    The disappointment is that these discs have terrible extras.  They are old or not interesting.  I'm an idiot for continuing to buy these movies from money-hungry Lucas in hopes they will be a definitive set.  And for such a technological powerhouse, Lucasfilms does nothing with the Blu ray format in term of the user interface.  Even the deleted scenes are not easily or logically accessible.  If you want to see a great UI, look at the Alien Anthology or Lord of the Rings just to name two.  Lucas totally blows using the Blu ray format to the movies' advantage.  And I'm tired of hearing Ben Burtt the sound designer being the most heard voice in the commentaries.  Where is Lucas?  where is the cast?  They should have made full running commentaries.  I give this collection only one star even though the movies never looked or sounded better.  But I won't return them.  Because I'm an idiot, like many of you out there.  If we we're smart, we'd all return these discs to send a message to Lucas.  But you know you won't!  So I won't either.  Start saving up for the 3D version he'll put on the market in a few years that will also be lacking.  Oh yes, we are all idiots!
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|Jane Espenson seems like a very likeable person from her interviews, but I am very unhappy with what she did to Buffy, Galactica, Torchwood, and now Game of Thrones.  Her Thrones episode was great where she parroted the book and weak where she impiously \\"improved\\" upon George RR Martin's work (hubris much?), in particular by misunderstanding and shaving off the subtle moral nuance of the Viserys Targaryen story, watering it down from truly wonderful into something merely fun to watch.<br /><br />In GRRM's book: Khal Drogo intends to give Viserys his army, but Viserys is too arrogant to be patient, so he dies through intemperance a la Hamlet.  Subtle.<br /><br />In Espenson's TV script: Viserys is led to believe that Khal Drogo will *never* give him his army, so he has little to lose in a desperate gambit.  Blunt.<br /><br />I seldom notice who wrote a TV show unless it's very good or very bad, but Espenson's work has jumped out at me. She once won a Hugo award for cowriting an excellent Buffy episode, but since then I've been disappointed in a favorite program several times only to notice her name in the credits.  Google for \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" and \\"worst episodes\\" and you'll see that Espenson's \\"The Passage\\" and \\"The Plan\\" are nearly always at the top of the worst episode lists, yet in interviews she often refers to them as \\"fan favorites.\\"  Hmph.  I wish she would stick to stuff like 'Gilmore Girls,' which I think suits her strengths much better.<br /><br />Almost everything else about this series is flawless.  If the producers read this, this viewer at least would prefer no more Jane Espenson scripts, please.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Wonderful depiction of life in colonial America and the crafting of the US Bill of Rights and Constitution.  Giamatti and Linney turn in sterling performances, and although the story line gets rather dense at times, the viewer is constantly reminded that the occurrences were actual events in history. This is a film suitable for all ages, indeed, it should be required watching for all citizens.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|which is not meant as a slap at him, just that this is some unvarnished, straight ahead blues, something he has kind of strayed from since the very early days. It's very well done. His voice has lost a little of its elasticity, but he can still carry the melody without having to strain or resort to altering the song. A very nice surprise; the guy is definitely not over the hill.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|First of all, The entire 5 volumes are ALL in the public domain. If you're anything like me, you will have a hard time reading one book (let alone 5). Solution, get the audiobooks. But you don't want to shell out big bucks for the audio CD's, or downloads? No prob. Librivox has them in convenient zip files on their sight for free (remember, it's public domain). The vocal volunteers may not be as polished as the pro readers, but they're not bad, and you can always get the pro reader's renditions at a later time.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|As our home entertainment options constantly improve, it is a wonderful thing when the media for our favorite movies gets an upgrade. I was extremely ecstatic when my wife ordered me the Bluray set of the complete Star Wars saga as a gift. As a lifelong fan of the films, I am really happy to finally have a set that looks and sounds great. Sure some of the movies were \\"fixed\\" better than others, but it really comes down to expectations. I have come to expect Lucafilm to constantly work to fix things both in content and technical aspects that they do not like. Gerge Lucas is a story teller, even when flawed, his intent always seems to be to tell the best story. With the Bluray release, the story doesn't necessesarily improve, but it now looks and sounds right with the equipment I have at home. And for that reason alone, its worth it. Do I like all the changes made to the features over the years with each new media release? No, of course not, but I have come to accept them as part of the process. Watching these I will say that the documentary extras and movies are great. Much of the other extras were slow to load on my Bluray player with an excess of menus to manuever, but I still enjoyed them. If you are a fan, you should relax and try to enjoy these. Its really not that hard to do....  May the Force Be With You.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I like the customizable Widgets and easy access to other pages by swiping screen.  The weather wheel format is nice but sometimes seems to conflict with the Temp data on the widgets.  The forecast is sometimes inaccurate but I guess that is caused by the source, not the app.  Overall, it is a nice functional tool to have.
B0000524E5|5.0|What a great movie. Even the hubby loved it! Not appropriate for children under 13 years of age. Fast shipper! Thank you!
B0058A119G|5.0|Listening to Streisand's interpretations of the Bergmans lyrics has been thrilling.  Every word is so brilliantly crafted and of course you can hear every word because of her beautiful diction.  The new songs were a delight and the older ones always a treat. One of my favorite renditions was Little Boy Lost.  I loved it as well as both discs.  She is the best.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This Movie Unstppable arrived undamaged and was playable and the packaing was intact too. Great movie, an edge of your seat suspensful, and action packed movie. Yes, I would order this movie again and I'd tell my friends about it too.   Robert Gaskill
B004K00NMG|5.0|I had been thinking about buying this movie on DVD for ages, but when I saw it on Amazon I just had to buy it straight away!!  One of my favourite animated movies and fun for the whole family!

B005COO1X6|3.0|I was so excited to read this book, but was very disapointed.  If you are a Stephen King fan you will have to read it.  Although, plot was kind of dumb.  Ending was just stupid!  The one thing I did like about it was that it being a short story and something I could read in an hour and not for days.
0439023491|5.0|My daughter said this book is good.Her friends also like it.She had three books from this author.She said all of three books are very good.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is worth all 99 pennies I paid for it.  Most puzzle games tense me up, but this one calms me down... might just be the music, which is excellent.
B003UESJH4|3.0|I hate to be a downer, but I found this movie to be a typical Oscar winner meaning it was drawn out and boring.  The plot, in a nutshell, is:<br /><br />- Man stutters<br />- Man doesn't want to be king because kings have to speak publicly (lucky for him, he has an older brother)<br />- Man goes to speech therapy<br />- Older brother gives up being king<br />- Man must now be king and speak publicly<br />- Man overcomes stutter - YAY - The end<br /><br />The acting was very good.  It was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role that was more subdued and she pulled it off wonderfully.  Geoffrey Rush played the quirky therapist perfectly.  It was just that the plot of the story was slow and boring.
6304711905|5.0|What two names go together better than Russell & Tombstone. A classic movie no doubt and it completely blows the Costner version out of the water. DVD arrived in superb shape & in a timely fashion. This is a DVD that my family has probably seen 50 times but our copy went missing - I had to replace it!  Shannon B
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this unit to go with the Grado s80i's and let me say that I like it. It lets me set my Sandisk sansa at the flat response it needs for these headphones because they do not need EQ and have enough power to put them at the level at and far beyond what I need. I tried the headphones without it and forget it I mean if I wanted to EQ the Sansa I could get enough volume but so far with this added in I have the headroom to be able to run the Grado's flat response which they and me love and so far I can play the Sansa longer because it does not have resistance from headphone drivers dragging down its battery life so in my opinion as long as the battery on the E5 delivers like it says I will be a happy listener.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best replacement for the stock keyboard I've used. Slight learning curve but well worth it. Intelligent dictionary and word suggestion engine that gets really good at predicting what your next word will be. Swipe to clear the preceding word is fantastic on the rare occasion you mistype
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This is one of the best (edit: THE best) rock documentary ever concieved. This is the raw, pure, untainted view of music and specially grunge in its earlier years. The Seattle sound and bands and the way they show the story starting from Andy Wood, just amazing. PJ has been the soundtrack of my life from an early age and seeing this movie unfold and tell the story of one of the most important bands of the 90's is breathtaking. The innocence in the presentation and the band itself is missing in todays music and bands. These are honest, true musicians that only made music because they wanted to express their thoughts and try to make a difference in the lives of their fans not their own wallets (read: every new band out now).   If you like any music from late 80's and early 90's, do yourself a favor and go watch this or buy it, it will have a lasting impression on your thought of music. I ordered this on my phone the moment I stepped out of the screening, even ordered the book for good measure.   If you are looking for another great rock documentary or mockumentary I should say, check out Spinal Tap. The band doesnt exist but its an amazing movie to watch.  Grunge forever!

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|I bought this hood for my Nikkor 18-55mm VR lens that came with my Nikon D3100 DSLR. I took it to my trip to Yellowstone National Park and it served the purpose very well. Although it feels thin, but it actually serves great as a hood. I even put it in reverse without any trouble.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a must read if you:  A. Were born in the 70s or 80s  B. Consider yourself a nerd/geek/etc  C. Have a pulse  Seriously, this is one of the best books that I've read in a long time and is a really quick and fun read. The parallels between the \\"future\\" that Cline describes and today's world are staggering and it leaves the reader wondering just how far off this story concept truly is. I am really hoping for a sequel, but until then I plan to just reread this novel and wait for the day that I can participate in FlickSync (again read the book, you'll know how awesome this would be).
B001RPZDY0|5.0|One of my favorite Verdi operas, well played out by the chosen cast with related staging. The voices of Hovorostovsky and Villarroel are superb. This was a most enjoyablle classical production.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Words cannot describe how amazing this album and Lady Gaga is. I pre-ordered it and waited in anticipation as the months went by for Born This Way. When i finally got it and listened to it, I was blown away. It was just so much more than I expected. \\"Bad Kids\\" is a favorite. It explains my life perfectly. It's really quite amazing. I love this album and I love you, Lady Gaga.
0393339882|5.0|It is one of the best books I have ever read.  The book is truthful, well written, and reflects a likable character. It is very well researched and documented.  I like the subjective part of the literature. The timeline, notes and bibliography serve as a great reference.  The book raises profound questions about the nature of reality. It is a great book to read for anybody. For all `scientifically inclined' this is a `must read.' Harry, Virginia, USA
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Saw a friend with this app and had to have it....less then a week into it I have no where else to go...beat the game....wish I knew before I spent money on such a short term game
B005E8KQPM|5.0|I'm editing my review from earlier because some people seem to have gotten offended by the truth. I said that the people who are criticizing Opeth for this new direction are narrow minded and don't really understand that musicians are supposed to evolve. Yes, MA did say a while ago that Opeth are a death metal band, but now that he's getting older and more into progressive/space rock and is tired of the daeth growls, Opeth have become a better band. If you like metal and nothing else, don't buy this album. If you are a fan of old progressive rock and classic rock (such as camel, king crimson, deep purple, rainbow, sabbath, etc) do yourself a favor and buy this album. It definitely still has the heavy signature Opeth sound, but it is a lot cleaner and more mature. I hope MA continues to take Opeth further in this new direction and I hope that the narrow minded reviewers/listeners grow up and understand that death growls and loud riffs are not everything.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Great indie band. Too bad people only give credit to Pumped Up Kicks. The whole CD is well worth more than one song.
B005DZMP00|5.0|It was Halloween 1972 and I was in Larry's car and we were on our way to Leopold's Records on Durant right across from the UC Berkeley campus and we were on a mission...To score a copy of the new live Grateful Dead set entitled: \\"Europe 72.\\" We rolled onto Telegraph Avenue after dark and it was a total freak-out of epic proportions...Halloween in the promised land of insane joys...Berkeley. Telegraph ends at Durant and you gotta find a place to park and hustle back down to this funky record store that had all the best records and got them out before anybody else. Larry, had heard a radio spot and we knew Europe 72 was in there and we were gonna get it.<br /><br />Up the stairs and inside Leopold's there were three high stacks of \\"Europe 72\\" on the floor and many more still in boxes and we thought we were the very first customers on the planet to answer the ad and hold this big 3 LP set of live Dead. Larry saw the white cover with the Ice Cream Kid and the rainbows and said \\"At last a COOL white album\\" and the Ice Cream Kid was kinda weird but really cool weird. There was a sticker that said this music was all from The Dead's spring tour of Europe and there was a price tag of FIVE BUCKS stuck on the slink-wrap and I fished out my five bucks and so did Larry as we had ours and we were gonna party with this sucker until the cows went home.<br /><br />September 2011 and almost 39 years after that night in Berkeley I'm in the high mountains of California and after a killer Bruce Hornsby show at the Mountain Winery in Saratoga on Sunday night it's now Wednesday evening and I'm listening to a great \\"Dark Star\\" from the Bickershaw Festival from England on 05/07/72 performed to sea of fans up to their noses in mud and as I have only heard this before as a low-quality audience recording I traded for in the mid-eighties. This HDCD is a real joy for my old ears. As the drums crash into \\"The Other One\\" Jerry takes off yet again and goes for broke over Pigpen's organ before Bobby screams: \\"Spanish Lady comes to me\\" at the ten and 1/2 minute mark and there'e still twenty more minutes of music before it's over. This is Primal Dead as they are really tryin' to explore some strange new worlds here that music doesn't normally go to but, The Dead will go there and we have the proof right here.<br /><br />\\"Bertha\\" is fueled by Keith playing some amazing runs on his piano and Jerry get's to snake and slide all around what Keith is playing and you just know he has that great big grin on his face the entire time. \\"Beat It On Down The Line\\" has a great playout from Jerry as they hammer it home. \\"Black Throated Wind\\" is a world away from the version found on \\"Steal Your Face\\" that has a lot less wind left in it than this fulla-energy edition from Radio Luxembourg two years before it. \\"Chinatown Shuffle\\" and \\"Next Time You See Me\\" are Pigpen's and he wails and moans and honks that harp as great as always even if he was already in real poor health (the European tour was his last big tour as a member of the Grateful Dead) If I had a wish for this set it would be to include more of Pigpen's material but I won't complain that the \\"Good Lovin\\" from Frankfurt, West Germany (04/26/72) got included here because Pigpen gets to rap a little but, what Jerry is doing here is really stunning as he plays some fantastic leads on this version and steals it right outta Pigpen's pockets.<br /><br />\\"Playing In The Band\\" has a good jam that finds some cool space that would only grow in future versions. I consider this short/longer version of \\"Playing\\" a great version and I'm glad it was selected for Vol. 2. The Merle Haggard classic: \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" is the best version yet as Jerry is very soulful here in his singing and playing, this was/is really special. The set ends with a \\"Not Fade Away>Goin' Down the Road>Not Fade Away\\" from early on the tour and it isn't the strongest version of this sandwich but it's pretty good and quite an effective closer to this set.<br />If you like live Grateful Dead music you gotta get this second set from Europe 72.<br />FIVE STARS !!!If you like live Grateful Dead music you gotta get this second set from Europe 72.<br />FIVE STARS !!!
0747589194|5.0|I was very excited to find one of my favorite books being offered from overseas near the location of the book's story. The book was in great shape and the shipping was excellent, arriving much sooner than expected. Thanks so much for this great transaction!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What a fantastic book by a new author.  It's the kind of book that really kept me going and wanting to read it all.  I enjoyed it so much the first time, I'm going to read it again!  Really good attention to detail on the 80's trivia!
B005GSY23M|5.0|I was in the same boat halfway through the movie I knew I must have this soundtrack, the music just absolutely captures the mood of the film to perfection.  Two thumbs up for this one
B005BW14FC|5.0|I have been a fan of 3 Doors Down for a few years now and after purchasing their very latest album, I am definitely not disappointed. I love their sound, their lyrics, and simply just everything about the group! It is very rare to find an album that one enjoys listening to from start to finish but this is surely one of them! Every song is wonderfully done! The lyrics are captivating and the music is dynamically invigorating! Every song has their signature sound and the passing of time has added a pleasant new melody to their mix. Just wonderful! To put it simply, I love this album (and all of their others!!) and I love 3 Doors Down! Love, love, love it! You will not be disappointed.....
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|this album is very good. there are some pop tracks that will make you dance. the ballads are beautiful. some of the r&b tracks are very relaxing. yes this isnt like Here We Go Again. but this album is more mature than her first two records. unlike her first two records, shes actually shows she doesnt wanna be labeled that disney girl anymore. and i like this record alot. this record isnt just full of pop, there are R&B tracks. and demi has said she was influenced by R&B. i suggest you buy this if you want a more mature album. this album suits her R&B roots and pop roots. thats what i love about it. unlike her pop-rock style she use to put out. im glad she decided to go pop/r&b because then she isnt singing about the same stuff she did on her first two albums. if you dont mind change by this. if you really love her old stuff and hate change. why waste your time? besides that i love it. thats all :)
B000066C6Z|4.0|...This was a pretty funny movie.  one of val kilmers first movies.  very similar to hot shots and blazing saddle style movies.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I picked this up, unsure, but desperate for something to read. I LOVED IT! After the initial few chapters of getting all the characters in order, I was sucked in. You start reading and can't stop. The characters are well written and the story just draws you in. You can't wait to see how their story finally ends. I would highly recommend this book!
B0055SWM08|5.0|it's fabulous. it gives me the gayest feeling ever. the only other adjective that would best describe it would be FIERCE! Trust me, I'm a power bottom!
B004WDPXN0|5.0|Just when you think you have it all, they release this! Listening to the remaster; you will realize Miles really hit the nail on the head with this album. The sound is excellent, forget about the other remasters out there, this is the best by far, plus you get the Live At The Nice Jazz Festival-1986 CD as well, you don't need a review of this to know you want it :)
0716703440|4.0|If you wish to truly understand the general theory of relativity this is the place to start.  It's treatment is old and hold nothing on the likes of Wald, but it ties in well with conventional mathematical methods and with this you can go onto more elegant and modern formalisms which miss a lot of the basics in this text.  If you have background in tensor calculus and special relativity this may be a  good starting point, if your knowledge however is above or below that level you may find the text a letdown.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I was in middle school when this movie came out. All my friends saw it but me. All I new about it was the song, I Will Always Love You. Now at age 28 I finally got a chance to watch this movie after buying it. I played it before going to work. My husband was just waking up and was stuck watching it with me till I left. When I got home he told me he enjoyed the movie. You know it is good if a guy says that lol. I didn't get to finish it  before going to work that day. So when I got off of work that night I watched it two times. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to watch it. But it was worth the wait.
0439321603|4.0|As much as I know this book was going to be amazing, unfortunately I never got it. =( Of course I am not saying it was the sender's fault, something may have happened in the mail. But as for this book, I can say it is amazing work done by J. K. Rowling and a must for people who not only love Harry Potter, but also have an interest in amazing creatures or who have an artist's eye
0375842209|5.0|This book is incredible. I don't want to ruin it for you but it literally has a mind of its own. Don't ask me how it works, it just does!I walked into my local condemned Borders,stole this book, and as soon as I got out of the store this damn book gets an attitude and starts calling me a book thief. Then I drive over to my Mcdonalds, order a my normal lunch of a couple fries, big macs, milkshakes, apple pies, and sweet teas. I open this book to first page and this book called me a fatass in big bold letters. Naturally I started to freaking out and swear at it, and when I turned the next page staring right back at me is a coupon a bar of soap telling me to go rinse my mouth out before he calls my mother. I told him to f' off. To teach him a lesson I threw him on my bed and locked him in my room once I got home. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. Later that night I went into my room and what do I find. This freaking book is bangin' my girlfriend! He turned and looked at me with his big hard cover on, pulled out, and got ink everywhere! I got extremely upset and my girlfriend ended up leaving me for this book. Moral of the story, don't buy this book, he is a dick and will ruin your life.
0061148512|5.0|What can I say that other reviewers have not?  I just wanted to also add that this is a fascinating and gripping novel following one woman's descent into torment and mental illness.  The novel is taken mainly from the events of Plath's own life, merely changed slightly to protect people's identities and to change the setting slightly.<br /><br />The novel is so well written and so honest that one cannot help but be moved.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|I really like this story and think it is good for children to watch and I decided to add it to my DVDs at home.  I got quick reponse on my purchase and was here at my address in no time. The seller was quick and fast and am happy with my purchase.  I have purchased things before from Amazon and have always been happy with my purchases and good response from them.
038533348X|5.0|I just finished up this novel and wanted to add my two cents to the hundreds of other reviews.  This is a very interesting and well written novel by one of my favorite authors.  I won't spoil anything, but expect more of Vonnegut's wry and dark wit.  The entire novel though is poking at religion, so if you are very religious and don't have a sense of humor when it comes to people poking fun at religion, then you may want to read something else...
0525422943|4.0|I got this book as an advanced reader copy (although it was lost for a while, so I actually didn't get it until a couple weeks ago). When I got it, I couldn't remember why I had chosen to get an advanced copy.  I read the back and thought, \\"Wow, this is going really depressing.  Why did I pick this book?\\"  Then I read it.  I won't waste time by summarizing it like most reviewers do, because I find that kind of annoying.  For most books, you can just read the summary that's already there and don't need that from reviewers.  From them you want an opinion.  Well, my opinion is that this is a great book.  It's well written.  It has a great story.  It has sad moments without being a depressing book, which is hard to do.  Plus, you can relate to Adam and Mia, even if your life is not anywhere close to what theirs is.  I never read the first book, but one really doesn't have to read the first book to get how great this book is.
0385333846|5.0|This is typically the first novel of Vonnegut's that most people are exposed to, mainly due to required reading lists.  I revisited this novel years later (now at age 32) and I must say that I found the novel even more enjoyable today than I did before.<br /><br />Basically the novel centers around this idea: what is crazier - the incredible and tragic bombing of a largely civilian population in Dresden in World War 2, or the belief of being abducted by aliens and put in a human 'zoo'?  As you read on, often you start thinking that the alien abduction seems the less far fetched event.  A testament to the futility and horror of war.<br /><br />Amazing!  If you haven't read it in years you should revisit this book.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|First things first, I flew through this book in only a few days (and it also seems fitting this was my first Kindle book).  It's a quickly paced book where things are happening constantly and those of us who are into the culture the book is talking about will love every reference and *wink* in our direction.  The author really has a knack for all things nerdy, and it shows.    In fact, it's almost a detriment.  Ernest does a great job incorporating so many parts of the geek culture that nearly all references have a paragraph or two further explaining them.  It's to make the book approachable to all audiences of course, but it can throw a minor wrench in the pacing of a scene when a fairly iconic video game or movie needs to be explained.  Given the book's frantic pace, yet devotion to exposition, it's a bit of a shame that the plot takes a fairly direct path.  Without spoilers, I will simply say there are a few good twists thrown in there for good measure, but don't expect much else from the plot.  The end goal is clearly defined, and the lines are clearly drawn in the sand on who to root for/against.  Regardless of the books minor flaws, it's just FUN.  The constant stream of geek/pop culture references are a blast, and it truly is a difficult book to put down.  Readers familiar with similar books like [[ASIN:B000HWYKES Lucky Wander Boy]] will find a home here.  It's a fantastic read and very much enjoyable, just don't come in here expecting deep social commentary or life-changing passages.
1451626657|5.0|I am merely adding in my own two cents:<br /><br />I never read this in high school or college, and now, at 32, I am rediscovering many 'required reading' novels that I missed.  Though this novel won't appeal to everyone, it is a satirical view of the folly of war, capitalism, religion, and many other ideals.  Through humor and very interesting situations the reader gains a sense of the exasperation the main character has with the surrounding characters and their morals (or lack thereof).<br /><br />Deep down it has a very Kafka-esque feel to it.  If you enjoy dark humor then you should definitely give it a shot.  I am very happy I read this, it is on my short list of favorite novels.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|At 5 years old I was fortunate to see episode 4 in the theater in 1977.  Although not perfect, I thought it was. The story and characters captivated me.  My friends and I would act out scene after scene, day after day.  We traded Star Wars cards, we played with the Star Wars toys,  the characters became friends to us.  We held our breath for 3 long years for the next movie. And when that day finally came it was better than Christmas. We could finally see for ourselves what did happen to Luke, Leia, Han, Threepio, R2, and Chewbacca. This release has been the biggest letdown.  I don't own it and I never will.  The original cuts, in restored video and audio, without the new special effects from any era, is that too much to ask for?  I would have spent 80 bucks on just those. Lucas just needs to let this series go and move on.
0316056863|5.0|QUOTE: It was a major and deeply embarrassing teenage revelation. It must be how straight teenage boys feel when they realize those boobs they like have heads attached to them. ~pg42<br /><br />Bossypants is a humourous look into the entertainment industry by a strong woman, with a good moral compass. Tina Fey is grounded, and funny - very funny. She successfully gives us an example of someone who can make it in show business without sacrificing morals and values and someone who has good character.<br /><br />QUOTE: Actually, that only happened to me once that I know about. A coworker on SNL dropped an angry C-bomb on me and I had the weirdest reaction. To my surprise, I blurted, \\"No. You don't get to call me that. My parents love me; I'm not some Adult Child of an Alcoholic that's going to take that poop*.\\" And it never happened again...that I know of. ~pg183, on being insulted with name-calling.<br /><br />Tina focuses on positive elements in her life, instead of the dirt (because we all have dirt, right?) She honours the people in her life, especially her parents, and the reader is left feeling refreshed, humoured and wanting Tina to be a personal friend.<br /><br />She bears a lot of responsibility for her show, 30 Rock but still questions and struggles with the same things that all working parents have to deal with. This makes her even more real and accessible.<br /><br />Overall, this book is definitely an A because it is well written, the message is positive and clear, and best of all the writing is humourous. You really must read it.<br /><br />QUOTE: When people say, \\"You really, really must\\" do something, it means you don't really have to. No one ever says, \\"You really, really must deliver the baby during labour.\\" When it's true, it doesn't need to be said. ~pg242
1593352964|5.0|You know how you see a movie or read a book (especially the first in a series) and think \\"Wow, this is the start of something big.\\" Well, Killing Floor is the start of something big. I have just read it and it was my first Jack Reacher book. I came to find out about Child's Jack Reacher via another book I am to review. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />First the good. I realize this is an older book, but it was hard for me not to make huge comparions to The Repairman Jack series. A man with no real connections like a ss# or address, a man who chooses to blend in, not stand out...and fights for the underdog. I can see Joe Reacher being this kind of hero. Also, Joe thinks a lot, allowing us to know what is going on inside his head, the turning of those mental wheels, the ideas sprouting to life. But he doesn't always tell us everything, so we get to feel like we are part of the book, a wandering dectecitve out to save our own skin. What will happen? Why did this and that occur? Is this part we just noticed relevant? Also, Joe Reacher is tough. When he takes someone down it doesn't seem egotistical, it seems scientifically planned out, the fight makes sense. In real life when someone fights back you have to wonder why they didn't grab someone's eyeball and pull it out of the socket, instead they just scratched and punched.  Joe Reacher? He's a fighter and not afraid to get dirty.  I love that.<br /><br />Now the meh..or not necessarily good. Hmmm...I would say I'd have loved the story more without the love interest. I didn't need to see Reacher's soft side or for him to have a girlfriend, at least not this early.  As a writer, I think it just took a weeee bit away from setting Reacher up to be an on-his-own, hardass kind of guy. Now he's kissing his girl on the head in the police station..meh. Not to mention, I watched a soap for a long time and I would be so into a crazy or intense character. Then they would give that character a spouse and then kids. I don't want to see that. It's hard for me as a mom to not say, go home! Stay safe and take care of your family. Don't put yourself and them into dangerous situations. Sorry, it's hard to kick the mom thing :)<br /><br />Also, and this is my only real issue that could make or break my reading more of Chid's Reacher novels.  It was the writing style itself. To begin with, Reacher's thoughts and dialog is often written in incomplete,  broken sentences. It was kind of like someone may talk in real life, but it's distracting and took a lot (A LOT) of getting used to for me to read. An example: \\"There was dead silence in the room. Lasted quite a while.\\" \\"I ran over to the counter. Spoke to our waitress. The one with the glasses.\\"  Okay, it probably sounds nit-picky to a lot of readers and for Child's that is a good thing. For me, it's distracting. For a short review :) or a conversation, it's okay. For an entire novel, for me, it took some getting used to.<br /><br />In the end, I will be reading another Jack Reacher book as soon as it comes in at my library! What a fun hero. I can see lots of possibilities for him. He is strong and smart with a questionable past and future. Love it!!! I highly recommend Killing Floor to anyone who likes this kind of novel. There ARE some pretty graphic gross-out scenes/violence in case you don't care for those. If you are on the fence, go for it! Give Reacher a try. Even his name is cool!me as a mom to not say, go home! Stay safe and take care of your family. Don't put yourself and them into dangerous situations.

0553714546|5.0|At Jamie's insistence Claire fled  for her and her baby's life back to the 20th century to escape the bloody fight at Colloden.  Twenty years late in the 1960s Claire discovers that against all odds Jamie survived Colloden and she must go back without her daughter.  The reunion between Claire and Jamie is unforgettable and her initiation back into the 18th century brings surprises.  The third book in the Outlander series is  my favorite so far. The story has much more action and adventure than the first two with fewer love scenes for you non-romance connoisseurs. This trip takes us from Scotland to the Caribbean with a few familiar characters popping up here and there. Some will surprise you.  Diana Gabaldon is a master story teller. Her wonderful descriptions of scenery, characters and historical events are fascinating and with the help of narrator, Davina Porter, the book on CD will transport you back in time.  I can't wait to listen to Drums of Autumn!

B0006JGFNQ|3.0|I got this toy for my wife as we are both huge fans of the movie. I got it for her to decorate her office desk. This looks great in the box, once you take it out, the dimensions are a little odd. The head is narrow and flat and the body is flat as well. The one we received had some matted fur and an odd dread-locked-ish strip of hair underneath one of the arms. There were parts of the fur that you wanted to be really soft, but it just wasn't.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty bad. It sounds like a very warped 45 record. I was hoping it would have a few different tracks, but only sings \\"The Mogwai\\" song, which is like a mix of high-pitched chirping and whistling. I like the song, but I would've liked more phrases. Howie Mandel's voice acting was the best part of Gizmo's personality.<br /><br />The dancing... as my wife put it, it looks more like gyrating than dancing, but is still cute.<br /><br />It's a good gift for the collector or fan of the movie, but I wouldn't expect any kid snuggling up with this toy at night, it has too many mechanical parts and is just not soft by any stretch.

Once I listened to this album I got the same pleasure, and relief, as when I first listened to Death Magnetic by Metallica. My heroes were back!!!    This is a very good album. My pick is \\"The Devil You Know\\" but there are a few other excellent songs.   Joey Belladona sounds better than ever and hope he never EVER gets kicked out of this band again.
B000JIJPZY|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because what I feel is wrong with it, is just my personal preference.  It didn't break, it's comfy, and it's easy to set up.  I bought this item based on price, having compared other small and inexpensive gyms with it.  I saw that the info said that the hanging toys are attached by velcro, and it didn't occur to me that meant I couldn't add toys to it without some fanagling (making my own loops to add).  I'm disappointed with the tiger--he looks really cute, but he's very hard plastic, and it wasn't easy for my son to get the music to play for the first 2 months of use (at 3 mo.+). The only way to get the music to play, is if the ball it's holding gets \\"rolled\\" between its paws.  This is the only noise-making item on the gym, except for the roller ball at the foot pad.  Now that he can consistently make the tiger play music (5 mo.), he's really getting too big for the whole gym.  I also wish that I would have chosen one that has travel closures, but I knew ahead of time that this one did not.  So my opinion of flaws are: no loops to attach your own toys, not enough/easy enough interactive items, and no travel closures.  One thing that I added to make it more fun is the Infantino chime animals:  [[ASIN:B00494CKIS Infantino Tag Along Chimes, Frog and Duck]]  The loop on those fit perfectly around the bar.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the the best blu-ray set I have ever seen. This set has gotten a lot of bad reviews from people who've never purchased of even rented it. They are all idiots who are just going off internet rumors. This set is beautiful. The picture and sound quality are amazing. The packaging is gorgeous. The extra features are incredible. I thought I knew basically everything about Star Wars, but I've learned a ton of fascinating stuff. I pre-ordered this set, and it came the same day it was available in stores. And I got it for cheaper than anywhere else. This is a fantastic deal. I could not be happier. Buy it. It is your destiny.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|Currently on tour with Styx, Yes has been playing their hits on the road for most of the past decade, but one thing they haven't done in the last ten years is release a new studio album. However, the band's new record, \\"Fly From Here,\\" did not come without cost.<br /><br />In 2008, Jon Anderson, the lead singer and songwriter for Yes, developed respiratory problems and was unable to tour with the band. His replacement was Benoit David, formerly of a Yes cover band. Journey, another Classic Rock era band, found their vocal replacement in a similar fashion.<br /><br />Eventually, Trevor Horn, who produced for Yes in the late '70s and early '80s, was booked to make a new record with the band and Jon Anderson was never told. Obviously, this created a rift in the band that will likely never be healed, but Yes is back and \\"Fly From Here\\" is their best album since 1983's \\"90125;\\" Horn's last project with the band.<br /><br />\\"Fly From Here\\" opens with an epic 25 minute long title track split into five parts. Where albums like 1994's \\"Talk\\" and 1987's \\"Union\\" seemed to lose focus, \\"Fly From Here\\" is an absolute nod to their biggest triumphs while still taking some time for reinvention. Trevor Horn's days as a member of The Buggles, the group that brought \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" to the world, come through the mix at times, likely aided by keyboardist Geoff Downes, who has played with both The Buggles and Yes in the past.<br /><br />As a progressive rock band, Yes' music is often filled with intricate instrumental sections and syncopated rhythms which rarely make mainstream radio, but fans of Yes' classic records should absolutely give \\"Fly From Here\\" a listen straight through. David's vocals offer a fitting tribute to Anderson, but stray enough from Anderson's soaring vocals at times to mark the beginning of a new era.<br /><br />Although Yes substitutes performers in and out all the time, their membership for \\"Fly From Here\\" found the magic that many thought was lost long ago.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Rush, Styx<br />Track Suggestion: \\"Fly From Here\\"estion: \\"Fly From Here\\"

Just enough of a challenge to make you think a few moves ahead,  but not extremely difficult that it causes the headaches and frustration.

Anyhow,  great game and cannot wait for the new one. I HATE WAITING!!
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|Arctic Monkeys had an unusual rise to the top of the charts for a band in the 21st century. Lead singer Alex Turner and guitarist Jamie Cook started Arctic Monkeys along with Matt Helders on drums and bassist Andy Nicholson; all students at the same high school. After playing a series of shows in their hometown, they began to distribute demos on the Internet and their fan base began to grow at a rate worthy of major record label attention. Instead of jumping into a contract with one of the biggest record companies, however, Arctic Monkeys opted to sign with Domino Records in 2005, the same as Franz Ferdinand, a band to which Arctic Monkeys received many early comparisons.<br /><br />Like Franz Ferdinand, the expectations for Arctic Monkeys' debut album were extremely high, but the band proved easily worthy of the hype when \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" hit the shelves in 2006. Although the album received a moderate amount of attention in the United States, selling over 300,000 copies to date, \\"Whatever People Say I Am...\\" became the fastest selling record in U.K. history, selling over 360,000 copies in the first week alone with well over one million to date.<br /><br />After a second album, \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare,\\" received glowing praise on par with their debut, Arctic Monkeys began to change directions with their sound. Producer Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age offered his expertise, which built up some additional anticipation in the U.S., but the resulting third full-length release, \\"Humbug,\\" still fell to mixed reviews. Arctic Monkeys' music became darker and a bit more laid back than their preceding efforts, but with third albums notoriously difficult for most bands in the limelight, many fans quickly began speculating as to whether Arctic Monkeys would be able to bounce back.<br /><br />Now, two years later, Arctic Monkeys' fourth release puts all of that speculation to rest. Opening with \\"She's Thunderstorms,\\" it's clear the band has learned a great deal from their time with Josh Homme, but is still unwilling to just return to the proven formula of their first two albums. Still less energetic than early hits like \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor\\" and \\"When the Sun Goes Down,\\" \\"She's Thunderstorms\\" finds Alex Turner singing more like a lounge singer than a teenage punk rocker, but the lyrics are equally clever which is what drew many fans to the band in the first place.<br /><br />Although \\"Suck It and See\\" offers many memorable and frequently amusing moments thanks to Alex Turner's wordplay, the title track, found one song before the album comes to a close, offers some of his finest work with each verse offering a unique blend of imagery and emotion. \\"You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock and other girls are just postmix lemonade\\" caps off the first descriptive verse while \\"that's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun and I can only hope you've got it aimed at me\\" furthers his sentiments on the next.<br /><br />The first track heard by most fans on \\"Suck It and See\\" was \\"Brick By Brick,\\" which was released as a video on March 10. With a chorus more reminiscent of The Vines than any of their own past singles, \\"Brick By Brick\\" is still a retreat from their first two records, but where \\"Humbug\\" often suffered from a lack of their original energy, \\"Brick By Brick\\" is a rediscovery of that forgotten vigor with a classic twist. Instead of relying on speed, the Arctic Monkeys and producer James Ford utilized live takes to capture the chemistry between band members. The resulting music is every bit as engaging as their first two albums, but ends up sounding more authentic.<br /><br />With the sharp bass grooves of \\"Reckless Serenade\\" and the atmospheric guitar effects heard on tracks like \\"Piledriver Waltz\\" and \\"Love is a Laserquest\\" filling out the album with different textures, \\"Suck It and See\\" offers plenty of variety, but there is still a natural flow between songs. Fans of the original Arctic Monkeys' sound will gravitate to the fast paced verses of \\"Library Pictures,\\" but despite fitting the mold that made them famous it's the only track that feels slightly out of place.<br /><br />\\"Suck It and See\\" is everything most fans hoped \\"Humbug\\" would be. As a fan of Arctic Monkeys from the beginning, it is difficult to hear the band evolve without reminiscing back to the beginning, but change is not always a bad thing. Alex Turner's lyrics still shine as brightly as ever and although Josh Homme is no longer the key producer, his influence is not forgotten. \\"Suck It and See\\" may not become a record breaker, but for any fans who lost some of their interest after \\"Humbug,\\" I encourage you to buy this album and see what Arctic Monkeys have become.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines, Kaiser Chiefs<br />Track Suggestion: \\"Don't Sit Down 'cause I've Moved Your Chair\\"e fast paced verses of \\"Library Pictures,\\" but despite fitting the mold that made them famous it's the only track that feels slightly out of place.  \\"Suck It and See\\" is everything most fans hoped \\"Humbug\\" would be.

B0054N73EY|4.0|It's been a hot minute since Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante left the band. By that, I mean he has been a part of every Red Hot Chili Peppers album since 1989 with the exception of 1995's \\"One Hot Minute\\" on which Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Naverro took over.<br /><br />Following a 16-month tour in support of 2006's \\"Stadium Arcadium,\\" Red Hot Chili Peppers' epic two-disc set of new studio material, the band announced an indefinite hiatus to recover from their seemingly endless work since 1999's \\"Californication.\\" When their time apart finally came to an end in October of 2009, Frusciante was once again not a part of the early sessions and his departure from the band was made official a few months later.<br /><br />Replacing Frusciante is Josh Klinghoffer who has worked with the likes of Gnarls Barkley, PJ Harvey, Beck, and Warpaint among many others in the past. Instead of letting him show off his skills right off the bat, however, the opening track, \\"Monarchy of Roses\\" introduces Klinghoffer with screeches reminiscent of a young garage band's first rehearsal. Anthony Kiedis's vocals enter early in an uncharacteristically distorted fashion while drummer Chad Smith's low rumble of kick drum and toms drives the song forward. At first, longtime fans of Red Hot Chili Peppers may think Klinghoffer has forced the band in a completely new direction, but suddenly Smith drops a loud downbeat on his snare drum and the Red Hot Chili Peppers we've all become accustomed to hearing are back.<br /><br />As \\"I'm With You\\" begins to take shape, one thing becomes clear; this is a bass-heavy record. Original bassist Flea, who is widely considered one of the most talented bassists in the world, answers the changing of the guard on the guitarist side of the spectrum with some of his most involved parts to date. Sure, \\"Factory of Faith\\" and \\"Ethiopia\\" don't exactly have the same intensity or skill requirements of the bass line in \\"Coffee Shop,\\" one of the most impressive parts of \\"One Hot Minute,\\" but his importance to each track is felt more in the studio now than it ever was 20 years ago. Instead of utilizing the slap bass technique to rough up the edges of the mix, Flea's bass now has a much smoother quality to it. Switching back and forth between octaves, Flea leads the way in providing the funk styling that has frequently been the job of the guitar on past records.<br /><br />The upbeat wildness of Red Hot Chili Peppers that defined them in the '80s still makes its presence known occasionally on \\"I'm with You.\\" On \\"Goodbye Hooray,\\" Flea unleashes a fierce breakdown very much like those of their earliest records, but the distorted slap bass is still traded in for a smooth, clearer quality. On the contrary, the polished solos of Frusciante, like those heard on \\"Scar Tissue,\\" are approached much differently by Klinghoffer. Tracks like \\"Look Around\\" give the guitar its moment in the spotlight, but clarity and technique are traded in for spontaneous creativity. These aren't solos that have been perfected over months of practice. Instead, Klinghoffer gives the listener a more in the moment interpretation of his instrument.<br /><br />Although each track manages to blend a trademarked formula with new twist, \\"I'm With You\\" still has trouble tying ideas together. Transitions between songs have never been the strongest aspect of Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums. One of the biggest criticisms of \\"Stadium Arcadium\\" was that many songs seemed to act as filler between singles and a common theme appeared to be non-existent. \\"I'm With You\\" is an improvement, partially thanks to the lack of a second disk, but the jumps in style and subject between \\"Happiness Loves Company,\\" \\"Police Station,\\" and \\"Even You Brutus?\\" still demonstrates just how diverse a single album of theirs can be.<br /><br />Like most Red Hot Chili Peppers records, \\"I'm With You\\" improves each time you listen to it. Yes, the change in guitarist provides a distinct contrastbetween this and their last two decades of music, but after letting the album play through a few times, it feels less like a new chapter and more like a page turn.<br /><br />Although they seem to be booked everywhere in the world except the U.S. for the remainder of 2011, the true Red Hot Chili Peppers experience comes in seeing them live. With a U.S. tour sure to be around the corner in 2012, \\"I'm With You\\" is an excellent way for any fan to pass the time until their tour bus rolls into town.

B004EPZ070|1.0|waste of time and money. horrible premise for a movie. overall very disappointing. Disgusting and BORING, the whole idea is depressing and wrong. I would NOT reccomend this movie to anyone I know, unless I wanted them to have a horrible time.
B0053FP1PQ|4.0|Better known in their home country of England than they are in the United States, The Kooks debut record, \\"Inside In/Inside Out\\" was released in October 2006 in the U.S., 10 months after its initial release in the U.K.<br /><br />With tracks like \\"Naïve\\" and \\"She Moves in Her Own Way\\" receiving a decent amount of radio play on independent stations across the United States, The Kooks developed a decent following, but did little to set themselves apart from the vast sea of bands with a similar musical formula like Kaiser Chiefs and Arctic Monkeys.<br /><br />After their second record, 2008's \\"Konk,\\" was released, The Kooks ended up taking some time off, in part due to the departure of bassist Max Rafferty. Fortunately for The Kooks, this may have been what saved them. Around the same time of The Kooks' hiatus, most of their competition began to deviate from their established successful formulas into more experimental territory.<br /><br />Kaiser Chiefs began to focus more on danceable beats, Arctic Monkeys teamed up with Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme for a full makeover and seemingly countless British bands followed suit with new, uncharted paths.<br /><br />While these bands all attempt to regain the fans they lost during their walkabouts, The Kooks have finally returned with an album that does little to separate itself from their past efforts, much to the delight of fans. That is not to say there is nothing new on this record, however.<br /><br />Splitting the album in half is \\"Time Above the Earth,\\" a string quartet driven track tied to The Kooks only by lead singer Luke Pritchard's voice. The tune is definitely surprising when hidden in the folds of a generally upbeat rock record, but \\"Runaway\\" quickly brings listeners back into familiar territory and \\"Time Above the Earth\\" becomes a welcome transition instead of a confusing new direction.<br /><br />The opening tune, \\"Junk of the Heart\\" picks up right where \\"Konk\\" left off with a feel-good mix of acoustic and clean electric guitar, light drums, and Luke Pritchard's vocals. Pritchard sounds a bit more like Julian Casablancas of The Strokes on this record thanks to some extra effects added by Tony Hoffer, their longtime producer, but fans of either band will not likely complain.<br /><br />As \\"Junk of the Heart\\" progresses, The Kooks begin to add in little changes here and there to keep things fresh, but the changes are not nearly as jarring as those made by their contemporaries. \\"Taking Pictures of You\\" adds in a wave of synths and reversed guitar effects, but the song easily remains radio ready with the acoustic guitar and vocals passing through production unscathed.<br /><br />Even the album's closer, \\"Mr. Nice Guy,\\" finds a familiar comfort in Pritchard's voice while the backing instrumentation is given the freedom to wander into the realm of distorted guitars and piano.<br /><br />In the chorus of the title track, Pritchard sings \\"I wanna make you happy, I wanna make you feel alive.\\" This could just as easily be a message for fans of The Kooks as it is for the subject of the song. Instead of experimenting with the formula that made them famous, The Kooks embraced it and returned with an album for their fans. \\"Junk of the Heart\\" is rarely original, but it is consistently enjoyable. Isn't that why we listen to music?<br /><br />Similar Artists: The Strokes, Arctic Monkeys<br />Track Suggestion: \\"Junk of the Heart\\"s vocals.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I'm so glad this movie showed an example of a loving, healthy, long-lasting marriage.  It's so rare in movies these days.  It was was also wonderful to see Mr. Fredricksen open-up and reach out to the boy and stay in his life as a mentor / male role model after they returned to the city.  We are very careful what we let our kids watch and we don't mind them watching UP.  Yay!  I love it!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Justin Vernon's debut album as Bon Iver, 2008's \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" came in at #47 on my list of the best albums of the 21st century's first decade. When I gave the album a recent listen as a refresher before experiencing his self-titled follow up, I regretted not listing it even higher. For all of its musical simplicity, \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" is a complex album with lasting charm.<br /><br />Few songs have ever captured as much beauty as \\"Re: Stacks\\" yet Vernon's crystal clear falsetto and softly strummed acoustic guitar are the only two ingredients.<br /><br />After creating what is now regarded as one of the greatest \\"breakup albums\\" in the eyes of many, Vernon formed one of the most unlikely collaborations in music when he joined up with Kanye West to assist in the creation of \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\\" Kanye's game-changing 2010 release. Kanye's album instantly put Bon Iver back in the spotlight and reignited fans' demand for a new album from the more surprising than ever songwriter.<br /><br />\\"Bon Iver\\" opens with \\"Perth\\" which quickly introduces many stylistic changes while keeping Vernon's trademark vocals and unparalleled songwriting very much in focus.<br /><br />Likely to be mistaken as silence for listeners afraid to turn up the volume, \\"Perth\\" opens with a faint recording of a train crossing before a much louder and exceptionally polished electric guitar cuts through. As the song progresses, \\"Perth\\" sees the utilization of far more effects than customary for Bon Iver and eventually blossoms into a surprisingly percussive track with a lush instrumentation.<br /><br />This is not the same Bon Iver that ran off to a hunting cabin to record an album three years ago.<br /><br />With many of the songs named after locations, both real and imaginary, Vernon paints a brilliant picture of each setting musically with the assistance of Rob Moose's string arrangements and Colin Stetson's horn playing, which both play an important role throughout \\"Bon Iver.\\"<br /><br />In the case of \\"Lisbon, OH,\\" an instrumental, the listeners are forced to use their imaginations to find connections between the small town and each sound effect added to the mix.<br /><br />Although \\"Bon Iver\\" offers many changes and surprises when compared to his simplistic debut, perhaps Vernon's most surprising track, \\"Beth/Rest,\\" is used as the final number. With a synthesizer part reminiscent of any '80s ballad and vocals more closely resembling Peter Gabriel than Justin Vernon, \\"Beth/Rest\\" is a far more confusing closer than \\"Re: Stacks\\" was in 2008, but still manages to be just as engaging.<br /><br />Justin Vernon may have moved on from the heartache heard on \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" but \\"Bon Iver\\" is still ripe with emotion and his songwriting is nearly as powerful now as it was then. Often when artists make such a drastic turn from their original sound, the result is disappointing, but Vernon's use of elaborate instrumentations and experimental effects do nothing to take away from the beauty of his music as a whole.<br /><br />\\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" is still his crowning achievement, but \\"Bon Iver\\" could almost be considered a new beginning for him, making the self-titled name of the album a perfect choice.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Iron & Wine, Nick Drake<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Calgary\\"listeners are forced to use their imaginations to find connections between the small town and each sound effect added to the mix.

B0055EDCGU|5.0|always liked Trivium, this is my fav. album so far. has alittle of everything. fast heavy stuff and slower rock stuff.
0060574216|4.0|This book really opened my eyes to the differences between men and women. I am much more tolerant now and I understand certain behaviors of my husband's that I just couldn't get before. We are from two different planets.
B004XE0P5E|1.0|I relied on Rolling Stone and Twitter in making this purchase.  Worst, mistake, ever.  This pretentious nonsense sounds like a cross between an 80s androgynous singer and music you hear at a spa.  I was expecting a rock album, not this whiny dribble.
0321544080|3.0|It's an ok book but geared mostly to photographers who only shoot with strobes, light kits, assistants etc.  For the average Joe who's just trying to get better at photography should probably wait until he/she strikes it big and has unlimited funds at their disposal.
030788743X|5.0|First of all, let's fall back into the 1980s and start to get oriented.  It is actually 2044 and a virtual treasure hunt was designed by James Halliday, deceased multi-quadzillionaire.  AND Halliday truly, truly LOVED (adored, obsessed about) everything from the 1980s.<br /><br />And because Halliday designed the ultimate treasure hunt quest on his videogame, OASIS, everyone on Earth has become just as obsessed with the 80s, looking for clues to find the hidden \\"keys\\" and egg for the treasure - ALL of Halliday's vast fortune.<br /><br />Wade Watts is a teen OASIS technogeek.  He lives for the game, has avatar friends but none in the flesh.  He is the perfect hero for \\"Ready Player One.\\"<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read - EVER!  It is definitely in my Top 10, if not actually Top 5.  It is fun, exciting, extremely well written.  It is amazing that this is Cline's first novel (even though he did write the screenplay for [[ASIN:B003G715JO Fanboys]], a favorite movie of mine).<br /><br />The book is kind of a combination of [[ASIN:B0024FADAQ The Last Starfighter]], [[ASIN:0142418218 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]], [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars]], [[ASIN:B002SG7Z8Y Gamer]], [[ASIN:B004SUDQ72 eXistenZ]], and a Rush concert (think [[ASIN:B000W1YYSQ 2112]]).<br /><br />There's good guys, bad guys, magic, romance, videogames, 80s trivia of every sort, hidden treasure, space travel - I mean - what more could you want in any book?  And I understand Warner Brothers has bought the film rights, with Cline writing the screenplay.  Hopefully we won't have to wait too long because this should make a stellar movie, too.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am a long time fan of Star Wars.  Seeing all the movies in HD on blu ray was great.  Excellent picture and sound. I recommend it.
030788743X|5.0|I was really excited to read Ready Player One and it didn't disappoint. I totally geeked out on this book. The 80's references are awesome, the universe Cline builds is one you want to escape into, and the plot is actually really compelling. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. I'm not exaggerating when I say this book is now one of my three all time favorites. It's just a totally fun read.
B003L77GRO|5.0|My husband and I are IN LOVE with Dexter! This season was great! So different then the other seasons! Can't wait for season six! Love it!
0439023513|4.0|I bought the first book at a thrift store and was hooked.  However, this book is either you'll hate it or like it or you'll be on the fence like I am still. The book picks up right where the last one left off. The story is pretty consistent and keeps the story moving. My biggest problem was Katniss. She came off very whiney and weak this time around which to me is not the Katniss I liked in the previous two books. She did want to train, follow the schedule or anything yet she complained about nothing being done. Then they risk their lives to rescue Peeta and there wasn't much gratitude for it. The way they turned Peeta's character into this mental basketcase/Anti-Katniss was heartbreaking and if Katniss cared for him as much as she seemed to have she would have stayed by his side no matter what to make things better. The author also goes on a character killing spree throughout the story which barely left anyone by the end. I did not like that Katniss and Peeta were just cast off to 12 and you cannot tell me either one of them would have seeked each other out sooner? THEN to just wrap up the story in 3 pages with \\"oh we grew together again\\" and then we had babies...we couldn't get at least another page as to how they slowly came back together and built a family? It didn't need to be a \\"happily ever after,\\" but at least a better conclusion. All in all...it's a solid book and a much better conclusion that I read to a series in a while.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing game with great yet relaxing replay value in trying to achieve gold on every level. The music helps you relax while you play this stress free game. Highly recommended, well worth the dollar.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is the #1, best movie, series, I've ever watched and it less than 20 bucks. Do yourself, your kids, and your friends a favor and get this series. Why this isn't in the hundred plus price range is beyond me.  This is, quite simply, required viewing.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|If yo like old classics, this one can't be beat.  Gloria swanson and william Holden are the very best actors they could have chosen for this movie.  By it You'll like it!!!!!!!!!!!!1
0545259088|4.0|FOREVER has all of the emotion and angst the other two in the series did.  The trials and tribulations of Sam and Grace's relationship is so real.  I love when I can identify with characters.  Grace is definitely someone I can relate to.  I love her.  But even more than her, I love Cole.  I found myself waiting for Cole's parts in the book.  All of the characters, including the secondaries like Cole and Isabella are very well rounded.  I still love how Sam's background story keeps coming up.  Although it is a tortuous story, it has power.  Now, let's talk about the ending.  Personally, I like open-ended books.  It lets me figure out what happens next.  However, in a series, I like it more when the chapter is closed and there is some peace in the ending.  I didn't get that with this book.    Overall, this is a pretty good end to an amazing series.  I'm glad I read these books.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Not too bad of a flick.  It streamed nicely and kept me entertained throughout the whole experience so I'd suggest it.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this is a fun app. i have played with it for a week and its still fun. i would gladly pay a dollar for it.
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|I don't know what to think about this movie. Was at the cinema last night and was totally unprepared for what I was going to see. First I thought that if I had watched it on DVD at home I would have been giving up on it, but being in the movie theater with friends I had to sit through it - and in the end I'm glad I did.  It is very impressive with beautiful filming and great acting. But the story is hard to get a grip on. It challenges you, \\"What is the director trying to tell me now?\\" question often came to my mind. I think I have kind of sorted it out, but also have come to terms with that there are parts I don't understand, and that's OK.  I think this is a like-it-or-hate-it movie. I have decided that I like it because of the beauty of it, but it is not a love it movie, so I give it a four stars review.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is going to be deleted, but seriously these are movies, how can you people take this so seriously. How can you actually sit in your house at your computer and actually push the keyboard and write these things?
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This has become one of my favorite BBC dramas (and I've seen and own quite a lot!). An intriguing drama with interesting characters and a compelling storyline. Complex without being too hard to follow. Excellent acting, directing, cinematography, and costume design. One of the best adaptations I've ever seen. In spite of the length, I could watch it over and over again without ever becoming bored.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm not going to bore anyone else with another pointless debate about the workings of George Lucas, it's a ridiculous argument. I will say that I just received my copy of the complete Star Wars blu-ray set, and I couldn't be happier with the product. The sound and picture quality is superior to any of the previous released Star Wars dvds. The extras that are presented with the set have provided hours of entertaining background  information and Star Wars history. I'm glad that followed my instinct and bought this!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Needs better zoom and undo to compensate for my fat fingers on 3.5\\" zio running 2.2. otherwise 5 star game play. High quality graphics. Fun to quickly knock off one-a-day of the many puzzles offered.
B004S7VSES|5.0|Ever since I first picked up A WALK TO REMEMBER it has been my go to book when I need a good cry.  Sparks is also an author that I know I can only read when I am prepared to be completely emotional while reading a book.    AWTR is such a beautiful love story and even though I know what happens; I treasure that love story each time I pick up this book.  I own multiple copies so that I can lend them out to friends.  A box of kleenex is a requirement for reading.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|It was...as the title nails perfectly...a beautiful disaster. I really loved it. It was real and honest and gritty. There is something in this story, in the characters, the dialogue, everything, that I can't even name but so perfectly depicts what it's like to be nineteen or twenty years old. Yes, sometimes Abby and Travis were both infuriating and dense, but isn't that truthful? We are not, especially at 19, all walking around psychoanalyzing our every thought, our every feeling, and our every action. Mostly we just feel, we just do, we just are. I felt that was a powerful concept explored by this book and made the characters so much more real and honest. Yes, the mistakes were great, and some things in the book are certainly not for children or even young teenagers, but it was extremely realistic. It was raw and I appreciated that. The dialogue was written with precision giving the whole thing this very movie quality feel to it.  I only have two real complaints. First, I would have liked a little more preamble. I wanted to know more about Abby's previous life from her own thoughts in the beginning, more about the act she was trying to put on. I also wanted more of America and Shepley's beginning, I thought those details would have helped the beginning, it was sometimes confusing, especially the time line.  I honestly love the romance and friendship between Abby and Travis. Yes, it was a disaster at times, yes it was dysfunctional, but I ultimately found it irresistible. Emotional and raw.  Second, while I appreciated the use of dialogue, I felt I would have liked a little more in between. A little more of Abby's angst. A little more description.   One last thing, I liked the sex scenes. They were tasteful and honest. I felt she gave some emotion without making it too wordy or too flowery (which would have contradicted the dark, gritty, raw feel to the rest of the book) and it still did not cross the line into tawdry, trashy tasteless romance. It was the first bookI have read where I truly felt an author got it right. For me at least.  Great book, great story. Highly recommended.   Oh and Abby's nickname? MY FAVORITE PART!
B005COO1X6|2.0|Was this a just a weird collection of notes that King released as a single? Or maybe it's a failed attempt at a novel. Either way, it is certainly not a story. It's more like a child playing with toys that he kills one by one. I love King and I will forever buy his books, but this just felt like a $3.00 way to circulate the first chapter of his new novel.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love this movie! The version I got was great because it has two ways to see the film:  as the original movie without the extra song, or with the extra song included.
0393325172|5.0|Large type and easy to read. Very similar to the Hornblower series but with a different type of captain. The writing will certainly stimulate your mind if your vocaublary is as limited as mine.
0425221806|4.0|This is a very entertaining read, I love Dean Koontz. I decided to read a few of his older works and I started with Watchers. It's a little dated in my opinion but the writing and characters are great. In this day and age it's hard to imagine a top secret lab animal not having a gps chip inbedded in it, so there would be no chase or hunting just hopping on a computer to locate said lab animals. No matter if technology has changed since then I don't regret reading Watchers cause I loved this book and its become one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels and I've read over 25 of his books!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Awesome game, but PLEEEEEASE, popcap, make a survival mode!!!!  I want a chance to grow my plant arsenal to infinite mass!!
B005974CNA|3.0|I'm a huge Dream theater fan.  That being said I won't blindly accept everything they do.  Images and words, Awake, Falling into infinity, and Scenes from a memory are all solid albums, and Six degrees is also very good.  Also love the live version of When Dream And day unite, with James on vocals.  After that the band kind of fell short.  Train of thought had the groundwork for a fantastic album, but the songs, while good, seemed to be bogged down with overly long instrumental breaks and pieces that served no purpose.  None of those songs should have been 14 minutes.  Endlesss Sacrifice is a good example of this, the first half of the instrumental break was pointless and shouldn't have been there.  that being said it was still a decent album.  Octivarium had a much more toned down sound, and was  way more mellow than I prefer, and had a couple cheesy songs I really didn't like.  But, it still brought several good songs and a couple more decent ones, so despite the toned down sound it was passible.  The much hated Systematic chaos followed, and aside for Portn throwing his weight around adding vocals to the album that James should have done, the first five songs were very good.  The end of Repentance went on too long, but I cut that off.  But then we get another political song, and a couple other songs that were too long and really weren't that good.  overall still a decent album though.  then we got Black clouds, which improved musically, and vocally, but the lyrics, and Mike adding vocals again.  Oh the humanity.  How did he get control of this band?  He completely ruined what was otherwise a potentially great album with awful lyrics in most of the songs.  Seriously a car crash where everyone is ok is not a good subject for a song.  But whatever.    After this Portny departed amongst potentially shady circumstances.  I don't really know what happened other than he wanted them to take a break and they didn't.  When I heard this my heart soared.  I thought \\"finallywe're going to get back to making complete albums again.\\"  After a stellar solo album by singer James LaBrie, I expected greatness.  I built up huge lofty expectations for this album, that the end result proved they were unrealistic.  They did manage to improve with much better lyrics.  James does the vocals on all the songs, so no crappy non vocalists singing nor growling.  The instrumentals seem to flow much better on here, mostly.  I forgot one major problem though.  Jordan Rhudes.  He rarely did anything right in this band.  He had some great moments on Scenes and Six Degrees, but even on the latter, he already showed he has no ability to solo.  He's fine I guess if left to doing background keyboards, but give him a chance to shine, and he plays circus music, and weird sound effects.  The production is pretty bad on here.  The guitars seem pushed way back in the mix, and during a couple choruses, to 2 of my favorite songs on here, I can barely hear the guitars over the keyboards which seem pushed way too  much fin the front in the mix.  James's vocals are very good as always, but the choruses on these songs needed some major work.  there were no instant classics.  They all sound like a bunch of extra songs on an album.  Granted there really isn't a bad song on here, but there isn't an instant great one either.  All that being said, once I got past the fact this isn't the great album I expected, and let the songs grow, it turned out to be a fairly good album.    On The Backs Of Angels 8/10 really grew on me.  I heard how great this song was, but was disappointed once I actually heard it.  Still it's a good opener that grew on me in time.  It's a slower heavier song that has a nice acoustic intro.  Somehow the melody gets stuck in my head, which surprised me.  Build Me Up Break Me Down 7/10 is kind of cheesy, but it is still enjoyable.  the lyrics sound like someone talking to someone who is either stalking them or thinks they're in love with them.  There are someturntable noises in here, that work ok, but they add to the cheesiness.  the melodies are ok, but again not spectacular.  Lost Not Forgotten 8/10 is a fairly good song, that starts with a pointless piano intro I cut off.  It's already an over 10 minute song, no need to add pointless parts that have no emotion, to them.  Overall this is a fairly heavy song, with a faster chorus.  This is one of the first songs to stick out for me.  This Is The Life 6/10 yawn.  It's a ballad, which doesn't automatically make it bad.  In fact Dream Theater have some great ballads, but this one's just boring.  Still it's not terrible, but this still hasn't grown that much on me.  Ok, but not great.  Bridges In The Sky 9/10 starts with some monks chanting, not a fan, but whatever.  Overall this is a really good song with a good chorus.  It's heavier too, which is nice after the last song.  Outcry 6/10 starts the part of the album that still suffers from mediocrity.  This middle to latter section just hasen't done much for me still.  With this song we get some heavier verses, which I really like the verses.  James's vocals during them are great, but I can't remember the chorus at all.  Course I'm also listening to the new Megadeth right now, so that may have something to do with it.  Overall it's still an ok song.  It's long.  I really don't like one section in the instrumental where the piano is featured.  Dream Theater has featured some great piano work, even some by Jordan, but this piece I wish wasn't there.  I don't know what it is, but this part bugs me.  Breaking All Illusions 5/10 is a big tease, like A Nightmare To Remember, and Glass Prison this song has a part that could've been the foundation to another song.  The song starts with an almost Maiden sounding guitar riff.  I was disappointed when it slowed.  The first verse and what could have been a chorus are soft, but they worked really well.  that part that could've been the chorus would've been the best chorus on the album.But alas.  The song  picks up and is heavier after that, and that part actually transitions well enough.  The actual chorus to the song is a disappointment compared to the first part.  Still overall this is a decent song, just teases you with glimpses of greatness.  There's also a piano and vocals song, can't remember the name, but I found it boring.  Beneath The aSurface 9/10 is my favorite song on the album, and one of the shortest.  This one's an acoustic song with great vocals.  This was a real treat to discover, because none of these songs did much at first, certainly not this one, and I grew to love it.  This song just oozes personal.  My only complaint is the keyboard solo.  Did they really need a keyboard solo in an acoustic song?  Songs like this Dream Theater rarely does, so it's nice to hear, but the keyboards are unnecessary on this one.  Otherwise this is a really beautiful way to end the album.  Overall this isn't the album I hoped for, but once I got over that, it turned out to be a fairly solid one, worthy of a Dream Theater fan's attention.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|I won't coment on the music as i guess everybody knows by now this is top drawer stuff.  For once i am completely delighted with the 'visual' part of the package (and the same goes for the Miles Davis DVD in the 40th anniversary box of Bitches Brew). Videos from this vintage are prone to have quality issues. This is in black and white and EXCELLENTLY shot. Many angles, camera is always there when the player is doing something of special interest, great framing, and good taste over all in composition, edition and lighting . These are all things that are rarely done properly in 'music videos'. The sound is not perfect but is very good and there is no distortion. Also, everybody is heard including Carter.   Man, this band was cooking. I wonder if we'll ever see another onP like Miles and his team. Probably not. But at least we can take a peak at what was the best jazz ever. Rarely have abstraction, elegance and tradition worked so well!
B004LROMQG|4.0|For those not in the know, the BBC's \\"Merlin\\" is to Arthurian legend what [[ASIN:B004XWLN20 Smallville]] is to the Superman mythos: a long-running prequel that explores the lives of various individuals before they become the renowned figures of legend. In this case, \\"Merlin\\" is based on the evolution of its four main characters: Merlin (Colin Morgan) as he grows from inexperienced youth to wise mentor, Arthur (Bradley James), who progresses from prattish prince to noble king, Morgana (Katie McGrath), whose fall into darkness provides the show's most tragic arc, and Guinevere (Angel Coulby), a young servant girl who will one day be Queen of Camelot.<br /><br />Rounding out the cast is Anthony Head as King Uther, an uncompromising ruler whose persecution of magic provides the main conflict of the show (for Merlin must keep his innate powers a secret at all costs) and Richard Wilson as Gaius the court physician, who lends support and advice to Merlin. It is these characters and the range of complex relationships they share, whether familial, romantic or antagonistic, that make the show so appealing. The entire cast is immensely talented, share amazing chemistry with one another, and are backed up by reoccurring guest-stars as other familiar characters from legend: Emilia Fox as Morgause, Santiago Cabrera as Lancelot, and John Hurt as the voice of the Great Dragon. With beautiful visuals and surprisingly good special effects, \\"Merlin\\" is suited for a family audience. There's nothing here that's too traumatizing for young viewers, though it does get darker as the series goes on.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Nothing too drastic, more character-related than plot-related, and most of it pertaining to the first two episodes.<br /><br />*<br />*<br />*<br /><br />The third series picks up a year after the season two finale, during which the main cast has been diligently searching the kingdom for Morgana. Spirited away at the end of [[ASIN:B003ES5JII series two]] by her half-sister Morgause, only Merlin knows the true reason for her disappearance and his culpability in it (it's a bit of a long story, and obviously you'll want to watch the first two series before jumping headfirst into the third one). Arthur and Merlin are searching for her in enemy territory when a familiar figure stumbles out of the mist: Morgana! She is whisked back to Camelot, much to the joy of her foster-father Uther, but Merlin is not so sure she can be trusted. As an army marches upon Camelot at the behest of Morgause, it becomes apparent that there is a traitor within the walls of Camelot, a discovery that sets up the arc of the entire season.<br /><br />With thirteen episodes in all, season three of \\"Merlin\\" is a bit of a mixed bag - mostly good, but with a few missed opportunities that prevent it from being truly exceptional entertainment. But first, the good stuff. The series opener and finale (\\"The Tears of Uther Pendragon\\" and \\"The Coming of Arthur\\") are both two-parters, and are the best that the show has ever been. These four episodes are filmic in terms of the storytelling, visual effects and emotional punch on display. We get our clearest glimpse yet of the future that it to come, what with the reappearance of Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake, the introduction of the Round Table Knights, and that glorious final shot of...well, I'd better not give it away. It's wonderful, stirring stuff.<br /><br />Between our four young actors a great dynamic is at work. Arthur and Guinevere's love story begins to develop from puppy love into something more serious, and if you thought that the pairing was a little rushed in the second series, give it another chance. Here the writers allow the couple to flirt and laugh and enjoy each other's company, and as a result Bradley and Angel's chemistry feels much more natural. Meanwhile, Colin and Katie channel a very different kind of chemistry as former-friends Merlin and Morgana draw their line in the sand and find themselves on opposite sides. Their scenes together are nothing short of electrifying as Morgana strives to bring down the Pendragons and Merlin attempts to oppose her at every turn whilst protecting his own secret.<br /><br />Among the new characters that are introduced this season are the future Knights of the Round Table, providing heroics and eye-candy in equal measure. There are also some great episodes such as \\"The Crystal Cave\\" and \\"The Eye of the Phoenix\\" which do a great job of melding elements of Arthurian legend with the show's own vision.<br /><br />But...there's a downside. To my mind at least, there are two major problems at work in season three that prevent it from getting a five-star rating.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment of season three is what was meant to be its trump-card: Morgana. A prequel's success lies in the journey that characters take to predetermined destinations. We all KNOW where Merlin, Morgana, Arthur and Guinevere end up. What we're interested in is HOW they get to those places, and Morgana's fall from a spoilt but essentially good-hearted young woman to the evil enchantress of legend undoubtedly held the most potential for a dramatic character-arc.<br /><br />Morgana had been established as a brave, impulsive, passionate woman who was frightened by her growing powers and terrified of Uther's hatred of magic despite his love for her. We had seen for ourselves how dangerous she could be when crossed and how gifted she was with the art of manipulation. Hers was a personality that could quite easily be corrupted by fear and hatred, whilst still remaining sympathetic and defensible given her circumstances - after all, Morgana's main goal is to destroy a genocidal tyrant. For any writer, this set-up would be considered pure gold.<br /><br />And so it is a bitter disappointment to discover that the Morgana who returns to Camelot is not a dangerous and intelligent adversary with justifiable goals, divided loyalties and complex motivation, but rather nothing more than a petty caricature of evil. Her plans are illogical and convoluted, and thus fail without exception. She turns on Arthur and Guinevere without hesitation or remorse, taking sadistic pleasure in tormenting them for no apparent reason. There is a perpetual smirk on her face that nobody ever seems to notice. Despite the terrifying prospect of a traitor within the walls of Camelot, she poses no viable threat whatsoever and is continually thwarted by Merlin with almost laughable ease.<br /><br />Katie McGrath plays the part with relish, but for reasons best known to them, the writers took their most fascinating character and turned her into their most one-dimensional, void of any kind of sympathy, reason, or consistency. Not only has Morgana's past nuance been obliterated, but the events that could have explained this shift in personality took place entirely OFF SCREEN in the missing year between series two and three. It's a baffling creative decision, especially when one considers how fascinating her character-arc could have been.<br /><br />The other big disappointment of season three is the writer's steadfast refusal to move their plots forward. Much of the season is simply filler, and the stalling tactics are enough to wear the patience of any viewer. Every time there seems to be some sort of forward momentum in the story-arc, the writers veer off into irrelevant side-plots, skipping over what could have been fascinating material in favor of comedic farce, recycled plotlines, and one-shot guest stars. This has the added consequence of making the characters seem remarkably stupid, as they fail to follow up on leads or to ask questions that would have pushed the stories forward into new and interesting territory. For instance, it's ridiculous that neither Morgana nor Morgause think to question the fact that Merlin was able to escape the magical chains that they bind him with; or that Arthur and Uther wouldn't try to discover the identityof the traitor after the magical sabotage during the siege on Camelot.<br /><br />Why don't they do these things? Simply because if they did, the writers would be forced to move the story forward into places they (for whatever reason) don't want to go yet. Unfortunately it really achieves nothing except to make their characters seem dense, and waste a lot of good material.  Other times ideas are raised only to be ignored - there was a chance to explore Gwen's character further what with the introduction of her brother and her discovery of Morgana's magic, but nothing ever comes of these plot-points.<br /><br />The status-quo is finally shaken up at the end of the series, but by exorcising all the filler throughout the series, the events of \\"The Coming of Arthur\\" could have easily been stretched out over five or so episodes. We could have seen more of Morgana's reign, more of Gwen in the role of a spy, more of Uther's suffering, more of Arthur living rough in the woods, gathering his allies, and planning a counter-attack to win back his kingdom, more of Merlin and the future knights training and getting to know one another and working as a team to create La Resistance - you know, all the *interesting* stuff that inexplicably happens off-screen.<br /><br />Am I being too harsh? Maybe. \\"Merlin\\" has never pretended to be anything but fun and frivolous family entertainment, and in that it does the job. But so often it misses out on being something very brave and different, held back by the writers' (or producers') reluctance to give up the pointless standalone episodes in favor of a larger, more complex arc in which their characters can behave logically and develop naturally. With season four due to start very soon, I'm hoping that the show is finally ready to grow up and realize its potential.without exception.

B005G4TJI4|4.0|Optimus Prime and the Autobots are back in this third installation of Transformers.  I am hesitant to call this a trilogy as each story-line fails to support a continuance of the previous.  Nonetheless, this was a far better movie than the second.  The effects in this film are second to none; I have watched this film in HD as well as 3D and was definitely pleased.    The story is self-contained.  The Autobots, losing a war on Cybertron, attempt an escape with valuable technology that could change the war in their favor.  The Autobot vessel crash lands on the moon, and this in effect starts a space race between the US and the Russians.  A space race that abruptly ends without any real explanation (the reason behind Chernobyl was also a nice touch).  Unfortunately, betrayal changes the fates of many and is the cause for the loss of a comrade.  In the meantime, despite graduating from an ivy league school and receiving a medal from Obama himself, Sam (like most Americans today) struggles to find a job, and is caught between his new love and trying to prove his self-importance.    If you view this movie through the eyes of a 10 year old, you can ignore minor details like the Matrix of Leadership (wasn't that destroyed in the second movie by Prime himself) and since when did Decepticons bleed or were torn apart so easily.  This movie was meant to be enjoyed as an action-packed flick and in action, it did not disappoint.  The accompanying music was great, Linkin Park was brought in again, this time with 'Iridescent' as well as other artists.  The freeway scene about an hour into the movie was one of my favorites.  The new Autobots were refreshing (I like Dino); and nothing against General Motors, but it was nice to see other nameplates (Dodge and Mercedes) in the movie, though I did miss the other two Chevys, Mudflap and Skids.  Though a bit lacking in story/plot, this film made up for it in action, script, special effects and acting.  Sam and his parents had me laughinga lot, Simmons and Dutch are an awesome duo, and Charlotte Merring (Director of Intelligence and Simmons' ex-girl) was just too real a character.  All the actors deserve their praise.  They did a great job.  I definitely would recommend this movie (especially in Blu-Ray).
B00129H7VS|5.0|Amazing piece of history. It's truly inpiring and very well done. My best series so far. It's good to remind us what was the price that these guys paid for our today's freedom.

B005KAH7QU|5.0|Great action, suspenseful and a good story.  The acting is very good.  It definitely feels like the beginning of a trilogy.
B005LLXB9K|3.0|Really enjoyed this movie, but since it's going to be on Public Television in HiDef for free 10/21/11, why should I buy the lower-quality DVD version...?  Because we were promised 4 hours of extra footage, good reason!  But this release description says only 29 minutes of extra footage.  Hopefully, the description is wrong.  Or, the 4-hour version is a different, higher-priced product (how could PJ do that to us haha?)  Also, would like to see the BluRay because the newly-shot footage is HD quality.... hate to see it printed-down!  --Gary
B003ES61EE|5.0|My camera lens seems to attract smudges - I don't know how I do it but I seem to get finger prints on the lens a lot. The first thing I learned about my camera was do not use a normal cloth to clean the lens because it will scratch it. But sometimes I have nothing else to use. Now that I have tried the AmazonBasics Lens Pen Cleaning system I will never take my camera anywhere without it.<br />It is very easy to use and does a great job of cleaning the lens. Does not leave a film behind. The compact size makes it easy to carry in my camera bag, or even in my purse.<br />This is a must have product that you will be glad you purchased!
0061537969|5.0|An amazingly written story about family life through a dogs eyes. I'm sure that my already existing love of dogs added to my love of this book, but even if you aren't a dog lover this is still a good read. After reading this book I found myself talking to my dog as though she had a higher understanding of the way the world works.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|My setup is a 51\\" flat panel mounted on the wall with center of TV roughly about 4 feet above the ground. We had Kinect camera 2 feet from the floor, but it worked better being above the TV at around 5 feet'ish. We were standing about 6 - 8 feet way, with width coverage also about 6-7 feet.  With Zoom installed, the Kinect Tuneup could not see our hands at the previous distance of 6-7 feet, but it can see us at around 2-3 feet from the TV. The width that the camera with Zoom also reduced from 6-7 feet (at 6-8 feet away) to about 4 feet, the width of our 51\\" TV. Kinect Tuneup shows the image of me with less detail and with very dark surrounding (instead of night vision greenish color of the camera without Zoom).  My attempt to setup was during bright day, where the light source was back of the camera so the video pictures are clean and visible (not grainy).  I didn't try going back to have camera  2 feet from the ground, so I can't comment on its effectiveness.  For now, I still prefer to make room with the standard Kinect at 6-7 feet away, instead of dealing with uncertainties from 2-3 feet away.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|this is a good cd I love everthing about it.I am a hage Taylor Swift fan.I think this the best Taylor Swift cd out her three cd.
B0017V7GTY|3.0|If you've ever wondered if a band could take Bruce Springsteen's throwaway songs, rest assured the answer is, \\"Yes.\\"  The band's name?  The Gaslight Anthem.<br /><br />I'll be brief, because the editorial review pretty much says all you need to know about this album and this band:  \\"Their Side One Dummy debut reconciles their love of classic rock and soul icons Bruce Springsteen, Otis Redding, and Tom Petty with their NJ punk roots to create a unique musical amalgam.\\"  After reviewing the band's debut album, \\"Sink or Swim,\\" I grit my teeth and gave these guys a second chance.  Much to my surprise, they didn't let me down, though they also didn't impress me all that much.<br /><br />Instead of sounding like they're trying to rip off The Boss and Social D's Mike Ness, they sound much more like they're paying homage to their idols.  For the most part, anyway.  On tracks like \\"Old White Lincoln\\" and \\"Meet Me by the River's Edge\\"--among a few others--Springsteen's passions for telling tales about large bodies of water and classic cars come rushing back.  Maybe it's a Jersey thing, I don't know....<br /><br />All in all, this is a decent record, though not one I'd find myself wanting to listen to all too often.  A marked improvement for the band, without a doubt.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|I love it she is the best.I love it when I heard what the hell and I was like is this Avril and like omg i had to find out when the cd come out!!!!!!!!!!
B003FK8V7G|4.0|Having listened to this band's output in chronological order--\\"Sink or Swim\\" followed by \\"The '59 Sound\\" followed by \\"American Slang\\"--I finally feel like I've heard the true heart and soul of the Gaslight Anthem.  It's been a slow progression from the Springsteen/Social D clones that appeared on \\"Sink or Swim,\\" and while the journey, at least for me, has been less than enjoyable, it feels good to see this band emerge with an album that both feels and sounds distinctly theirs.  Sure, there are a few hints of their Springsteen-influenced songwriting, most noticeably on \\"The Diamond Church Street Choir\\" and \\"Old Haunts,\\" but the rest of the album takes on a life of its own.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the stand-out track on this record is \\"The Spirit of Jazz.\\"  This is the first Gaslight Anthem song I ever heard, and it's my absolute favorite.  If they could write and play all their songs with this much energy...wow, that would be an album truly worth hearing.  Fortunately, there are other songs with enough strength to support the oh, so obvious lead single:  \\"Boxer,\\" \\"Stay Lucky,\\" and the album's title track.<br /><br />The album ends on a quiet note with the nostalgiac, almost sad \\"We Did It When We Were Young,\\" which comes across as a statement of growth for this young band from Jersey and really helps to round out the record.  It helps to give shape to the overall statement of growth and reflection heard on \\"American Slang\\" and is a big leap forward for the band.  I only hope their next album is at least as good as this.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I Taylor Swift she is the best. I love how she always has good music and this is something everyone would love.You get good cd with Taylor Swift!!!!
B003L77GGK|5.0|I sure do love me some Supernatural! Had to watch it all again before season premiere this Friday!!! I recommend this to all fans, non-fans, and human beings in general...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Fun hames needs more levels added to continue the fun of playing this game.  a blast for the family and eveyone loves it.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|I hadn't seen it mentioned elsewhere, so I thought I should mention that the main feature has optional English subtitles.  The 7 short prequels do not.
B00004YC2F|3.0|Volodos performance is crisp and well executed. Very nice. However, I find little emotional ties to the music interpretation and to me it feels a bit shallow and lacking in luster and passion. There are many Rach 3 recordings, among the top I consider Gutierrez's recordings of the Rach 3 to be the best recording to date. The sound quality and orchestral support for Gutierrez proves to be a magical combination.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I just bought this, and unlike other fellow Opeth fans... I'm not disappointed by any means. Although this album has taken a complete detour from the death metal genre and taken a more experimental approach, I can still notice the talent and originality which is what I love and appreciate about music. Classic prog rock/fusion while keeping the same atmospheric sound (thanks again to the creative musical genius of Mr. Steven Wilson)... minus the dark and haunting inspirational death metal. I wasn't sure what to expect from Heritage and after my first listen... I'll be honest I was a little dissapointed myself, but the more I listen to it, the more I love it and appreciate it! I have to hear talent in my music, and believe me.. it's here! And as far as other Opeth fans anticipating this release and being bored and dissapointed with it, keep in mind you have nine other Opeth albums to satisfy your hardcore headbangin' needs. Just be grateful what Opeth has given us over the years and give this one a chance. Mikael Akerfeldt has been growling and headbanging since 1994, I can't blame him for wanting to do something different for a change. Believe me I've been a metal head all my life and Opeth has always been one of my favorite bands and still is. I'm loving where they're going with this. If I ever feel the need for their brutal dark and haunting heavy metal sound again, I can always go back to Blackwater Park or Ghost Reveries \m/. My hat's off to Opeth for this different approach. Sounds good! Change is good!
B005EVVESM|5.0|I have been a fan of Maroon 5 since \\"Songs About Jane\\" and I am still not disappointed, they really delivered on this album, Misery hooked me in, but it does not end with this great song, the follow up \\"Give A Little More\\" was just as magnetic, and the back up vocals make me wanna sing along as I drive (but I don't),and \\"Don't Know Nothing\\" was another great one with excellent back up vocals that has sing along potential.  And they break away completely from type with the title track \\"Hands All Over\\" the funky guitar, vocals just sends this song into orbit, one of the best on this album, until \\"Runaway\\", great harmonizing, great, which I hope they perform live, because they would kill it!!!, Great album, great vocals, looking forward to seeing what they do next, keep it coming!!!
0439023521|5.0|Katniss, a sixteen year old girl tribute from district 12, is forced to compete till death in The Hunger Games. She makes new friends and new relationships that lead to tragic and happy endings.  She has to fight through not being with family and the weather that the Game makers make harder to survive. Each night she listens to the Game anthem and sees everyone that died that day, and thinks to herself, I can be next. Katniss goes through days of starvation and without water. She must find a way to survive. But when the game makers make an unexpected twist, will she win the games after all? The Hunger Games was an amazing book! I thought this because there was a lot of action and fighting between the tributes and many unexpected twist. Such as in the beginning, when her sister Prim name is called instead of Katniss. If you like watching Survivor, you would like to read The Hunger Games.  It's a social and physical game, where only the strongest and smartest players survive
0345528581|5.0|This is an awesome book. The programs are very well laid out and easy to follow. The 125 different exercises are great and are well explained. I know a lot of people complain that you do need some equipment, like a pull-up bar or heavy objects. I find that these are easy to come by and not to expensive. The main selling point of the book is not having to spend a lot of money on gym memberships or equipment and it delivers in that aspect.
B004CAFUOU|5.0|Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted.

B005BJ7Y54|5.0|I have heard of Girls in the past, but never bothered with a full album before \\"Father, Son, Holy Ghost\\". I'm kicking myself now because I can't believe I missed this group on their debut. There is something at once familiar, and yet utterly fresh and infectious about the songs on this record. Musical revisionism is nothing new, but like another recent favourite of mine, Ariel Pink, the band mix enough love and new ideas together with the old to make the whole thing come alive.   The reviews before this one do a much better job of explaining its virtues than I can, but suffice to say this is a must listen album for anyone who considers themself a fan of modern pop/rock.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|We saw a hint of things to come with the brilliant \\"Watershed\\" a few years back.  While there were still a few measures of death metal roaring still present,  it was not hard to predict Mikeal Akerfeldt's breaking away from those grunting vocals and open the way for a huge boost in melody and meloncholy.  The album \\"Damnation\\" was also a clean vocals album but much more mild and frankly, for all its brilliance, a very mournful album fit for a cloudy drizzly day when the whole world seems to be in a funk.<br />  \\"Heritage\\" isn't a follow-up to \\"Damnation\\" so don't let those comparisons throw you off.  It's really quite simple.  Why grunt and growl when you have a voice like Akerfeldt's?  It is a waste of one of the most beautiful singing voices in popular music.  \\"Burden\\", from \\"Watershed\\" could and should have been a monster single, crashing into FM radio territory like the classic cut it is instead of being tucked away for Opeth fans.  While one doesn't and shouldn't really care about that \\"breakthrough\\", it would sure be a nice payday for a band that certainly has earned and deserves one, but that would mean making room for twits who are singing through synthesizer vocoders and sound like electric mouse farts.<br />  The sound has taken a turn in the way back machine to the seventies and prog heaven.  You can hear the thickness and the feel of the old analog sound, including somewhat muffled drums.  Flutes scurry about, a cheesy Hammond style organ flavors everything, and you can't help but feel the long arm of early Yes and maybe even Jethro Tull reaching out with their influence.  The big difference is that Opeth, Mikael Akerfeldt in particular, is a superior songwriter and vocalist, not to mention guitarist.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|The films are classic. The packaging is fabulous. The quality of the audio and video is definitely a huge upgrade over DVD. Not much more to be said. A must own in my opinion. I love the THX clip at the end of the films. Its worth viewing the entire credits to hear that.
1933492910|5.0|Terryl Whitlatch is so talented, and this book of her animal illustrations and drawings is amazing. Her realistic animal illustrations and orthographic drawings are beautiful and informative. Her creature designs are inspiring- my teenage sister saw this book sitting on my desk and started looking through it, and later that day, she had pages of drawings of her own fantastic imaginative creatures!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|It is so hard for me to believe that &quot;Dr. Who&quot; is considered a children's program in England.  Maybe the new Who's, especially with Tennant and Smith, are changing that. They have pretty &quot;big&quot; themes, interesting and exciting to sci-fi loving adults. I am a true-blue fan, collecting the DVD sets of the original Dr. Who's (which I originally recorded onto VHS from the TV!) as well as the new Dr. Who's.<br /><br />Series 6 of Dr. Who was produced and aired in two sections, with a short hiatus inbetween.  The first seven episodes were broadcast in spring 2011.  The last six episodes are still being aired in Sept. 2011. That is why Series 6 was broken into two separate DVD releases, known as Part 1 and Part 2.<br /><br />Before Series 6 Part 1 started, there was the 2010 Christmas Special, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.  I watched that on TV and the ending was pretty emotional, a thoughtful well-done Christmas-y Dickens-like show.  &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was NOT included in the DVD Series 6 - Part 1.  However, it IS included in this &quot;Doctor Who: The Complete Sixth Series&quot;.<br /><br />Following is a list of all the episodes for Series 6 which are included in this Complete Sixth Series. A couple of them are just plain good old adventure stories, such as &quot;The Curse of the Black Spot&quot;, with a great twist on the myth of the siren and her ability to call sailors to their doom. &quot;The Doctor's Wife&quot; is also a favorite of mine. The Doctor answers a Time Lord distress call and is trapped with the gruesome Auntie and Uncle and the downright weird Idris. But Idris isn't who or what she seems and her interaction with the Doctor is fabulous.<br /><br />Other episodes have themes which carry forward into following episodes, and, to tell the truth, I sometimes had a little trouble keeping track of everything.  But that's one good reason for me to buy them on DVD, I get to watch this great sci-fi storytelling all over again, and catch the nuances and details I might have missed the first time.<br /><br />1.  &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; - Awesome story of forgiveness and life-altering love.<br /><br />2.  &quot;The Impossible Astronaut&quot;  -  Finally we find out just what &quot;The Silence&quot; is. It was The Silence that caused the TARDIS to explode at the end of Series 5.  Worth watching just to see a puzzled but game Richard Nixon (played excellently by Stuart Milligan).<br /><br />3.  &quot;Day of the Moon&quot;  -  A continuation and completion of the Doctor's dealings with The Silence. The circumstances reminded me some of the movie, &quot;Memento&quot;. What would you do if you could not remember something as soon as you turned away from it?<br /><br />4. &quot;The Curse of the Black Spot&quot;<br /><br />5. &quot;The Doctor's Wife&quot;<br /><br />6. &quot;The Rebel Flesh&quot; - Part 1 of a two-part story. A solar tsunami throws the TARDIS onto 22nd century Earth. We know of robots used in conditions where a human could not work. What if you could create dopplegangers of yourself to do the hazardous work? [Sidebar: Recommended sci-fi reading, &quot;Kiln People&quot;, by David Brin.]<br /><br />7. &quot;The Almost People&quot; - Part 2 continuation. What if those dopplegangers decided to rebel?<br /><br />8. &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; - This is where the background story gets very convoluted. An Almost People is involved, and Amy and Rory's baby, Melody, is kidnapped. River refuses to help the doctor because it is during this war that he will learn her identity. THAT is worth waiting for. I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />9. &quot;Let's Kill Hitler&quot; - A human crew from the future wants to kill Hitler and change the future.  A dilemma. Who wouldn't think the world would be a better place if Hitler could be stopped before he reached full power? Convoluted back story.<br />[I stand corrected. A comment correctly points out that the humans didn't want to kill Hitler, they wanted to collect him for incarceration for his crimes against humanity.]<br /><br />10. &quot;Night Terrors&quot; - Eight-year old George is terrified of monsters in his bedroom. But, naturally, it's not that simple, nothing with the Doctor ever is.<br /><br />11. &quot;The Girl Who Waited&quot; - The Doctor takes Amy and Rory to Apalapucia for a well-deserved vacation. Unfortunately, they land before they find out that the whole planet is suffering from a plague that kills creatures with two hearts. Amy gets separated, and waits 36 years for the doctor to find her, and she's not happy about it.<br /><br />12. &quot;The God Complex&quot; - The Doctor and friends are trapped in an alien &quot;hotel&quot;, where opening the wrong door leads to possession and death.<br /><br />13. &quot;Closing Time&quot; - Remember Craig Owens?  The Docter moved in and became his roommate in the Series 5 episode, &quot;The Lodger&quot;. The Doctor decides to visit him. And Cybermen show up somehow. This episode hasn't been aired as the time I write this review.<br /><br />14. &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot; - There are some spoilers out there about what is in the last episode, but the actual plot is a closely guarded secret until it airs on October 1, 2011.

B005974CNA|5.0|This new album with new drummer Mike Mangini is just as strong as any other DT release.  You either love DT or you hate them, that's pretty much the way it goes...  Anyhow, I was a bit nervous with the whole new drummer thing, but Mangini proves he's more than capable.  The song selection has a good mix of heavy and not-so-heavy.  \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" (heavy) seems like it could have belonged on James Labrie's Static Impulse album for those who have that CD.  Good album for those of you who DON'T have it.  \\"Far From Heaven\\" and \\"Beneath the Surface\\" are the two \\"not-so-heavy\\" tracks on this album.  Both are beautiful tracks, just not \\"heavy\\".<br /><br />My one \\"flaw\\" in this album is this: I was so psyched to hear the drums on this album, only to find out they seemed to be mixed a bit too low.  BUMMER!  Also, since the songs had already been written before Mangini joined the band, I feel that they might have been a little better had he been part of the writing process.  That's something to look forward to on the NEXT album.  I think once he's able to put in his \\"two cents\\" as far as what the drums will be, things will improve greatly.<br /><br />So, in light of those minor complaints, I still have to give this album a 5 mainly for the fact that DT shows they can \\"make do\\" even though they've lost a long time member.  And I WAS sad to see Portnoy go, but, as they say \\"No use crying over spilled milk\\".) I look forward to seeing what else Mangini can bring to the band...
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This was a wonderfully researched and produced movie about a (in some circles) well known figure in ancient history that was central to a turning point in Western and Christian history.  It was beautifully filmed and produced and the central figure was wonderfully played by Rachael Weiss.  It is largely historically as accurate as it probably can be with the exception of the ending which was tastefully restricted to  eliminate the horrific final acts with the body of the central character perpetrated by the Christians.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I'm reviewing the packaging for this product.  This is supposed to be the shining crown of someone's collection and you get the discs in a booklet, slid into sleeves on each page.  The LOTR Blu-ray set is packaged 100 times better than this junk.  Epic Fail.
0345529057|3.0|I liked the story line, and the characters are interesting...but the violence made me sick (graphic and cruel...and frequent!) and all the sex and incest made me uncomfortable.   If you are completely desensitized to violence and if incest and rape does not phase you then you might like this series.  If the other hadn't been so indulgent in the sex 'scenes' and graphic murders, I would give it 5 stars.

0307946711|2.0|I agree 100% with Gregory B., one of the reviewers below. I loved the very first part of the book and had high hopes, which were dashed over and over until it got so tiring and then things got a little too convenient. I'd recommend skipping this book.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|The Blu-ray disk of the show which can be found at this link [[ASIN:B004I2K4E8 Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]] has one of the best performances (Norm Lewis as Javert) and one of the worst performances (Nick Jonas as Marius.) I concur with fellow reviewer Philip Wells who wrote, \\"Nick Jonas is a complete distraction in this show. His Marius has none of the depth that previous performers have given that role.\\" I could not agree him with more.  Pop star Jonas Brother Nick singlehandedly ruined the 25th anniversary performance. His voice was embarrassing as was his delicate, almost hesitant, overall performance. I also agree with Philip Wells who mentioned that when they finally brought out the 1985 cast, Colm Wilkinson he triumphed.  His voice was so astounding singing Bring Him Home that, although the three other Jean Valjeans sang too, it was Colm Wilkinson's song alone right up until the last pure high note which only Wilkinson could achieve and hold perfectly for so long. The greatest strength of the 25th Anniversary Cast was  Norm Lewis as Javert. Lewis' immense strength, expression, intensity, posture and clarity of voice made it clear Norm Lewis is the epitome of the conflicted Inspector Javert. While the greatest Jean Valjean will always be Colm Wilkinson,  Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean gave an exceedingly strong performance despite looking a bit young; but then he wasn't in charge of make-up so he cannot be blamed for that. His presence, expressions, and above all, voice made him a great choice for the 25th Anniversary Concert.   Robert Madge as Gavroche is outstanding! Such energy, such talent, such adorable smirks! (too Bad \\"Little People\\" and Gavroche's brief death scene were omitted.) Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras made a great heartthrob but it was the commitment in his powerful voice that made him the premier student rebel leader. Karimloo was clearly a ideal casting choice.    Finally, the lighting in this production was the most outstanding innovation; it being so effective that it gave the show a great dramatic effect only seen the stage version (and hopefully will be seen in the promised film.)  If you can deal with a pale imitation of Marius, buy this Blu-ray for the show including the postlude providing music with the current London cast, the original 1985 cast, the 25th Anniversary  Concert cast and the the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary touring production.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I remember thinking that Thor couldn't possibly be a cool character. He just seemed like such a farfetched and unrealistic part of the Marvel superhero family. He didn't fit in; he was mythology, not Marvel. That was until sometime back in 2008 when I read all 800 pages combined of Mark Millar's epic collections of [[ASIN:0785110828 The Ultimates]] & [[ASIN:0785121382 The Ultimates 2]]. Those books were nothing short of amazing, and those books introduced me to the Marvel gang in a whole new light, especially Thor. Thor quickly became one of my favorite Marvel characters after reading Millar's books. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor and does the character supreme justice. Kenneth Branagh directs and together the entire cast and crew turn out one excellent film.<br /><br />For starting a war of the realms in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, Thor is banished to Earth by his father (Anthony Hopkins), the King of Asgard, leaving Thor's brother Loki as the potential heir to the throne. And something's not quite right with Loki. With the help of mainly Natalie Portman, Thor must find redemption and once again become a worthy defender of Asgard. There's one catch: in Thor's banishment he was stripped of Mjolnir, his all-powerful Hammer that also holds his superpowers.<br /><br />Much of the movie is spent making a \\"good guy\\" out of Thor after a relatively rough introduction to his character. In the end it's all worth it, because you're really rooting for him by the film's finale. And the after credits scene suggests that Thor will have no minor part in 2012's Avengers film. So Thor 2011 is a successful and exciting intro the character for events yet to happen in a future film(s).<br /><br />Joss Whedon is writing and directing The Avengers and I'm not sure whether his plan is to follow Mark Millar's storyline. Personally I hope so. Whedon has done some great stuff in his career and some, well, let's just say not so great. But that's a matter of my opinion and based on the NO votes that I received for my review of Whedon's [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity]] project, I am perhaps in the minority for worrying about Whedon at the helm. We shall see. In the meantime...see Thor.or my review of Whedon's [[ASIN:B000BW7QWW Serenity]] project, I am perhaps in the minority for worrying about Whedon at the helm. We shall see.

B005974C94|5.0|Clapton Marsalis plays The blues @ The Rose Room Lincoln Center<br /><br />I was @ The orginal show in April and loved it then and I love it now on DVD<br />But I must say that based some of the reviews on Amazon....<br />I say this....<br /><br />CLAPTON FANS PLEASE GROW UP....<br />Eric has grown up how bout you...<br /><br />This is two different artists of different training melding into one and Clapton is going for another challenge and nails it with great interpretion and ripping solos and thank GOD for Carlos suggestioning Layla \\" This an absolute classic and will be for years to come...<br /><br />Marsalis, Artistic Director  of Jazz at Lincoln Center and nine-time Grammy® Award winner, writes about his collaboration with Clapton, a 19-time Grammy recipient, in the album's liner notes: \\"...we wanted these concerts to sound like people playing music they know and love, not like a project.\\"<br /><br />To help them achieve that level of devotion, Marsalis and Clapton were joined on stage by Dan Nimmer (piano), Carlos Henriquez (bass), Ali Jackson (drums), Marcus Printup (trumpet), Victor Goines (clarinet), Chris Crenshaw (trombone, vocals), Don Vappie (banjo) and Clapton's longtime keyboardist/sideman Chris Stainton. Marsalis says the group combined the sound of an early blues jump-band with the sound of New Orleans jazz to accommodate the integration of guitar/trumpet lead, a combination that gave the musicians the latitude to play different grooves, from the Delta to the Caribbean and beyond.<br /><br />The band nimbly navigated a diverse set list that touched on different styles, from the four-on-the-floor swing of Louis Armstrong's \\"Ice Cream\\" and the southern slow-drag of W.C. Handy's \\"Joe Turner's Blues\\" to the traveling blues of \\"Joliet Bound\\" and the boogie-woogie jump of \\"Kidman Blues.\\" After opening the shows with his solo set, Mahal returned to join the band on \\"Corrine, Corrina\\" and the New Orleans funeral standard \\"Just A Closer Walk With Thee.\\"<br /><br />The one song not selected by Clapton for the show was his own \\"Layla,\\" which was requested by bassist Henriquez and arranged as a Crescent City dirge to tremendous results. On his review of the performance, David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"In the [song's] instrumental break, Clapton hit a series of stabbing licks lightly crusted with distortion, followed by Marsalis' slow parade of clean hurting peals - a moving dialogue in lovesickness and blues routes.\\"Layla,\\" which was requested by bassist Henriquez and arranged as a Crescent City dirge to tremendous results.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|The movie was really great with a very plausible story and great acting by all.  It was casted and directed very well and echoes of the original POTA feature films but with a modern edge to it.  The movie ties in the original series where the apes actually DO take over where before, in the 70's versions, we do not actually see this.  And true to the original version, humans are affected by a virus although the original version has a different cause than the modern version.  I like this version better because it is far more convincing in the whole take over process.  What bothered me a bit is the overly animated movement of the chimps.  When an animal motion is animated in computer or hand drawn, it is once removed from life.  Then it is twice removed from life when it is transferred to film or some other media process.  So it is important for the animators to get it right without overdoing it but with enough \\"animated\\" behavior that we get it and are convinced by it.    I didn't quite feel that I was convinced and it wasn't because of the quality of the CG but rather it was the movements.  They were a bit unnatural in various parts of their actions.  The chimps didn't have the heft and weight to them and even some of their moves were overly exaggerated, particularly in Ceasar's behavior as a young chimp.  As a baby, there is very little movement in baby chimps, more clingy and subdued.  They have an instinct to coddle.  As Ceasar grew to be two and three years old, the movements were too rubbery and practically bouncing off the walls instead of looking like heavy, swift, and robust like he is supposed to be.  The apes throughout also moved way too quickly and lightly whereas apes in general have a more weightiness to them.  These animated apes seemed a bit too bouncy and almost too wiggly at times.  This was especially true of the orangutangs.  Orangutangs generally move very slowly and these guys were like spider monkies when they swung around.   Before you start beating me up for my comments, (I teach animal motion and biomechanics in an animal drawing and anatomy class for a university and many of my students are 2-D artists and 3-D animators, just so you know.  I've studied animal motion and behavior for years - and even train animals.  My experience may be more limited than some but enough to know that some of the action was a bit more exaggerated and it did'nt have to be!  That being said, it was a really great film and I eventually lost my critiqing part of my brain after a while and settled in to the movie.  The story was written extremely well.  It was fresh while still keeping step with the 70's original tone.  It was a convincing story, acted well, and had humanity elements in it, fitting for our concerns of our modern times.  The full gamut of human emotions played through this movie, ribboning its way through wave after wave.  Love and compassion pendulated between rage and extreme frustration, we see the world through Ceasar's eyes and his scientist human.  In the end there is the final the taste of sweet revenge and freedom.  The action and plots played out at a great pace also and there were no segways or layers that were not relevant. The movie is pretty fast paced and exciting all the way!  Amazingly done well and absolutely fantastic was the facial expressions that came across so convincingly.  The apes had amazingly realistic expressions (and they had to because they lacked story telling dialog) and their emotions were so clearly read.  The acting with the eyes and body language rang so clear that even a human could read the emotions from their posture and gaze.  Real apes do display various emotional expressions without contorting their faces but this movie went a step further.  Ceasar was a far more sophisticated creature than his brothers so his face revealed a higher intellectual process and you can really see the wheels turning in his eyes!  What a fantastic job!   The whole movie was an amazing production for everyone involved.  Especially the actors and digital animators - they should really be commended and get a award for this.  Awesome job!  There were more layers in this movie than the straight line of the original ape sagas.  The multi-layered story worked well and everything wrapped into other layers, coming together at the end.  It is a great movie in spite of my critical comments, and I'm buying my copy soon!

B004TACMZ8|3.0|The Bosch GMS120 Digital Multi-Scanner is slightly better than a few other, similar products I've used in the past, but it's still far from perfect. The thing is, if I'm drilling through some plaster and hit some wiring, it doesn't comfort me to know that about 70% of the time this thing is accurate. It's really got to be 100% accurate to be at all useful.   So, yes, this is better than nothing, and the overall design is very convenient, but I'm still holding out for something that gets it right every single time.

My wife who could care less about 1080p and 1000 watts of 7.1 surround heaven looked at it for 5 seconds and i quote \\"Oh my god the bluray version is so clear\\".  I have purchased movies that came out before bluray, that where later released on bluray....nothing was done to take advantage of the new hardware out there....  Gladiator is the last one I bought, that was released before bluray came out....I was so disappointed when i started it up  2) if you are buying this for nostalgia...dont ....just buy the vhs  The changes are there...but I bought this to watch starwars on high end modern day home theatre equipmen....Mr.Lucas did not disappoint!!!
1416955070|3.0|CITY OF BONES by Cassandra Clare (3 stars). This book needs buckets of edits. Oh yes. Horrific grammar, ridiculously long sentences, bad structure, etc. Yeah, Clare was definitely a fanfic author who just got lucky with good marketing. That's all it is. Just like I AM NUMBER FOUR.<br /><br />But then . . . Clare goes all FORBIDDEN on our asses. The main character's romantic lead ends up being her brother? (Possibly/maybe/sorta, but they still want each other?) REALLY? That's super gross. Finding out someone you are attracted to is your brother is the equivalent of your smooch partner farting and stinking the space between you. Insta-detraction.<br /><br />(FORBIDDEN is a book coming out soon from Simon and Schuster. I received the ARC and was disgusted by the storyline of a brother and sister falling in love. My friend read it for me, thank God. She loved it. Hah.)

But I do not need 5-10 pages every time somebody eats lunch.  Most reviewers were happy with this book, but take a look at the less enthusiastic reviews of 4 & 5.  If George Martin had the sense to write a Trilogy he might have had a masterpiece.  As an alternative he should have kept each book to 500 pages.  The HBO TV series is off to a good start.  They will leave out the 'starchy filler' so I think I'll watch the TV version and skip the rest of the books.
159514188X|5.0|13 REASONS WHY by Jay Asher. I bought the Nook version and read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Like I said in another review: this is one of only a few books that has ever made me cry. 13 REASONS WHY is about a girl who leaves audiotapes behind explaining why she decided to kill herself. I read this literally a few months after my best friend took his life, so it had a profound impact on me personally. I could seriously write a novella about this book and not cover all the topics I feel need to be addressed. It took me so long to finally write any kind of review because I needed space from the whole subject. I still want to write more. So much more to send to Jay Asher to tell him how his beautiful writing touched me in so many ways. Maybe one day I'll be able to do that without being a blubbering mess, or I'll find out the subject will always turn me into a tissue-hog. Anyway, lovely novel of how the tiny things can build upon your shoulders and slowly tear you down.
0060558121|5.0|Neil Gaiman has become one of those rare breed of writers for whom many people will buy his books as soon as they see his name on the cover. And this is with good reason. He can write superbly well. His characterisations are interesting, his narrative is entertaining and his dialogue is frequently downright hilarious. This book is as good an example of that as almost any (I preferred the Anansi Boys though, which I read before this. There are shared themes between these two books).<br /><br />In American Gods, we are introduced to Shadow - a convict who is released early on compassionate grounds following the death of his wife. Almost immediately he is met by a man who calls himself Wednesday - and is clearly much more than just an ordinary man. Wednesday wants Shadow's help, but he is not specific as to what he wants - only mentioning that it is very dangerous. Indeed, early in the book there are all kinds of things that we are not told. Why exactly was Shadow in prison? Who is Wednesday (actually I guessed that one straight away), what does he want? What happened to Shadow's wife? And much more.<br /><br />The answers to these questions mostly do not come early. But they do come. There is a road trip across America that put me strongly in mind of Stephen King's \\"The Talisman\\". The protagonists are quite different, but I was reminded of the other book because of the natural/supernatural duality and the journey across America, experiencing different places - some more special than others. The whole story, it seemed to me, could as easily have been penned by Stephen King.<br /><br />There are two reasons I do not think, in good consience, that I can give this five stars (even though Neil Gaiman fans will therefore start voting down my review! But please don't without leaving me a comment as to why!) These are:<br /><br />1) This was a very earthy novel. There is plenty of sex - especially oral sex - mentioned. Many people will like that in a book, but I did not think that for the most part it added anything to the story. The language likewise was earthier than was strictly necessary, and moreso than in the Anansi Boys, which I preferred to this book. (I also thought the Anansi Boys was funnier).<br /><br />2) This book was almost ponderously long. Ultimately there were two plot themes, but the middle of the book spent so long setting them up that the resolution was very brief. One plot was resolved in a couple of pages and was something of a non event. The other was resolved in a longer epilogue. But did the book need to be 670 pages long? Neil Gaiman admits the book is long but excuses it by saying that America is a big country, which is true. The narrative is wonderfully descriptive of America - but whether that was all necessary for this story is an open question.<br /><br />So in summary - a very good book. I can recommend it, although I preferred the Anansi Boys, and that would be the book of Gaiman's I handed adult readers first. (The Graveyard Book would be my pick for young adults or those who enjoy young adult books).thing to the story.

0316044938|3.0|THE LOVELY BONES by Alice Sebold (3 stars) Watch the movie, forget the book. Yes, they are different, but the movie is better. The saying \\"the book is always better than the movie\\" is a crock.
0345472322|5.0|If you are going to read any book before the end of the year.. make sure it is Carol Dweck's Mindset.  This is a fast and easy read, but you'll definitely want to take notes and mark-up the margin. I thinks it's a must read for everyone who has a thought and makes a choice.  Through this book she helped me see the amazing power of perspective.  I've always thought of myself as a learner and this book helped me see even more opportunities I control through my mindset. If you're a parent, teacher or coach the best gift you can give a young person in your life is for you to read this book.  The second best gift you can give them is to get them to read this book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had my doubts after seeing the changes made to this new version, and while I still strongly dislike the \\"Vader No's\\" in Return of the Jedi, I have to admit this set is incredible. I was not too excited about it until it was in my hands and I started to really look through it. 9 discs and 3 of them are the special features. To get 6 films on blu-ray for this price is a great value. The special features alone are worth the price. There is more detail and more information about the movies than I have ever seen anywhere else. The picture quality of the films, especially Revenge of the Sith, is outstanding, and the original Star Wars (A New Hope) looks better than I could have imagined.

The flip book presentation of the discs is great. They really made the packaging as small as possible. The sound, color, and picture are amazing. I have not had a chance to watch the extra content but I assume, from what I have read, that the content is stellar. I can now get rid of all my other versions of the movies and keep this single copy!

0307472841|1.0|I've become a fan of Henning Mankell's Wallender stories, mostly through the British TV series. The gritty depiction of Swedish culture and country is fascinating, and the plots are laid out well enough to sustain my interest. This story is not part of the Wallender series, however.   This book begins with a gruesome mass murder in a remote village, and the author captures the isolation and atmosphere of the place. Even though the incident is over the top, it's an interesting premise from which to begin.   However, the author then steps outside Sweden and begins to go on at length about international politics, economics, and history. A major portion of the book is set in China, and it's quickly clear that his knowledge of that country goes no deeper than a few newspaper headlines. He has his characters expound in lengthy, boring monologues on the virtues of Communism, the wisdom of Chairman Mao and the political situation inside China. He would have the reader believe not only that Chinese peasants are ready to revolt, but that the Chinese government has developed a plan to solve the problem by relocating them to Africa. Actually, there are almost a billion peasants in China- sending a few million of them to Africa wouldn't even begin to address the issue, even if it were real. The whole structure is not only not credible- it's boring. Even the ending is bad- abrupt and unsatisfying.  I look forward to Mr. Mankell returning to the things he does well. I certainly won't read any more of his stories which take place outside Sweden.
B0053B347M|5.0|Before purchasing this, you should consider your own setup.  This will only work well in rooms that are not very bright behind the monitor, and if your monitor is in close proximity to the wall.  In my room, this lighting is not very noticeable or useful during the day, but at night, its very helpful.  My monitor doesn't normally receive much light, in fact, no direct light to the back wall.  Therefore, this adds lighting behind and does reduce eyestrain.  I did notice a big difference when I had to disconnect it, my eyes started feeling strained after looking at the monitor.  Having high contrast (dim lighting) behind your screen is nice during movies, but for standard computer use at night, such as web browsing and such, its really not good to have a bright monitor and dim surroundings.  If you like to play games in the dark, this is certainly the product for you.  It provides excellent light when it is completely dark, and not to mention it looks pretty cool, you have to admit.  For $13, this is a bit pricey though.  I got it for $5 on sale at another retailer..
B002ZG98C8|4.0|&#34;Machete&#34; is one of the first entries of Hollywood's &#34;supergroup cinema&#34; trend, mixing lead performers from different rungs of the cinematic ladder in a bombastic vehicle that would've been unthinkable to produce in preceding decades. It also continues the fad of retrofitting modern action movies with exploitation twists in emulation of grandhouse features. In both arenas, &#34;Machete&#34; succeeds remarkably, making it one of the more enjoyable features of 2010.<br /><br />The story: Three years after the murder of his family at the hands of a ruthless drug lord (Steven Seagal, [[ASIN:B00003CXW4 Exit Wounds]]), ex-Federale &#34;Machete&#34; Cortez (Danny Trejo, [[ASIN:B0000WN140 Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]) becomes a wild card in a shady conflict involving the attempted assassination of a Texas Senator (Robert De Niro, [[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]]), an underground immigrant aide network run by a tough beauty (Michelle Rodriguez, [[ASIN:B002VPE1AW Avatar]]), and a plot to exploit both to dark ends.<br /><br />The cast is the first thing that catches your eye, and for the most part it's remarkably well-chosen. Danny Trejo - the perpetually underrated tough-guy - plays his first mainstream starring role to the hilt. De Niro brings a sense of legitimacy to the picture and proves that he doesn't mind not being the center of attention. Rodriguez is cool throughout but positively explodes during the finale. Seagal's casting is the most controversial but also the cleverest: eight years of DTV features have done nothing to lessen his intensity, and he plays a bad guy with deliciously despicable hamminess. Jeff Fahey as the two-faced co-villain, Cheech Marin as the shotgun-toting padre, and Don Johnson as the twisted nationalist militia leader are a hoot to watch, and even Lindsay Lohan gets her share of awesome moments. It's so much fun to see all these performer together. The only performer who doesn't do too well is Jessica Alba ([[ASIN:B00005JNTX Sin City]]) as the conflicted policewoman: her part's written well enough, but she doesn't seem into it and gives a spotty performance.<br /><br />The film's grindhouse style is mostly consistent, but it lapses whenever the filmmakers realize they have to focus more on the story or purposely let on that they're not taking themselves seriously. Stylistic aging of the video quality is attempted early on but quickly dropped. The violence is bloody but rarely outright gruesome: even when Machete slices open a man's stomach and pulls the length of his intestines out (he uses 'em as a rope), it's sold as incredibly fake and shouldn't bother anyone besides the extra squeamish. The actual action content is pretty cool: gunfights, explosions, knife fights, and many impromptu beheadings by Machete meld together to form a veritable action opus. Surprisingly, Steven Seagal's character gets in on very little of this: he's most active late in the movie, when he engages Machete in a swordfight that's neat but not nearly as furious as the other ones he's had in his career. Spectacle is occasionally played over substance here, but I can't fault these scenes: any gunfight that convinces me that Lindsay Lohan is hardcore automatically deserves credit.<br /><br />The film's political overtones regarding the exploitation of illegal labor in the U.S. are, in my opinion, justified but could easily limit its appeal among viewers with different opinions. (Anyone who frequented this one's forum on IMDb years ago will remember all the Henny-Pennies who cried that it was going to initiate a race war.) Nevertheless, I don't consider this a serious political movie - just a fun, reckless action flick with a bit of style. Even if this one doesn't become a cult classic, director Robert Rodriguez ought to be proud of his work.icted policewoman: her part's written well enough, but she doesn't seem into it and gives a spotty performance.

B004G25V9S|2.0|If you love Opeth to this point, consider - would you rather leave their existing legacy intact or take a chance that this album might ruin it for you?   Simply: do you ask your loved ones what the worst thing they ever did is and enjoy the answers? That is precisely your answer as to whether you, if you find yourself a fan of Opeth's pre-Heritage catalogue, should purchase (or even listen to bits of) this album.  You may be able to grow with the band, but is the chance worth it?  I've seen Opeth at least 10 times throughout the last decade, twice in Germany and in a load of different US states (I've flown  elsewhere in the US just to see a show), and their upcoming tour stop in my town is on Halloween. Still, I'm considering selling the ticket off, as the set is sure to be full of Heritage songs. Personally, this is the album I suppose I was waiting for, the equivalent of Mikael recording himself farting in a paper bag. To be sure, it's far better than that sort of wind, but the change is jarring, as Watershed didn't soften the blow much at all. My hope is that they do like Dark Tranquillity after Projector and throw themselves back into the brutal groove after a break.

0307716511|3.0|When I began reading this book I was captivated by the plot of the missing sister, later found dead and the question of what happened to her.  As the plot progressed it became mired in an overly-contrived plot twist that took the book somewhere unexpected but not in a good way.  It was hard for me to continue reading this book after a certain point and I was happy to be done with it.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|I really liked this film, it was poignant and funny, but a little over the top.

0670022411|2.0|'A Discovery of Witches' was quite a surprise, and not in a good way. All the glowing reviews really made me believe that I was about to have an unforgettable experience, after all, I enjoyed Twilight with its corny and incredibly romantic plot, and many mentioned that this was the adult version of Edward and Bella's story. Unfortunately, even though the novel had a lot of promise, the execution was greatly lacking. Both the characters and plot had many inconsistencies and the story did not flow as smoothly as it should have. Here's why.   1. Characterization. The first few chapters were well crafted. Diana's character was so refreshing, and I absolutely loved her reserved and meticulous manner along with the well-constructed reasoning for why she chose the path of a scholar. Matthew's first introduction depicted him as a self-serving, contemptuous elitist with a very strict ethical code for a vampire.   So where did those personae disappear? A third of the way into the book, Diana became a whiny, thoughtless and unreasonably dense teenager instead of a thirty-something adult woman. She let a vampire she barely knew, whose kind she was taught to hate from childhood, literally bully her into going to his estate in France to avoid a perceived danger. There she was alternatively treated with contempt, pity and intimidation by various Clairmont Clan members, while she thoughtlessly brushed it off and worried about her appearance. Also, the constant tiredness and overeating made no sense for a lifelong athlete. Later on when she went back to New York, her treatment of her aunts who raised her over Mathew, whom she knew for a couple of weeks, was ridiculous. She was highhanded with Sarah and Em and became a worshiping mouse with occasional outbursts of spirit in front of Mathew. Inconsistent to say the least.   Matthew's character went through an even bigger transformation, going from Alpha Male to a love-struck puppy with temper issues. His behavior, including but not limited to intimacy issues, senseless protectiveness, inability to make logical and tactical decisions, fear of killing Diana, trying to alternatively push her away and keep her close, made no sense. The change in his personality from what was originally introduced was so drastic that I felt like I was reading about someone with serious identify crisis. I also could not understand why logical Diana found it so endearing, especially her acceptance of his vigilante streak. The breaking point for me was during Diana's rescue, when both his mother and brother kept on reeling him back from useless attempts of finding and saving her. Was I really reading about a 1500 years old vampire who was a personal friend of every notable person throughout history? On top of that, the abstinence was just ridiculous. Chapter after chapter of narratives about their platonic relationship added nothing to the story, although it was amusing to see Diana throwing herself at him to be rebuffed at every turn.  Also, constant encounters/accounts of his past love interests once again added nothing to the story or gave any useful insight about his character. They felt more like filler material to make the book longer than plot devices to further the reader's enjoyment.  2. Story. The premise for the book was well constructed.  Vampires, witches, daemons and humans were introduced as separate species, and all subject to Darwin's theory of evolution. While the history of human transformation was well documented by scientists over the years, the other groups lacked such understanding, and gradual population decline forced some to take action in discovering the truth. Not to give more of the plot away, this excellent foundation was met with poor execution. I think my main complaint was lack of foreshadowing. We kept on being fed new information throughout the book and the author left nothing for us to discover on our own. It was like an instruction manual on Diana's life, hence it didn't draw me intothe story. It was also the main reason why Twilight was successful for me and `A Discovery of Witches' was a failure.  I loved that part in Twilight where the whole story gradually builds to the culmination originally foreshadowed at the beginning of the book. When I was reading it, I tried to imagine how Bella's original words would come to life, and it made it all the powerful when I finally read it.    Overall, 'A Discovery of Witches' lacked subtlety in execution. The protagonists were always a step behind and clueless, while antagonist's actions were sporadic and needlessly sadistic. Bad guys would show up occasionally, wreak havoc and then disappear for a duration, which allowed team Matthew and Diana to regroup and work on her magic. Why didn't they ever come in force? They knew from pretty much the start that they weren't going to get cooperation from Diana and were frequently depicted as being ruthless, powerful and cunning, so why not strike against them when their defenses were at their weakest? These types of blunders could have been forgiven in a paperback harlequin romance, but I found them intolerable in a 600 page action packed paranormal mystery series.  I struggled to the last page and will not be purchasing the sequel. I gave this book 2 stars only because the plot had so much promise.
B0041G67ZG|4.0|The bluray quality was excellent, both in terms of video and soundtrack quality.  One disappointment was that there were *no* special features on the bluray disc.  I have to wonder why the disc authors chose to omit the extras available on the standard dvd release.
B005NFW1JK|5.0|I admit, I am hooked on this show!  I watch it with my pre-teen daughter and it appeals to both of us for very different reasons.  The fact that both an 11-year old and her 47-year old mother enjoy it is a true testament to just how good it really is.  The story keeps moving, always keeping you more than interested and on your toes.  I look forward to each and every week.  And for those that compare the show to the other vamp stories (Twilight, etc.) out there, PLEASE DON'T!  Vampire Diaries (both the books and the show) blows them all out of the water.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|It is a must have album form the Pioneers of electronic music. I could listen to it until I am braindead. But this is just my opinion.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|After listening to is about 10 times in the last few days, I really cannot imagine not having heard this album.  I barely remember how I felt listening to it the first time, only that I hit play immediately for a second listen.  Where I initially found some moments and choices questionable, all those questions melted away as I kept the disc spinning.  Anyone who is buying this album should know what to expect, from the words of Akerfeldt himself, the words of critics or even from reviews on this very page.  All I would suggest is that if you're an Opeth fan and you don't like this album at first, keep working at it.  Slap on headphones, turn it up as loud as you can handle, and just take it in.  If you don't love this album in a few days, try coming back to it later.  Comparing it to other Opeth observations is a mistake.  It is a gem, and frankly I've never heard another album like it.
B001QB9H1A|5.0|I find it extremely difficult to not enjoy a Jason Statham movie, which is why it is no surprise that I loved Transporter 3.    Jason Statham's fight sequences in this movie are just absolute fun to watch.  My favorite scene is surprisingly a more quiet one, with the two main characters looking out over the scenery.  Overall, this movie that rounds out the trilogy delivers just as much fun as its two predecessors.  Very enjoyable, very entertaining, action packed, fantastic driving and car stunts.  Nothing to not like about this movie!

B0036T31YY|3.0|The first 1 hour of the movie is very good ...  Friends going on a yatch, hit by a storm and getting on to an abandoned ship.  After that, it tapers off very badly - seems like an endless repetition with no end and no meaning.  Maybe the producers had some idea, but whatever weird that it is - it seems meaningless and repetitive.  Unlike movies such as Matrix, Sixth sense which have complex themes behind them, but have been so well directed to put the story out.

B001ILHY1I|5.0|I can't compare this film to the original version.  While I know I saw the original, it was so long ago that I just don't remember it enough to draw any comparisons.  Death Race starring Jason Statham - this movie is great for people that enjoy high energy entertainment.  Statham is in his best form in this movie and I really can't sing his praises enough.  He is such an entertaining actor to watch, no matter his role.  The stunts and visual effects were great.  Just a really fun movie.

B0058S0OMS|4.0|Growing up, this was the first Halloween I ever saw. At the time, I was 7. I didn't know about sequels, so I thought this was the beginning and I didn't know why Michael was killing everyone in the hospital. But it sure got to me. I think the dark, creepy-ass, nearly-deserted hospital did it for me because we've all been to a hospital and they usually make us uneasy to begin with. I've seen the movie about 100 times since it's first releases on VHS and DVD. This one is the best.<br /><br />First, let me explain that I do not own a 60-inch Plasma with a 7.1 Surround Sound Home Theater System. I own a 37-inch LCD HDTV and a Sony Blu Player. I did watch this twice, first on HDMI input and second on Component. Sharpness was just about the same. The HDMI enriches the color, almost too much sometimes and adds a lot of oranges and reds. There is some grain in different spots throughout the movie, but it depends on the lighting. It got kind of hazy during Laurie and Jimmy's talks in her hospital room, as well as the end in the operating room. A few scratches and dots here and there, but hey it's a 30-year-old print. Overall, though, the picture was a great improvement over the DVD. Again, this all depends on what kind of monitor you use. HD does sharpen all of the flaws, as well, but they're magnified even further when you use a giant screen. Even on a TV, you can tell the difference between the different audio streams offered. The Dolby 2.0 sounded kind of hollow with a little bit of tin in it. The Dolby 5.1 sounded fuller.<br /><br />And lastly, we finally get some extras for Halloween II! There are about 8 deleted scenes. Don't get your hopes up if you're looking for uncut gore. It's all character developement. Some of it's the hospital staff, and some of it's Loomis with the police. Laurie getting checked over after they sedate her (that's where the title of my review comes from). There's a lot of Jimmy talking, or least trying, to talk to Laurie. Some stuff between the nurses. And a few drunk Dr. Mixture scenes before he goes to \\"watch the fish\\" in his office. There's also the Happy Alternate Ending. I think I saw this on TV awhile back, because I remembered it perfectly. It kind of confirms what was already insinuated in Part 4. The biggest bonus on this disc is Terror in the Aisles! Full Widescreen HD, with great sound and subtitles. I watched this on satellite about a week ago and this blows it away. Sure, there are some bad spots from the old clips, but even a lot of them look great on here.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with this disc is some things that Universal did to it. Yes, they removed Moustapha Akkad from the credits and changed the font. They also jacked up the menu. I love seeing the pumpkin split open and the skull hidden inside. But, they added a BD-Live pop-up add on the menu! If you're connected to the internet while it's on, it cycles ads for Universal content right there on your DVD Menu! They also added some kind of funky built-in screensaver to their discs. If you pause for too long, it overrides your player's built-in screensaver and you get one that says Univeral. It looks cool, but you can't just hit Play and turn it off. I couldn't get mine to turn off, so I stopped the disc and had to find my spot again.

There's also the Happy Alternate Ending. I think I saw this on TV awhile back, because I remembered it perfectly. It kind of confirms what was already insinuated in Part 4. The biggest bonus on this disc is Terror in the Aisles! Full Widescreen HD, with great sound and subtitles. I watched this on satellite about a week ago and this blows it away. Sure, there are some bad spots from the old clips, but even a lot of them look great on here.  My biggest gripe with this disc is some things that Universal did to it. Yes, they removed Moustapha Akkad from the credits and changed the font. They also jacked up the menu. I love seeing the pumpkin split open and the skull hidden inside. But, they added a BD-Live pop-up add on the menu! If you're connected to the internet while it's on, it cycles ads for Universal content right there on your DVD Menu! They also added some kind of funky built-in screensaver to their discs. If you pause for too long, it overrides your player's built-in screensaver and you get one that says Univeral. It looks cool, but you can't just hit Play and turn it off. I couldn't get mine to turn off, so I stopped the disc and had to find my spot again.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|A must see movie definitely worth buying!  With its beautiful scenery, master camera work, perfectly timed soundtrack, talented cast, and captivating plot line, The Holiday should be praised for showing what a true romantic comedy should be.   When Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) and Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet), meet on the internet, they find out that they both have something in common:  single and unhappy, they're looking for a change over the Christmas holiday.  Swapping houses and lives, both women hope to completely step back from their troubled worlds and take a mental vacation.  While trying to forget about their issues, their new lifestyles seem to bring them to the core of their problems, exposing every flaw with their personality and attitude towards men.  This crazy holiday vacation leads both women to a newfound self-discovery and a much more serene life.   This emotional yet entertaining movie is a breath of fresh air among the genre of cheesy chick flicks.  With the ability to truly make me laugh and cry, The Holiday seems to have outdone itself.  Apart from the dull storylines of other romantic comedies where you can guess every move, The Holiday has a spark about it that keeps viewer's wondering, what will happen next?  Bravo to director, Nancy Meyers, who kept this movie light yet thoughtful.  Pulling together a movie of this caliber is not an easy task.   The strong cast of The Holiday is probably what made this movie as great as it was.  Jack Black, normally a comedic genius, showed a softer side while still enticing the audience.  Kate   Page 2  Winslet also portrayed the different emotions of her character, Iris, with such strength that every action came off as completely believable.  Cameron Diaz and Jude Law seemed to have such great chemistry that they made their on-screen love seem real.    The best love story of the decade is The Holiday.  Five out of five stars, this movie is a winner.  Aimed for an audience of late teens and up, The Holidayis a must-see for the true romantics out there.
1594744769|5.0|After reading many reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase this book, and it was a fantastic storyline. The photographs in the book add a whole other dimension to the story, even though the author has a beautiful writing style all on his own. The storyline is \\"fantasy-ish\\", but the way its described in such detail, and with the photos, it seems so realistic! It is beautifully written; I would definitely recommend it!
B002WPVNOS|5.0|I do not usually listen to popular music but must say that this band is outstanding and this collection of songs is stellar. One Republic is far above all their contemporaries in musical originality and execution.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed Jason Statham's and Ben Foster's performance in this movie.  The quality of the action sequences always feels higher in Statham's movies because of his ability to do his own stunts.  Ben Foster held his own and was captivating as quite the contrast to Statham's more polished character.  Great movie, and recommend it to anyone that enjoys this type of movie.

B001RIY4WE|3.0|This movie is awesome. Most of us have seen it and most of us love it or you wouldn't be reading this right now. I've owned 5 different versions of this on DVD, including the Skynet Edition. I got the same edition on Blu because I'm switching over my entire collection and this was on sale at the time. First off, I don't own a 60-inch Plasma with a 7.1 Surround entertainment center. I have a 37-inch LCD HDTV with a Sony Blu player. Picture is awesome through most of the movie. I did see lots of motion blur during some chase scenes and grain during some of the scenes with smoke, but I just chalk it up to trying to color match the effects at the time. Which brings me to the ghosting. There's a lot of ghosting in the dark scenes when trying to composite the scenes where the T-100 is morphing. It wasn't that noticeable on VHS and DVD, but with an HD transfer, you can really tell.<br /><br />The sound is horrible on this disc. All of the dialogue is really low, so you have to turn it up. Then, someone yells, or there's loud music or the background effects erupt and my room shakes. I almost gave the dog a heart attack. I've seen this happen when watching TV and notice the commercials are way louder than the show I'm watching. It's a real pain. I was constantly turning the TV up and down. Features were awesome on the DVD. On this disc, you get about 7 trailers, several pic-in-pic docs for side-by-side comparison, 3 deleted scenes from the Extended Special Edition, and a few commentaries. My biggest gripe is the way that the disc is made.<br /><br />The menu is a pain the ass, especially if you have it connected to the internet. It pings your general location and sets up a fake Skynet hunt for you. To top it off, all of those great behind the scenes, making-of documentaries (The Making Of T2 Featurette, T2: More Than Meets The Eye Featurette, The Making Of T2: 3-D: Breaking the Screen Barrier, etc) are on the BD-Live site. So, now you have to be connected to the internet and download all the content. Great, storage. More pain. I thought Blu was supposed to be the new revolutionary storage media where you could put so much on there without the compression. I don't want to have to rely on connectivity to get most of my content. This disc needs a do-over!ontent. Great, storage. More pain.

B00004R7X5|4.0|This disc features three of Russia's most familiar composition: Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture and Capriccio Italien.  They are all so popular that almost everybody will recognize their famous tunes.  So, of course, it should come as a breath of fresh air when musicians as great as Karajan and the Berliners try to tackle these masterpieces.  Did they succeed in giving us something special?<br /><br />Well, they certainly did in the Scheherazade.  This is a work overflowing with a wealth of melodies combined with gripping drama.  Karajan and the Berliners seem right at home in such a world.  Karajan is gloriously intense, seeing all of the many mood changes, delivering them with finesse, while preventing things from getting out of hand (one of his greatest gifts as a conductor).  Everyone wants to be kept awake during this work, and Karajan does the job.  Clarity reigns even in the most climatic of moments, the buildup to the sinking of the ship in particular.  Karajan has a wonderful eye for detail and even though this disc is from the 60's, you can pick up on wonderful contrasts that are present throughout.  And I shouldn't forget to mention the win of the performance--the 3rd movement.  Here the Berlin strings take us out of this world with the power of their beauty and elegance.  I didn't know such a thing was possible in this work, but it appears that it is.  Despite this recording's age, it is just as indispensible now as it was when it first appeared on LP.<br /><br />After hearing the Scheherazade, the Tchaikovsky sounds unsatisfying in comparison.  Karajan is still intense, to be sure, but I don't hear him pulling out as many thrilling moments.  Sometimes the music can border on sounding dull, and that is not what I want in my Tchaikovsky.  It's strange, because Karajan has worked wonders with Tchaikovsky elsewhere.  Perhaps he, like me, considers these works, particularly the 1812, to be overhyped and doesn't have much interest in the music.  The average listener won't notice these setbacks, because things are still interesting to a degree, but experienced listeners will probably complain.  In order for these works to really make an impression, solemnity will be out the window.  But that is exactly what Karajan tries to incorporate, which keeps things from really coming to life.  It wouldn't have hurt to throw more fun into the picture.  At least that's how I feel.<br /><br />To summarize, the Scheherazade is given a stunning performance that demands a listen, while the Tchaikovsky asks for more.  But given the quality of the former work, you've got to own this disc.  The recording quality is very good considering that it's from 1967.  Buy this CD as if though you were only getting the Scheherazade, and there's no way you'll be disappointed.The average listener won't notice these setbacks, because things are still interesting to a degree, but experienced listeners will probably complain.

Only thing; I work behind the bar and if your feet get wet there is no ventilation as I'm sure fellow foodservice people can relate, something to consider. Otherwise, excellent speedy service and top quality product.
1847879071|4.0|This book is required for my stat.'s class and it's actually a decent read.  Field tells jokes and there are very good examples that show you how certain statistical methods and concepts are actually applied to real life examples.  He does a decent job with SPSS, although some examples could use a little more detail.  All in all it's a decent book that most people wouldn't have problems understanding.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an incredible reading experience.  I was amazed how the author imagined future society and feel she must be a visionary since this is a society I can see us moving toward.  The deception and cruelty of the president was extreme but very realistic.  Even though this is fiction the content sticks in my mind as being a warning of sorts for future generations.  I've highly recommended this trilogy to friends and really enjoyed reading it from my kindle.  Oh, and I'm thinking of taking up archery!!

B005CM9DX6|3.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this new Opeth. The album's not bad, but its not all that inspiring either. Don't get me wrong, it does have its moments, but they are few and far between. I can dig prog, can dig free-form jazz, but I feel the album is trying to force the old Opeth engine into an entirely new chassis and the parts seem to conflict with one another. The album paces between ambient Opethy sounds and a sort of spastic syncopated barrage, yet never seems to peak anywhere and lacks any sort of cohesion other than the constant midtempo that permeates the album. Again, none of the passages are bad, and they certainly have the core elements of Opeth, but something is missing.  I feel on this album, Opeth simply got lost in the amount of parts they have tried to put together with their sound. It sounds overthought and is painful to get through. It starts with the obvious flux that occured with the bandmembers, but it is exacerbated by the drastic changes in melody, variety, composition, and, dare I say it, edginess. The album has no crunch to it, no grittiness. Further, Akerfeldt actually oversteps his vocal range a couple times, which is something I never would have anticipated from him. As other reviewers have stated, it is hard to figure out what Opeth is trying to convey here, and this is coming from an Opeth, Kalmah, Miles Davis, Meshuggah, Gojira, Moonsorrow, etc fan. I'm not afraid of challenging music, but I do have an attention span. I'm sure this album will get a few listens when I'm busy doing something. But I probably won't sit down and just listen to the album.  I almost feel this band should either decide what they want to do with Opeth and execute it, or lay Opeth to rest with its massive and esteemed catalog and pursue this new endeavor under a new name. The pressure of Opeth's branding is ruining this band. Either dedicate to getting the parts to fit in Opeth, or move on. I feel that either choice would free up the band to regain some of theirdirection, without the hangups of what they left behind. Opeth has long been one of the last holdouts from that great era of deth metuhl in the 90's and the early 00's to continue to make hard and compelling, crunchy morsels of musical bliss. Opeth has now officially gone the way of the my dying brides and paradise losts of the metal world. Sad to say, but raise the flag and have a moment of silence. :(  Maybe Steven Wilson will sing deth metuhl on the next PT album, as the bands seem to be crossing paths. Ha.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I've had a similar app on my old Windows Mobile 6 phone. But then it wasn't as polished and feature-rich as one would expect (Winmo wasn't either!)

B0050PYNP8|2.0|Let me start off by saying that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a couple of really hilarious guys. They have charmingly funny ideas as well as a serious cinematic appeal. With that being said, not everything English people say and do is automatically funny solely because they happen to be in the United States. Apparently the same rules also apply to aliens. Paul the character, much like Paul the movie, go figure, is so painstakingly unfunny that he could almost be mistaken for Kristen Wiig. Come to find this particular extra terrestrial also smokes pot, so it's no wonder he is voiced by Seth \\"I know Judd Apatow\\" Rogen. Now I'm not going to lie, this notion does have some serious comedic potential, the only problem is that unlike most humans, Paul can't even manage to be funny when he's high. Not that he is receiving much help from co-stars Pegg and Frost, who seem content with just standing in frame. In fact their combined performance were so blandly Americanized, that they too could have been mistaken for Kristen Wiig. But hey, who knows, maybe they were just exhausted after the endless struggle it took them to pull this script out of their asses, which, not for anything, appear to have gotten bigger. I was convinced Frost was going to eat Paul on more than one occasion. The film's main offense, however, is actually managing to do one thing right...JASON BATEMAN. A brazenly funny actor who took his one dimensional, cookie cut-out of a character and ran with it in the most liberating kind of way. Jason Bateman as a mysterio-style government agent is truly a sight to behold, the only dilema is, should a person really have to sit through all 90 minutes of Paul to see it? Sadly, the answer is no, but the second that agent Bateman get's his own spin-off, sufficed to say, I'm there.  In summation, I gave Paul one star for a stellar Jason Bateman and another simply because Pegg and Frost were too lazy to write in a sex scene for Miss. Wiig.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've been using the Garmin 405CX for about a month now, and I really like it. I've been using it with the heart rate monitor, and plan to use it with the Garmin Cadence Sensor I have on my road bike soon. It is easy to use once you are familiar with the menus, and it syncs up well with my Mac. I can also export the files to use in RunKeeper and other fitness apps, which is nice.   I have only two cons:  First, I have a suspicion that the calories burned isn't too accurate for indoor fitness activities where are stationary...which brings me to my second con...that there is really no setting for treadmill/stationary bike or other fitness equipment on the watch. You can change that once it is uploaded to your computer, but it doesn't change the calories burned estimate.   If this had a little more functionality for something like a spin class it would be perfect. For everything outdoors it is great!

B0000YB7Z8|5.0|Jethro Tull's 1978 live album Bursting Out is one of those rare and fantastic live albums where the sound and energy are so fantastic that many the tracks eclipse their studio counterparts, where the guitars are louder and heavier and the drums are harder and more forceful.<br /><br />Bursting Out finds the band on tour supporting their Heavy Horses album and as such contains an absolute wealth of material that fans of the band's work from the 1970s will love, representing most of their albums up to that point with at least one track and delivering a lot of the classics side by side.<br /><br />Highlights include an astounding twelve minute rendition of `Thick As A Brick,' as well as the louder and heavier versions of `Sweet Dream,' `No Lullaby,' and `A New Day Yesterday,' however the whole record is absolutely essential listening.<br /><br />In addition to the harder rock moments, like `Cross Eyed Mary,' and `Hunting Girl,' there are acoustic favourites like `Jack In The Green,' `One Brown Mouse,' and `Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of The New Day,' that work brilliantly along side the heavier tracks and also both a big Flute solo and Drum solo to display the member's immense talents... not that everyone wasn't doing that anyway adding great flourishes of exemplary musicianship throughout the proceedings.<br /><br />The performance is absolutely phenomenal with big exciting drum fills, creative guitar solos and Ian's usual astounding Flute and Vocal work on a particularly high standard here.<br /><br />Overall, Bursting Out is a fantastic live record, a great representation of the band's 1970s progressive period and would serve as a fine introduction to the band indeed for potential fans. It is one of the best Jethro Tull albums period. If you like Jethro Tull at all then get yourself a copy.

B0040JHLM2|4.0|I'm a midfoot striker with mild overpronation. I usually train in fairly light shoes like the Brooks ST5, the Green Silence, the Musha Ronin. Recently I added an OTC insert on occasion because of plantar fasciitis, which I thought might be cured by a stiffer, heavier shoe designed to correct mild overpronation. So I bought a pair of Adrenalines GTS 11. The shoe runs narrower than usual. In the Green Silence or ST5 I wear an 11.5. In the GTS I needed a 2E and the 11.5 was then too long, so in this shoe I take an 11 double E. Please consider this if you haven't tried the shoe on and plan to order on line. I found the shoe very helpful in correcting pronation and had zero plantar pain after a three mile trial run. However, the transition from my lightweight shoes to this was too much. Good as they are the Adrenaline's felt like lead. This wouldn't be an issue for someone who normally trains in a heavier shoe. For me, it really put a damper on the run, which was intended as a five miler but became three miles since I wanted to return the shoes before I scuffed them up too much. This is an excellent shoe that does what it's made to do, and I don't fault it at all, and if I stuck with it I would adjust to the weight, but I decided to take them back and will maybe try the Ravenna 2 or just stick with what I have.
B0059F7I24|4.0|Heffy has mostly abandoned the post-Ascendency Hetfieldish vocals that make me cringe.  These guys really are pretty talented considering they consider this album a dumbing down.  I would say that this is pretty much part Ascendency part newer Trivium.  There's not much in the way of anything too fresh here, but this is certainly a good lot of new songs.  Trivium is admittedly one of the best out there right now as far as a thrash style, which is often replaced by slower heaviness in much of today's metal.  I would definitely recommend this to fans of Thrash and any of Trivium's past work.

What he wrote about was horrible and it's hard to believe those men kept their sanity.  I really liked the way he wrote without bravado or judgement.  This is a great book and shows what war can do to someone, especially in the type of war our troops fought in the Pacific.

The best cut in this CD in my opinion is 'That Face' which I tend to play again and again.  The bonus disc is a compilation of previous releases by Alan and Marilyn but they do not get old.  I recommend to anyone who is a fan.
0062060554|2.0|First of all, how exactly is this woman reading an entire diary of 200+ pages before 9am every morning? I find that highly unbelievable. It took me a couple weeks to read this novel. And I found it dreadfully boring. Not to mention I found that she was becoming more self aware as the novel progressed but then that stopped. The ending was a cop-out. The author tried so hard to make you believe one outcome that it was an obvious ploy so you knew from the way she was pushing, that she was trying to get you off track. I just didn't like the story at all. I would have thrown it after page 50 if it wasn't a book club book. And it didn't get any better. I am confused how anyone would rate this above 2 stars. I would give it a 1 star except it wasn't absolutely dreadful, just really unbelievable and uninspiring.
B000XR49VQ|1.0|One of Peter Greenaway's most accomplished artistic efforts is REALLY given short shrift with this Allied Artists Classics release on DVD. They claim \\"Digitally Mastered\\" on the DVD jacket, but the picture quality STINKS. I suspect the master used for the DVD is the same that was used on the Laserdisc, which, on today's Hi-Def sets, looks like a bad copy of a third generation 16 mm copy of the film. Comparing the two releases, (yes, I still have a Pioneer Laserdisc/DVD analog combo player, which I seldom use nowadays because what seemed like exceptional quality back in the stoneage of video now is nearly unwatchable!), the Laserdisc actually looks better than the DVD. And in 1920 by 1280 resolution, EVERY bit of noise, smearing, complete loss of shadow detail and pixilization inherent in the source material is painfully amplified. To add insult to injury, they tacked a price of $44.99 on a clearly inferior pressing.<br />PROSPERO'S BOOKS deserves MUCH better treatment than it is given here, and so do we.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This Album is simply Amazing! One thing you must remember about this album, IT IS NOT PINK FLOYD! It is a solo album from one of the members. Yes you can compare it to some of Pink Floyd's material, but not giving the album credit on it's own is just b.s. IMO This album is amazing. The music is great, well put together, soothing. Makes you feel good. The lyrics are great, full of emotion, minimal. This album really lets the music creativity flow. Some other people gave this album a horrible review because they are stuck in \\"Pink Floyd\\" mode and can't let go, and see this album for what it is. A great collection of songs put together by the Voice and Guitar of Pink Floyd. David Gilmour. If you love Pink Floyd's music like I do, then this album is worth a listen. This album is amazing. Terrific effort by David Gilmour. I also own the DVD \\"Remember that Night\\" with the entire performance of this album on it, plus several other goodies. It's worth checking out also.
1400032717|5.0|In the city I see people who smell like urine or are acting weird in one way or another, which I remembered when reading Christopher's journey in the tube. This book wiped all judgment completely from my mind. In fact, it's made me ashamed that I expected all persons to be on the same cognitive level. I found Christopher's character to be well interpreted, that his condition was better explained from reading his perspective than reading a text book or even observing an autistic child. I was intrigued as well by the surrounding storyline, ingeniously built within the confines of an autistic narrator. I read a website (autism myths) that said Christopher's character was not believable, that he was too \\"self aware\\" and that this doesn't quite depict autism. I appreciate that. I have two comments. 1. The author doesn't use the word autism. 2. Reading the book caused me to want to learn more about autism which landed me on the aforementioned site. Additionally the book had the important impact of making this reader more autistically aware than I was yesterday. Anyway, it was a quick, enjoyable, engaging read. I highly recommend.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|I noticed some people feel this album is not as heavy as others, but IMO this album is one of their best! The first couple of songs are actually heavier that the rest of the album, I would say more in the vein of RUSH. \\"Outcry\\" and \\"Bridges in The Sky\\" for me are standout tracks.<br />\\"Breaking All Illusions\\" wow another great track think Zeppelin/Floyd, Petrucci shines here.<br />and I love James singing on \\"This is the Life\\" really nice. I really think that DT wanted to do something totally different this time (Although you know the sound is still DT ).<br /><br />One of the best Prog Albums this year!
B002ZG99CM|4.0|I remember when I saw the trailer to The Karate Kid remake I was like oh God this is going to suck. When I was going through The Karate Kid movies a month or 2 ago I decided to rent the remake & I was surprised. The Karate Kid remake was directed by Harald Zwart he directed Agent Cody Banks & The Pink Panther 2 which this is definitively a step up for him. Stars Jackie Chan as Mr Han, Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, Tarje P Henson as Sherry Parker, Wen Wen Han as Mei Ying & Zhenwei Wang as Chang. I like it but it's no where near the magic of the 1st 2 but The Karate Kid remake respects the original & has homages but it stands on it's own 2 feet. Story is this 12 yr old boy named Dre Parker is moving from Detroit to Bejing cause the factory his mom works at is moving there. He meets this girl at The Basketball Cout named Mei Ying. Then this boy named Chang doesn't want him around her cause his family is close with Mei Ying's. Chang beats Dre up badly. Dre has to put up with Chang at school Chang flips Dre's lunch tray on him. Mei Ying is trying to become a violinist which I believe the actress is a real violinist in real life. But her & Dre become fast friends. In the original you had the hatered between Johnny & Daniel & the scene where Daniel put the hose in the bathroom stall. Dre takes a can of oil & splashes it on Chang & his friends & Dre runs back to his apartment really good chase scene. But the bullies beat him up then Mr Han comes in & saves Dre it is cool how he did it. Mr Han uses a fire cupping technique to heal Dre now I can tell it's CGI but it doesn't kill the movie for me. Dre wants Mr Han to teach him Kung Fu but he refuses. Han tries to make peace with & talk it out with Chang's teacher but ends up as the same deal as the original with Dre entering the tournament. So Mr Han train Dre & the whole jacket on jacket off got old after awhile. Mr Han also takes him to the mountains to continue his training. I have to say that it iis well shot the locations. You have the parents that are high brow just like the original they don't want Dre to hang out with their daughter. & Jackie Chan has this good scene where it's the anniversary of his wife & sons deaths where he's destroying this car & he was mad 1 night & he & his wife were arguing it's pretty good acting by Jackie Chan. Dre apologises to Mei Ying's parents & because he didn't break his promise to be at her recital she'll be at his side at the tournament cause in their family they never break a promise. I didn't care for the slow mo with the fights at the tournament but the fights themselves aren't too bad. Small homage to the original where Dre gets hurt Dre still wants to compete Han uses the fire cupping. Dre battles Chang &  uses a flash kick  to beat him. I didn't care for the alterate ending it felt like it belonged in a action movie. I just like it where the students bow to Mr Han. I thought it ran too long the slow mo during the fights I didn't care for. The soundtrack was bad. But this was a good movie. It doesn't change my opinion on remakes why I don't like & rant on remakes is a good majority have too many homages to the point there a carbon copy & don't stand alone. Harald Zwart did a pretty good job. Jackie Chan was very good. Jaden Smith surprised me I thought he was going to be annoying but he was good. Wen Wen Han was good. Zhenwei Wang was ok he was better than the hammy villains in KKIII. This is better than KKIII definitely. I'll do more reviews soon.
159514188X|3.0|Here is the thing.......I was so hyped up for this book.  It had such potential, and had gotten such great reviews.  It is so well written, and Clay Jensen is such a great character.  But Hannah was SO annoying.  I know so many people who have survived horrific abuse of every kind, and almost every kind of malice imaginable. And they dont kill themselves. So asking me to feel sorry for a very pretty, moderately popular(yes, Hannah, to have even been invited to parties and have to turn down half the people you did would have been paradise to me)and pefectly healthy girl who just cant handle her life really ticks me off.  I mean, it really  grates under my skin.  She is actually offended that people find her sexually attractive.  WHATEVER.  I've been to high school.  That isnt a bad thing.  I would understand if she had had lifelong sexual abuse, and the remarks continued to objectify her. But even she admitted that her parents loved her.  They were just distracted.  The book just didnt ring true.  This girl had no reason whatsoever, no motive in legal speak.  I find it rather demeaning that people find this so indicative of a real suicidal person.  I've been in much darker places that this child.  With God's help, I made it out.  I dont know how people make it, when they refuse to rely on God.  Maybe it is the fact that I'm far removed from being a teenager, and far removed from that high drama, everything is life or death mentality.  Her character was so weak and whiny.  I kept waiting for more, for real reasons.  They just didnt come.  And when she hid in the closet at the party while her classmate was being raped, it was  just sickening.  But she could have told the cops, could have got counseling.  I feel far more sympathy for poor Clay.
B002BEXG86|5.0|How many bands can crank out not one but TWO career bests within a single calendar year? The original Alice Cooper group did just that back in 1971 when their second album with producer Bob Ezrin was released that November.<br /><br />Just as raw as \\"Love It To Death\\", \\"Killer\\" possesses some new touches that they would expand on the following year with \\"School's Out\\".<br /><br />\\"Under My Wheels\\" is as arresting an album opener as you can get. It still amazes me this song never became a driving classic like \\"Born To Be Wild\\". Can the car metaphors be any more obvious?<br /><br />\\"Be My Lover\\" is the band's autobiographical laid-back rocker (\\"She asked me why the singer's name was Alice. I said listen baby, you really wouldn't understand\\").<br /><br />The big showpiece of the album is the epic \\"Halo of Flies\\", which is really three songs in one, including a beautiful overture halfway through. The galloping drums of Neal Smith during Act I is probably my favorite part.<br /><br />Alice's sharp vocals make for a great contrast against the gorgeous strings on \\"Desperado\\".<br /><br />The distorted, kicking \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" is Alice at his head-banging best.<br /><br />The album's low point would have to be the somewhat clumsy and lazily titled \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\", which is the only song on \\"Killer\\"--or \\"Love It To Death\\" for that matter--that I would even remotely consider \\"filler\\". But even it is much better than half of the material on the \\"School's Out\\" album.<br /><br />Next to \\"Halo of Flies\\", the infamous, atmospheric \\"Dead Babies\\" which opens with Dennis Dunaway's ominous bassline and features plenty of gritty guitar work, is probably the album's next best cut.<br /><br />The album ends on a high note with Alice channelling Jim Morrison on the title track, which like \\"Halo of Flies\\" is like a three-part opera which ultimately ends up with Alice being led to his death in the gallows before the supremely-jarring finale.<br /><br />\\"Killer\\" is just as great an album as \\"Love It To Death\\"--in some ways even better. If you want to experience the original ACG at their best, it's these two albums you want.album as \\"Love It To Death\\"--in some ways even better.

B0051QO4QY|5.0|I must say, I had extremely high expectations for this album with GaGa saying things like \\"this is the best music I've written\\" , the anticipation nearly killed me. When I first heard the album she  blew my expectations out of the water! This is the single most amazing album I've heard in my life. It has everything, great influential and/or positive messages along with enormous metaphoric inspiration. Not to mention the amazing musical aspect. The album is like an electronic journey through which you can learn so much about GaGa and yourself! I'd highly recommend this to anyone.

1451626657|5.0|It's sobering to realise that it's 50 years since Joseph Heller's biting satire `Catch 22' was first published. Through the 1960s and 70s, its famous title was slowly adopted into everyday idiomatic usage around the world and is now quoted by people who have never read the book and may not even know the origin of `Catch 22' to mean any `double-bind' situation designed to get you no matter which way you try to brook the system.<br /><br />Heller's novel is themed on the way an unfeeling bureaucracy conspires to marginalize the individual. It covers the same ground as much of Franz Kafka's work (notably `The Trial') and has an Orwellian core, but `Catch 22' is much funnier than almost any other work of this loose genre and is a joy to read.<br /><br />Earnest comedy combines with episodic chopped-up storytelling: on re-reading the book after several decades, it becomes obvious that Heller does in fact employ a tight and disciplined - though unorthodox - structure, where common themes are continually re-stated and reinforced with humor and for example the same scenes are described from the perspectives of different characters as the novel unfolds. Clever observation of the absurdity of bureaucratic thinking through a host of sharply-drawn and fleshed-out characters display human behavioural psychology in a way few other novels of the modern age manage to do. You put people in a situation like this, and this is what can happen: it all has its own peculiar logic where the insane can be comfortably in charge and the irrational appears normal. If you are prepared to exploit the system you can get away with almost anything, whereas if you follow the rules and demonstrate `patriotism' and `honor' - well, you're basically screwed.<br /><br />The characters who populate Yossarian's world are hard to forget: General Dreedle, the Chaplain, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Major Major Major, (who had a rank created just for him, to exploit his unique name); the incomparable Milo Minderbender and his grandiose money-making syndicate extending even to trading with the enemy and contracting to fly missions for them; the comparatively sane and rational Doc Daneeka, who explains Catch 22 to Yossarian; Nately, Cathcart and the rest.<br /><br />You could describe `Catch 22' as a comic-tragedy, but above all it's instructive and entertaining. If you've never read this 20th century classic and real, solid books with paper pages are your thing, you now have the chance to get yourself a new edition of the long-out-of-print paperback- the `50th Anniversary Edition'.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I waited until I could see the final release versions of the changes before commenting hoping that some of them were rumors or that some of the video clips I'd seen were fake.  Here's my quick run-down of the ones I particularly noticed (only from the original trilogy as I don't care nearly as much about the prequel):  * Obi-Wan's changed Krayt Dragon scream is **horrible**.  They should have stuck with either of the previous versions.  This one sounds like a kid playing around with some fun tech.  It completely breaks me out of the scene.  * Gredo still shoots first (though it does look slightly better).  :(  * The Ewok's have eye-lids.  Honestly, this one didn't bother me nearly as much as most people.  I prefer the no-eyelids but am okay with the CG eyelids.  * Vader now says \\"No.  Nooooo\\" when the Emperor is shooting lightning at Luke.  Another good scene completely ruined.  Not only was the scene much more effective without the line but the quality of the voice seems way off as well - my guess is they either did not use James Earl Jones or used software to modify dialog from somewhere else - it just doesn't sound like it fits there.  My personal take is that I like some of the changes made to each version (1997, 2004, 2011) but I really wish Lucas would stop ruining scenes or characters.  I will continue to watch my theatrical release DVDs until Lucas, at a minimum, restores Han to shooting first, removes the \\"No\\" line from Vader, and makes the Krayt Dragon scream not sound horrendous (either of the two previous versions or some new one is fine (as long as the new one is *much* better than this one)).

1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton's \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is a book I just could NOT bear to put down. Morton weaves the story of Nell, a small girl with a forgotten past, with stories of women from Nell's past.  3 or 4 stories are happening simultaneously, but instead of becoming agitated as suggested by some of the other reviews, I was intrigued. I read each chapter quicklym and instead of the perspectives becoming dull, each perspective offered more details, and more questions to answers about Nell that I thought I had figured out previously. Together these 3-4 accounts illuminate tiny Nell's layered genealogy.   It is a beautiful book about generations of women, their love, hate, and need for one another.  I hope Morton writes 100 more books of this caliber revealing and concealing little mysteries until the very end. She had my rapt attention the entire time!

B004LWZW4C|1.0|One of the worst most boring films I have ever seen. Casting Kevin Bacon (Kevin Bacon!) to play a Nazi is like casting Oliver Hardy to play Hannibal Lecter. It just doesn't cut it. The film flops along without energy, occasionally trying to blow a fuse but in some inappropriate, foolish fashion. Lights are seen directed down like beams upon character's faces, apparently to add \\"drama\\" to their expressions, otherwise flat and inexpressive. Oh, and the \\"story.\\" How has it happened that fantasy Marvel characters are now immersed in scenes of the Holocaust, concentration camps, scenes of murder? Is this a film for grown-ups or children or, as it seems, absolutely no one at all?

B004NSULHM|5.0|I first wanted to take a moment why I feel this album by Radiohead exceeds any previous work.  Over the past 2 decades there have been certain songs I have enjoyed...Creep, Karma Police, The Tourist, Nude.... but to no avail could ever find an album that I could listen to the entire work at one sitting.  I did enjoy MOST of Ok Computer, but feel Paranoid Android casts an almost negative tone to the rest of the album.  I have to forward it to the next song just so I dont have to listen to Thom have a fit- absolutely horrendous!  However, King of Limbs has changed my life when it comes to music, and sits on top of all the albums I have listened to in 2011.  Lotus Flower is one of those songs that gets peoples attention, and every individual I have introduced to this song, LOVES IT!  Look at the like vs dislikes on you tube!!  Of course it does take a little time to devour the entire album, but that is with any great work.  I almost feel Radiohead has finally come together as a band, matured, and really excelled themselves in a better realized and accepting sound.  For all of the naysayers that state that I jumped on the wagon, feel free to do so, and I can almost guarantee those hypocrites loved Metallicas black album released in 1991.  Great job Radiohead, and look forward to your next release!!!  Love Supercollider!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well, the original Star Wars movies that so many people experienced as they first appeared in cinemas are apparently no longer of value or relevant to anyone anymore and are not included in this set.  The fact that a quality print of the original Star Wars is still not available today is unbelievable and a real loss to fans of the original trilogy, and indeed to all those with a genuine interest in the preservation of important works and maintaining their integrity within film history.   I am sure this release will adequately meet expectations for those that enjoy the revised canon, and I genuinely hope it is all that you wish for, but also feel that many people are greatly missing out by not experiencing the original theatrical versions, which actually had a more natural looking colour pallet, better contrast with no detail loss in shadows, and pioneering special effects and model work still intact.  As time has moved on, and in the light of continuing changes and digital manipulation, which just seem to detract rather than enhance, I have now come to accept that fans such as myself who greatly appreciate the unaltered films are also no longer relevant, or indeed even part of the intended demographic for this current incarnation of Star Wars and all that it has become.  I have great memories of watching Star Wars when first shown in cinemas all those years ago, and the real sense of adventure it evoked in the imagination, and although obviously a little sad that both new and older fans will not be able enjoy the original trilogy at a respectable quality, I believe this release really does mark what is a great missed opportunity.  Very Disappointing.

B005HG4C4C|3.0|I've been a prog rock and metal for quite some time now, since being a fan of Rush back in the 70's. I have to say I expected something a bit more from Dream Theater's latest release. I'm a brand new fan of Symphony X and I find there music certainly is inspired by Dream Theater and Yngwie Malmsteen, fused together. When Iconoclast was released back in June, I was floored by its power, darkness and unrelenting prowess. I was thinking when Dream Theater puts out their new album they would put Symphony X in its place. Well that's not the case when it comes to the sheer entertainment value. I thought DT's new album was the proverbial balloon with less helium than its earlier predecessors. What happen to that dynamic band that left you in awe?  There are parts in the album that raise your eyebrows but the sum of all its parts , especially the last couple of songs left me disappointed. Iconoclast although sounding similar to some of their previous albums was indeed a breath of fresh air. They put the petal to the metal and didn't let up. I felt A Dramatic Turn of Events puts the petal down for brief moments in the album only. I think both bands are technical geniuses with Dream Theater being a little better, but not on their newest album releases. So I would say Symphony X beats out Dream Theater this time around.

Deciding to keep this due to the price and sound quality, but I may still purchase a different pair for a better \\"feel\\".

0060763280|3.0|On a whim, I picked up this book for cheap in a used bookstore and don't regret it. The advice given by T. Harv Eker is conducive to potentially earning more money and even building character. Some of Eker's tips are well known but at times hard to put into practice: positive inner thoughts projecting out into the world; fresh ways of thinking to enhance happiness and success; dropping all unsupportive past money habits to increase earnings. Eker inserts the usual cheerleading platitudes such as committing yourself to wealth, retaining only empowering thoughts, thinking large and setting specific goals. These are all admirable objectives, but what I admired most about \\"Millionaire Mind\\" were Eker's points about saving money (with multiple accounts), investing (making sure to educate yourself, diversify and remain in it for the long haul), keeping track of your overall net worth and simplifying your life to keep more money. It sometimes gets forgotten that millionaires don't have to be flashy people; a modest home and lifestyle saves a lot of money in the grand scheme, which can be used for other things (entertainment, necessities, saving or investing).<br /><br />The author also conveys that earning a fortune takes creativity, honesty and lots of hard work. He recommends a part- or full-time venture on your own so that you can eventually be in business for yourself, and Eker is big on selling, which he says people can earn a fortune from. Eventually, he says, if you work hard enough and get involved with the right things, your money will work for you and you can sit back and enjoy. This is easier said than done, of course, but it can be accomplished by thinking outside the box and courageously moving forward.<br /><br />Based on his book and website, Harv Eker comes across as a genuine guy with a streamlined message, someone who thankfully doesn't offer guidance about everything under the sun. His language in the book is cheerful and straightforward, maybe even a bit too direct for some people's taste. He unabashedly promotes his seminars, but that's par for the course since he recommends heavily marketing what you have to offer. His advice doesn't reinvent the wheel, and much of this stuff may already be well known to many. But for me, a lot of Eker's information was reinforcing and, at times, inspirational.some people's taste.

0061537969|5.0|Written from the perspective of a dog who yearns to become human, this book is very well written, very touching.  All the major emotions and some minor ones will be struck over the course of the story, which encompasses the life of the dog, Enzo.  It's not a book for girls; it's not a book for guys, it is a book for humans.  Try it, you'll love it...then pass it on.

B000002GQH|5.0|First off, I'm not a Moodies fanatic.  I like a lot of artists equally well.  Each is unique.  I have had all their albums at one time or another but this one remains my favorite.  It is a musical journey unlike any other artists or even other Moodie's albums.  It seems that it was done at exactly the right time and place, otherwise it would never exist as it does. That the songs on the album are bookended by Orwellian or Space-Age ideas underscores the wealth of humanity that pours forth from the songs in-between. Perhaps that was the intention.  If not, it creates a powerful, if not magical, effect on the listener.  Many of the songs are all well-crafted English pop-rock circa the early seventies (released in 1969) with some very trippy and esoteric music that will leave you wanting more. It is quality from start to finish.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|i never read the book but I have seen the movie. I really liked the movie but it made me mad that it kept going back and forth between the past and the present. The present was boring and I wanted to keep watching Sarah's story. Her story just cut off and we didn't see any progression. If the whole movie was about Sarah I would have loved it. Julia's part was just annoying.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I was very excited to read about this device and all the reviews were very good.  However the item I received provides a blurry picture, poor hand tracking and is generally unusable.  I also noticed these lenses are yellow but all the review units I've seen had blue lenses, maybe Nyko skimped on the actual production unit quality?  From a technical standpoint I can see no reason this product doesn't work, the lenses are all perfectly clean, no dust and the room is well lit but not flooded with natural light.<br /><br />The kinect alone works fine, except I'd have to get rid of my couch to have enough room for the back row, but for games like dance central it doesn't matter.
0307719774|4.0|This book is great! I love it so far! The only problem is that the book is rather small and is about the size of my palm and almost 2 inches in thickness. No wider than my palm too. Small and portable but if you're rough with it, it can get scratch after some use but other than the normal things, it pretty durable. Hardcover styled, the hardcover isn't that thick but thick enough.   Pros:  -Great for daily use if you want to write small tibits.   -Comes with questions to answer if you can't think of anything.  -Dates included basically.   -Durable  Cons:  -Frustrated with binding, as you can't sit it straight on the table to make it easy to write  -Small spaces between lines  Besides the little things here and there, its a really great 5 year journal. Very simple and easy to do. If you're a hardcore journalist, i wouldn't buy this since its mostly for people who are looking for somethings simple to do. I bought this for myself (I'm turning 16 soon) I felt it was would be great for myself as i transition into adulthood. Well from a young girl to an older one! (Young as heart forever and ever) It stops right around the time i turn 21. So i can't wait til then. So i greatly recommend you buy it for teens or people who are at a difficult time in their life. It's a little book filled with questions that make you look back on the times with a small sigh of happiness.

B005974CDU|4.0|Even casual DT fans must know of the falling out, leaving, dismissal, retirement, whatever you call it of Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater last year. I was totally shocked and confused by this. I wasn't sure who to side with, or where my allegiances should lie. Finally, I decided that I was just gonna see what direction each took and reap the benefits. Mike did some phenomenal work with Transatlantic, probably some of his best. Avenged 7x tour was a weird choice, and a direction I have no interest in, much like Adrenaline Mob. Both of these projects were quite below Mikes ability, but whatever. The Neal Morse album-Testimony 2 was another astound-er from Mike, and I loved his work on it. I was just waiting to see what DT had in store.   First was the phenomenal docu-drum-a/off auditions that were broadcast on the web. Truly great stuff. I thought Mike Mangini would be the one from the start, and I was not disappointed. Now, almost 9 mos later, I am pleased to say this baby is a beaut! The band is evolved, fantastic, and relaxed. All of the players are up to their usual above great standards, and Mangini is a magnificent drummer. His style fits right in. The songs are all inspired, and the band feels fresh again. There are even 9 songs to enjoy! This album is waaaaay better than the last (Black Clouds-no wonder!)and has almost 2x the songs.   Does this mean the song lengths are short again? No way! Lots of epics, no 20 min songs, but thats OK. Lots in the double digits or just under time lengths. If you have ever been a fan of DT, you gotta get this album. Plus, its already in the top 10 in the US! I can't believe it. Maybe good taste in music is coming back...  Wonder what MP's next project is gonna be...I can't wait!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I delayed my review until I had watched all six movies.  Both Star Wars trilogies look and sound great on blu-ray.  In fact, they are probably the best I am likely to see and hear in my lifetime.  If you are a fan and have been hesitant to purchase this set, I say go ahead and buy now.  The boxed set is definitely worth the price.  For a simple test of your audio hookup, listen to the sonic charges explode when Obi-Wan is chasing the Fetts through the asteroid field.  Kudos to Amazon for great pricing and service as well as UPS for delivery on-time.

If you feel the same way about professional writing, I suggest that you NOT purchase this book. If there were a -10 rating, I would choose it for this book.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I love Opeth, first and foremost, lets get that out of the way. I find Steven Wilson to be a genius and Mikael Ackerfeldt to be the \\"Igor\\" to his Dr. Frankenstein. On this album, the student attempts to rival the master, and does a fair job of it. No, this is not a death (or even a )metal album, so flush that out of your expectations. This is a prog rock record. At being such, it is fantastic and reminiscent of so many of the styles used in the early 70's. If you are a fan of prog, as I am, then this album will likely astound you, especially if you've heard of, but never actually \\"heard\\", Opeth. This is no Damnation for the next decade, this is a whole new direction for the band. Gone are the death metal vocals and super intense metal passages. Replacing them are some King Crimson-esque jazz-infused rhythms, killer bass lines, inventive percussion, and Jethro Tull-like flute solos. Too Much? Way to severe of a change in direction? Maybe. I love this stuff, and enjoy this album more and more with each spin. It is a marvel to behold, truly. But, now I can no longer brag to my friends that I listen to death metal! I do miss some of the heavy, intense parts of other releases (even Damnation is \\"heavier\\" than this to be honest), but I don't miss the death vocals. MK has such an awesome clean vocal, there really is no need to continue the death vocal. Plus, he still is in Bloodbath where you can get your fill of all death vocals.  So, what is the final opinion here? Through the tutelage of SW, MK has been able to come out of the closet and stand tall as a lover of Prog-rock. There are a few small failings, but overall this album is a breath of fresh air and a welcome respite from the hum-drum, no talent, sing-song cr*p that permeates the ether these days. It takes chances when fans want or expect more of the same. I applaud MK for his change in direction, just wish it would have been a bit more of slow turn than such a drastic one. All fans of great music will find plentyto love here, just be patient with this one.Trust me, it will pay off in dividends. Horns up, my liege!  A note on the 5.1 mix: Astounding! Second only to the Grace for Drowning blu-ray. This has to be heard to be believed! The album really comes to life and is truly amazing in surround. You are missing out on all the depth here if you don't get it.
B002WPVNZM|3.0|This is totally a commercial pop CD although to credit the band, there are some little flourishes of some kind of independent spirit. From the lyrics which are a bit oppositional to the \\"man\\" to the long intros and some tracks that are obvious non-hits, it's refreshing to hear a band on a major label attempt to have some kind of creative integrity. That being said, only about 1/2 of these songs are truly interesting. Some sound to me like they have listened to a Radiohead CD, gotten drunk, and headed to their rehearsal space and into the studio the next day. Like, the sonic textures are captured well, but the songwriting is lacking. I can't fault a band for being into experimentation, but some of the songs seem a bit loose and direction-less. I give it three stars because the songs that are really good songs are done well, and they're catchy and sincere sounding. The others sound like they need a producer or a few more days in the rehearsal studio.
0553801473|4.0|Mr. Martin was originally going to jump years forward after \\"A Storm Of Swords\\", presenting the characters as much older - presumably adults.  He has chosen instead to craft \\"A Feast For Crows\\" and \\"A Dance With Dragons\\", which really are one book split into two due to length.<br /><br />He also appears to have compressed his time line, allowing his characters to *grow* quickly rather than accumulate wisdom via aging.<br /><br />Thus we will enter the last part of A Song Of Ice And Fire with significantly younger characters than he'd expected, but due to the way they gained wisdom in these middle books, his storyline remains essentially intact.  And by showing us their growth in this middle book (or two books), we will have a series that has continuity, and I like that a lot.<br /><br />This book, A Dance With Dragons, is written with supreme craft.  I thought \\"A Feast For Crows\\" was desultory and drifting, inferior to Martin's other work.  \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" was brilliant to me.  The intrigues, the treacheries, the characters!  If you simply want *things to happen*, then yes, I can see why you would think it drifts.  But Martin wants you to *experience* the political intrigue and the treacheries.  And these things take time to unfold for the impact to be emotionally felt.  I do not, in particular, want such things boiled down to the usual video game approach in so many epics, that rushes it all at a surface level:  Then A happens, then B happens, then C happens...  Spare me such fast and cheap swiftness.  I don't think Martin wasted a single word.<br /><br />This was a setup book, much like \\"A Clash With Kings\\" was a setup book, so yes it suffers from the lack of climax and resolution.  It does everything it needs to do, and the writing is fantastic, so perhaps I should rate it 5 stars.  But I can't rate any such \\"middle book\\" a five, that's just me. Here's hoping the payoff, in the remaining two books (or three, or four), will be as magnificent a payoff as \\"AStorm Of Swords\\" was.

0345522478|2.0|If nothing else, this was a creative story - I've never run into celtic lore in the fantasy genre before, let alone set in modern day... so that was a plus.    On the other hand, while the story was creative, I found myself a little bored.  If I had read this book when I was 13, I'd be chomping at the bit to get into the next novel.  Unfortunately I'm not, and I found the story and characters a little too twilight-esque - for a protaganist who is two millenia old, I just kept expecting him to behave like he had a little more baggage.  Instead he behaves more like a happy-go-lucky, know-it-all eighteen year old.  There's no sacrafice for the good guys, and the the bad guys lose - utterly.  Maybe I've just grown to enjoy darker novels, but I just found this a little too nice and neat.  The characters and the author will tell you otherwise, but it's not what came through to me and  even though the author uses some adult contexts, they're adult in the way that a horny thirteen year-old boy might imagine.  I'm slightly surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but despite my comment about the novel being twilight-esque, I need to keep in mind that slot of people really enjoy those books. So, with that in mind, if you're looking for Twilight, minus the teenage love story,  this novel is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.

1423113381|4.0|I love learning about ancient Egypt so this book interested me from the moment my nephew gave it to me. The chapters have fun titles and are alternately told in Carter and Sadie's voices which I enjoyed. The brother-sister banter is an added quality that made the story fun to read. It took me awhile to get through the book and it seemed like the obstacles Carter and Sadie faced would never end. While the Egyptian lore is fascinating I felt there was too much information crammed into the book. The ending was a surprise, not at all the tragedy I had imagined and in my opinion would have worked well as the conclusion without the need for a sequel. If you enjoy myths and legends, you'll enjoy this book. I give \\"The Red Pyramid\\" a 4/5. It didn't become a favorite but I do want to continue reading the series to see where Sadie and Carter's adventures lead.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but I feel compelled on this one.  This is the rare book that left me physically trembling at 2am as I fought against myself, desperate to just read another page, but still knowing that I had work in a few hours.  Lucky for me, even though I went to sleep, my dreams were filled with nothing but this book.  If that sounds appealing to you: just read it.
B004IQMXD4|2.0|I really don't know what happened here.  Stevie is really doing what she has always done; she's trying to stay relevant when she really doesn't have to try.  She is a brilliant songwriter who makes tragic mistakes in production because of her seemingly desperate need to \\"stay commercial\\" and please record executives.  If you don't believe me, watch the Destiny Rules documentary.  This album is a tragic representation of that.<br /><br />She needs to admit that she ruined her voice from many years of substance abuse and lack of proper vocal training (she only began training her voice in the late 90's when it was far too late really). I wish she would stop singing through her nose! It's very distracting.  She really has very little range at this point and her vocals are just not that interesting anymore. Not to mention...what happened to her great harmonies with her back up singers?  She has Lori Nicks and Sharon Celani on here and both have great voices that meld so well with hers. They get lost in the mix.  Dare I say that even her vocals with Lindsey sounded less than stellar? What a waste!<br /><br /> She is still capable of writing great lyrics that create a fun and moving experience for the listener; you just won't find them here. These trite lyrics are set to crappy electronic bits and drum machines.  The grip that I'm so used to her holding over me is pretty much absent.  Not to mention the fact that she keeps reintroducing old lyrics to new songs. Instead of being sort of poetic when she did this previously, she just seems out of ideas.  Where is my Stevie?!<br /><br />I really don't like that Dave Stewart sings with her on this album, because he can't sing. He sounds like some sort of lurchy Frankenstein when intertwined with her nasally accompaniments.  Cheaper Than Free is horrifying.  He's a poor singer and the lyrics are not up to Stevie's ability..some b.s. about \\"passion and high fashion\\"!!??  Get real!<br /><br />Most of the songs I just find bad or silly.  I do like For What It's Worth.  It's one of the best songs she's written in a long time.  She should stick to more parred down musical arrangements.  Stevie is best with little embellishment at all.

0756603749|3.0|Of the five \\"knot\\" books I have, this ranks about in the middle.  On the positive side is the excellent writing, the wide variety of knots and the inclusion of splicing.

This would have allowed larger illustrations, and more easily understood steps.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|This is a pretty good non-sony controller. It's very sleek and responsive, and mostly comfortable. The extra friction on the grips has a nice feel to it and keeps your hands from getting to clammy. The buttons and joysticks are good, but there's one downside. The joysticks are either spaced oddly or slightly raised. It's not much of an issue except when you try to have your fingers on all the trigger buttons, it places your right thumb in an odd position. All in all though, I'm happy to not have to pay for an official controller, and this one certainly gets the job done.

0385534639|3.0|I know I am going to reflect the minority here but I did not love the book as much as I wanted to. Maybe it was the repeated hype and build-up, or maybe it was my own excitement, but I really expected a lot out of this book and it did not deliver.<br /><br />First of all, it took me about 100 pages to get into the book, which was longer than anticipated. I kept reading but it took me a while to get into the energy and flow of the back-and-forth dialogue enough to be truly excited about picking it back up.  While the writing and description were wonderful, the characters struck me as rather bland.  I felt this especially about Marco and Celia, who - as two of the more magical people - could have been focused on more, and given more time in the book. The whole storyline is centered on this competition that both Marco and Celia are unwilling participants in. Instead of pity or empathy, I could offer no emotions for the two protagonists as they did not come off as tangible people. I understand this is supposed to be \\"magical\\" but what good is magic if there is no element to tie it to the reader?<br /><br />My favorites, by far, were the secondary characters - Bailey, Herr Thiessen, Poppet and Widget, and Tsukiko. The colorfulness of these characters, added to the overwhelming blandness of the gray mood of the circus as a whole. While we get bits and pieces of their overlapping stories, Morgenstern chooses to do so in a disjointed time-frame that is often confusing. Her narrative jumps forwards and backwards, but there is really very little reason for her to employ this technique, as the general flow of the story is very linear.<br /><br />My absolutely favorite thing about this book was the imaginative scenery and the circus as a whole. The smells, sights, and sounds of it were so beautifully explained, that I could almost smell caramel apple as I sat reading it. The many different tents that were a part of the circus were so creative and wonderful that I found myself longing to be a part of that world. The ice garden, in particular, was so beautifully explained. I loved that this book made me imagine the circus so vividly. While the descriptions help, it left just enough out that I am sure my version of the ice garden is different from that of anyone else.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to other readers who love a fairy-tale like story but are not looking for too much emotional involvement or character substance. I have heard that the rights to the movie version of \\"The Night Circus\\" have already been bought and I think that is fantastic! The book is so visual, that I just hope that the studio who will be responsible can do it justice.rld. The ice garden, in particular, was so beautifully explained.

These details are good to be referred to while laying out how to avoid the caveats with some good programming practices. The theme is \\"Everything about  JavaScript Semantics that could every be known\\" instead of \\"Here is how to write JavaScript code and here is how  you code it to avoid these potential ambiguities\\". I am fortunate to have a CS degree and I understand the issues and can develop good programming practices on-the-fly as I read. What I want to know in this order is.  1. Here is a facility of the language.  2. Here is what it means without all the caveats.  3. Here is how you write it.  4. Be careful about this... and that....( major caveats here )  5. More int the Appendix for debugging.  Instead,  It is a very dry read and no doubt with the number of peculiarities in JavaScript regarding these topics, it becomes clear that:  1. You will probably not remember all of these rules right away.  2. JavaScript being not strongly typed will allow even the best programmer to create small but potentially painful and hard to detect bugs.  3. Convince the programmer to use mnemonics to distinguish the object class/type but never states this explicitly. Especially when it comes to objects v. variables due to the immutability of variables and the peculiar behaviors associated with treating variables like objects.  4. The data type conversion rules are very similar to other languages but then there are peculiarities that may cause #3 above type bugs to painfully appear.  5. Explicit data type conversion functions can be just as confusing.  6. But he never really lays down any rules of thumb to avoid ambiguity and future bugs.   7. Even the brightest people do not hold all of these rules in their head.   8. The programmer is left to defining a set of best practices to avoid ambiguity of conversion, comparison, assignment and evaluation. Truly a lacking aspect of this book. The easy way out of all of the plethora of possible bugs are good programming practices. The author never brings this up.  9. When discussing the scope of a variable  local v. global ), the author is exceptionally ambiguous in his descriptions of JavaScript scoping. He does mention one good practice regarding scoping. However, there is a very simple solution to this. He also includes code like this:  function f  {   var scope;   // Local variable is declared at the top of the function  console.log(scope);   // It exists here, but still has \\"undefined\\" value   scope = \\"local\\";   // Now we initialize it and give it a value   console.log(scope);   // And here it has the value we expect   }   I ask only one question here. Why doesn't the author include the expected value in the comment. This kind of repetition sends the concept home. There are loose ends everywhere in his book where he makes statements like, \\" it is not what we expect \\" without any further explanation. I am lucky that I am an experienced programmer and I can look back over the code to verify what my understanding. But why should I? It would be nice to read continuously through this book without hoping on promises that it will be covered in a later chapter or having to look back over the code again.  I am beginning to like this book less and less as I read it. Come on .... , just lay out the problem in a very simple way and show how to code around it. This book is obsessed with expressing the knowledge of caveats without a basic set of coding standards to avoid them. It would be much better if we could learn the JavaScript and learn good coding without obsessing on the caveats. I am on Chapter 4 so far and there has been no discussion on programming. We have discussed loops and functions in regard to scoping but not how to write them.   I am down to one star on the first day of reading. I should not have to chop their way through the Amazon Jungle twice. Use the same trail over again. I feel like I have paid for a guide who insists on chopping a new trail through the jungle instead of using one over again. Give me a break. All of these rules without any mnemonics or rules of thumb. I can come up with them myself  but I feel like I am reading a dictionary.   So far, other than laying out the bare facts the book is not at all inspirational.   Continued later ....
0385534639|5.0|This is a very craftily-written book where a story is revealed in vignettes in different time lines and story lines.  But that doesn't mean it's hard to follow, it just means it increases anticipation.  I'm amazed at how the story has progressed by sometimes months between chapters, and gives us a glimpse at the unwinding story.  You want to keep reading to see where it's going and how it ends.
B001E75QH0|4.0|It's Indiana Jones so of course the movies are amazing, but the box itself is poorly made. The dvds are housed in flimsy slim cases. In case you don't own them already, get a move on and get them. If you already have the original trilogy and just want to own a copy of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, go and pick up a copy.
1932100660|5.0|I recently read China Study.  It was an eye opener.  I do not no why doctors are not atleast making their patients aware of the alternative; especially when the choice is drugs, surgery or long term treatments.  It also makes one aware of how this country is represented less and less by the people that we send to Washington. Read it and you will not look at thinks the same anymore.

It's small but I can read it just fine.  I have had it in for a few weeks, and it has made no difference on my battery life.  I used my phone quite a lot today, and with the app, after a 12 hour shift, there is still three quarters of my Samsung Mesmerize battery left.  I have tried the apps other people suggest, which is why I have this app.
1593975635|5.0|This book started okay. I expected it to move along a little faster. Not all books can be \\"The DaVinci Code\\" but I soon realized I was wanting more and more information. My personal thing is; I like the way Dan Brown writes. I seek knowledge, which he and his characters do also. Constantly in a slight confused state kept me going with this book. It was simple. The bad guy is: oh no that can't be right. More info. Is the good guy really a bad guy? Ugh! Frustration. Must read more! If you like Dan's style, you will like this book.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|i bought this knife on a whim just because i wanted a new knife, and it is now with-out question my favorite fixed blade i own..... and I own several.  From Gerbers to Ka-bars which i spent a lot more cash on.  The blade came super sharp.  First thing i did with it was fillet callouses off my hands, the blade has good weight and thickness.  Great stability.  I even really like the sheath.  The extra pouch is great for a metal match.  It's a quick grab survial kit all in one that i would take out with me anyday, anywhere.  Don't hesitate.  Buy it.  And with expedient shipping, i had it in 2 days.
1878424319|5.0|I purchased 4 copies of this book to share with others.  The message is powerful, simple and profound.  Applying the four agreements to your life can dramatically change your sense and love of yourself and others in your world.  It also arms you for dealing with those who wants to drag you down with them.  Very fast easy read that can do wonders for your soul.  All copies of the books were in great condition and one had an article tucked inside, related to the book, I liked very much.  Bonus score!

B00009MGGI|5.0|This British production - featuring Ian Richardson at his reptilian best as party whip, and later, Prime Minister Francis Urquhart - is superb.<br /><br />This is British political drama at its best. Highly recommended.<br /><br />January 2014 Update to Original Post:<br /><br />Since Netflix has now made a US adaptation of this series, the British original is well worth viewing as a comparison to the Netflix updated US version. This is the British production on which the Netflix production \\"House of Cards\\" is based.
0553801473|2.0|The book was a smaller hard cover version without the lifted cover. The print runs right to the very bottom of the page with no margin. I had no idea this was even an option as all others books I have seen is full sized copies with legible margins. I feel like I got shanked as I would have spent more money on a regular copy.<br /><br />By the way I am a HUGE fan of martin's for many many years
030788743X|5.0|Just writing a bit to leave a 5 star review, this book is worth the price of admission and will be one you keep at your bedside to read when you should be surfing or sleeping, it is hard to balance one's addictions at times like this.
0553579908|5.0|Anyone who says that Martin is not in the same league as Tolkien is missing something. A Song of Ice and Fire is fantasy of a high, fine order, fantasy in the tradition of Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I mean by that is that GRRM makes his fantasy highly accessible. In the same way Rowling used humour and whimsy to introduce us to his (Potter's) world, Martin uses language and detail to pull us headlong into his. The horrors of war are placed alongside the mystery and wonder of youth, the magic of discovery, and the real progression of time slipping away. Martin's heroes are not all powerful lords of the world, they are not high-level sorcerors and knights that can wade through enemies without a scratch. Many of his heroes are not even heroes at all. They reside in that grey space that defines real life - they are simply people driven by their motivations. Love. Lust. Greed. Piety. Ambition. We see all of this from the subjective point of view of the people experiencing it.<br /><br />Martin also shows himself to have a deep understanding of how we communicate - and miscommunicate. Information is scattered, disparate. We see (through his character's eyes) how confusing and muddled the world may have been in the days of knights and kings, when information traveled much more slowly and disinformation was almost the law of the land.<br /><br />The interconnectedness of Martin's world lends a realism that even Jordan somehow failed to capture. In this book even more so than A Game of Thrones we see the real costs of a war, its real effects on people. The subjective nature of the story makes even the high fantasy elements (magic, dragons, and alchemy for starters) seem realistic. This is magic of the Stephen King variety - powerful, real, usable, but not necessarily to be trusted, and never fully understood.<br /><br />If you haven't read A Game of Thrones, you must do so before reading A Clash of Kings. It's essential reading to understand the character dynamics in thisbook. All in all though, the entire series is a \\"must read\\" for any true fan of fantasy or simple good fiction.
0316098329|5.0|This book intrigued me from the moment it came out. I heard a piece on NPR with the author, and the bit I listened to didn't divulge the big \\"secret\\" of what's REALLY going on in the book, so I went into this one blind. It's told from the point of view of five year old Jack, who lives with his Ma in Room. It's all he has ever known, and the only glimpses he's ever had of the outside world he's seen on TV. But with his fifth birthday, all that is about to change. I figured out what was going on in the story pretty early on, and when I did, it was like a punch in the gut. I had to stop reading, but was compelled to pick the book up again moments later. I devoured this book--it will give you a lot to think about.

0312370849|5.0|This one is a very, very popular book at the bookstore I work at! Most Americans don't know the story of the Vel' d'Hiv roundup, and Sarah's Key will be a very enlightening book for them. It's the story of a young girl named Sarah, daughter of Jewish immigrants living in Paris at the start of World War II. Just before the Germans take control of the city, the Vel' d'Hiv round-up, organized by Paris officials, occurred, resulting in the deportation and death of almost all Jews captured that night. Sarah hides her little brother in the secret cupboard in their bedroom, thinking she'll be back in the morning. When Julia, an American journalist living in Paris in 2002, discovers Sarah's story, their lives become linked. This is a book that sells itself, and is impossible to put down. It will consume you, until you learn of Sarah's fate and how Julia deals with it. It's a remarkable story, but also a vital reminder to never forget about what happened in Paris in June of 1942. I can't recommend this book enough.
B00441GYZ6|5.0|Larry Flint was a victim of the Right ring, yes I said it the right wing, they do the same things as us left wingners only they petend to be so bloody wonderful.  Larry Flint is a idol for freedom of speech.  I saw this a few day ago on HBO.  I Didn't watch the start of it.  I love the good fight that Larry was trying to win and he will win at the end of the movie.  To some Larry was a sleze bag but aren't well all, only Larry was mostly a victim.  For once Courtney Love was in a good movie, I haven't seen much of them but will one day soon watch her stuff.<br />  This movie is a good movie I am good at writing reviews like some.  The acting was good the actors really go into the part of film.  It did make me feel sick when they were shooting up herion.  I don't like neddles.  I am going to tell people to watch this movie.  I want to watch more left wing films.<br />  My favoite part of this movie is when Larry is giving the SEX OR WAR speech. Its ok for volince to be on tv such as the those horrid Saw movies.  But people freak out about eroctia.
B0054YIQK8|5.0|This performance spoils anyone who loves opera as drama.  All other interpretations of Bizet's masterwork pale before it.  Migenes, particularly, defines Carmen in a manner that is unmatched in my (over 6 decades) experience with opera.  The Blu Ray version is extremely enjoyable as to image and sound quality.  I like its availability even though it has cost me the value of my old dvds of the work since they are no longer amongst the out-of-print.  The translation of the subtitles is a bit off to Americans.  It matters little to the opera's enjoyment.
0385341075|5.0|I either sell to the used book store, donate to the library book sale, or give away most of the books I read.  This one is one to add to my permanent library.

Also I had never read Great Expectations - now have that on my Kindle and for free.
0307887898|4.0|Author Eric Ries a computer programmer by trade and his greatest business success has been a company called IMVU, an instant messaging service that allows people to communicate using avatars. He uses his experiences as the basis for the main lessons in The Lean Startup, as well as other entrepreneurial stories from the technology industry.  The main point of this book is that business start-ups tend to be much higher-risk endeavors than they need to be. Entrepreneurs in every setting make the same mistakes. They build elaborate products before testing them with consumers. They make decisions based on the wrong information, and they stick with bad ideas long after they should.   According to Ries, a start-up is a \\"human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty\\". The key words here are \\"human\\" and \\"uncertainty\\".  A successful start-up does not just rely on a brilliant idea, but also requires managing people through all the challenges of innovation and growth, and through times when the idea will fail and when people will fight over what to do next.  Ries suggests that entrepreneurs create a \\"minimal viable product\\" as soon as they can and start testing it with consumers. It will be worth a thousand hours of strategy planning and internal analysis. Then they should keep testing every part of their business models using \\"split testing\\" - a technique taken from direct advertising, whereby you test slightly different versions of the same product with different groups of customers to see which works best.  I really enjoyed the author's to-the-point writing style.  This book is full of useful ways to rethink start-ups for any business.  If you are thinking of starting a new business, or if you are thinking of changing the direction of your business, this will give you plenty of good ideas and probably save you time and money in the process.
0786891416|3.0|A titillating mystery thriller this is not.  This is not even as good as the TV show, Castle, which they are playing off.  This is just a middle of the road, let us slap some words on a page and call it a book kind of read.  I don't know if it has been published anywhere who the actual ghost writer is, but I am hoping that it's not one of Richard Castles poker buddies, because a few of them have written some good books.<br /><br />Nikki Heat and Rook (this would be the name given to Castle's character, because calling him Pawn or Knight would just be silly) are in charge of the investigation into the death of a New York real-estate developer.  Of course everything is smoke and mirrors when it comes to Manhattan and the rich and famous, so when the death is ruled a homicide and the art collection doesn't live it to its estimated value, you throw in the Russian factor and wham-bam you have a police procedural.<br /><br />The book goes where the series has not, but then again, this is all in the imagination of a somewhat 12 year old wanting to play cops and robbers.<br /><br />If you are not looking for anything heavy or thought provoking, you might appreciate this sophomoric attempt at entertainment.  It would work great for a lunchtime read where you can pick it up over a week and not feel that you have to go back and read anything to remember where you were.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|First let me say i can completely sympathize with those who are upset that the original theatrical versions of the orginal trilogy are not part of this set but that being said i think its been taken way out of control in the view of being rational. the fact that there were over a thousand reviews on this set BEFORE it came out was insane to me, even with the leaked footaged of the changes in this release. how can one fairly give an opinion on something they havent seen in its entirety right?  Anyways, i really feel that the people at thedigitalbits.com got it right other than there critical low rating on episode 1 video quality which i found to be above and beyond what the dvd video quality was. No grain makes that movie so much easier to watch. what a great treat to see that movie look as good as it does. the worse looking film in the bunch to me is episode 6 and i guess the reason for that was the way it was shot. The softer tone in the picture just doesnt work for me but even still it looks great and the \\" horrible \\" changes i actually like. Didnt think i would but i do.  The three specail features disc's can be a little bit of a pain to navigate through but the content is worth while. The deleted scenes fron episode 4 make this set worth buying and those scenes are as \\" original \\" as you can get baby, lol. The documentary about the 501st legion is really fun aswell, to see other fans do there thing on a grand scale is kinda cool to sit back and enjoy.  The changes in this release are really quit minimal compared to a couple of lists i've seen on the internet of proposed changes that really just would rebuild the movies from the ground up. just bad news from the get go. Theres still alot of the original film left in these movies and those scnes that havent been altered are a pleasure to see in HD. Its not like every shot has a change in it. There all mostly small stuff that i feel really doesnt change much, it certainly didnt take anything away from my Star Warsexsperience. Overall its still Star Wars and it still kicks A!

B004WO774M|4.0|i like it because it's a rare edition and i think it was worth buying it for those who got it while supplies lasted at Walmart. not a lot of people can say they have this edition. well long story short, it's a great edition however it doesn't contain a spanish audio track. for those of you who are looking forward to watching this movie in spanish, i don't recommend it, however it does have spanish subtitles. although, i don't think that would be enough considering the price of this edition. Disc one only contains the film, scene and language selections, and disc two contains special features.
B004132HZS|5.0|Since the first books of Sherlock Holmes came out decades ago, the iconic character has gotten both either small screen or big screen at least once a year.  Most of these were small items produced in the UK for the British audience.  Then Robert Downey Jr. teamed up with Guy Ritchie to give Sherlock a full-blown treatment loaded with special effects.  However, the reviews of that film were mediocre as many complained about the excess of action at the expense of mystery, suspense and deliberative storytelling.  Leave it up to BBC to counter with an awesome 3-part miniseries.  Coming out at the end of 2010 for the US audience, each episode clocks in at over one hour in length; commercial free.  The episodes are set in modern-day London, with original backgrounds for all the main characters.  Watson is a veteran of the Afghan War, Mycroft works for British intelligence, and Moriarty poses as a gay man to get to Holmes.  The crimes themselves are wonderful plot devices and each episode is actually a convolution of multiple plot lines that weave in and out until they join at a great climax.  Overall, I would call this the best miniseries of all of 2010.
0062112430|4.0|This book sucked me right in and this is not my normal genre of book.  There is only two similarities in Delirium and the Hunger Games, 1st the main character is a teenage female and 2nd it take place in the future with a controlled government.  The main character was relatable and I found myself cheering for her.  I hope there is a sequel.  If not, it was a terrible ending.

0307887898|5.0|I am in the midst of doing a new startup.  I have been creating products and companies since I was 13 years old (20+ years now).  I wish I would have had this book back then.  It provides a framework for constant innovation and validates what I know to be true in the world of business.  I am confident that I have the right business model at the right time but have spent months fine tuning, trying to make it perfect before launch.  I have heard over and over again that I just need to get it out there whether perfect or not but never fully bought into that until reading this book.  I now understand.  This book has inspired me to speed up my plan and I think at the end of the day I will have a much stronger product and startup because of that.  And this book isn't just for startups.  In addition to my new startup, I own a marketing firm.  While reading this book I kept thinking of the ways the methodology in in could benefit all of my clients - from my doctors to my retailers to my restaurant clients.  Just a great read for anyone that has a product that they want to sell to the masses.  So pretty much - if you are in business, you should read this book.

1401324517|5.0|Reading Rafael Nadal's autobiography is the next best thing to being on the tennis court with him!  His story is well written and very interesting.  His book details the struggles he has overcome to become a fantastic tennis player and winner of many grand slam tournaments.  Although Rafa is naturally right handed, he switched to playing lefty which makes him all the more amazing!  Rafa is a truly gifted athlete who has trained hard to achieve his career goals.  He also seems like a really nice guy and it was fun reading his life story.  The color photos are great, too.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes tennis.  Love-Love his book!!

B005N0PJJO|5.0|In this second book of the Fifty Shades Trilogy, the romance continues between Christian and Ana from Ana's point of view... and what a busy POV it is!<br /><br />I have enjoyed this story since it was on the author's website, so it's no surprise I loved this book! The edits have indeed improved the story. \\"Darker\\" opens up with the couple apart, but soon Christian and Ana are re-negotiating their relationship.<br /><br />As in the first book of this trilogy, some aspects of the writing are sophomoric, mainly in relation to periphery characters, but don't let that deter you (!) because there is brilliance here too. The relationship between Ana and Christian is just so good. Their frank and open communication is fantastic and their story is not only totally engaging, but downright addicting! Christian (aka, Fifty) is one of the most memorable, delicious characters I have ever read. His voice is unique and clear and mesmerizing, yet he is revealed entirely through Ana's experiences and perception of him (quite a talent, Ms. James!). For both Christian and Ana, everything they think they know about their lives gets tilted at odd angles and makes their growing relationship feel like a thrill ride. All the usual suspects return to keep the \\"action\\" going (with at least 3 different mini-plots), and, of course, there is the continuing fallout from Christian's severe childhood (and possible adolescent) trauma. Issues of independence, trust, acceptance, submission and, most importantly, unconditional love are all in play. Despite the intensity and conflict the tone remains witty and playful and romantic.<br /><br />Readers complain about Ana a bit and, I must say, she took me out of my comfort zone at times. I think she's bolder than I would be in her constant questioning of Christian. But I tend not to like confrontation, so it's likely just me. But those who hate misunderstandings will appreciate that no stone goes unturned between these two '. It is refreshing to read about people who are completely guileless with one another. Ana can also come across a bit schizophrenic when her thinking swings from \\"I want this\\", to \\"I don't want this\\" to \\"do I want this\\"? However, this tension feels true to life. Her choices were not easy (too many shades of grey!). Overall, I really like Ana and I certainly enjoyed having a front row seat to her busy inner world. Those (very popular) inner characters may have been overused in this second book, but they are fabulous nonetheless.<br /><br />Something interesting to note: The original story was published one chapter at a time for the subscriber's reading pleasure, so each chapter of this book feels like \\"a full experience\\". This format created highly eventful and revealing chapters for the books and the overall story feels \\"episodic\\" not unlike the structure of \\"Outlander\\" which I found unique and very readable.<br /><br />I also noted Ms. James fleshed out several scenes with additional action and dialogue in this book during editing, which was great for me as an original reader. I thought she did a splendid job filling in some gaps and deepening the story. The author also summed up the day's events from time to time in this version. I didn't mind it, but it dragged the action down for me a bit. New readers will likely benefit from the summaries as I remember needing to summarize in my own head previously. The only quibble with this format is the repetition (Christian sets his \\"mouth in a hard line\\" about 10 times throughout the book; Ana wonders if it \\"will it always be like this\\" about 3 or 4 different things and she reminds us many times that she wants to know more about Christian), but it didn't pull me out of the story at all. In fanfiction, it doesn't feel repetitious when it takes 2 years to tell the story.<br /><br />The sensuality is once again hot, hot, hot. It doesn't feel gratuitous to me, but there is a lot of it. The sexual experiences between Christian and Ana and their growing intimacy are central to the story in FSD and are gloriously full of the darkest and lightest shades of grey.<br /><br />I can name a hundred heart-soaring, heart-rending and breathtaking moments in this book. There are many favorite scenes that I am already looking forward to re-reading (Portland to Seattle, anyone?). I am a fan, what can I say? Although British-isms still abound, there are typos, and a couple of the mini-plots are duds, I don't care. It's imperfect, but it's so very unique in its style, its structure and its content. I adore it and highly recommend it!ll of the darkest and lightest shades of grey.  I can name a hundred heart-soaring, heart-rending and breathtaking moments in this book.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|This mixer performs well; it has all the features (and more) that I expected.  I would give it a 5-star rating except for 3 things...you can decide which are important to you.  1) There is no main on/off switch.  Once you connect the power supply and plug it in, it is on forever, unless you have it connected through some type of switched outlet. 2) If the power supply goes out, you will not be able to find another like it, unless Behringer sells them...the power adapter plug is not like any I have ever seen.  3) The small blue LED \\"power on\\" indicator is bright enough to use for a searchlight.  Seriously, I don't know where they found these little blue lights,but they are BRIGHT!  I had to actually cover the light so that I could see the mixer controls.  Aside from those shortcomings, it works very well.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book was a great sequel to Something Borrowed! By the end of the 1st book I despised Darcy and when I realized that the second was all about her it took me a little time to get over her selfishness. This book is not only about Darcy but how she over comes being \\"betrayed\\". Very hart warming end and my mind had definitely changed about Darcy when I was done with the book. If you've read Something Borrowed you MUST read this book! :)

B004EPYZP8|3.0|Rather indifferent towards this movie. The plot progression was a little jagged and I thought that Ryan Phillipe's acting was less than enthralling. It was entertaining, but not nearly as much as a thriller as I was expecting. Matthew McConaughey gave a good performance but overall I was unimpressed.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi took a couple of tries to get me interested.  Pi has some personal theories and ideals about religion, instinct, and force of character he wants to express in addition to the story line.  The resulting complexity ultimately gives this book the depth that makes it worth reading.  In places the book gives a sense of excessive description, which perhaps controls the pace of the story but fails to enrich Pi's character.  As a weary bedtime reader, this led me to put the book down with no urgency to return.  When I finally picked it up at dinner one night and read it at speed, the story held together well.  I could easily ignore the thin parts of the plot and focus on the overwhelming presence of the tiger, for whatever it symbolizes.  While the plot thinned at times, the emotional power and character development remained credible and coherent.  Pi's ideas about religion, instinct and force of character have enough depth to challenge the reader to improve upon them, and the symbolism is blurry enough to support multiple angles of argument.  The book struck several positive notes with me early on, and at the conclusion opened powerful feelings of sadness and powerlessness in the face of loss.  Where you stand on the story may depend on how you feel at the particular time you read it, and how your fellow readers express their views.    Amazon reviews tend toward high rankings, so I've allowed some grade inflation...  6 stars - Buy this book now, you'll want it more than once  ==>5 stars - Will reflect well on you if given as a gift  4 stars - Worth reading to enrich your life  3 stars - Entertainment for those with time on their hands   2 stars - Fun to read, but not the best use of time  1 star  - Seemed offensive to me
1439170916|4.0|his book claims to be a \\"biography of cancer.\\"  It is really a history of the science unlocking the nature of cancer and how to fight it.  Like many such histories of science it glorifies the struggle against all odds and the scientists who persisted against all hope.  It is a success story, though there is still a lot of work left to be done and little hope that we will ever \\"conquer\\" cancer, due to its ever-changing nature.  The book reviews all the internecine battles between groups of competing scientists, but does not deal with the political battles and the politics of cancer (for that read Sam Epstein's book of that title).  It was more than a little disappointing to me, as an Occupational Health professional, that occupational cancers get almost no mention.  Asbestos gets mentioned in one paragraph out of 470 pages.  Percival Potts' story gets more attention as an origin story.  Despite all these flaws, the book is well written and a compelling story.  I enjoyed learning about the Laskers and their role, Sidney Farber's contributions, The Jimmy Fund and many other facts.  I also enjoyed the personal stories of his patients woven throughout the book.  It is worth reading, but keep in mind there is a lot more to this story.
B00002E233|5.0|I recently purchased \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" because I love shark movies (think of \\"Jaws\\") and I love Thomas Jane. I first discovered him in the 1997 film \\"Boogie Bights\\" and I am currently drooling over him in \\"Hung\\". Although this is a great action/thriller movie I couldn't keep my eyes off Thomas Jane, especially in his wet suit and shorts scenes...man what a body this guy has!<br /><br /> Anyhow, \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is really a great film. Although critics hated it upon its release in 1999 it now has gone on to be a true classic shark film. It's also known for its exceptional cast including Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, and LL Cool J. It is also known for its neat special effects.<br /><br /> The plot deals with scientists using sharks as a means to discover ways to help the human mind and to deal with mental issues. What they don't realize is that these sharks eventually become intelligent and before everyone realilzes all hell breaks loose as the sharks become determined to escape from their captors.<br /><br /> The movie was a box office hit making $165,000,000.<br /><br /> The DVD set includes director/star commentaries, still galleries, and deleted scenes.

B005G4TJI4|1.0|How could anyone watch any of these Transformers movies and consider them to be anything but garbage of the lowest order? Michael Bay is without a doubt a brainless juvenile delinquent. Bayformers 3 might not be filled with as much cross burning racism and military propaganda as part 2, but it's still an insultingly stupid movie. Now, I know this is based on a cartoon about robots that turn into vehicles, but Thor/X-Men: First Class/Captain America were based on comic books and all three of those movies were very well made for the types of films that they were. Popcorn movies don't have to be dumb and when audiences flock to see crap like Bayformers they're practically paying to be treated as though they were mentally deficient.  Michael Bay's Transformers movies are to Science Fiction as the Twilight movies are to the Horror genre and it's truly sad to see that both franchises have made soo much money as it proves that I.Q.'s are dropping across the board. Bayformers is to cinema what The Jersey Shore is to television as Justin Bieber is to music; the lowest common denominator.

B000001Y9I|5.0|\\"Purpendicular\\" is the 1996 studio album from Deep Purple, and features numerous standout tracks. Without question my favorite feature of the album is the presence of Steve Morse, one of the most fluid and captivating guitarists in the world: I'm not anti-Blackmore, but Morse is amazing and this CD really shows off his various techniques to great effect; I love the acoustic guitar (and mandolin!) parts on the Celtic-inspired \\"The Aviator\\" (Morse is that rarest of renaissance guitar superheroes who did a stint as a professional pilot among his various musical gigs.) Likewise, the beautiful acoustic opening on \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\\" is a virtuoso performance, with a much harder electric punch line.<br /><br />This album features some great writing; I am very partial to both the witty anti-fat cat lyrics and incredible instrumental parts on \\"A Castle Full of Rascals,\\" which is one of my favorite Deep Purple songs. Many of the performances on the CD are among the best of the band's legendary career, and I recommend it to any fan of Deep Purple or any fan of intense guitar rock. From the infectiously catchy guitar introducing \\"Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic,\\" to the heavy concluding riff of \\"Don't Hold Your Breath\\" (which is not credited on the CD case, but is the final bonus track of this pressing) this is an A-list album all the way.

1466208686|5.0|For any Software Engineer who aspires to land up with a job at top tech companies, the key skills that are absolute must are firm grasp on Computer Science fundamentals like Data Structure, Algorithms, and Operating Systems. There are tons of resources available out in the wild and sometimes it's so tough to find a one stop place to get all the relevant information for such tech interviews. Gayle's CTCI does a great job of combining all of them into a single repository in way that makes things look easy. This book is not only a compendium of most important topic and problems commonly asked at tech interviews, it also gives you an interviewer's perspective. Along with 150+ technical problems and their in depth solutions, it touches on aspects like soft skills that most Engineers ignore or are unaware of. After having read this book, I sincerely felt that I lacked skills on so many fronts (technical and non-technical both) and this book certainly helped me patch them. I personally have been benefited from this book, and have been able to get multiple offers. I would highly recommend this book to everyone who is out there interviewing at such tech companies.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was too young when the originals were made, I just love a good story with great special effects. These Blu-rays are beautiful, all 6 of them look amazing, and sound amazing. The look and sound of these movies are so great that I fell in love with these movies all over again. It was like watching them for the first time. You know when something is right in front of you, but until the right times you never really see it. That was my experience with these movies. I didn't think I could like them anymore than I already do, but these Blu-rays have proven me splendidly wrong.
B004FYF3IG|5.0|I was worried that they would run out of ideas and that the show would start getting stale.  This season did not let me down one bit.  I am a huge fan and often have my own Supernatural Marathons starting with season 1 and watching them all over again every few months.  I don't have cable so I watch each episode on Amazon's Instant Video so I can watch throughout the season.  I also purchase the DVD sets when they are available so that I can share with my friends.  There are so so many great episodes this season that I know I am going to have a hard time waiting for the next season to start.  If you like the past season you will not be disappointed with season six.  I can't wait to find out where the story takes us next.  Thanks Amazon for your Instant Video program so I can keep up with my show and for the fast shipping getting my DVDs here so quickly on release.  The packaging for this season is also so much better then past seasons.  Much more sturdy and safe.  Enjoy all!

B005FUTBWS|1.0|The title of the film is clear what this film is; an attempt to smear anyone not far left and Christians, in particular. However, for bigoted liberals, such ridicule is fair game, isn't it?
B003Y5H51K|2.0|With the name of James Cameron attached as executive producer (actually, he is one of the film's nine producers), you might expect a thrilling adventure tale in \\"Sanctum.\\" The beautifully shot Australian film is about an expedition team led by a veteran cave diver Frank (Richard Roxburgh). The group explores an underwater cave system in Papua New Guinea, but when a cyclone suddenly hits the area, the expedition goes terribly wrong.   Fantastic cinematography cannot disguise a run-of-the-mill script and stock characters including Frank's twenty-something son Josh (Rhys Wakefield), the team's financial backer Carl (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson). Like the passengers in \\"The Poseidon Adventure,\\" they struggle to survive. One major difference is that in \\"Sanctum\\" we don't really care about the characters.  The screenplay by John Garvin and Andrew Wright is said to be based on the Andrew Wright's real-life experience. It is a terrifying story being trapped inside a flooded cave, but here the story is told in an ineffective way. Some scenes are rather good, I admit. The deluge of water itself is scary to look at, and so are the claustrophobic spaces. It takes cinematic narrative skills, however, to generate tension and suspense, which the director seems to forget to use.   In short, with decent dark cave and underwater shots, \\"Sanctum\\" attempts to be a gritty survival action movie, which it is not. It needs better storytelling. We don't need a strained father-son relationship. We don't need a Coleridge poem, either. We don't like watching characters constantly make stupid decisions. What we need is a slick narrative, convincing dialogues and sense of danger lurking in the dark.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a very entertaining season to re-watch.  I forgot that there were so few episodes the first year.  Wish there were more.  One of the few quality TV shows on the air.  Lets hope it keeps on getting renewed.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|Any thriller or suspense about a 16-year-old girl assassin requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief. The task becomes even harder when the storyline is saddled with countless plot holes, incredible coincidences and impossible motives. Don't get me wrong. I know disregard to realistic possibility is not actually a bad thing, and I enjoyed such actions as \\"The Long Kiss Good Night.\\" But in the case of \\"Hanna,\\" things just went too far.<br /><br />The film centers on a girl Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan), raised and home-schooled by her father Erik Heller (Eric Bana) in the wilderness of Finland. Under Erik's tutelage Hanna has been training more than ten years to be a perfect killing machine. Hanna is growing up fast, getting more and more interested in the world outside, and one day Erik asks her to make a decision. She does it, and deadly battles with CIA operatives begin, while she meets people including a traveling family in the desert.<br /><br />You can argue that \\"Hanna\\" is not really an action thriller, but a character-driven drama about the titular heroine like \\"La Femme Nikita.\\" Some might find fairy-tale elements in some of the episodes and characters, and Cate Blanchett's wicked-witch like agent is one of them. To me, \\"Hanna\\" seems more like a pretentious effort from filmmakers who fail to realize the film's derivative premise, which is hardly covered by the showy camerawork (including the director Joe Wright's trademark long take), and the superficial treatment of dramatic and allegorical aspects.<br /><br />I like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett. I tried to like the film, but found it very hard to do so, when Hanna, easily frightened by television and electricity, drops in a shop, uses a computer and access the internet; when chasing agents commit stupid mistakes again and again; when, most importantly, secrets and twists (very slowly revealed) are nothing really original. The only thing I like about the film is the thumping score by The Chemical Brothers.

159448385X|4.0|Mariam grows up living with her unmarried mother in a kolba, a hut outside the city where her father lives with his three wives and his legitimate children. A respected businessman, Jalil visits Mariam every week and provides for the girl and her mother. When Mariam demands a place in his family, though - to be treated truly as one of his daughters - tragedy follows.<br /><br />Laila grows up the daughter of a once respected teacher, who finds himself banished from that job after the communists take over Afghanistan. When her two older brothers are killed in the country's battle to free itself from Soviet domination, Laila's mother retreats into her grief; and Laila, fast growing into a young woman, becomes closer than ever to her childhood best friend. That causes gossip, because Laila's best friend happens to be a boy, not another girl. Then a stray rocket tears Laila's family apart; and she finds herself obliged to become second wife to the brutal tradesman who for the past 18 years has been Mariam's husband.<br /><br />The relationship between Mariam and Laila is this book's heart, and it makes fascinating reading. The stories of women in a culture like that of Afghanistan under the Taliban can be heartrending, and the author pulls no punches in his descriptions of what life becomes for Mariam and Laila; but in the end it is truly a life-affirming, uplifting tale. A tale of survival, and of what makes surviving worthwhile.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle\\"
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I grew up with the original trilogy, watching it get tampered with during each edition that came out.  Regardless, I still really enjoy the series.  It looks beautiful on the TV, and the extra content it comes with makes the set completely worth it in my opinion.  I can understand if someone is looking at this from a 'purist' standpoint and gives it the no go, but even for all the crazy additions contained within the actual movies, I'm still a kid at heart, and still love the series for what it is: A GREAT escape from reality for a few hours.   Give it a shot.  I really don't think you'll be disappointed at all.
B0006HBZXS|1.0|I received this movie, and am very disappointed in the quality.  It freezes and skips during the first 20 minutes or so.  Makes it difficult to watch.
0786838655|4.0|I first heard about this book when I was watching the special features on the movie version of The Lightening Thief.  I absolutely loved the movie (and still intend on purchasing it) but didn't realize until afterwards that it was actually based on a book.  Of course, after viewing the movie, I instantly wished I had read the book first.  Since the movie came out, I've been dying to get my hands on a copy.  So of course, when I saw it at Goodwill for only $.50 I had to snatch it up before someone else did.<br /><br />This book is absolutely amazing.  Even better than the movie (as most are).  Admittedly, it's the first book I've ever read that deals with the Greek gods.  Not that the books aren't out there, I just have yet to manage to get my hands on them.  Now that I've read this one, I'm even more interested in reading books of the nature. I absolutely loved it.  As soon as I began reading I fell in love with the character of Percy Jackson.  The things he goes through, magical and non-magical, on a daily basis are amazing and I loved following along as he grew and learned with the rest of us.<br /><br />I found myself getting lost in his world and I really cannot wait to read the rest of the series.  Now if they would only make the rest of the books into movies, I would be a happy (Half-Blood) camper...)

B00065MDRW|5.0|This is one of those albums that only very few are better. It's a landmark in music, they started progressive rock and influenced a lot of bands. It's arguably one of the best albums of all time, if it wasn't for King Crimson than their wouldn't be the music that's around today. It starts off with 21st Century Schizoid Man, faster progressive rock with all kind of different genres in it. You can tell that progressive rock started as post-psychedelic rock and evolved overtime, eventually psychedelic went out of style in the mid-late '70s but progressive rock is still consistent today. I Talk to The Wind is almost the opposite, it's much a slower ballad and less experimental than the opening track. Epitaph is the best though and it's one of the best songs ever made. The instruments have a unique sound to them and have various tempos. Greg Lake is an amazing vocalist, it also has some some of the best lyrics ever written and some great instrument arrangements. The entire album's a classic and if you don't already own it than you should, it's not worth missing.
030746363X|3.0|Timothy Ferriss's, The 4-Hour Body is a conundrum, an ironic exposition that is both informative and flawed, as well as entertaining while being redundant. Mr. Ferriss claims the book is revolutionary and unconventional in approach. Perhaps to a degree, but much of the information offered here has been written before and in greater deal. The diet he promotes is very close to the Paleo-diet and some of the supplements he suggests have very little science to back them up. The experiments he conducts upon himself are regularly done in controlled environments. He never really touches upon the placebo effect or the ill effects of stress on the human body(albeit the stress suffered by debt and a forty-hour work-week as opposed to a four work-week and the palatial circumstances Mr. Ferriss claims to afford).<br /><br />Okay, so the book is a bit hackneyed at times. But the big positive to all this is that his book does not linger on a subject for too long. He touches on a hypothesis, offers you some data to back it up and then moves on to another topic. That's the book's greatest strength. Most people want results, the data is secondary. The 4-Hour Body does not smother you with a plethora of long winded, hubristic science, which causes your eyes to glaze over and your brain to boil until caramelized. Instead, it offers quick tidbits of information, glamorized and formatted in such a way that you don't even have to read the chapters chronologically.<br /><br />Alas, science hounds do not fret. Within each chapter, he offers a more collegiate explanation of how he came to his conclusions. It's annotated and considered optional to read. I guess it kind of reads like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy of the sport, nutrition and fitness universe.<br /><br />Did I enjoy the book? Sure, it was informative and entertaining enough--definitely an easy read. Do I think it's revolutionary? No dice. Most of it was interesting, but the sex parts seemed kind of gimmicky and unnecessary. And no book is ever going to teach a person how to properly swing a baseball bat. You need to be observed by another to gain such a mastery. I don't know why, but that topic irked me the most.<br /><br />C.S.

B004LWZVZC|3.0|\\"The Conspirator\\" is NOT an entertainment. I'm hardly the first to say so; most of the 80-some reviews already posted have taken note of the film's political agenda. Though the script ostensibly depicts the military trial, conviction, and execution of Mary Surratt -- in whose boarding house in Washington DC the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempted assassination of William Seward were plotted -- a viewer of this film would need to be utterly unaware of current events not to grasp that the film is implicitly a denunciation of the actions of the George W Bush administration during the \\"War on Terror\\". I have no doubt that director Robert Redford and script writer James Solomon intended a connection to be understood between the suspension of habeas corpus in 1863, during the Civil War, and the assaults on civil liberties of the Bush/Cheney neo-conservatives in the name of national security. Yes, there are points of relevant comparison, but unfortunately there are overlapping agendas. I'd love to avoid ranking this preachment-disguised-as-a-film with stars, but I can't. So, it gets one star for muddle or five stars for good intentions, but understand, please, that the ranking is arbitary and could go either way. Therefore, my three stars ... a 'mugwump' solution if ever!<br /><br />First I have to be honest about my own agendas. I'm opposed to capital punishment for any crime under any circumstances, although my opposition is totally rational rather than emotional. There are acts so unspeakably hideous that I would relish shredding the perpetrators with a cheese-grater, but I don't believe judicial murder serves the good of society. The hanging of Mary Surratt, the climax of this film, is patently intended to draw my/your sympathy to a woman who may have been unfairly tried and unjustly punished. Had I been one of the panel of judges in 1865, I would not have voted for her execution, nor for the execution of the other three convicted plotters. I would have stuck with my conscience. But the sympathy for Mary Surratt is merely a ploy in this film, a distractor, a red herring if you will. In fact, the evidence against Mary Surratt is far more than circumstantial. She was guilty, in that she certainly knew what was being plotted. Even Redford and Solomon can't help allowing for her guilt. So the \\"agenda\\" here isn't opposition to capital punishment or supposition that Mary Surratt was innocent.<br /><br />That brings us back to Bush/Cheney. And that puts me on the spot, because I fiercely agree with the implications of the film. Bush/Cheney violated the provisions of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The prison camp at Guantanamo, the use of torture, the kidnappings -- all villainies and violations of the best American ideals! Take a look at the other one/two star reviews of The Conspirator, and you'll find that supporters of the Bush/Cheney doctrines denounce the film's agenda. And here I am, supporting that agenda yet disapproving of the film! What's up?<br /><br />John Surratt Jr., Mary's son, fled from Washington before the assassination which he had certainly helped to plot. In the film, his mother pleads with him not to go, not to do anything reckless, and he responds that \\"the War isn't over yet\\". Oh boy, was he right! The War was won on battlefields but it wasn't over in the \\"hearts and minds\\" of Americans northern or southern. It still isn't over; a good pollster could easily show a strong correlation between opinions about the Civil War and the ideological divisions between Liberals and Conservatives (both mislabeled) in the USA today.<br /><br />I suspect that one's reaction to this film will be determined by one's understandings of the Civil War and Reconstruction. Viewers with Southern, States' rights sympathies would thus be expected to acclaim the film as a sound denunciation of 'Big Government' tyranny. The depiction of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton as an unscrupulous tyrant would suit their prejudices perfectly; he was, after all, a \\"radical reconstructionist\\". However, such viewers soon run into a dilemma. Most of them are quite ready to side with Bush/Cheney over the so-called Patriot Act and the use of torture. Which agenda comes first?<br /><br />The film muddles diverse agendas too much for my taste. The Civil War was NOT a conflict over States' Rights; that was always a rhetorical smokescreen for other agendas. The Civil War was about slavery,and it's problematical for me that slavery is not even given an allusion in the film. One can argue that the War was not fought by the North to free the slaves, but the other side of the issue is plain as sin. From the perspective of the South, it was a war fought to preserve and extend slavery. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was the dramatic first blow in the perpetuation of the Civil War  -- Johnny Surratt got that right -- which reversed the Northern victory in battle. I'm not being original; it's been said since the 1870s that \\"the North won the War but lost the Peace\\". The violence that thwarted Reconstruction, the ugly 'Redemption' and disenfranchisement of the slaves and their descendants, the Jim Crow apartheid and racial cleansing violence of the South for the next hundred years, and the still-too-evident racism of so many in America ... Hey, it's painfully clear that Edwin Stanton, even in this slanderous portrayal, had a point. Not only the assassins and their accessories, like Mary Surratt, were guilty. The entire Confederacy, military and civilian, got unmerited mercy and used it chiefly for revenge.<br /><br />Who can sincerely believe that the virulent attacks on the character of Barack Obama are not at least significantly an expression of racism? These days, 150 years afterwards, Civil War Consciousness is far stronger among Southerners (those of Southern heritage, not those who happen now to live in the South) than among non-Southerners (I use that negative designation to include the many who have no particularly image of themselves as Northerners). \\"The South Will Rise Again!\\" The Myth of the Lost Cause is still taught in schools and homes. Take a look at the mendacious twaddle in \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to the South (and Why It Will Rise Again)\\" by Clint Johnson or the \\"PIG to American History\\" by Thomas E. Woods. I'd wager that both Johnson and Woods would have ferociously ambivalent reactions to this film, just as I have, but for opposite reasons.<br /><br />What a muddle of historical meditations this awkward film stirs up in my mind!dical reconstructionist\\".

9626343613|5.0|Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:<br /><br />\\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\\"<br /><br />It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosene, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out.

B004M9AS3Y|5.0|LOVE this bag.   It does as advertised and best of all it wasn't too expensive as compared to other camera bags.   It had all the features I was looking for:   - Side access to camera  - Lap top slot  I have a smaller DSLR Canon T3.  There was enough room in there for my camera plus a laptop and I was able to squeeze in a notebook and folder as well. It was a snug fit with everything in it but did the job.   Also, I like the fact that the camera portion collapses and can be used strictly as a back pack if you chose to.

B0041KKYDI|5.0|I must admit when I learned of what Aaron Ralston experienced I said, \\"Idiot! You should've known better than NOT to let people know where you were going.\\" I know now that was very ignorant and wrong of me. I say this because I have done the same thing, gone hiking, and biking without letting anyone know where I was going. Thank the Lord I have never had to amputate a portion of my body like Aaron did.  I have liked James Franco and glad to see his career take off. In 127 Hours he looked like an ordinary guy, but his acting is extraordinary. He plays the part of Aaron Ralston with genuine skill, making you believe he's simply another guy who loves the outdoors, and finds himself in stuck between a rock and a hard place. Could've happened to any one of us. The movie skilfully shows what Aaron went through day by day, what crossed his mind, and what he was going to do. I won't spoil it for you. Watch this movie and you'll see for yourself.  David Lucero, author of THE SANDMAN
B0052GACNM|5.0|Duets II is a wonderful release from the great Tony Bennett and other talented artists who perform sublime duets with Tony and that's grand. What we get here is five star, high quality control music all the way through! I marvel at how well Tony's voice has held up over time; and this CD gives us the last recording of Amy Winehouse who Tony referred to as \\"extraordinary.\\" In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />\\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" gets a fantastic treatment by Tony and Lady Gaga; Lady Gaga shows just how well she can belt on this number with its strong musical arrangement to accompany them. \\"One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)\\" has Tony singing with John Meyer; this is a gem! They play with major and minor keys to make this number memorable. \\"Body and Soul\\" has Amy Winehouse and Tony never letting go of a single superfluous note; it's so sad that Amy passed away but at least with recordings like this last one of hers (with Tony Bennett) we can still enjoy her talent. \\"Don't Get Around Much Anymore\\" has Tony and Michael Bubl&eacute; squarely front and center--right where they belong! Tony is joined by k.d. lang on \\"Blue Velvet\\" while Tony and Aretha Franklin do great justice to \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing.\\" I really like \\"The Girl I Love\\" performed by Tony with Sheryl Crow--and how's about that piano in the arrangement?<br /><br />Tony Bennett and Willie Nelson do a splendid job performing \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street;\\" and listen for yet another gem in \\"Who Can I Turn to (When Nobody Needs Me)\\" as done by Tony and Queen Latifah. \\"Speak Low\\" teams Tony with Norah Jones and they do this to perfection--and beyond! \\"This Is All I Ask\\" has the great Josh Groban singing beautifully along with Tony; and listen for Natalie Cole to outdo even herself when she sings \\"Watch What Happens\\" with Tony. Excellent!<br /><br />\\"Stranger in Paradise\\" gets the royal treatment from Tony Bennett and Andrea Bocelli; they are both singing at their usual very best and it's all exquisite. \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" couldn't have been done any better than the way Tony Bennett and Faith Hill perform it here; their excellent diction and sense of timing enhance this even more. Alejandro Sanz and Tony do a great job on \\"Yesterday I Heard the Rain;\\" this is a highlight of the album as Alejandro and Tony infuse this with so much heart and soul. \\"It Had to Be You\\" sounds nothing short of perfect as Tony and Carrie Underwood deliver this faultlessly; and the album ends strong with Tony Bennett and Mariah Carey doing \\"When Do the Bells Ring for Me?\\"<br /><br />Tony Bennett is and always will be one of the very few performers who possess incredible amounts of genius; and he certainly sings with the best of them here! It all leaves me wanting more. This is a must-have for Tony Bennett fans and people who love the artistry of the others.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Here is a Yes album that, I believe brings you back to a classic Yes album. I heard the title track, live at Jones Beach Theater, NY, a day or two before the album was released, and thought is sounded good. Once I heard the full song with all \\"parts\\" (1-5) I really enjoyed it. The multiple parts of the song, seemed to grow on me, and I couldn't stop play it. The whole album is a pleasure to listen to.   As a classic Yes admirer, I miss Jon and Rick, but this is probably as close as we'll all get, and I embraced it after the disappointment with the previous album 11 years ago: Magnification.  To Steve Howe, Hour Of Need, needs to be longer......what a beautiful well written, composed and produced song!!! as is the whole album. This song is a gem, but I felt cheated with it being so short. Still love it, so I guess I just have to hit the replay button a few more times!!!  Would love to hear the whole album Live in Concert.......now after hearing just a taste live. Its great getting acclimated to new Yes music that reverts to the Yes Classic genre.

This should be on the bestseller list for all eternity, and a must for cancer patients and their physicians!
B005DZMNHA|5.0|Wow! Chris Rea really comes out swinging on this one. The first three songs are a bit 'harder' than what Rea has done in the past, but in a good way.<br /><br />I was watching CNN last night when this CD arrived via UPS. The top news story was about a gay teen who killed himself, after months of trying to encourage other gay teens to 'stay strong.' Then, what do I hear on the first track of this CD? \\"Dancing my Blues Away,\\" a song about a young boy's troubles/struggles. I doubt this is the theme Rea was trying to cover in this song, but much of the content paralleled what I had just heard on CNN.<br /><br />Rea's voice holds up well on this CD, compared to the songs he put out in the 70's and beyond. As noted, there is a rocking start, and with great instrumentation. This collection is a far cry from 'On the Beach,' 'Fool if you think it's Over,' and 'Diamonds,' some of Rea's more popular songs. His voice also dominates well on this CD, with very little from back-up singers. These songs are also more upbeat than some of his prior works.<br /><br />For Rea fans, you can hear flavors of \\"You can go Your own Way;\\" \\"Road to Hell;\\" \\"Texas;\\" and \\"Looking for the Summer\\" on this collection. I can also hear threads of Boz Scaggs, Talking Heads, and Van Morrison here. In fact, Rea gives Boz Scaggs a challenge in the 'smooth and cool' category with some of these songs.<br /><br />I was bopping down old Route 66 Highway today (now, Interstate 40), listening to 'Last Open Road.' What an experience! There are a few blues numbers here, with a wonderful beat. There are also a few mellow songs, but only one grab-your-partner-and-slow-dance number. But with a title like, 'Lose My Heart in You,' how could you not.<br /><br />These songs will have you tapping your feet and bopping along. It's a great collection of songs, both for long-time Rea fans and newbies.<br /><br />Now, if Rea would only tour the US. Otherwise, I've got to buy tickets for his upcoming European tour.<br /><br />Good job!
B0052GACNM|3.0|At the time of the release of the 2 best-selling albums of Sinatra's career, the Duets albums from the mid-'90s, I was elated. Many of us simply didn't want to believe, in fact rejected the unthinkable, i.e. that Sinatra was finished, so these latter-day gifts were sufficient cause for celebration.  And for the first month or two after each of the two releases, I played them repeatedly.  But soon the novelty wore off, and I had no interest in these concoctions, especially with the vast Columbia catalog, the priceless Capitol recordings with Nelson Riddle, the final extended chapter of his Reprise years all beckoning to be revisited.  Apparently, others felt much the same (recently, I've seen either disc going for a buck or two used).<br /><br />The Bennett Duets are less \\"tricked-up\\" than the Sinatra ones, which involved long-distance, call-in performances by his partners.  Moreover, Tony sounds almost as good as ever, much more vibrant physically and in control musically than Ole Blue was after 1990.  Moreover, the program comprises winning songs from the Great American Songbook, with Tony so confident and secure that, rather than being \\"carried\\" by any of his younger, more vigorous, partners, he's the one who makes up for their deficiencies with this material.<br /><br />Perhaps the track with the greatest interest will be \\"Body and Soul\\" with Amy Winehouse.  It's the most recorded popular tune in music history (check out the numbers at jazzstandards.com or allmusic.com), partly because much of its satisfaction comes from the challenge of executing it--difficult but ingenious and logical chords, unforgettable melody, mediocre lyrics--but Bennett and Winehouse (who sounds mature lightyears beyond her actual age) pull it off quite nicely.  Listening to Amy's first album--\\"Frank,\\" the one before her hugely popular \\"Back to Black\\"--it soon became clear that the very young girl at this time knew jazz phrasing and could swing. Once she finished the daunting \\"Moody's Mood for Love,\\" you knew right then that she was capable of delivering the goods in more than one style or genre.<br /><br />The one thing that may be slightly off-putting is Amy's attempt to sound rougher, more blas&eacute;, even a bit inebriated (stoned--or an affectation?), than either she or the song requires.  The same could be said about Lady Gaga's otherwise sparkling performance on \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" (what a travesty this number becomes when certain latter-day singers substitute \\"champ,\\" which not only wastes Lorenz Hart's clever, subtly ironic, lyrics but actually destroys the non-conformist, free and independent spirit of the lady portrayed in the song).  But Lady Gaga sings the song and the word \\"Tramp\\" with the most assured conviction (it's Tony who almost messes it up by (only once) substituting what sounds like \\"champ\\").  Though she could do without a couple of \\"growls,\\" Gaga proves that she's more than some sort of insubstantial hoax, one-trick pony, or year-round Halloween media creature.  Like Tiny Tim (whose musicianship won me over after the initial shock wore off), the person who plays the role of \\"Lady Gaga\\" is a wonderful \\"straight\\"performer, perhaps even a first-rate musician.  Sounds like she's listened to Sinatra.)<br /><br />The duets with Michael Buble, Natalie Cole and Dana Evans (Queen Latifah) are predictably right in Tony's wheelhouse.  He could easily make an entire album of arresting performances with any one of these musicians, who have jazz sensibilities similar to Tony's.<br /><br />The rest of the album will score big with some listeners, especially those who responded favorably to Michael Bolton singing with Pavarotti.  But to my ears the album tends to get a bit thick and mushy, even \\"injured\\" by musicians who simply can not swing.  I appreciated Merle Haggard's lengthy interview in the NY Times shortly after his \\"jazz\\" album.  Whatever one might think of the result, there was no question that Merle knew he was in unfamiliar territory, over his head and studying up as hard and fast as he could about the elocution, phrasing, and timing required to deliver a classic Gershwin ballad or swing tune and do it justice. Willie Nelson keeps revisiting the \\"American Songbook,\\" but I have yet to hear him adapt to its standards.)<br /><br />Bocelli and Groban contribute to the schmaltzy quality weighing down stretches of the album (The solo version of Tony's early signature song, \\"Stranger in Paradise,\\" is far superior to this new version.  Inexplicably, Aretha goes after a song that was one of the highlights of the first Duets album, \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing.\\"  My advice: revisit the first version with Tony and George Michael or simply forget about it.  Aretha is one of the all-time great soul singers (starting out as a jazz singer, despite the popularity of her dad's recorded sermons), and she was delightful on the Sinatra Duets album, providing much needed life.  But here she takes on a freely structured song that goes no where unless the singer is able to take it somewhere.  She's in good voice but the effect on this listener is: \\"Been there, done that.\\"<br /><br />As for the others, if you prefer a duet for Harold Arlen's wrist-slasher, \\"One for My Baby,\\" make it any Sinatra version, or even the Kurt Elling-John Pizzarelli meeting.  On this occasion, the song, which is a musical soliloquy, or a Robert Browning dramatic monologue addressed to a silent auditor, and moreover a haunting cry of despair (one of Sinatra's greatest \\"suicide songs\\"), was a mistake from the very beginning (I can imagine the Arlen estate even being offended by this insult to the the memory of Harold Arlen and lyricist Johnny Mercer).  Performed as a duet by Tony and his youthful counterpart, it comes off as little more than slightly mischievous and lightweight albeit pleasant musical conversation.  In fact, there's a bit too much pleasant, pretty music on the album--nice-sounding voices, thick layers of sweet-sounding strings.<br /><br />But for Tony and the highlights on the album, the result, on balance, still amounts to a winner: 3 stars, a definite thumbs-up  though certainly not a high-five.  This time I'm not as quick to pull the trigger as was the case with the so-so (in retrospect) Sinatra Duets.  I could readily list (and produce from my collection) a dozen albums by Tony that trump both Duets dates--timeless performances, some with just Tony and the piano of Bill Evans, or Tony with Flanagan's or Sharon's trio, or Tony with Count Basie.  The man unquestionably knows the routine (to quote from the aforementioned Arlen song), and on a number of his solo recordings, he's gone beyond and above it--way above it, reaching artistic heights  on the level of the best by Armstrong, Astaire, Garland, Holiday, Crosby, and even Frank, singing his heart out just for the joy of it (and not a fiddler in sight).as he could about the elocution, phrasing, and timing required to deliver a classic Gershwin ballad or swing tune and do it justice.

0439023483|4.0|My youngest daughter (age 14) handed me the book after she finished reading it.  I read it in a weekend and found it to be a real page turner (5-stars).  I immediately went onto Amazon and bought the two follow on books.  This is definitely a book that parents should read before (or immediately after) their children have and then have discussions about the book.  I know that we all have above average intelligence children and they will be able to understand the book completely on their own -- but maybe discussing the book together will bring you closer.  You certainly will want to take the opportunity to help re-enforce what morality you believe your child should have.  This is the main reason that I knocked off one star -- parents really should read the book and discuss it with their children.  The book is dark.  If it were a movie, I would argue it needs more comic relief.  Judge your own child's personality and decide if reading dark material would bring them down too much or can they easily separate out a depressing story from reality.  Having read all three books (and yes, this part doesn't pertain to *just* The Hunger Games), it feels like there was one large book written and it was broken into two and a half books.  At the end of the two and half books there were lots of unanswered questions and the filler was added trying to answer those questions (stretching the whole to three books).  The first two books are absolute page turners.  The third book (which did not effect the star rating for this book) is a little choppy as it tries to cover questions that the reader might have.  I wasn't going to write a review until I read some of the other reviews.  Some have complained that there is no moral message to the book.  There is, but it is subtle.  If you miss the moral message it is possible that your world view is too different from the message.  And no, I won't say what I believe the message to be because I hate spoilers in reviews).  Some have complained thatthe characters are unrealistic in their goals and values.  If the characters were coming straight from our world, I would agree.  However, if you imagine the toll on priorities and how the dark world that Suzanne Collins created would wear and morph people's values over the preceding generations, I would say that Ms Collin's projection of people's values is certainly plausible.  I'm certainly not willing to run an experiment to find out.  Some have complained that the story is a blatant rip off of other stories.  These same people point to the beauty of J.K.Rowling.  While I thoroughly enjoy  Rowling's work, perhaps these reviewers should read Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game -- and realize what a blatant rip-off the Potter series is ...  No.  Even after pointing out the remarkable similarities, Card goes on to defend people taking the same plot line and weaving their own stories around it.  After all, aren't there only 7 plots?  In summary, if you normally don't read what your children are reading, I would make an exception in this case.  If you can, read the book(s) before they do.  If you can't, try to read the books anyway and discuss them with your kids.
B000B8QF00|4.0|the cd came early and was in great condition. i love the cd very much and will buy from this person again.
B0054N73EY|1.0|In today's mass marketed culture there always has to be \\"product\\" to fill a slot on a business marketing schedule. Perhaps Warner Brothers kept RHCP to fill a marketing slot. \\"Oh people will remember the name and just buy it\\". This is the only reason I can think of to keep this band signed to the label.  As a band ages by listening to their back catalog you can tell if they ever \\"had\\" something or if they were just lucky in a prior time frame. RHCP had a burst in time but that burst was long long LONG gone.  And that is many many CD's ago! This release makes it blatantly clear there never was THAT much talent as a BAND. I preface the word BAND, meaning a collective of people not individuals musical ability.   The weakest link in this band has always been songwriting. The number 1 reason this collection fails miserably is there are no songs. Vocals are always the main component in songwriting. What makes this painful is the lack of melody. Instead of having a musical ear to ebb & flow it sounds as if words were scrawled on a piece of paper and then forced into pre recorded tracks. Vocals are herky jerky, with poor meter. None of the vocals have any ebb & flow. It's choppy. It like he's stuttering at points. It sounds like the writer had a tin ear, or simply put, no sense of melody. It all translates to not being catchy. No ear candy here to make you want to buy.  A singer is responsible for carrying a band. The sex appeal thing had a good weigh as to why this band was signed, but sex appeal only goes so far. You can only take looks so far, ie: the muscular body of the singer. Lack of vocal ability runs parallel to the non existent songwriting. The second flaw needing attention is the vocals. Boy does Anthony need massive help!   Some heartfelt recommendations for the band:   1-If you can't write standout songs get some good songs written by other people which you can embellish and make your own. The more obscure the better, people will think you wrote them.  2-Get another producer whose output you like. Trust their judgment and let them guide you. Check your egos at the door and do what they say as they can see a bigger picture.  3-Listen to some vintage old school funk and classic rock as inspiration and get down to business. Let those slow tempo fragments go away.   4-Make sure the vocals are the number one concern. Even if Anthony needs to be coached word by word with massive punch in's. Do that!    5-If need be (and this may be painful to fans), fire Anthony and get someone else who can really sing. He has always been the weakest member of the band.  I feel RHCP do have it in them to produce a stellar CD but factors need to change. Please don't disappoint again with a crappy CD like this! Get down to business and put some real effort into it and make heads turn. Work Harder! You can do it! You can do it! Please no more crap like this.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Maybe OK on phones, but broken on tablets. Looks like a fun game, but the screen size problem makes it very hard to play.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|Didn't care for this book and wouldn't recommend it unless you need a good cry at the end. The characters Emma and Dexter weren't all that likeable. Oh,they had their moments, but those were few. Their sense of humor and sarcasm were witty but overall I didn't care for either Emma or Dexter. Dexter comes from a family with money, he's handsome, charming and witty with average intelligence. On the other hand he can be an obnoxious, conceited, shallow, immature jerk. In his delusion he comes across at times as innocent as real life is going on all around him. He experiences an occasional bit of reality and it seems such a surprise to him when he actually gets it. The only time I really liked Dexter was when he had his most sincere human moments and those are only when he and Emma FINALLY get together near the end of the book.   Emma is very intelligent but is frumpy, has no self confidence, doesn't come from money and is a bit envious of those with looks and money which just makes her bitter and angry. She camouflages her anger with raging social causes. She's so socially conscience and offended about so many issues, one would tend to believe this book originated in the 60's rather than the late 80's.  Although she is attractive, due to her lack of confidence she shies away from any attempt to improve her frumpy outward appearance throughout most of the book. She's attracted to all the wrong men and is just bitchy. I got sick of her feeling sorry for herself for all that was wrong with her life. I wanted to scream CHANGE IT.  Instead she harps on Dexter.  The only time the two of them are truly happy is when they get together but that takes almost 20 years of friendship and for the most part the waiting for them to get together is just boring.  The book picks up about ¾'s through then ends sadly.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Good game.  Nice scaling in difficulty. fun music and graphics.  Keeps me coming back.  Touch interface works well on Infuse.
0385523912|5.0|I rarely review products on Amazon mostly because I usually don't have strong feeling either way to bother. In this case, I'm making an exception. This is an amazing book. I could not put it down.  By the end, I felt like I personally got to know each of the main characters - 6 people whose personal stories Demick used to write this book. I always wanted to know more about North Korea but after reading this book I almost feel like I got to know it too well.   Words of caution: this is not what you would call \\"light reading\\". At times, it is depressing and heart-wrenching. Sometimes you almost want to cry. Everything that happens on this book is real. But, in my opinion, this is what makes it so great.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Smooth gameplay,  good graphics. The puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. Would definitely recommend this game, and you can't beat the price.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I am always fascinated to see who will get involved in Dexter's mixed up world each season.  The idea of a victim accidentally in the mix works amazingly well.  I hope the coming season will continue to be as inventive.

B005EZJ3MW|2.0|what the hell. she/the record company suckers us in to like her with the rock. then they say well i think we can sell more records if you do pop/r&b. the problem with that, most of her fans liked the stuff she put out before. plus she is by far no means as good as christina aquilera. and they make her do all these annoying runs. her voice is ok but its not strong enough to do that stuff, and she does it over and over and over on this cd. some of the songs sound make her sound like shes still a kid, she's not. there are some ok songs on here besides skyscraper but not much. i mean the world song=lame, the daddy song is ok. i guess the main thing that got me upset about this cd is not that they had her try this and that but she abandoned what fans liked about her in the first place. there is not 1 ioda of rock on this cd. my opinion. thats all.
B002BWP4A6|4.0|&#34;The White Ribbon&#34; was shot in black and white; in a flat, deadpan style.  Upon reading several other Amazon reviews of this DVD, I observed that even if the reviewer didn't care for the film, they did admire Christian Berger's brilliant cinematography. The cumulative effect of tone and pacing is subtle, as if the director (Michael Haneke) did everything he could to make a suspense/horror film, without resorting to the use of any suspense/horror picture cliches.  This film is a testament to the corrosive power of family and societal secrets.  Its characters live in an oblivion of denial, in a village where certain key male authority figures wield power with an iron fist.  For the most part, the perpetrators of the various heinous events occurring in this picture are not revealed; these incidents are presented to the viewer &#34;after the fact&#34;.  On occasion, there is a silent, visual implication of involvement; for example, the scene where the boys watch the burning barn from their bedroom window; the group of children gathering outside the doors or windows of various homes.  Subliminal evidence of the &#34;revenge of the abused&#34; is directly and/or indirectly hinted at.  But ultimately, the villagers are working very hard at appearing to be innocent (the white ribbon, after all, stands for innocence).<br /><br />In Chapter Two of this DVD, a child attempts to lift the veil covering the face of a dead woman.  He is then comforted by a man sitting nearby in the dark; watching this scene, I suddenly feared that the father was sexually abusing the child.  Although the plot is easy enough to follow, in that particular scene, I wasn't 100% sure who the dead woman was, who the child was, and who the man sitting in the dark was (the director purposely kept him &#34;faceless&#34;).  And so I assumed that those characters were the doctor, his former wife (now dead), and the boy was his son.  The point being--whether or not one knows who these characters are, the effect of this scene is chilling; it is the most disturbing one in the entire picture.  Following that scene, the older sister of a little boy explains to him that everyone must die; he struggles to understand mortality.  That is probably the most touching scene in the film.<br /><br />There are two characters in &#34;The White Ribbon&#34; who are equally abhorrent in their roles as abusers; the Doctor and the Pastor.  The Pastor is bigger monster of the two, as he hides behind his mask of moral superiority.  The Doctor, although reprehensible, is at least aware that he is a monster.  When the Schoolteacher (who, along with his fiance Eva, are in the minority of villagers that could be described as &#34;good&#34;) confronts the Pastor near the end of the film, the Pastor warns the Schoolteacher not to reveal his theory about who has been committing the crimes in the village.  It's as if the Pastor metaphorically becomes a black-winged demon in that moment.  And of course, the Schoolteacher realizes by this point that there is no place for noble intentions in a village that is suffocating in a stew of its own vices.  So often in life, the worst among us are perceived to be the best; what is evil is mistaken for good, and vice versa.  Although I think this is a good film, and one that gave me the chills as I reflected back on its scenes--I still wish that Lars Von Trier's &#34;Antichrist&#34; had won the 2009 Palme d'Or at Cannes, instead of &#34;The White Ribbon&#34;.<br /><br />Stephen C.

0425241505|5.0|Why I Read this Book: Book Blogger buzz is the one and the only reason I read Dragon Bound. The buzz surrounding this book made it practically impossible for me to ignore. I didn't read any reviews; I just saw the buzz circulating on Twitter. The main consensus was that while Dragon Bound is PNR but it isn't your typical PNR. And I'd have to agree with that statement.  What I Liked: Dragon Bound is not a book I would have normally read had I come across it at a book store or the library. One reason being I haven't read a PNR with dragons in it. I'm one of those people who generally sticks with what they know and love and for me, that's vampires and werewolves. (I really need to expand my reading tastes.) Another reason being I was a bit intimated by the complex world building just from reading the blurb. I know that I, as a reader, don't do well with complex world building. It's not what I look for in a book; I don't want to have to think too much. I've got so much going on in my brain already, I don't have the capacity or the focus for all the extra details that come with a complex book. So I tend to stick with PNR with mild world building so that reading remains an (easy)enjoyment for me.  The first thing that I loved about the story was the coin that was stolen from Dragos. The `take a penny, leave a penny' concept was genius! I knew from that point on that I was going to love this book.  I really liked Pia's character. She is Dragos' calm and serenity. He's an entirely different being when he's around her. She tries to teach him to ask instead of demand. She brings out a kinder side of him though he's still the same tough and fearful alpha ruler. She doesn't put up with his temperament; she demands respect and he gives it to her. She challenges him in ways he's never been dared challenged before and he likes it. He's jealous, possessive and obsessed with her - all of which is entirely new to him.  Another thing I liked about Pia is that she didn't take Dragos' hand outs. She wasn't there to take advantage of his financial or power status. She can take care of herself and wasn't dependent on anyone else.  I love the mystery behind Pia's half wyr-half human heritage. The revealing was stunningly beautiful. I was a bit confused as to whether or not Pia herself knew what her wyr-half was. She seemed to know that she needed to hide as much information about herself as possible but I don't think she knew the exact why to it.  I loved the dream Pia has towards the end and the meaning behind it. I can't wait to see how that story arc plays out.  Here's one of my favorite quotes that shows Dragos' vulnerability:  *****  \\"I meant to lay a trap for you with that dream. I trapped myself instead.\\"  *****  What I Didn't Like: There wasn't anything I didn't like about this book.  Overall Impression: Dragon Bound is the type of book I wanted to slowly ease into. It deserved my full and undivided attention and that's what I gave it. I wanted to grasp every single detail I could to take it all in. It was like eating fine piece of chocolate from Godiva - you don't just gobble it down and start on the next piece. No. You savor the flavor and enjoy the textures and indulge your senses to achieve the most exciting and exhilarating experience possible. (OMG, I can't believe I just compared reading this book to eating chocolate! But you get the gist.)  I got Dragon Bound from the library but I am definitely going to get a copy for my shelf. This is definitely re-read material here and coming from me, that says a lot. And I'm definitely looking forward to reading Storm's Heart.
B00356CO1E|5.0|When I was in highschool (two years ago now), I used to do track and basketball. When I left highschool I kept the whole running and excersize up for a year. But now that I have to work, go to school and play on a softball team I don't seem to have the time. I found myself loosing my muscle tones and I just bought this workout. It's by far the best 5 dollars I've spent. I've only done level one but I feel it. I also love that she has it split into two people. Most things I like to go faster and harder. But I watch the slower version for push-ups. It's nice too that she knows exactly when I want to turn it off and she's like you better not!

B004SBBDB2|4.0|For whatever reason I thought that this was going to allow me to totally replicate the screen of my iDevices onto my television. In other words, I thought that I would have the pleasure of watching Angry Birds on the wide screen. Unfortunately this is not the case. The functions that I was able to successfully transmit to my T.V. were HBO GO, Netflix, and other motion pictures we had saved on the devices. This cable will serve its purpose well as we end up downloading more and more movies digitally rather than obtaining physical disks. It connects via the Apple 30 pin connector on your device and three \\"Red, Blue, Green\\" video connectors as well as the standard analog Red and White audio connectors. It also has a USB power source connector; however, I would find it inconvenient at best to set up a power source 12 inches (as that's about the distance allowed by the configuration of the cable) away from the inputs on the back of my television. Charge up your device prior to viewing and you should be in good shape.<br /><br />It's neat, and if you have a lot of digital media that you would like to be able to view on a screen larger than 4-13 inches then it is probably a sound investment.

0439023521|5.0|I noticed the novel to be well crafted having a wonderful pacing. There may be a lot of physical violence within, however, not so ostentatious they can be drawing attention. Romantic scenarios are generally sparingly created so they won't end up being way too embarassing (one thing I tremendously treasured as a father!!) The rage versus the program theme is definitely common enough to get noticable, yet not as overbearing as they point out...  On the whole, My partner and I strongly recommend this particular book for the children from 12 up. The conclusion turns me to think that this is going to be a series. I actually imagine I will probably be pre-ordering the moment it really is accessible. Congratulation Ms. Collins!!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3FTHQ5ZS8YM95]]I got myself an halogen flashlight rated at 4100 Lumens through an external website. Amazing light, it is so powerful that it can burn paper, melt plastic and it has an unbelievable clarity... A contender for the Guiness Book record. The main problem is that it burns through the battery in about 30mn and it is not recommended to use it for more than 3mn at a time to avoid overheating.<br />I started looking for a more practical, yet powerful flashlight to use in every circumstance.<br />So I found the Fenix TK41. It arrived promply, along with a set of rechargeable batteries that I ordered separately since none is provided with the lamp.<br />It has 2 modes: Normal lamp, SOS mode and Stroboscopic mode. It also have 4 levels of intensity for the normal lamp mode, ranging from 8 lumens to a whooping 800 lumens.<br /><br />Why did I mention the 4100 lumens lamp before? you may ask. Because it will be a fair point of comparision. Fenix TK41 vs Wicked Laser's top lamp:<br /><br />- Solidity. Both lamps are built to resist shocks and heat. Both are very strong. No clear winner.<br />- Intensity of lighting: Whole area is won by the Wicked lasers lamp. Center zone won by far by the TK41 because of the LED which has a much nicer pattern. Yes, a 800 lumens is brighter in the dead center than a 4100 lumens lamp!<br />- Battery: a special battery for wicked laser for which replacement cost about 30$ and last about 30mn, versus 8 AA rechargeable batteries for the TK41 which I tried to wear out over more than 24 hours and failed. It starts at full power and automatically decrease the intensity as the battery life starts going down. So their claim at 240 hours battery life is justified in my opinion. Clear winner is the TK41.<br />- Other details: The Fenix TK41 is water resistant up to 5 feet, not the other one. Also, the wicked laser lamp has only one mode: full power. The TK41's lamp is using LED and has a 50 000 hours expected life span.<br />- Price: Both are within the same price range.<br /><br />Conclusion: The Fenix TK41 proves a better buy than the Wicked laser lamp for a similar range of price.<br />The bad side is that there is only one way to hold this light when moving around and it is with the hand. I would love to have one as powerful for headlamp.<br />In any case I love this flashlight which is an awesome acquisition. I tried it to light up my main dining room by night and it does an amazing job in case of power failure. You can read, cook, do whatever necessary and you can modulate the intensity as you wish (4 modes).<br />Buy it!e: Both are within the same price range.<br /><br />Conclusion: The Fenix TK41 proves a better buy than the Wicked laser lamp for a similar range of price.<br />The bad side is that there is only one way to hold this light when moving around and it is with the hand.

B0034G4P80|5.0|This review comes from a long-time fan of comics.  This is one of the very best Marvel movies yet, and Thor had to be one of the hardest comics characters to adapt to film.  I believe they've managed to do such a great job that even people who never really were all that fond of Thor in the comics will really like this movie.  One problem they overcame was the costumes.  The versions they came up with for the film are recognizable, but avoid looking foolish- even Loki's horned helmet.  They neatly side-stepped the \\"Donald Blake\\" subplot.  They had the wisdom to avoid having Asgardians speak with \\"thees and thous\\".  They avoided offending viewers (generally) on the subject of \\"godhood\\", and even got a bit of humor out of it.  And the humor, throughout the film, was done well, and was never forced.  There were pleasant, natural tie-ins with Bruce Banner, Stark, Hawkeye, SHIELD, and Nick Fury.  The set designs were wonderful.  Asgard looks like Jack Kirby with Norse Viking decoration.  The banquet hall looked like Maxfield Parrish painted it, and Bifrost was dazzlingly perfect.  I always wondered what Thor saw in Jane Foster.  Thanks to Natalie Portman, I know now.  Aside from the consideration of being true to its comic book roots, the acting, direction, special effects, wardrobe, cinematography, sound, and music are all consistently top-notch.  HERE FOLLOW SPOILERS!  I loved the way they came up with a visual symbol for the spell Odin cast on Thor's hammer.  The Destroyer was more scary-looking than ever. (And I read his original appearance when I was 12 years old.) Although they didn't explain it in the film, the Destroyer isn't a robot.  It's a hollow, magical suit of armor, activated by and filled with Odin's power.  Using it against the frost giants, then having to charge it back up probably helped bring on the Odinsleep.  Some critics said Thor's change of heart, evidence of an increase in maturity and wisdom, came too rapidly to be believable.  He believed thathis careless actions had been partially responsible for his father's death!  He was filled with grief and guilt.  That would tend to calm him down some, I should think.  I was glad that Jane kissed him, instead of him acting like he had some \\"right\\" to her.  I liked the way you could tell that he was glad that Jane was searching for him at the end.  Ah, the course of true love...  I really can't find a false note in this entire film, and recommend it wholeheartedly.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Before I begin, I want you to know that my dad worked at CBS/FOX Video during the 80s. As such, what I'm about to say comes from someone who has seen the original negatives (or, at least, a copy that isn't that far off from the o-negs).<br /><br />Being a fan of STAR WARS, I'm ready to jump at any chance to purchase a product that will give me a home theater experiences comparable to how I saw the movies in the theaters. I did that for the DVD release (which, just for the fact that I could watch the movies over and over again and they'd look as pristine as when I first watched them was worth the money) and now for the Blu-ray release. Obviously, the fact that the movies are only 85%-90% of what people originally remembered has become a source of friction amongst the fan community. However,  I could overlook that (especially  since I don't mind some of the changes) when I think about the pristine clarity Lowry Digital and Blu-ray technology could bring to these classic movies. But, the ultimate test was my dad. I played the movie for him on our 50\\" TV. He was already impressed with how much better the movie looked. Then, he had me pause on a moment on the Tantive IV with a closeup of C-3PO. He pointed out to me the detail of all the dirt and grime on 3PO's forehead that he remembers seeing on the film prints he handled. He remarked on how this was the first time he had seen that kind of detail come out on any version of those movies for any home video release. As such, this version of those movies is *much* closer to the original negs.<br /><br />The additional features are amazing as well. There were rumors going around in the fan community about certain sequences, whether or not they had been filmed, or whether or not the footage still existed. Two of my favorites would have to be all the footage related to the Wampa scenes on Hoth and the additional footage of the Rebel side of the attack on the second Death Star. There are interviews that have never been seen before dating back to before the special edition all the way up to the DVD release. As well as behind the scenes documentaries that were aired during the original trilogy. Some extra \\"tokens\\" would be the addition of a documentary about members of the 501st being hand selected to march in the Rose Parade as well as \\"spoofs\\" of the trilogy, I assume, were fan created. My only complaint would be that I could have hoped for something a little more substantial in terms of extras. Not as much as, let's say, The Lord of the Rings Special Extended Edition. It doesn't have to be such a big monster. But, just something similar to what we got with the DVD release: STAR WARS Empire of Dreams. So, my word of advice is, if you already own the 4 DVD set (the silver slipcase), keep it. The DVD extra in that set is worth hanging onto.<br /><br />Update: There are more videos on the individual trilogy discs other than the cut scenes and the interviews. I started looking at the collections and, after looking at rotating models, additional interviews played. They could have done a better job at explaining that.efore the special edition all the way up to the DVD release.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Playing this game is the most fun I've had playing a board game in a long time! It may take a little while to learn all the rules, but once you know them you will become addicted! I highly recommend it!
B000002KEV|5.0|Very good service, product is exactly what I wanted, very speedy service very happy with my purchase.  I recieved my CD before I could even start wondering how long it would take.  Can not say enough about them.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Outstanding sound quality on this remaster. From first play a favourite and treasured CD album. Mark Knopfler is brilliant at the front of group. Every track memorable, played often, lyrics are spot on with experience.
B004V98UKS|2.0|I like this kind of  puzzle to stimulate the brain and help pass the time when I have a few minutes to kill but I only able to get to level 2 and have it work right.  Level 3 just does not show up on my display correctly enough for me to play on my droid so it is a bit of a let down.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|It's a very funny movie ......but not for some people...There are loads of \\"F\\" bombs and certain things that may offend people. But I enjoyed it.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I've just got to agree with the other happy 5 star reviewers. The hero Flash Gordon a hirsute gay icon running and flying around in leather shorts out to save the planet Earth from Ming the merciless - is err unforgettable. Flash the movie is loosely based (very) on the earlier circa 1930s comic strip of the same name. The supporting cast is no less pantomime evil, heroic or erotic with familiar name actors lurking in mask, lycra or leather. In this Mongo munchkinland the girls are very hot, the boys no less than handsome and the old men bad, mad and evil. The zany plot and the 1980 circa arcade game style special effects only add to the brilliance of this charade. The striking costumes, wizard of Oz colours and the title music by Queen are also a natural and seamless fit. Flash can be viewed as camp Christmas family fun or as a stoned sensual must see. Either way this Ming and Mong fantasy/farce is great entertainment.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Although there have been comparisons to Blair Witch (pfft) and even Cloverfield, those movies fell well short of expectations whereas this one excelled. The characters are all quite engaging and believable, and the plot is believable, in a fictitious sort of way. There are so many underlying messages about government and society (at least as pertains to Norway specifically, but to the world at large as well), that i wont even bother regaling you with my views there. Suffice to say that this movie doesnt rely on unseen foes and hidden agendas. You actually see the trolls, and bare witness to the protagonists dealing with the situations, as a college filmcrew finds, then follows, then joins with an official government troll hunter/preservationist. Kind of a zookeeper with much larger confines that sometimes has to become a hunter as well. I would definitely recommend watching this, unless you cant keep up with subtitles for some reason, in which case, you wont like this. However, it is my experience that within the first few minutes, you forget you're even reading them as you become completely engaged with the story. Watch this movie...and enjoy!
B0050G3NWG|1.0|The more I learn about how \\"Citizen Kane\\" was made, the more I appreciate it.  However this Blu-Ray transfer is not enough of an improvement over the DVD to justify buying a new edition.  At least we get a DVD of \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" which will likely be released soon on it's own.  My problem is that my 10 year old Denon receiver can't play the DTS HD MA soundtrack.  The Dolby Digital soundtracks are in Polish and Portuguese (weird foreign language choices).  One has commentary by Peter Bogdanovich and another by Roger Ebert.  So I can't get the movie dialog unless I buy a new receiver.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i love the kindle app. when my kindle is charging i use this app on my phone its awesome! i love all amazon stuff!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Definitely worth the price! This book is a page turner from beginning to end. Enjoyed the characters and the story so much - I just had to read it the 2nd time. I recommend it to everyone :)
0062068423|4.0|Really enjoyed this intellectual thriller. Hole is a likeable character, and Nesbo does a good job of mixing in a bit of humor, which is refreshing.
0307463745|5.0|I am only one quarter into the book and already I am so inspired by Rework. I have found that in life two things usually filter out.  1- Conventional wisdom often leads to mediocrity.   2- Simplicity, while humbling and pseudo-intellect ego bruising, is true wisdom.   I am encouraged by some of the negative reviews, as simple truth often ruffles the feathers of the conventional masses.  I expect to love the remaining three quarters of Rework as much I I have the first third, and who knows, maybe it will actually get me off of my excuses and actually go for it. ...stay tuned.
1609611543|5.0|This was an interesting book - it starts with a history of wheat. I hadn't realized just how genetically modified the wheat we have today is when compared to wheat of 100 years ago (or further back, for that matter). In order to increase yield and resistance to pesticides, scientists have been playing around with wheat for some time, without really taking the time to understand what long term effects this genetic modification might have. Davis then goes on to look at how wheat interacts with the body - like the fact that wheat consumption has the same brain effect as opiates - as well as looking at Celiac disease, diabetes, the body's pH, and aging as they are impacted by wheat. From there, he goes on to talk about what the wheat free life looks like and why he feels it's worthwhile (and really, \\"quit eating wheat\\" is drummed into your head at least once on every page - not without back up information, but still, the point is very clear - wheat is bad, as are wheat substitutes). There are mentions of actual clinical studies as well as anecdotal evidence from Davis' practice - but in the end, he makes a convincing case to at least give living wheat free (and again, not just gluten free, but really just giving up wheat) a good try.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I've been a fan of this movie since its theatrical release. It is a movie in the grand tradition of hollywood epics of the past. If you have any interest in classical music or movie epics then this should do the trick. However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the original theatrical release should also be part of the 2-disc special edition or blue-ray releases. This is mainly due to the scene of partial nudity that is in the \\"director's cut\\" which, at least to this reviewer, could have been left out or edited in such a manner that most of the scene could remain and there-by keep the movie suititable for all audiences. At least with a copy of the theatrical release that would not be a concern. I say this because this movie's music (Mozart's)is splended and is a good way for the young ones to become acquainted with that composer life and music. Of course I know a lot of the movie contains quite a bit of fabrication for dramatic reasons but the music and some of its history of composition/performance is true to historical fact. This is all brought out in the \\"making of\\" featurette contained in the 2-disc director's cut. I have a copy of both the original theatrical release and the 2-disc \\"directors cut\\" and I am happy with both and can at least tailor a \\"movie night\\" to the appropriate audience. This can't be done with the current 2-disc director's cut dvd and having the original theatrical release together would allow for just such a scenario. All that being said, it still does not keep this movie from a 5-star rating. Buy and enjoy.
B0058A119G|4.0|I have been a fan of Barbra Streisand for over 45 years, so when her newest CD began to be advertised on Amazon, I was very excited and eager to order it.  Her voice sounds better than ever and for the most part, I liked the selections.  I liked the mix of the well-known with the lesser known music (lyrics) of Alan and Marilyn Bergman.  I would have liked more upbeat music in the mix, however.  Ballads are great, but the tempo needs to be picked up now and then.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|The writing on the front of the DVD says it all. Great for people who don't even like country music. This movie gets better every time I watch it.
B000002LKU|5.0|this cd has made it to my top 10 all time of americana music.  not a bad track in the bunch.  a  bit on the mellow side, reminding me a little of JJ Cale.  excellent guitar work throughout, and great harmonizing vocals.
B0055S348W|5.0|Highly recommended, works great. Found my printer, installed driver and print. Clean and just what I needed, if you need to print from your Android this is the app to buy. Xoom to Dell laser via wifi.
B00132GBRA|5.0|I had a pair of this model that lasted more than three years, with much use. I bought the second pair because I am quite satisfied with the product. So I had a guaranteed delivery, made ''the purchase through Amazon.com, which I am a customer for over 5 years.The Men's Merrell Moab Mid Gore-Tex XCR Boot is comfortable and durable, giving me a sense of security when walking.
0316098329|5.0|This story is amazing.  I finished the book and wanted more about the characters' journeys.  Reading it gave such a new perspective on my own life, parenting and empathy.  A must read, for sure.
0071762345|5.0|I am currently a student studying advertising & design. I love social media but after reading this book I fell more in love with social media! Yes it is possible. Most of my piers thought I knew a lot about social media already but after reading this book I found out I maybe already knew 1/8 of everything out there!<br /><br />I hope to one day make my mark and name like Dave has! Social media is the field I want to go in and closing in on my senior year I am glad I have a direct focus. This book gives so much insight and compared to all my other school books I had to pay for, the price of this book is a steal for all the knowledge it contains.<br /><br />Our e-commerce class has been restructured to keep up to date with modern times and this book was required for the course. I think all schools should require it in similar classes. I have also read or skimmed through a few other social media books and none of them compare to this one. I can't say enough good things about it. It is like a social media \\"bible\\" to live by. I know I will use it as such.<br /><br />I had never heard of the company until reading this book and their website is so informative as well, especially with all the webinars. Dave Kerpen even gives out his personal Facebook & Twitter information and responds very quickly.<br /><br />So why are you still reading this buy the book already once you get the book you will wonder how you ever did without it!<br /><br />With lots of social media love from Tampa, FL
B003INBNXO|5.0|Next to Jet Li's FEARLESS, I don't recall watching a Martial Arts film of this caliber in a long while. Donnie Yin puts in a wonderful performance and is a very skilled martial artist and pleasant character to watch. The story is a bit dark, but very heart felt. My sons and I have watched this film over and over and it just gets better every time. If you're a Kung Fu fan this a masterpiece you'll want to have in your collection.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I bought it for my children who also loved it. Even without all the extras for special effects.
0394818237|5.0|I bought this book for my nephew for his birthday because this was one of the few books that I distinctly remember from my childhood and wanted to give him that memory. I'm glad books like this are still in publication!
0439023521|4.0|I enjoyed this book and loved the characters.  However, there was a dark edge to the storyline that left me disappointed.  The victory was brilliant, but heart-wrenching.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Great show, great chemistry between the cast. The main characters are all very likable. This season ends in a great cliffhanger way that really makes you want the 4th season right now...lucky for us, it is here now
B0051OZ564|3.0|Lots of action and beautiful girls but story is kinda lacking.  I did not leave the theater thinking wow great movie.  It was ok and would make a decent rental.
0451232577|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in good order as usual. I have ordered many books over the years from Amazon and it is always the same.  Professional and efficient!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is hilarious, smart, quick, and totally original. The actors are legitimately talented and can deliver comedy, drama, and improvise. The writing is witty and peppered with pop culture references. The DVD package has ruined me for all other TV on DVD. There is commentary on every episode by most of the cast, bloopers and special features on each disk, mini episodes, deleted scenes, the list goes on and on. It is such an enjoyable set, I can't wait to get started on the second season.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|I was familiar with the names, but not the story.  This is a well-written, well-acted docu-drama.  It will remain in my \\"Things My Grandchildren Need To Know\\" library.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|I can not encourage you enough to buy this record! It is seriously the best Foo Fighters record out to date. From start to finish, this album is packed full of hits. There several different sub-genres of music that lay within Wasting Light. You can hear a couple of punk rock-type tracks in Bridge Burning and White Limo. With \\"I Should Have Known,\\" you can hear a great answer to \\"The Pretender\\" track off of the previous album, \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.\\" This song features a re-uniting of Nirvana member Krist Novoselic (bass, accordion) with Dave Grohl (vocals, guitar). There are so many gems on this record and I believe they shine brightly in the Foos catalog of hits. I bought the physical copy of Wasting Light back in April on release day and have literally played it just about every day in my car on the way to school/work. This album can be loud and head-banging, but also smooth and light.
0143113100|5.0|This is a very good book, though perhaps not written as a page turner.  This information is very valuable for two reasons.     First, it could potentially change the way we look at diseases of the mind, and what are the options for treating them. Like so many other good works of medicine, this book clearly shows that not all treatments need to be drugs and surgery. The brain has a built-in flexibility never before imagined. But up to now we have not guessed this, and have not known what kind of stimulus is required to activate the brain's own inherent abilities to change and heal itself. He points towards what some of the new therapies might be.    Second, one can ponder, how and why the brain has the kind of flexibility it does. In one example, people blind from birth learn to see through their tongues. A video camera is strapped to the subject's head. The camera image is converted into electrical signals, those signals sent to a small disc, and the disc placed on the subject's tongue. In a matter of days the blind person's visual cortex is interpreting the signals from the tongue, and the people can \\"see\\". This all touches on a much larger topic, that our brains have far more complexity and ability than is necessary for our survival in the life we lead. If our brains only evolved to give us better abilities to find mates and increase territory, then why would we have staggeringly complex neural abilities that do not relate to finding mates and increasing territory?    --Michael Clarage  [...]
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This is not a review of the movie but the quality of the new bluray release. As some may have herd this is the added cg version and it has not been newly remastered for this bluray release but they are using an older remaster. As for the sound quality, it's clearer than the DVD release making the dialogue easier to hear especially on A New Hope. As for the video, the picture is noticeably clearer and more detailed and the black level is better. The fact is this video looks so much better that I can only imagine a new remastering would only yield marginal gains for now. If you're wondering if the quality of this new release is substantial enough to warrant purchasing this blue ray I would say yes.
B003WTE886|4.0|If you love Taylor Swift than you'll love this CD.  While some of the songs are a little slower than ones on her \\"Taylor Swift\\" CD, the words are great and once again it's easy to feel how she felt while writing the songs.  Moms, you'll love the song, \\"Never Grow Up\\" and although I'm not a mom yet, I can relate to the end of the song.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|As soon as i saw this thing at E3 I knew I had to have it. I pre ordered this the first day it was up for pre order on here. Set up was easy, just snap it on and you're done. But getting the Kinect to actually find me and keep track of me is a whole other story. With out the add on the Kinect finds and recognizes me right away. But snap this on and I MIGHT be able to get it to work for a minute. For the few minutes I could get it working I did notice that it improved the playing space a lot which is why I am giving this a one star. But it all most never works and I've tried all kinds of lighting and positions. With this on you can see when the kinect starts up the window in the corner is all most filled with black and can't view me. But when i take it off the picture is clear and can find and track me with in seconds. I do not recommend people buy this. Save your money.
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Norah Jones' voice sounds awesome on vinyl. I actually used this album to setup my system. Her voice is so full of feeling and nuances that any mis-adjustment makes her sound fake. When everything is adjusted properly Norah Jones is IN my apartment (minus her good looks.) I want to come away with her. Also recommend Rome.
B0052U59F4|3.0|I am not into BDSM stories, but I have to say that I liked this one.  I found this book to be addictive, which is kind of disturbing.  While this book is not the best book I have read, you just have to take it for what it is, a trashy romance novel, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />This is the love story of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.  Christian is such a complex character.  You love him and hate him at the same time and it's really confusing.  He's the ultimate alpha male, bad boy with a very dark and disturbing desire to inflict pain.  He literally gets off on it.  He meets and falls for Anastasia.  When they meet she is an innocent college student and happens to still be a virgin.  This is their love story and its deeply disturbing.  Our boy Christian has some serious demons and its making Ana think long and hard about their relationship.  This is not your typical boy meets girl let's date and fall in love romance.  He wants to dominate her and he wants her submissive. He comes up with a contract that he wants her to sign.  She's torn between her love for him and her fear of him.  She wants to know why he is so Fifty Shades of \\"f'd\\" up.  She wants to get to the bottom of what happened in his past to make him need this type of relationship and why he hates to be touched.  He introduces her to the \\"dark side\\" of his sexual habits and in his desire to keep her and make her happy, tries for the \\"vanilla relationship\\" she desires.  Will Ana embrace Christian's dark side or will it be more than she can handle?  The way he makes love to her is so erotic, steamy, sexy and scary all at the same time.<br /><br />I know it does not sound like it, but there is a real love story there.  Ana brings out feelings in Christian that he has never felt with anyone else.

B004V98UKS|5.0|This game starts out easy and quickly gets difficult. I'm currently stuck on level 10 and am almost to the point of thinking it's not possible... but I know it has to be since there are 100 levels.  I've looked online for solutions but can't find them. Anyone know where they are?  The controls are just fine for this type of game since you are doing more thinking/ pausing than moving.  If you like challenging puzzles, this game is worth .99&cent;.  Droid X
B0055SWM08|5.0|An ingenious combination of simple elements used to create increasingly complex puzzles. On top of that the graphics and music are very Zen. You will feel challenged and calmed simultaneously. Worth the price and more!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Got the app when it was free. Surprisingly involving. Lots of fun and increasingly challenging. Great time killer. Good brain exercise.
B004SBX112|5.0|As others have pointed out, not having the ads in the way makes game play a whole lot easier and more fun. The free version is great for trying it out, but you will not miss the almost-dollar you spend on the upgrade. Angry Birds Seasons is an addictive game with great graphics and realistic physics (not to mention: awesome music and hilarious bird noises). I highly recommend it!
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I am not a fan of this book what so ever.  And if the rest of the series is anything like the first book I wil not even bother reading a sample.<br /><br />This book so so confusing in the beginning you have no idea what is happening until about half way through and the Author doesn't even bother going into details about where these events take place.  I wish he had used at least a little imagery instead of focusing on just the people and events.<br /><br />Also Erickson introduces so many characters through out the book that you easily get confused and loose track as to were the general plot is taking you.

B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a beautifully logical puzzle game, with nice super-visible (and perfectly simple) graphics. Learn to mix colors and manipulate angles using mirrors and prisms. The game starts off easy to allow you to learn its controls, but then gradually becomes very challenging. Definitely a well-worth-the-price mind-bender!
B000002KMV|5.0|When this was first released, i bought it on vinyl and played it repeatedly. The songs were so social awareness at the same time the music, the rhythm was fantastic. Even now the social statement being made by these songs still apply. How brillant must prince have been in 1981 to have music that still applies to us in this day and age. While many songs speak to the situations around us, I have to single out \\"Do Me Baby\\" because this song is so raw, so passionate if I hear it playing now, I am transported to the realm of fantasy, the realm of memory as well as the realm of possibility.   Controversy is a a piece of music genius. If an artist can release an album that you can still love thirty years later that is masterful. If the music speaks to you then an artist has done his job. From the title cut of \\"Controversy\\" to the last song \\"Jack U Off\\" the passion will not leave you wanting. Whether you like Prince or not, this album is and has always been fantastic. Love It!!

B005CM9DX6|5.0|This album is everything I hoped it would be. No growling vocals. Just excellent clean vocals from MA. I am 62 years old and I have loved prog rock since the early 70's thanks to a group that I love CAMEL. One of my favorite albums in my collection happens to be DAMNATION which I believe is OPETH'S finest album(I own all of them). I have loved OPETH'S music from my first encounter which was STILL LIFE. The one problem that I have always had with the band is the growling vocals. Let's face it, growling is not singing!!! Thank you MA for giving us a second LP without the ridiculous growling vocals. My hope is that OPETH continues to make great music in this direction. Thank you MA and everyone associated with one of my favorite bands OPETH!!!!   Jerry Sanseri
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Ive been a fan of this band for over 13 years (first album was Blackwater Park). I can say that while listening to all their observations one thing is distinctly clear: Opeth is in a category of music all their own, and Heritage spotlights this beautifully. At their core, they will alwyas have their roots in heavy metal. However as others have stated, this observation is NOT a metal album, but its is PURE Opeth through and through.   One of the things that Opeth have been become masters of is redefining the idea what an album can be. Up until I heard Opeth, the only \\"heavy\\" music I knew was Metallica, Pantera, Slayer etc. What hooked me to Opeth while listening to Blackwater Park was the intense ebb and flow, punishingly heavy and beautifully clean sections all mixed into one glorious song. That album and every album in their catalog opened my eyes to the possibility of what could be done in the world of heavy music. And I love every measure of it!  Heritage is, no doubt, the most radical departure for Opeth musically. With the exception of a few songs, most of the tracks have a very free form feel to them, not unlike a live jam session at times, though the attention to detail and atmosphere are eerily top notch. Jazz, folk, rock... all combined and put through the classic Opeth structure give this album an absolutely unique sound. The musicianship displayed by all the band members indicate to me that they are at the top of their game. I imagine that playing some of these songs live, mixed in with the rest of their catalog, will truly showcase their diverse ability as top level musicians  I for one and cant wait to see them live, and hopefully hear a few tracks from Heritage.  This is NOT a metal album. What this album is is pure Opeth, because last time i checked this band is ALL about delivering the sonically unexpected. Heritage is unexpected, but in my humble opinion a welcome addition to Opeth's vast collection of observations. Can we expect all Opeth albums from here on out to sound like this? Who knows... but that is, for me, part of the joy of being an Opeth fan. You never know what they will do next. I for one cant wait to find out!
B0006AAS5G|1.0|This watch was extremely disappointing. The packaging was fantastic. Sad to say that if the best part of a product is the packaging. The watch was not heavy. The band felt cheap and thin. The buttons on the side were locked and would not press in. The main button to pull out to adjust the time was frozen in place. For the price, I suppose I got what I paid for. While I was trying to figure out the buttons, one came unscrewed and fell out. I could not get it to go back in place either. This has to be the cheapest watch I've ever encountered. I've seen fake watches on the street that operated and felt better than this one. Save your time and money and do not buy products from this company. I will never purchase another Invicta Watch of any kind ever again. Purchased a nice Seiko once I returned this junky watch.
B004LROMSO|2.0|I will make this short if not sweet:  Like another reviewer before me, I cut my literary teeth on the Arthur legend.  I got my first Arthur book, \\"The Once and Future King\\", when I was barely able to read.  I LOVE the story, and have read every book and seen every film I could find although again like a previous reviewer I haven't found that many that I felt were worthy of the story.  I like the original legend which probably makes me a traditionalist.  This take on the story didn't even seem like the Arthur legend to me.  I felt they could have renamed the characters, put them in a another environment and it would have been an entirely different tale.  I'm not as down on the actor playing Arthur as alot of people seem to be, but I'm not wowed by his portrayal either.  I'm a strong Joseph Fiennes fan and find his interpretation of Merlin to be the only one I really appreciated and enjoyed.  I am invested with these characters and I would prefer that their story remain as originally conceived.  The only exception to this would be the Merlin character.  I liked the younger, edgier Merlin.  I found the scenery, the lighting, the photography, the costuming (good to see for a change that it was more suited to the 5th-6th centuries than to medieval times) to be excellent and feel that had the story/script matched the film quality it would have been a winner.    If Starz had decided to do a second season of this show, I would probably not be watching.  I think by cancelling it, they made the right choice.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|This is without a doubt one of my favorite movies.  I enjoy reading/watching about snipers in general and this is just a well done action drama.  Kate Mara is pretty easy on the eyes as well.  There are certain movies I watch at least once a year. Shooter is one of them.

B004EPYZOO|5.0|The last two or three movies that Cage has starred in(save Season of the Witch) have been pretty boring to me. My first thought was \\"Great...another Nic Cage car movie. Woopdidoo\\". Man, was I surprised when I popped this into my DVD player and watched it.<br /><br />The story, itself, is about Milton. Milton breaks out of hell to rescue his infant granddaughter from a Satan-worshiping cult leader named Jonah King. Along the way, though, he encounters a woman named Piper who has a bad attitude yet has a good way about her and with a killer body. Then, there's the Accountant...this guy is out to get Milton and bring him back to Hell by any means necessary. Thing is, Milton always stays one step ahead of him. Still with me? Then, there's ton of car chases..gunfire...flying limbs...nudity...sex scenes...dry humor..alcohol..and that's not even getting it all.<br /><br />My favorite scene, hate to admit, is the sex scene shootout. I cracked up seeing this woman Milton was with's reaction during and then after it all. Classic.<br /><br />Needless to say, it's a high-octane film that harks back to the old B-films of the 70s. It doesn't take itself too seriously but that's what makes this movie so special. I love the movie. It's a heckuva lot of fun and, definitely, worth the ride.
B005DZMP00|3.0|This is a very good buy from Amazon, 3 hours of music for 9.25 when I got it. However, so far , I am a bit disappointed with the sound quality, definitely not as good as the original Europe 72 and I listened to it on a HDCD player.<br />  I don't know what the problem is, just sounds a bit muddy to me, I have not listened to the second disc , which is supposed to be great, so I will edit this when I listen to the second Disc.<br /><br />  I am a big Deadhead ,especially for their 70s music, so I was glad to get to hear part of this project, Loved \\"Greatest Story Ever Told\\", great version. Will get back to you, if things change.<br /><br />  Well, I said that I would get back to you all, if things changed. I decide that I would listen to Disc 2 on my 15 year old Sony CD player that does not have HDCD, I don't use it much anymore, the second disc immediately sounded much better, I mean alot better, the way that I had heard it described, Great versions of \\"Dark Star\\", \\"The Other One\\" and \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" brought goose bumps on my arms, just great harmonies, even Donna was in tune and sounding sweet. The \\"Not Fade Away-Going Down the Road\\" jam was quite good. Then I decided to revisit Disc 1 on the older CD player, it sounded much better too, \\"Bertha sounded classic, good quality\\".<br /><br />  I can't explain this though, every other CD that I have sounds alot better on my Oppo Universal Disc player, which plays SACD, DVD-Audio, HDCD, and more. I played some other recent Dead releases on the Oppo and they continued to sound much better with the HDCD. I don't know if there was a defective batch, really , I have been reviewing music for 10 years and never ran into something like this. I mean, on the old deck, it sounds very good, but still not comparable to original Europe 72, but very listenable, and I am enjoying it now.<br /><br />  It doesn't capture that Europe 72 vibe if you will, but there are some tracks on here that Shine.
B005CSX2JG|5.0|The comparisons to Beyonce are inevitable, so here goes. Kelly deserves to be bigger than she is, this album is fantastic. I enjoy every song on Here I Am, especially \\"Commander\\" and \\"Lay It On Me\\". I haven't bought a Beyonce album since her debut, but have been following Kelly since she went solo. Very happy with this album, buy it!!
B0058A119G|5.0|This is Streisand's best album since... since when?  Ever?  She invests these songs with so much feeling, such poetic intensity, that it elevates the material to a place it could never occupy without her talent.  I'm not sure I've ever heard her give a better performance than she does on the title track, (a song many had probably consigned to the past, a hazy, mainstream acid trip from the 70's).  In Streisand's hands the song becomes a hushed, wonder-struck meditation on a lost love, and the way beauty and pain can co-exist in a single moment.  She infuses the Sinatra classic \\"Nice 'N' Easy\\" with a silky, feminine sensuousness.  On \\"My Name is Barbra, Too\\" she sang a fragment of \\"That Face\\" as part of a melody of \\"face\\" songs, but here we get the entire thing, and it becomes a gently swinging paean to her beloved (James -- are you listening?) -- and it has as much sweetness and youthful passion as anything she recorded in her youth.    Maybe that's the key: at age 69 Streisand's passion is undiminished, merely tempered by time and the kind of wisdom that only a lifetime of experience can give.  This is a glorious album.

0545123275|4.0|Shiver is a wonderful romance about Grace and Sam as they get to meet while the same species for the first time. As a child, Sam in wolf-form saves Grace from being eaten by other wolves, and ever since then they've shared a connection. As a werewolf, Sam is drawn to Grace, however as a human, he can't help but love her completely. For Grace, when she was bitten as a child, something changed within her. Despite being bitten by werewolves she never turns into one, however their howls at night call to her the way little else does in the world. Sam has always been special to Grace, and she spends as much time has she can during the winter outside watching for him.  When Sam shows up as a human bleeding on her doorstep, Grace steps in without hesitation.<br /><br />Shiver is a book that doesn't really have any particular 'enemy' to it, except the ever-approaching cold that could force Sam to turn back into a wolf. Despite this, I could never stop reading as Sam and Grace's tale is one that kept drawing me back. I had to know if they'd get their happily ever after or not. While there is more to the story aside from this, it never really drew me in the way Sam did. The story has a very poetic feel to it, with Sam's bits of lyrics always setting the mood when being read from his POV.<br /><br />While the main characters in Shiver are excellently depicted, the supporting cast sometimes falls to the wayside. It is easy to love Sam for his wish to stay with Grace, to keep his humanity. Similarly, it is easy to appreciate Grace's easy acceptance of who Sam is, and to have your heart-break a little each time she is 'called' by her wolf side despite being only a human. These characters however, are the only ones whose point of view we see in Shiver, and this seems to change in Linger when the cast is opened further to include characters that are introduced later in Shiver.<br /><br />While Shiver could easily be read as a stand-alone book, there are plenty of lingering questions that readers like me will be forced to read the aptly titled 'Linger' for the answers to. I would recommend this to any fan of romance with a bit of the supernatural thrown in.forced to read the aptly titled 'Linger' for the answers to.

B0044DE906|1.0|I seem to be in a minority here. I found the characters very one dimensional and merely mouthpieces for the author's opinions. Whilst at times it was funny this feels very 'Stage Set' and contrived. A bit like a poorly directed play where a character walks on, recites there lines and walks off again. Not to my liking I'm afraid. I prefer good honest humor that develops naturally out of the characters. The likes of  PG Wodehouse, David Luddington, Tom Sharp etc.   I'd previously read Corrections and found that quite good so I guess I was hoping for better.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I've been a Canon user and Canon fan for many years, but Canon video cameras always seem to have some sort of sound problem. In the case of Canon DSLRs with video capability, the problem is the loud and annoying hiss that occurs when you use an external microphone in a quiet setting. The first time I used my new Canon 60D to make a video, I quickly realized that the onboard microphone, while adequate for perfect circumstances, was not a good fit for outdoor use or pro-style interviews.  I decided to buy an inexpensive $45 shotgun mic - big mistake - which produced the loudest ambient hiss I've ever heard on a recording. After a bit of research, I found that the 60D and other Canon DSLR cameras (and no doubt other brands as well) almost always produce a notable degree of \\"quiet room hiss\\" when used with most external microphones--and of course it's usually worse with a cheap mic. Further research led to further frustration, with all the \\"experts\\" suggesting that quality in-camera recording is just not feasible on DSLRs and you should buy an expensive independent recording system and then \\"sync\\" the sound to the video in post. What?!?!? I don't work for Sony Pictures, I just want to do some good quality commercial work for Internet posting. Then I ran across a YouTube video of a guy testing Rode microphones. He said that, after posting his video of a test with a Canon DSLR, Rode contacted him and told him that by setting the Rode Videomic Pro's dB switch to +20 and adjusting the manual sound level setting on the camera to about 20%, he could achieve a virtually hiss-free recording. Thus I ordered this mic from Amazon. It arrived on-time and in perfect shape, I ran a series of tests under various conditions, and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. Interestingly, the suggested DSLR setting is right there in the Rode manual--perhaps they added it after the YouTube video was made.  Bottom line, if you're shooting video with a DSLR and you want simple, high-quality sound for a reasonable price, this is your mic.  Buy anything less, and in my opinion you will be unhappy with the results.<br /><br />One small caveat: This is a professional mic with a 10 year warranty, but it's not for people who don't take care of their equipment.  The mini-jack cable is thin and could easily catch on something and break or be ripped from the mic if you aren't careful. The \\"rubber band\\" shock mounting system--while clever and effective--is easily pulled from its mountings and could be easily lost. (One extra set of replacement bands comes with the unit.) In other words, be prepared to handle with care, and you'll no doubt get years of use from this excellent pro microphone.sound for a reasonable price, this is your mic.

B005974C94|4.0|One of the first things that strikes you as you watch/listen to this collaboration between 2 musical giants is that this isn't your father's blues.  This isn't Texas blues or Mississippi blues.  At least not as is understood by most.  Although Eric Clapton chose all but one of the songs here, they have a far distant tint.  The music may be thought to be what is traditionally known as Dixieland music from New Orleans.  And while there is certainly some mingling of the jazz genres at work, from Marsalis and Clapton's perspective, this is also Blues.  One thing is certain.  This is a gathering of some great musicians, mostly from Marsalis gang.  Each is given an opportunity to shine as neither of the stars is wont to stand out.  Clapton in particular seems thankful to have such a diverse group gather on his behalf.  Few of these songs are familiar to me but all sound terrific.  Surprisingly, the troop performs at their best on a New Orleans swing/dirge arrangement of Clapton's own \\"Layla\\".  And don't pass up the extra track on the DVD of a Taj Mahal solo performing some brilliant guitar work and singing on the classic \\"Stagger Lee\\".  The DVD that comes with the CD is crystal clear when up converted on a Blu-ray player and the DTS 5.1 sound is very good.  This concert may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a little bit different musical experience, check this out.  The CD/DVD combo package is a steal!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|OK. There are a lot of people criticizing the film. I don't see their arguments. I've watched the film, and with the enhanced sound, it is truly incredible. I've been a fan since my wife and I saw Episode IV in theaters in the late 70's.   What irritates me is the constant whining about little things people want changed. I hate it. Referring to my title, I've listened to it, since the Episodes I-III hit theaters. They are great movies. And I enjoy this latest release, just like I did the VHS releases, the DVD releases and now this one. I hope I live long enough to see one of these people, who seem to know so much, attempt to create a movie. When you do, just develop coping skills for the army of people, who have nothing better to do than to don Star Wars uniforms and sit in front of a TV.  Enjoy this new release. I have, and my entire family will too. It is an incredible addition to our DVD library.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|I suppose if you push me I will admit I prefer silent films to any other format. I mean, if that's the choice you give me. There are a lot of reasons for this. Mostly, I think, because so many silent films were incredibly groundbreaking in so many areas including writing, direction, artistic quality, and method of acting. You can watch the growth take place right before your eyes. Despite the intervening years since their creation and release, silent films continue to resonate even today.<br /><br />Metropolis is one example of such a film.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have watched this movie. Every time I see it I notice something new. I am not a huge fan of German expressionism, although I do like it. But Metropolis appears as if it combines story and art on such a high level of genius it is no surprise that it's considered to be Fritz Lang's magnum opus.<br /><br />One of the best parts about the film is how it looks so believable. I think the closest any modern day science fiction film has come to making me truly believe in the futuristic background and culture is Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. But Metropolis did it first. It may even be the best interpretation of a futuristic society bar none. I think this might be due in part to the temporal distance involved. We know the names and biographies of the actors in Metropolis, but they have no real connection to our lives in any tangible cultural sense. Whereas when I watch Blade Runner I can't help but think \\"Hey, that's Harrison Ford up there.\\"<br /><br />Of course, I know some of the names of the characters in Metropolis. But they aren't culturally tied to me, so I think that gives them a sort of freedom and makes the film itself a tabula rasa for anyone else who comes to it for the first time. When we watch any film, no matter what it is, we always bring our past experiences with us and draw upon them to help us understand what we are seeing, and process it. This is why going to movies, and reading, and attending operas and ballets and other forms of entertainment endure. They demand that we draw upon our past experience in order to interpret them. There is not only a social connection being made but a psychological one, too. I think as human beings we like that process. We understand it, or at the very least feel comfortable with it.<br /><br />We know Harrison Ford, at least through his modern day work. Most of us like him. We don't know Brigitte Helm, Alfred Abel, Gustav Frolich and others who appear in Metropolis. That distance lends itself to an even deeper commitment of our suspension of disbelief, I think. What I mean is, the characters themselves don't lurch us out of the film and back into reality because they are, for the most part, completely unknown to us. We come to them somewhat empty and unformed and let them help us fill in the tapestry of the film-going experience.<br /><br />From the decimal clocks to the mechanistic and dehumanizing social stratification, Metropolis presents myriad and multi-layered facets. As a writer this fascinates me as well. Fritz Lang is juggling a lot of crystal balls with this movie, and he keeps them in the air and moving in an intricate pattern. It's an incredible artistic accomplishment given the breadth of the work.<br /><br />The art direction for Metropolis set the bar. It is phenomenal. Even when you consider the sense-shattering impact of German expressionism, there are so many elements to Metropolis, so much packed into every scene without either the story or the look of the film becoming top heavy, that it just melds together as one entity. As for story, which as a writer I tend to concentrate on above all else, it works, too. Oh, the basic qualities of the story are a bit long in the tooth: a social and economic clash between two distinct classes, blah blah blah. But even old stories gain new life when they are peopled by actors who interpret their characters as three-dimensional beings. I find the actors did an admirable job of this in Metropolis. We've seen the basic story before. We have not seen this interpretation before, I don't think. At least, not played out like this.<br /><br />Of course, of all the cast, it is Maria, played by Brigitte Helm, who stands head and shoulders above everyone else. From her transformation from Christ-like figure to robot, she is right on target and completely steals the movie. Her image continues to endure right down to today.<br /><br />Watching the evil Maria Robot I also get the impression a lot of background work went into developing that character. Watch how Maria moves and interacts with the other actors. Watch her facial expressions, her gestures, the small moments she brings to the screen. It is like nothing I have ever seen in any other science fiction film -- ever.<br /><br />Today, when we see robots on the silver screen, they either move in some mechanistic stop-and-go action, or like any other ordinary human being so they can hide among us. Think C-3PO from Star Wars to Number Six in the Battlestar Galactica remake as separate ends of the knowable spectrum. But Helm's interpretation of Maria is the only truly inhuman robot I think I have ever seen. She moves and acts and gestures like something completely and totally alien to our experience. It is an amazing feat, and it is downright creepy.<br /><br />To be sure Metropolis is not a perfect film. The philosophy \\"The mediation between head and hands must be the heart\\" becomes repetitious and I can't help but wonder if we are not losing something in the translation from the original German which accounts for its awkwardness. There are also the usual filmatic standardizations and slogging character development that we have to suffer through upon occasion.<br /><br />But for the most part this film rocks. One of the best parts is fans and collectors are always finding new snippets excised from the original film stock. So over the years they have built and patched the film into the original shape Lang meant it to be viewed in.<br /><br />I like Metropolis. As someone who works in genre I can't deny the impact the film has had upon science fiction. As someone who loves film, I can't deny the impact it has had upon the industry as a whole. It's just amazing to me how a film can reach higher than itself and become almost atavistic to genre. As iff all that has passed since its release must by necessity narrow down to the nexus of its existence and draw creative sustenance from there.<br /><br />I think Metropolis does that, at least on a small level, if not large. It reaches beyond itself and becomes something greater, not just in flim but as it relates to knowable human experience. In the process, we are swept along and bounced from crest to wave.<br /><br />It is a fascinating ride through the fabric of imagination and culture. Anyway, that was, and continues to be, my experience when I watch this film.d an admirable job of this in Metropolis. We've seen the basic story before.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|I can't rate Season 3 higher or lower than previous seasons. The stories are up to par, if not much better than those seasons before. Everything seems to have hit a stride that manages to provide a ton of character evolution. Dexter gains a somewhat twisty friendship with the ADA. Many dark moments as this relationship grows, along stride with Dexter's growing relationships with Rita and the homicide division, this season turns into: how do you plan a party for a serial killer anyway...?<br /><br />The bad parts are the same as every Dexter DVD release prior. A mere handful of these have anything to do with the series. Mostly it's episodes of Showtime's other shows. Essentially, Dexter's final disc is pretty much a catch and released selected episodes for Showtime's other> shows. If I were interested in other shows, I would have already bought those series. Sure, previewing several shows is just good marketing. But small details like \\"subtitles\\" (never provided with seasons 1-4) would be a pretty nice inclusion that makes the extra shows kinda weak.<br /><br />So, season 3 itself: 5; special features on this season: 1.
B003L20ICE|4.0|Two of my favorite female adult actors star in this film about a lesbian marriage coping with children curious about their biological father.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor is a great deal of fun and exactly what escapist movies should be.  The acting is what one might expect from this type of movie.  It goes for cheap laughs and chuckles not deep thoughts.  It doesn't take it self too seriously and it realizes it's a super hero movie. Even so I thought the acting was decent.  Chris Hemsworth plays Thor quite well.  Tom Hiddleston take on Loki is refreshing and the positioning of him as a somewhat tragic figure is inspired.   Kenneth Branagh does a great job of making this a family type story out of Shakespeare.  Granted it is not Shakespeare but one can see where he gets his inspiration.  This is a fun movie and I recommend it as a fun thing to watch.
0810970686|5.0|Once again I grabbed this book as soon as I could prise it from my daughter's fingers and read it quickly before she took it to school the next day to loan it to friends.   This is a wonderful series. Greg is a self centred ordinary but somewhat wimpy 12 year old boy. The things he gets up to are so wonderfully underdescribed as he writes his diary, and so hilariously set off by his illustrations, that I was literally laughing out loud at points in this book.   This book is the third in the series. If you have not read the first two you should really start from the beginning as there are occasional references to earlier incidents that will make more sense that way. If you have read those and got this far, then you probably love these books as much as me (and half the kids in my daughter's class!)   Excellent books for children and adults alike, and a very quick and easy read so a good one for less confident readers too.
0312263511|5.0|Having only read Apollo 13 I'm fairly new to the astronaut memoirs.  That being said Cernan's memoir is not only an excellent astronaut memoir but also a great overview of the history of NASA's space program up to the Apollo programs.  Where Apollo 13 gave a great bird's eye view of Lovell's experiences with NASA and a good overview of what its like to be an astronaut, Cernan's memoir goes into a lot more detail of how the space program was going in relation to his own experiences.  This made all the difference for me because not only are we able to see how he handled everything, what he went through, what it was like, we also get to experience almost all the steps that went towards Apollo 17 and the close of the Apollo program.  Cernan's memoir is succinct and written clearly, making for an easy, yet rewarding read.  I felt enlightened and fascinated by the inner workings of NASA and how the astronauts went through the struggles of both space flight and the internal political dynamics associated with their position within the agency.  Where Apollo 13 sealed my interest in astronaut memoirs, The Last Man on the Moon went further and made everything come to life so that I can't wait to read another memoir of such a fascinating subject.  Read Cernan's memoir and you will not be disappointed, not only for his account of his experiences but on a detailed account of the space programs through Apollo.  Definite recommend.  5 stars.

The original copy is now on its way around the class on loan to various friends, and I just managed to read this one after she had finished it and before she lent that one out too!   So without a doubt this book is popular with its intended audience. It states 9+ on the back of the book, although my daughter is 8. There is no maximum age for this book though, because it is hilarious and works on so many levels.   Adults will read this book and be transported back to their school days. Greg, the diary writer (or journal writer as he would prefer it to be called) is very much a typical 12 year old boy. The genius of this book is how the author captures that so perfectly and succinctly. Like any 12 year old boy, he does not waste words in his diary on feelings and touchy feely stuff. He writes as he thinks, and then draws pictures - and these are hilarious.   I found myself literallly laughing out loud at this book (and few books have that effect on me). Anyone who has been a kid will identify with this flawed but lovable boy as he struggles against the victimisation at the hands of his older brother, and all the other curved balls life throws at him.   A quick but excellent read. Well worth it. Also a good one to enthuse less confident readers.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Okay, me... long-time Trekker, I collect ST toys & books & Dickel bottles BUT... I've never owned any Trek Original Series on any form, Beta, VHS or disc. Until now. And I'm glad I waited and didn't get stuck with 79 separate VHS's in clamshells! You'd think I'd be a purist and all a-gripin' about the Remastering, but nope. I love it! Here's what the naysayers are missing in their reviews.<br /><br />Of course Star Trek would be easy to preserve and clean up, it always looked great, it was a vibrant, colorful show. But no one probably thought that it would get \\"tampered with\\" &agrave; la Star Wars. Fans hate to point out weaknesses in the things we revere, but face it, the stock shots of the same Enterprise model crudely super-imposed over the same planet footage, it was just jarring transition-wise.<br /><br />The old-fashioned dials are turned into more futuristic read-outs, the Gorn blinks, the matte paintings are re-done more realistically, the phaser beams colors are in sync. The special features tell you that they basically used the same planet shot multiple times, just tinted it different colors. Let's face it, the budget went into Janice Rand's basket-weave hairdo, there wasn't much left over for FX.<br /><br />But the new exteriors and bridge viewscreen shots aren't jarring like you might expect, in fact they flow with the original series footage better than ever. The ships don't jerk, they don't get translucent, but somehow they made the CGI a bit aged to fit in with the rest of the film stock. It's only when you first start watching that you anticipate the CGI and are more concious of it, after awhile you forget about it at all. There's a great side-by-side comparison at the \\"Star Trek\\" website, just search for \\"Star Trek comparison remastered\\". So basically, that's how I feel about THAT! Nyah!<br /><br />Okay, the dvd packaging? Feh! It's SO bad that I find it funny now, every time I open the cases wondering how anyone could've seriously thought this was aesthetically-pleasing or convenient presentation. Unmarked dvd discs, a big 10-disc plastic case in a paper box in a plastic hinged box and the square cards with each episode listed on them. My cards fell out today when I tilted the box to pull the unweildy 10-cd plastic case out. Ugh. Anyway, so bad it's funny, at least I get a little laugh out of it! That's how I put a positive spin on things I guess.<br /><br />Buy it. NOW!!! And live long & prosper.entation.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|We definately need more popcap games in the future! All time great game. Can't wait for more.  The game has some decent repeatability too.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|People you need to stop bashing George its his movies not ours his creation you did'nt make it up. All these changes are what he wanted but did'nt have the tech to do it at the time. These are the best quality we will ever see these films in so be happy the changes are not really that big of a deal. Darth Vader looking at palpatine while he is killing his son and then basically saying enough is enough and screaming no actually was emotionally touching I loved it my wife cried when it happenend. These Movies will never look any better get over yourself get this set its awesome.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|It has been a very long time since there has been an album that I don't skip a single song when listening to. I think that Government Hooker and Scheibe have to be two of the best \\"getting ready to go out\\" songs ever created.  I listen to the album every day and never get tired of listening to it.  I am already thirsty for more Gaga music.  Perhaps an acoustic album next?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Right at the top: This is not a review of the whole box set.  I refuse to buy this on the grounds that Lucas is simply trying to grab as much cash as possible from the same product.  If this had included the ORIGINAL series with better picture and sound, I would own it, even with the craptastical prequels.  But no.<br /><br />Instead, I borrowed the Deleted Scenes disc for SW, EMPIRE and JEDI.  This is a review of that, for those who, like me, would only purchase this set for that disc.<br /><br />1.  It's a super-uber-new Blu Ray which takes a LONG time to load if you have an older Blu Ray player.  It took me an hour to watch fifteen or twenty minutes of material.<br />2. Even just from watching bits of clips, I can tell that the picture quality on the Blu Ray films is amazing.  The Deleted scenes have been cleaned up, but not to that crisp quality of the features.<br />3.  With the exception of the ROTJ lightsaber scene and sandstorm scene on Tatooine, there's nothing on here that an avid fan hasn't found on the web already.  And quite frankly, nothing on here is that interesting.  At all.  There's several angles of a Han-led assault on the Endor bunker with a fun \\"scum?\\" rebuttal from Solo, but that's about it.<br /><br />Long story short, if you were looking forward to the Blu Rays for the bonus material and not Lucas's newest rogering of one of the greatest film series of all time, you can skip this.  You're better off re-watching the \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary.

B001KQZ7I8|4.0|Man's Search for Meaning was a fascinating account of Victor Frankl's life before, during, and after serving as an ordinary prisoner and survivor of four Nazi death camps.  The first part of the book is more of an auto-biographical account of how he arrived in Auschwitz, the harsh living conditions, and later what happened after his release.  I found this section easy to read, with some real pearls of wisdom.  The second part of the book was more difficult for me personally because it included a lot of psychology terms.<br /><br />It was interesting to learn about the things Frankl endured, and more importantly how he survived the bitter cold, limited food rations, brutal punishments, and the overall depression associated with being a death camp prisoner.  Despite all the hardships, he even discussed a few rays of sunlight that broke through the otherwise drab existence - this included humor, natural beauty of a sunset, and many other things.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book I would like to read and study again, especially so I can better understand the psychology concepts used in the second part.  I do think the first book is written simply enough for anyone to understand the basic concepts Frankl is conveying about our own personal search for meaning.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Watched this one last night. Paul is a movie that had potential but I didnt care for the preaching crap trying to say theres no Christian god...I think its weak to inject atheism in a movie and say theres no Christian god...out of all the popular religions in the world, they always pick on Christians...why is that? I know why...it is because they are scared of the other religions. If you want to make an atheist movie, bring up the other religions instead of Christianity. I dont respect anyone or anything that disses the Christian religion but neglects any of the other ones....WEAK.
B0034G4P80|2.0|The first 10 minutes were pretty bad, not done well at all, but then it picked up some.  There was some good action and special effects but the movie was very predictable.  The acting was average to poor even for Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman so you know the director was at fault there.  The military handling was very cheesy and not done well.  The ending was not so good and setup for a sequel obviously.  At best this movie might rate a 5 out of 10, AT BEST, and certainly isn't better than the X-Men series or even Iron Man for that matter.  So it was watchable but I would toot anyone's horn over it.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is fairly relaxing, and if the puzzles don't do the trick, the soundtrack should. Very fitting. What is the meaning of the 1928-1946 thing? Regardless, I would appreciate it if I wasn't coerced into rating the game after two stages. I can't make up my mind that quickly!

0670022411|5.0|This book was a great read and one that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The characters were well developed as was the plot line.  I cannot wait for the next book in the trilogy and will be anxiously awaiting to learn more about what happens to Diana and Matthew as they travel back in time and if a war between the daemons, vampires and witches breaks out.  Deborah Harkness is obvously a very talented writer and I wish she would write faster so we could get to the next chapter!!
B0000029GA|3.0|I'm not going to go as far as to say this is a bad album, but I think it's always been way overhyped. I don't even think it's the best album from 94. Word Life (O.C.), Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik (Outkast), Hard to Earn (Gang Starr), and even The Diary (Scarface) are just a few I think are better from that year. I didn't like Illmatic or Ready to Die when they first came out, but Ready to Die has at least grown on me though over the years. Illmatic is still just OK to me. I know this is Hip Hop sacralege but I don't care. I don't like Nas that much over all, Illmatic is the only album of his I even own and I think it's only out of obligation. I think a lot of people jock this album because they think they have to and don't want their Hip Hop fandom questioned. If you are new to Hip Hop you are pretty much required to listen to this album to even participate in a conversation like this, but don't be surprised if you can't figure out what all the hype is over. If you do like it, cool, I'm not saying it sucks, just don't ignore the other quality music from that era.
B000001EXR|4.0|Throughout their career, Kiss would occasionally update their sound to reflect the sounds of the day as they flirted with disco on Dynasty, pop music on Unmasked, and pop/metal on Crazy Nights. In the mid-90's, grunge was all the craze and the band attempted to mimic that sound on Carnival of Souls. Unlike their previous experiments, this is a pretty successful one. No, this isn't one of their best albums ala Destroyer or their self-titled debut nor is it on the level of Nirvana's Nevermind or Soundgarden's Superunknown but it's still pretty good. This style suited Gene Simmons well as his songs were traditionally the heavier ones while Paul Stanley (who was the backbone of the band) sounds a bit out of sorts but still delivers the goods. As for the songs, \\"Hate\\" is Kiss at their most wicked and Gene's vocals most resemble the \\"Demon\\" character he portrayed. \\"Master of Slave\\" has a killer riff that repeats throughout as Paul's voice shows a lot of drama. \\"Jungle\\" is a strong tune with a sick groove that got some radio airplay while \\"I Will Be There\\" is one in a long line of good \\"ballads\\" from Stanley. Bruce Kulick's playing here is his best ever as a Kiss member and he really shines on \\"Seduction of the Innocent\\", the catchy \\"In the Mirror\\" and his own \\"I Walk Alone\\". The remaining songs (\\"Rain\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"In My Head\\", etc) are all good and the band certainly do the \\"Seattle sound\\" justice. While there are no classic Kiss tracks here, nothing is bad either and Carnival of Souls is worth checking out if you're a fan of the grunge sound that dominated much of the `90s.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't believe it takes anything more than that to review any release of Star Wars that does not use the original theatrical version of events. Shame on George Lucas for failing to practice what he preached and butchering these movies. Shame on anyone that buys these and continues to support these abominations.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Polished, good graphics, complex, everything that is necessary for a quality game quell has. I love puzzlers and this works flawlessly unlike other simple games that cut corners with their graphics and game play
B00000FCBC|5.0|Who would have thought that a hard rock version of Bob Segers' Turn The Page would be so damn good? Disc one features newly recorded content, while disc 2 contains rare b sides and the $5.98 Garage Days Re-Revisited EP.
0821210920|5.0|Let me start with the fact that I've had high school and college classes on photography so I already had some preconceived notions. This book helped change some of those. Mr. Adams works in large format (8x10 I believe), black and white, sheet film. That matters nothing to the education you can get from this book. He starts from the bottom up and explains everything in clear terms, always focusing on how the term or action relates to taking the picture. He could have gone way technical but he stops short and you can tell he wants to teach us to see and to use our tools (whichever ones we use.)  If you are new to DSLR photogrpahy, SLR photography or have a loved one who wants to do better at amateur photography, this is the book to get them started. Whether you are a portrait taker, nature photographer, found object, animal or a mix, this book will serve you well, especially those with little or no training. Thanks Mr. Adams! May we all rise to your level of artistic integrity and skill.
B003Y5H574|4.0|Anything with Ryan Gosling shirtless is bound to be a hit.  It helps when he's part of a supporting cast that makes what could be just another ho-hum movie something much more than run of the mill.  Steve Carell, who always seems to hit the right note when playing the loser character, transforms brilliantly into more than the loser while still somehow being that guy.  This movie is at times touching and at other hilarious.  I was completely convinced these people were more than just who they initially appeared to be.  Jonah Bobo steals most of his scenes as the love sick teenage son of Steve Carell and Julianne Moore's characters.  Very well paced and executed.  This is one of the best films I've seen all year and actually feels like something that could happen in real life with a few exceptions.
1591840562|5.0|I read this book as part of UAB's IEM program in EGR 651, Technology Ventures.  What a cool book.  I love the way Guy weaves stories about his work at Apple and in Garage Technology Ventures with the principles in the book.  The way he talks about creating a mantra challenged me to focus on my message.  The business plan chapter is the second shortest in the book probably because that's where too many people get hung up in getting started.  He talks about simplicity.  He intentionally avoids some of the detail like corporate structure and the legalities for getting started, and instead focuses more on people, funding, and branding.  The wrap-up chapter ties back in with his very first step - to make meaning, become a mensch.  Everything he describes is an art, and Kawasaki outlines the flow of creativity but leaves the details to us.  There is something in this for every budding entrepreneur and intrapreneur.  Well worth the read; don't wait to take a class to pick it up!
B0027REDK2|5.0|How could the greatest song that Duran Duran ever made have stayed on the album? Buy this double-CD set to hear Track 14, \\"Hold Back the Rain [US Album Remix]\\". As guitarist Andy Taylor explains in the beautiful liner notes, they remixed a number of tracks for the US album, this is one of the magnificent results.<br /><br />Everything about this song is amazing, Lebon's voice soars beyond anything I've heard him do before (and that's saying something). The rhythm and synths and drums, all perfect. Six minutes and thirty seconds of Duran Duran at their best.<br /><br />Oh, and there are a few other tracks on these two discs you might have heard of: Rio, The Chauffeur, New Religion, Save a Prayer, etc. etc. etc! For almost 15 years I've known Duran Duran from their Greatest Hits CD, I've clearly been missing some incredible work.<br /><br />What an amazing discovery all these years later, get this double-CD!

B005CM9DX6|5.0|I play the 'cello and love classical music.  I came of age in the '70s.  I listen to a lot of progressive rock and metal.  I love all the music of Opeth, and now they have made this recording just for me.  This recording, as everyone has noted, is like nothing Opeth have done before. It is on the one hand an homage to the music that has inspired them.  For almost 20 years they have made sophisticated music in an ordinarily unsophisticated genre, music that clearly owed a lot to classical influences, to 70s and 80s rock, and to the versatility that modern electronics gives to musicians.  This work acknowledges those debts explicitly.  On the other hand, this album is not imitative.  It is innovative in structure, instrumentation, and gives a 21st century form to now-classic styles.  It draws from a number of deep wells, and creates a drink that is much more than water.  Those of us who came to Opeth from the metal side will probably be disappointed.  Those who came from the prog rock side may be slightly mystified.  But those that love complex, thoughtful music that is very conscious of its *ahem* heritage should acquire this album right now.

B004VFYOA2|4.0|And seriously, Wright Brothers.. we have the space shuttle now. What were you thinking??   I can't believe people are criticizing this release for 20 year old video technology. Hello, wake up everybody. There was no Hi-Def smart phone blue ray technology in 1990. David didn't claim that this was stellar footage - in fact he made sure you knew up front that it wasn't. But fans (like me) have waited and hoped for 20 years to have something released from that era - and here it is.   I gave it a 4 cause there are a few things that maybe could have been done better - but like David said - it is what it is. And I'm glad to have it. Now, a few of you probably need to get back to watching your hidef Brittney bluerays and let the grown ups watch Whitesnake in peace.
0553801473|1.0|I can not think of the last time I have been so disappointed in a book. After the long wait, continuously checking Martins website to see if he had FINALLY finished writing this long awaited book. After thoroughly enjoying all the proceeding volumes. They were such excellent work! A Dance with Dragons was horrible. I think it was pointless to write, much less read! Why ruin such a good tale? Great expectation often leads to great disappointment.
1595825045|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet. If you're a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, then this is the definitive collector's item. While insight into the creative process can sometimes demystify a work, this art book can only cultivate a whole new appreciation.  Understanding the sheer scope of the project, the ambition of Michael and Bryan, and the unflinching dedication of artists East and West, also makes it clear just how the show managed to be so epic and so beloved by people of all ages.  For those who get into the finer details, the book is made out of high quality materials: gorgeous glossy paper, high resolution artwork (even where the images are small), and a solid hardcover with a firm binding.  It makes a great coffee table book, conversation piece, and lead-in to recruiting the next legion of A:TLA fans.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The prequels are the biggest and most welcome surprise in this set. Massive, massive, massive improvements to the picture particularly in better marrying the multitude of elements within the frame. That is to say, digital elements are merged much more gracefully with practical elements. Furthermore, these elements look more like they were physically photographed on set. No, it is not perfect and totally seamless in this regard, but the improvement is light-years beyond previous releases. Clearly, there are improvements that will go largely unnoticed by the average viewer's conscious mind while still registering as marked improvement even if one is not able to put their finger on exactly what or why. The prequels, photographically speaking, have been dialed into a look that is parallel to the 'look' of the original films. This improvement lends these prequels a legitimacy that was absolutely NOT there previously. Visually it appears as if a hazy filter has been lifted from in front of the camera revealing, well, Star Wars movies. There is now a clarity to the overall picture to which the eye is much more receptive allowing the viewer to more fully take in the richness of Lucas' grand illusion. One could liken this enrichment to the new life afforded a film experience by taking in a widescreen presentation after being well familiarized with years of pan & scan. The money spent on these Blu-Rays by the consumer is onscreen for sure. Enjoy.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|After the death of both my Tritton AX720s and my Tritton AXPros I turned to give Turtle beaches a try. I mainly bought the turtle beach x41s other than the PX5s simply because i didn't feel the need to spend $250 on another headset. Purchasing this product was probably the best move I ever did.   Opening the box i was surprised to found that everything i needed was included and i was very happy to find that the transmitter was powered by USB. The headset itself is very light and same goes for the transmitter. I was worried that they were made almost entirely of plastic and to my surprise they are very durable and more durable than my trittons ever were. Now i was extremely disappointed to find that the headset ran on batteries and was not rechargeable. Come on Turtle Beach its 2011!!  Now with the sound Quality. I first had to test this on MW2 and Black Ops to see if these truly gave you an advantage. You cannot go wrong! Footsteps could be heard with the 5.1 Surround Sound (7.1 is fake marketing) as clear as day with these on. If you play a lot of multiplayer games these will give an advantage.I then tested these with Gears of War 3 and was blown away. Footsteps were clear and the sound quality was great. They even include an effects button to boost up the bass levels.  The turtle beach x41s have 3 main problems. First being that it runs on batteries and second being that it runs wirelessly on a 2.4 GHZ frequency. If you play less than 4-6 feet away from your router you will notice interference such as pops, crackles and loss of audio.  Other than those 2 cons you just cant go wrong with the turtle beach x41s. Truly an incredible headset!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Totally enjoyed this album.  It is finely crafted with a nice balance of songs.  Of course, the title track was a monster hit and deserves every ounce of it's popularity.  The arrangements and musicianship are gorgeous.  Young new country at it's finest.
B001R4CKGU|5.0|The book takes a little effort to get in to, but it is worth it. I could see how some readers would not be able to appreciate it. Don't be turned off by the low ratings by some. They are looking for something lighter and more linear.   The phrasing and images are vivid, the story line captivating. Made me think of my own relationship with my father with anger, disappointment and tenderness. The author does a great job of capturing the complexities of real relationships.
143350393X|4.0|Nice book with interesting commentaries. However, even though the commentaries tries its best to be objective and all inclusive, it fails to be anything more than a very bias text. I like the illustrations, and the font is easy to read.
0061450162|4.0|I love short stories. I love Neil Gaiman's writing. Does it follow, then, that I love Neil Gaiman short stories?<br /><br />Some of them, yes.<br /><br />Smoke and Mirrors covers a lot of ground: humor, erotica, whimsy and horror. Included are several poems, some flash fiction pieces, and a number of conventional short stories. The tone, regardless of what mood or emotion a given story is going for, tends toward the straightforward. Unadorned, no-nonsense, but clear and effective.<br /><br />Gaiman's favorite trick is to flip a well-known fable or fairy tale upside down -- to reveal events seen from a different character's perspective, or to modernize a traditional character or scenario.<br /><br />\\"Murder Mysteries,\\" a long story retelling interactions between angels going back to the very formation of the universe and the human sphere, may be the most ambitious and interesting thing here. \\"Snow, Glass, Apples\\" is likewise richly told and well written.<br /><br />\\"Shoggoth's Old Peculiar,\\" which visits a variation on Lovecraft's fictional town of Innsmouth, and \\"We Can Get Them for You Wholesale,\\" about a guy who turns to an assassination service to help him deal with his frustrations, are particularly funny.<br /><br />Many of other pieces were comparatively slight, though. In my recent review of Joe Hill's collection \\"Twentieth Century Ghosts,\\" I said the book might have been improved by eliminating the weakest 1/3 of the material, and I'd say the same thing here. A shorter book, but a much stronger one, would result. I give the collection as a whole 4 stars, but there's quite a bit of 5-star material here, as well as some individual stories I'd give 3 or even 2 stars.<br /><br />Overall a hit-and-miss collection, yet it contains some very worthwhile stories fans of Gaiman won't want to miss.
B005M68S4W|3.0|this collection was necessary!   I get the part about how cool it is that Tony has had this incredible recording career--both he and Barbra Streisand are the champs of longevity--but this follow up to the Duets album he released five years ago misses the mark. To me the bigger problem is that the majority of the songs here have already been done by Tony over, under and sideways down. Some of the duet partners would have done better with some new material (to both them and him).   While not a total miss--it does have it's moments.   First of all--the BIG moment--the duet between Tony and Amy Winehouse. It is a masterpiece! If everything else on this album was of this quality this would be a milestone album for Tony--or for anyone! Unfortunately, no other cut lives up to this.   That is not to say there aren't more good cuts--there are! Here's who works well--and makes it worth the purchase.   Lady Gaga, John Mayer and Michael Buble are fun to hear--they sound good--and it sounds like Tony is really enjoying himself. Gaga is a blast--John Mayer is respectful and jazz-bluesy--and Buble is--well he's his usual Michael Buble self.  Pal k.d. Lang, Faith Hill and Norah Jones are just lovely with Tony and it sounds \\"easy\\". They work very well with the songs they share with him. Lang is as usual beautiful--Jones is sexy as hell--and Faith is just a sweet surprise!   The prettiest male duet is Yesterday I Heard The Rain with Alejandro Sanz. It's beautiful.  Natalie Cole delivers--she would with anyone! The girl can't help herself--she's a class act singer who knows how to work her way around a song, with a duet partner or by herself! YEAH!  That's nine cuts totally worth it!  Then there's the filler stuff--basically forgetful duets with Queen Latifah, Carrie Underwood and Sheryl Crow. They're the girls who could have used \\"something new\\" to record with Tony. When they are in solo they sound pretty good but when they're in duet with Tony they're in his key and not their own and that takes a big toll on the the overall recording. Underwood's duet is the best of the three, and the only one I would keep--Crow's is the worst.   But--that's only 12 cuts--(and it should have stopped there!) but, there are 17 on this album. There's even two more on the Target version. You have got to know when enough is enough--and take the best. (Note to Barbra Streisand on the other side of that coin--10 is too few--but wait--note to Tony Bennet I would have cut 7 of these songs leaving only 10--and that's too few for you too!!).  The 5 remaining cuts should have been shelved in the spirit of less is more.   First--the Queen of Soul is the Queen of dreadful--OMG!--this REALLY sucks--she really is bad--I mean really bad--and on top of that she manages to make Tony sound just as bad! Painful! Is it time for Aretha to go sit down?  As for Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli--they just do not work with the material. Yes these men have beautiful voices--but in this case they are so far out of the jazz league that Tony operates in that it borders on embarrassment! I think of the word soul-less! It's bad musical blending.  Willie is Willie--and he has done some fine jazz standard work on his own--but it's just a big yawn!   I have read a few reviews that love the Mariah Carey duet and I can't figure out why. It's not that she and Tony don't compliment each others voice--but this song--why? Over produced big time. This is totally a case where a different song was needed for their voices.   While it's true I started by saying that I don't know why this collection was necessary--I'll end by saying that I love Tony Bennett and I'm glad to add 12 of these tracks to my collection. I would add that I have been buying albums by Tony Bennett for 50 years so I feel like I've earned the right to express my opinion about this album.   I'm just sayin'--and know that I'm not a hater! I love Tony Bennett.  For my own maximum enjoyment I have programmed the disc player to play 10 cuts in this this order--cuts 1/ 2/ 3/ 5/ 10/ 12/ 14/ 15/ 4/ 16. It's much better this way!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Deathly Hallows part 2 is the best of the Harry Potter series of movies.  There were a lot of important sequences from the book that had to be filmed just right to be able to pull off the emotional and dramatic impact - and the movie succeeded in all regards (Snape's memories, Harry using the resurrection stone and sacrificing himself to Voldemort, and the reactions of those that loved Harry seeing his \\"dead\\" body).  In previous movies, director David Yates has had a somewhat bad habit of deleting important parts from the books and adding parts that were not in the book (see Half Blood Prince for the best examples of this).  In this particular movie, Yates' adding, expanding, and showing things not necessarily shown in the book worked very well:  Hogwarts virtually turned into a prison camp with the teachers leading students in formation to their destination, Harry confronting Snape directly about his murder of Dumbledore, showing Ron and Hermione actually going into the Chamber of Secrets, and the much-expanded final battle between Harry and Voldemort.  Curiously missing was the explanation why Harry was able to return to life (Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection in Goblet of Fire which linked Harry to the Earth similar to Voldemort's own Horcruxes);  by sacrificing himself, Harry had become the \\"master of death\\" and the dementors could not affect him and all the people he cared about now had the same type of protection around them that his mother had put on him, and finally Harry not repairing his original wand with the Elder Wand...with all the talk of wand lore, this was very important to Harry to have his old wand back and was basically his final act before the epilogue.  The movies like to show the wands spells connecting, which really only happened once in GoF because Harry and Voldemort's wands had twin cores), but it's a good visual effect, along with smoke trails of the Death Eaters when they actually just appear or disappear when they apparate/disapparate.  With that being said, Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fantastic movie and is action packed, visually stunning, emotional, funny at the right times, and dramatic.  Daniel Radcliffe is Harry Potter and he is at his best in this movie.  My highest recommendation - I loved it!
B00002605V|4.0|If your a metal fan then this is a must for your collection.  If you trying to buy old school Metallica then this is not as high energy as Ride the Lightning, Kill em' all or their best album (IMO) Master of Puppets!  There is however no filler songs and one of my Favorite Metallica albums ever so that's why I bought it.  On suggestion to metal fan's reading this is to point out that while I'm collecting a large quantity of Metal from the 80's and 90's I recommend getting remasters whenever possible.  Otherwise the sound quality might be somewhat disappointing.  Yes the remasters are more rare and cost more but the sound is freaking awesome like I just experienced on King Diamond - Fatal Portrait & Abigail.<br /><br />KC_Metal
0061205699|5.0|Harper Lee's masterpiece is a captivating blend of folklore and Urban Legend on one hand and an astonishing and vivid picture of a little town in the state of Alabama in the 1930's on the other hand. Rather than having a distinct story-line it's a portrait of all sorts of characters some more important than others.<br /><br />The main characters are Scout - a smart nine-year-old girl - and Jem her intelligent and courageous twelve-year-old brother. The lawyer Atticus is their father. They live in a house together with Calpurnia the perfect nanny and she's like a mother for the two children (Their own mother died several years ago ).<br /><br />Tom, a young black man, has to stand trial for assault on a white girl. The court has appointed Atticus to defend the accused. It will have rather severe consequences.<br /><br />The title of my review - The things that happen to people we never know - is from a conversation between Scout and a neighbor. We will fully understand the others, says Atticus, when we put ourselves in the shoes of the others. He says this because as a lawyer he wants to understand the reason why some people commit a crime.<br />There is another important character though we met him only a few times. His name is Boo Radley who lives like a recluse in his own house. He's the most mysterious person I ever met in a work of fiction<br /><br />The novel has a rather tragic and peculiar ending.<br /><br />One of the best-loved classics of all time \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\" has earned many distinctions since his first publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer price, been translated in more than 40 languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians accross the United States.
1847940323|5.0|This book is a great read; and a very fun read. There's really no way to read this and not begin taking your change efforts to a new level. This was the spark I needed to inspire new ideas in my business and tackle old ones in personal life. Highly recommended, unless your on my X-mas list this year, because this book is what everyone is getting from me.
0307279189|2.0|OK.  I've heard of this book for a couple years now and finally read it after a friend asked me.  I'm a year-round runner, have finished 20 marathons and three ultra-marathons.  I've had running-related injuries but not since 2006.  I understand the mindset of the people McDougall speaks of.  But.  Seriously.  In my experience, the author plays fast and loose with the facts and stretches them beyond credulity.  To point to Nike and Adidas as the de facto cause for evil in the world and to hope for a planet on which we simply all run antelope to a point of exhaustion in order to feed our children is just too far out there.  He makes a practice of taking a fact and extending it to a rediculous extreme and then sits back, smiling, waiting for the reader's adulation.   There are good points in the book.  The discussion of the facts of a foot's anatomy is helpful.  Pointing out how a mid-foot strike point in stride is accurate.  Eating mostly plants, less of it and staying fresh is well understood.  But his extension of these things just zaps any credibility.   If he were right, we'd see 5-10% of runners in races barefoot or with minimialist shoes.  In the five races I've run in the last two months, I've seen one out of a total of nearly 10,000.  It just doesn't fly.  I also see now that the hero of the book, Caballo Blanco, has his own web site where he offers guided adventure tours to the very canyon which McDougall seems to want to protect from the evils of Western influence.  Nope...all of them are making big bucks off this seeming \\"return to nature\\" polemic.   Didn't go for this at all.  Just can't find it in me to buy it.
0385534639|4.0|Good but not great. I enjoyed The Night Circus a lot but didn't fall madly in love with it as I expected to, and as many others have.<br /><br />The Night Circus is one of the most imaginative books I have read. I loved the author's descriptions of the circus. The lush imagery she creates is beautiful; I almost felt myself transported into the enchanting world of the circus.<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel a little disappointed that I didn't love the book as much as others have. The problem was I couldn't feel a lot for the characters. I didn't care about any of them, because I felt I hardly knew them. As for the romance, I just didn't feel anything about it either.<br /><br />The four stars is because of the author's incredible writing skills. I will be looking forward to more from her.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Love the recording, the price, the service. Joe Satriani is the greatest, and this is a great selection to add to my collection. No disappointments here.
B0051MKMNC|3.0|too bad the dvd copy of the film was not included. overall the package arrived on time as expected. bla, bla, bla
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are star crossed lovers. While that may sound like a set up for a romantic movie, in \\"The Adjustment Bureau,\\" it could destroy the world as 'The Chairman' has planned. As loosely based on a story by Phillip K Dick, the adjusters come to Earth at the orders of the Chairman to quietly make little tweaks so the world runs just as it should. Trouble is, Damon and Blunt are not supposed to be in the plan.<br /><br />In Dick's story, Damon's Dick Norris is not a rising polition, but some grey suit in an office who stumbles into the adjusters, who happen to be dogs. In the story, the dog is supposed to bark and delay Damon. In this case, the adjusters are given human form and magic fedoras that make John Slattery look like he just crossed the street from shooting Mad Men, but in the movie give them the power to navigate strange portals (a store door that opens to Yankee Stadium, for example) and make things work as the Chairman sees fit.<br /><br />Religious Allegory much? While that is never mentioned, Chairman = God gets pretty obvious and tiresome as the movie stretches out. While Dick's original story was deeply misogynistic, at least Blunt is given a woman who could conceivably be the strong character Damon would fall for. Ultimately, the fate versus freewill argument consumes the movie and the holes begin taking up more space than the magic doors. Blunt and Damon have good chemistry, Terrence Stamp is a menacing adjuster, but the movie can't maintain a steady pace. \\"Inception\\" this isn't.
0307987647|1.0|I am a big fan of the whole series of \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire. The author is fantastic and the reader is great. I am so angry that CD\\"s 26,27, and 28 skip HORRIBLY! I am not even finished so I don't know how bad the rest of the collection is. RUINING a great book. The CD's are brand new with no visible marks or scratches. I have to purchase the book to find out what I missed. NOT GOOD!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Love the idea. I like being able to search, listen to samples, buy, download, and add to a playlist, and listen to the playlist all from a single app on my phone. Streaming from the cloud is \\"cool\\", but it will kill your battery quick and run up your data plan if you do it often. This feature is better used on the web browser interface for streaming to a work PC or tablet.  This app has quite a few problems that keep it at three stars. Amazon needs to fix these issues and this player will be great:  1) Music skipping issues. I thought it was just me, but this is noted in other reviews too. I'm playing from local storage and not using cloud streaming, so connectivity isn't an issue.  2) Needs an equalizer. Every other Android music app I've seen needs one too. Stock sound coming out of Android is terrible. It is very \\"tinny\\" sounding. It's not my headphones because I used these same ones on a Creative Labs player that has an EQ and they sound great.  3) Needs a better random song algorithm. I keep getting the same songs played back to back or multiple times within several songs. \\"Random\\" should mean that each song gets played ONLY once in a random order until the entire playlist has been played.  4) Needs ability to push playlists created On-Device to the cloud so I can save the playlist and access it elsewhere.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This is a lovely little movie.  My grandchild aged 2 1/2 could not get enough of it.  I have seen it 5 times.  It is a typical marvelous Myazaki creation.  I highly recommend it to everyone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have a few conflicting opinions on this collection. First and foremost, I'm glad GL decided to bring this saga to Blu-ray (he sure took his sweet time). I am loving how much better, or rather, clean the movies look. That crisp look of Blu-ray is quite impressive. And I have yet to get to the 40 hours of bonus features... which I'm excited to see. What I am conflicted with, is how much a loathe GL's obsession with being a perfectionist. He seems to just not understand that the fans like what he did, making changes is not necessary, let alone wanted. What's worse is forcing those who want this saga on Blu-ray to have only the altered version and not let us have the unaltered is infuriating. However, with that said, my beef I have is with GL himself, not Star Wars. They're still fantastic movies, albeit somewhat tinkered with. I give this 5 stars for the fact that I love Star Wars and that's what this collection still is. Everyone marking this with 1 star has every right to feel that way, but shouldn't confuse the GL's work for GL himself. He deserves the poor rating, not this.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|after flimsly, rubbery plastic cases that don't stay on and huge, bulky otterbox cases I finally decided on the amazon basics case.  it is great!  it is plastic, but is a rigid plastic that does not fall off.  the openings are great for still being able to get to the volume buttons, the mute switch, the switch on top, and the plug opening on the bottom.  the speakers and headphone jack are very convenient also and the camera is not covered at all.  it is not big and bulky and really fits well into your pants pockets.  to be honest, the screen protector that comes with it is worth nine bucks itself.  we have purchased the cheaper screen protectors and they leave bubbles and get scratched very easily.  this screen protector was easy to put on and there are no bubbles or scratches.  there is a very small amazon basics logo on the back at the bottom that does not take away from the asthetics of the case at all.  i bought the smoke color first and my wife went for the clear one after she saw the one i purchased.  don't keep looking for a great verizon iphone 4 case, because this is it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|With all of the outrage surrounding this release, I thought I would give my opinion, as a life-long Star Wars fan.  If you watch these movies chronologically (which I've yet to do), the additions to the blu-ray edition really make sense -- I'm specifically thinking of the \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" and the Krayt Dragon call...    The sound in this release is absolutely breathtaking.  The hum of the lightsabers and the sounds of ships just blew me away.  I could care less about the video quality (which is disturbingly excellent) with sound like this!  If you're a fan of Star Wars and you have a decent surround sound system, you really owe it to yourself to give this release a chance.  You will definitely not regret it.
B000VD5I94|5.0|This movie was such a pivotal part of my childhood that I felt compelled to spend the $10 to buy it again once I got a 1080p TV and Blu-ray player.  This is what I consider to be a near-perfect Science-Fiction film.  It is character driven with a plot that touches on human characteristics that are played well by Peter Weller.  The best part of all GOOD science fiction films that I watch are films that don't get into babbling all kinds of tech-speak about future technology.  This film was made in the 1980s and set \\"sometime in the future\\" and there are quite a few things that date the film (the \\"new\\" Ford Taurus that was space-age for the 80s but is now simply an aged design) but it still is very enjoyable.  The characters don't ever feel the need to mention any dates that specifically date the film and any of the technology used is never blabbed about as if the audience needed plot exposition in order to know that something was high-tech but still in daily use.  All I can say is that this is a great adult science fiction film that is still a good watch despite having seen it more than a dozen times throughout the years.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|I admit I didn't love this record the first several times I listened to it.  I went back and listened to \\"Make Yourself\\" and some of the other older albums and bemoaned the fact that Incubus had gotten all mellow with this new one.  But then I kept listening and found that the songs ARE very good.  While it's lacking the rock n' roll of the past, they do have a good way with slower songs as well.  Remember that \\"Drive\\", a very mellow tune, is the song that first got them noticed by the masses.    As I said, I didn't love it at first, but after several listens it IS good stuff.
0385534639|5.0|This booked hooked me from the start.   Very well writen, the stories and characters easily jump from the page.  Nice use of classic references.  I did not want it to end.
0143116738|4.0|According to author and education consultant Sir Ken Robinson, today's educational systems promote only certain types of learning and recognize only certain types of intelligence and creativity. Yet people are happiest when they follow their talents and do what they love. Robinson, writing with co-author Lou Aronica, describes this avenue to fulfillment as \\"the Element,\\" the intersection of ability and passion. He uses stories of artists, scientists, athletes and musicians to support his theory. While Robinson makes a strong case for finding your Element, he doesn't tell you how to get there. Since he relies on case histories of the famous, some readers might feel more distanced than motivated. Nonetheless, getAbstract recommends this thoughtful self-help book, which challenges traditional views of intelligence and creativity.
0756404738|5.0|This book is really good. In fact, the two books in the series so far are outstanding. I highly recommend them.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|I purchased it for the camera I intend to buy in the near future but I now keep my cell phone in it most of the time.  Fits my HTC WD7 with Otter Box like a glove.  My girlfriend borrowed it to check it out with her camera. I like the way it shrinks in my pocket and she likes it because it does not take up packing space like other camera cases do.  The draw string is very easy to use.

0061438294|5.0|I first read through this book about a year ago. Maybe a little more I'm not sure. After having applied what Mr. Joe Javarro has to say, my ability to read body language is sharper than a Hanzo sword. This ability greatly reduces strain in social situations to an extent you would not believe.<br /><br />Random example off the top of my head. Last night at work me and my female co-worker were talking about age. I guessed she was twenty and a half which ironically was EXACTLY right (Lucky Guess) however, before she admitted this she said she was 22 seemingly with complete sincerity. I however, knew better. Not because she did not look it, she could easily pass for 22 but because as she was saying it she reached back and started to play with her ear. This is what we call a pacifying behavior and in this situation I interpreted it correctly as her lying about her age.<br /><br />This interaction really had no consequence but I still think its a cool example and something I NEVER would have picked up on had I not read this book. On top of giving me a better ability to recognize deceit I regularly read body language to know when<br />-Someone wants to talk to me or does not want to<br />-I'm better able to identify when someone is attracted to me<br />-How invested a person is in the conversation<br />-If someone is talking to another person but wants to talk to me, or wants to not be talking to that other person<br /><br />That is what I come up with off the top of my head but I'm sure in my day to day life I use it in even more situations.<br /><br />I am literally thrilled I happened to read this book for it has irrevocably added my quality of life.<br />Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!

B003XMKMTQ|5.0|Very wonderful concert.  As another reviewer said, this show was edited much more 'raw' (lesser video quality and the acts are arranged out of chronological order) than the subsequent concerts' releases, and there are fewer songs on this release than the 2007 or 2010 shows.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me when I received it was the packaging: this came in a jewel case (like an audio CD).  I worried I had accidentally ordered the album, or received a bootleg.  But don't worry, it's the real deal.
0553801473|3.0|Is no one else concerned about the utter degradation of women in every entry in A Song of Ice and Fire? This is not a real world, it's a fictional one no matter how many medieval trappings it has, and its details were entirely within George Martin's province. Yet we have approximately 5,000 pages of women being referred to by a slang term for female genitals. We have five extremely long books in which women are repeatedly mutilated, gang-<br />raped, raped again and mutilated some more, in as many different ways as the men who set upon them can imagine. (And since it's really Martin doing the imagining, that covers a lot of ground.) That includes the whores, of which there are an endless supply in these books. When men aren't actually raping women, they're talking about it and planning for it. In the eyes of the men in these books, women rank somewhere beneath horses, which at least carry men into battle and can be roasted and eaten when they're dead.<br />  Given the massive number of words given to detailing the use and misuse of women, would we be going too far to think that Martin has unleashed his inner self? I'm a writer myself, and I cannot imagine writing about men the way Martin writes about women. No matter how vicious the world my imagination created, there would be limits to the abuses committed upon the bodies of its characters. Martin has no limits at all.<br />  There are no women worth admiring - unless you count Arya, and she's just a girl. It has to be said that there are precious few men worth admiring, but at least men aren't referred to by their genitals. Even Queen Cersei, referring to a gaggle of old women, remarks to herself that maybe what they need is \\"a good raping.''<br />  Still, I enjoyed the first three books of this series - with reservations. Someone else mentioned that the services of a good editor were sorely needed, an observation with which I heartily concur. Martin seems unable to finish one story line before spinning off half adozen more, and a good editor might have held him to his task. As it was, I skimmed most of A Feast for Crows before realizing that Martin wasn't going to come close to providing a finish to the story(ies) that began 4,000 pages earlier. I felt so betrayed that I have no intention of reading Book Five.<br />  I'd like to know what happens to Tyrion and Arya, the two characters I found most interesting. I'm not going to hang around for several thousand more pages to find out.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I think everyone can agree that there have been major ups and downs throughout this entire monster of a series, but I think I'm in the majority when I say that this is indeed a perfect ending. Not perfect, like book-perfect, for no matter how hard you try, you just can't recreate the true awesomeness of the books. But just truly a great end to the Harry Potter film franchise. I could nitpick certain details, being the addict that I am, but I'm not going to because as a whole, it just works from beginning to end.   Starting out a tad on the slow side, DH pt 2 very quickly escalates to non-stop action that doesn't cease until the near end. It will keep you glued to the screen, on the edge of your seat. There's so much to look at but you never really lose focus. The CGI is utterly fantastic, probably the best looking film since Prisoner of Azkaban. Then there's the beautifully moody score by my new favorite composer (since Benjamin Button) Alexandre Desplat.  You are always aware of it, but it is never distracting, and always moving.   The actors do such a fantastic job with their parts, and I'm not just talking about the three main ones. Radcliffe exceeded all my expectations and then some, and his two faithful companions were no different. You will see little cameos during the film, including Emma Thompson as Trelawney, who has maybe 1 line, but she made me smile nonetheless. Dame Maggie Smith delivers a stirring and surprisingly robust performance and delivers a line that had the entire theater roaring with laughter. Ralph Feinnes is even more sinister and frightening, never failing in his task to truly impress. Finally, I've saved the best for last. The absolute perfection that is Alan Rickman, as the always mysterious, never boring, Professor Severus Snape. The most brilliant casting in the entire series. He will break your heart a thousand times over, even for people who have read the books a million times. Finally, FINALLY we get to see him in all his glory. It's just a shame we had to wait 8 films to see it, but oh what a performance! Truly award-worthy.   I was a bit concerned for the epilogue but was extremely surprised and pleased by the way it came out. Very realisticly done. Subtle, and just right. I could not help but get a little misty-eyed, knowing it was finally all over. Thank goodness for the DVDs...
B005DVINPU|3.0|Good item to add to my Comic movie collection so my kids can show there kids and keep the imignation alive. If they still have DVD's by that time
B001FB55L2|3.0|Brothers is a good film but a bit misleading. Even from the trailers, it seemed there was more to it but after watching it, you find it's a different story. Toby Maguire's character is married to Natalie Portman's character and they have two daughters. He has a brother who just got out of prison, played by Jake Gyllenhaal . The simple premise is, Maguire leaves for Afghanistan just as his brother is released and then something happens during his tour of duty, and his family believes him to be dead. We find out very quickly this is not the case, but at home, things get a bit cozy between Portman and Gyllenhaal. Like I said, the trailer leads you to believe their relationship truly progresses to a deeper level, but in reality, the only thing that really transpires is literally one kiss. Not to say that they don't feel anything, but things don't go further for them. Then they find out Maguire is still alive, though he has been a prisoner of war for some time and had to endure a traumatizing event. This is where the true drama begins.  After Maguire is rescued and sent back home, his family very quickly realizes that everything is not OK. He is clearly traumatized though he does a good deal to hide it, even asking his commanding officer to send him back to war. His marriage is strained and so is the relationship with his children. He gets it in his head that his brother slept with his wife, and that sets him off during a tense, climactic scene.   Basically, what I found misleading is the fact that the title is called Brothers, and yet, there is not much in the story that really pertains and establishes their relationship to each other. Yes, they seem to care for each other, but there is nothing deeper that is developed or explored. Also, for some strange reason, I found the fact that both Portman and Maguire are parents slighly unbelievable. I'm not sure why, but it just seemd somewhat odd whenever they were around the children. Besides that, I thought Brothers was a solid film, that really deals with what seems to be a recurring theme in real life-the lives of soldiers after they come home. What horrors they've faced, and how to begin again or return to their former lives. It's a well-made film, if a bit miscast.
B005LMEB8E|4.0|Looking forward to the next release by Demi Lovato since her sophmore effort Here We Go Again, I was also afraid Unbroken would be full of the same old tired  pop that is played constantly on the radio with lyrics that were too mature for her younger audiences. Her single, Skyscraper, however, gave me hope there would be at least a few songs worth listening too.   While the first two songs on this album, All Night Long featuring Missy Elliot and Timbaland and Who's That Boy featuring Dev were exactly what I feared, the rest of Unbroken is a solid effort and a good listen.   As the first track titles indicate, Unbroken is a pop with R&B infused album, but Miss Lovato has the capabilities to pull off the new sound and with the exception of the first two tracks, the album is a fun listen from front to back.   The songs that impressed me the most were Fix a Heart, For The Love of a Daughter, My Love is Like a Star, Skyscraper and Lightweight.  Miss Lovato has a wonderful voice that expresses her emotions beautifully.   Unbroken is definately an album to buy.
B000022TSW|5.0|The basic plot- kids go to x rated movie, get corrupted, come back swearing a lot, their parents decide to declare war on Canada in revenge.  Sub plot- Satan sits in Hell awaiting the day he can return to Earth while his lover Saddam Hussein treats him with contempt.  Ok so far? Make sense? Good. Then I'll continue.A satire which is so sharp, so devastatingly on target- and there are a LOT of targets- is so hard to find.  This succeeds by being phenomenally well written,and quite hysterically laugh out loud funny. It mercilessly dismantles every single thing in its wake with wit, verve and occasionally even subtlety.(admittedly buried in a welter of filth, mind) Nothing is safe. Overbearing parents, racism, bigotry, the tendancy to go to war on a pretext, censorship, hysteria, fake moral outrage, nothing is safe, everything is fair game, and everything is atomised in the name of good old fashioned sweary entertainment.  Under the slapstick, the insults, the inventive swearing is several serious points. This isn't just a parody, not just comedy, its really well written satire.That's why the film stands up the way it does, because it is so much more than a series of set up situations with a punchline. It is Parker and Stone at the absolute peak of their powers. I just wish I could quote things that made me laugh. I can't though, I just really can't. If you were offended by this, you were meant to be. For the rest of us, it is a brilliant, brilliant movie.Rarely if ever do movies kick over the statues in the way this one does, and make you helpless with laughter as it does.(And I didn't even mention the songs..... just fantastic.

0307341550|5.0|Between self-mutilation, memories she wishes not to relive, and a mother who has always made her feel inadequate, Camille Preaker returns to the small town of Wind Gap, Missouri to report the murders of two unique little girls who do everything except fit the typical profile of Wind Gap girls. Being a small town reporter in the big city of Chicago Camille is despereate to get a leg up in the business of journalism. But will the haunting memories and shock of the culprit of the murders be too much to handle for Camille? I loved this book. Although some of the content is very explicit, it truly shows a young woman's ambition and strength to overcome past, present, and future obstacles that can be truly detrimental to success in work and in life. I'd recommend this to anyone age 15 and up.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|The advertisement needs to reflect the fact that if you have your Kinect sensor mounted on top of the TV, IT WILL NOT WORK.    When I set it up and turned on the system, the Kinect unit looked up at the ceiling instead of down at the player area.   Calibration-frustration - it only saw the top half of the players during set up. and very blurry. It was registering hips and knees as feet. Kinect ID setup, the avatar's legs kept folding up into really abnormal positions, and it was hard to \\"step on the square\\" indicated. Tried the \\"smiley card\\" calibration. Had to hold the card way up over my head to get it in the target box for one setting, the last setting was so blurry it took 10 minutes for it to recognize the eyes enough to capture it.  So how is this going to improve game play???   Navigating the Kinect Hub with it - the icon you need to hold in place to activate stuff kept flickering or jumping around the screen and took forever to get anywhere with.  Tried it with Kinectimals -- couldn't aim at all for throwing, and had to fling my arms several times just to get it to let go during the throw.. and when it did let go the toys kept hitting the cub in the head.  Difficult to lock in on toys or yes/no buttons to select things.    Don't get me started on the soccer/kicking challenge.. it was a mess, to keep it simple.    The biggest disaster - the training round where the cub follows your cues to do tricks.  Since it was seeing my lower body as feet, or no feet... the cub kept jumping all over the place like he had nerve damage. When I was able to get him into a sit or stand for a moment, and try the signals for barrel roll or flips, he just looked at me like I was insane.  Mind you without the Zoom I can get him to dance, spin, roll, and do most of the other tricks with no problem.  This game was a good test for the Zoom.. the makers of the Zoom should have used the unit with Kinectimals as a quality control test.  I assume that it may work better with games that require less detailed movement but they should be honest about that, and where the unit should be placed before they just put it out there.    I've seen several other reviews on here saying that even with it below the TV, there are the same glitchy control issues for navigating the Kinect hub and basic game menus, even if the games themselves work \\"ok\\".  Major disappointment with this product.  After fighting with it for an hour I've decided it's a lot less annoying to occasionally bump into the couch when I'm playing... and that being stuck in the 1 player zone for all games and taking turns is better than nothing.   I'm glad Amazon is willing to honor the return of this thing for full refund.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Don't look for a technical review of this CD...The one I have has all the tracks on ONE CD which is nice. I bought this because of a song that was playing during the credits for \\"French Kiss\\" with Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan. Then after I played the CD I recognized many songs used in various films including \\"Michael\\" with John Travolta.<br /><br />I'm a knitter and this is just great music to knit by. Relaxing at times and up beat with other songs.<br /><br />I admit I did not realize how talented a musician Van Morrison is and I certainly did not appreciate his talents until I bought this CD. I like it so much I'm buying one for a friend who travels alot and this is great long distance driving music.<br /><br />I highly recommend !

B001OGWY1W|5.0|I thought they really couldn't match Batman Begins.  I am a huge nerd, I mean Batman fan.  Now the ones with Arnold and Halle, those were awful.  I mean, really awful.  The very first one with the penguin was good but very outdated.  But these last two, wow.  The Dark Knight was phenomenal.  Heath, RIP, did an amazing job.  He captured the joker better than I could have ever imagined.  Bale, always good.    My only complaint is Rachel.  She doesn't really seem like \\"the Rachel\\" to me.  Now Katie Holmes was a good Rachel, a believable Rachel.  Simple kind of pretty, yet elegant and strong.  Unfortunatelty, Maggie Gyllenhaal was used in The Dark Knight.  Maybe I just don't like the actress, but she was not at all what I had always envisioned, she's just sort of sad looking (not in a good way).  Other than Ms. Gyllenhaal, the film was excellent.  And I hear it leads well into the next one?  After these last two, I am VERY excited to see!
B003O86FMW|4.0|These are excellent books; I have just finished this one.  I laughed, I cried and at moments I actually had to put the book down and walk away for awhile.  too scared and or nervous to go on  With these books dubbed for young adult I was hesitant; being 55yr old grandma.  I am actually kinda sad about being on the final book and having the adventure end.  Well worth the read.  Enjoy!
B002ZG997C|5.0|I really don't want to ruin anything, but this is a great movie if you are a person of Christian faith.  This is one of the few movies that my mom would actually enjoy, (minus a couple scenes of implied sexual violence, you can't see what is going on, therefore I say implied).  This was a very nice surprise of a film.  Highly recommend.  It has action, actual plot, plenty of surprises, all together very impressed!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First things first: the picture and sound quality for this set are unparalleled.  The improved quality was more noticeable with the original trilogy, but they're all a huge step up from their DVD counterparts.  So how about the films?  THE PHANTOM MENACE  A good space fantasy, but it lacks the charm of the originals.  Part of it is just because everyone's so young in this film; it takes place 33 years before A NEW HOPE, so nothing is too identifiable yet.  The special effects are fantastic, although at times it feels like we're watching a Pixar movie.  The digital characters look real enough, but sometimes they try too hard to draw attention to themselves, and I've noticed that most of the live-action heroes speak in monotone.  The story is also pretty complex, involving the hostile takeover of a planet by a greedy Trade Federation, and resolving the conflict in the Galactic Senate.  Those new to the STAR WARS universe might be a little confused if they start with EPISODE I, because ironically this one contains the most exposition.  Despite its flaws, the action elements make it feel like a STAR WARS film.  The lightsaber duels, the menagerie of alien creatures, the podrace, and the developing relationships of the characters make up for shallow acting and complexity.  The inclusion of the digital Yoda is a nice improvement from the stiff puppet that was originally used, making the character look consistent with the rest of the films.  That being said, as a prequel it's a more sophisticated story than the originals, and it does a nice job of setting up the rest of the saga.  ATTACK OF THE CLONES  A good sequel, finding more common ground with the original trilogy that it's foretelling.  We finally get to see its two primary heroes working beside each other as student and teacher, and we get our first glimpse of the Clone Wars that Ben Kenobi talked about in A NEW HOPE.  Again, the action scenes are first class: everything from the speeder chase on Coruscant, the fight with Jango Fett on Kamino, the asteroid field, and the Coliseum-like battle of Geonosis are true spectacles.  The highlight of the film, of course, is the Yoda/Count Dooku battle toward the end.  The atmospheric, cloudy mood of CLONES is a different pace for the series, but the air of mystery surrounding it makes for a diverse experience.  The one major flaw is the unbalanced romance between Padmé and Anakin, which doesn't feel fleshed out enough.  Padmé genuinely avoids Anakin's advances the entire film, and then suddenly tells him that she's fallen for him.  It's nowhere near as subtle as the Leia/Han romance in EMPIRE, and the dialogue they exchange is laughable.  Aside from that, it's better than MENACE, telling a more gripping story and providing a great set-up for EPISODE III.  REVENGE OF THE SITH  The title crawl says it all: it starts with the word WAR!  Virtually every scene is an eye-opener.  George Lucas tightened the script and created a story that is both engaging and dark, making it the most intense chapter in the saga.  There are tons of battle scenes that further move the story, and the emotional resonance of its performers is near-flawless.  The romance between Anakin and Padmé is still rocky, but where the film really shines are the relationships it explores between Anakin, Obi-Wan and Palpatine.  Ian McDiarmid is cunning in his duel portrayal of a well-meaning chancellor and power-hungry Sith master.  The centerpiece: an epic lightsaber battle that takes place on an erupting volcanic planet.  This was the film STAR WARS fans were eagerly anticipating since the prequel trilogy's inception, and it delivers on all accounts.  A NEW HOPE  Considered a classic by fans and film historians, it tells the tale of a young moisture farmer, Luke Skywalker, who joins the Rebellion in its fight against the Galactic Empire.  Joining forces with a host of loveable characters, Luke rescues Princess Leia from the clutches of Darth Vader and leads an all-out Rebel attack against the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star.  The visual effects have always dazzled audiences, and while many fans see the additional tweaks over the years as major annoyances, they really don't interrupt the flow of a fantastic fantasy tale.  For the Blu-ray release, several changes include a modified krayt dragon call made by Ben Kenobi upon rescuing Luke from the Tusken Raiders; as well as the addition of digital rocks to better hide R2-D2 from the Tuskens' presence.  Neither of these changes detracted from the overall film, and they aren't as noticeable as the major effects overhaul undertaken in its 1997 re-release.  The infamous Han and Greedo confrontation has again been slightly altered, in which Greedo and Han shoot at the same time, restoring the scene to a more appropriate western shootout motif.  Despite the various changes, most of the film is left intact with some astonishing High Definition visuals and an always-stunning soundtrack.  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK  The Rebels continue to evade the Empire across the trenches of space as Luke continues his Jedi training under the tutelage of wizened Jedi Master Yoda.  A romance blossoms between space smuggler Han Solo and the spunky Princess Leia, and Darth Vader reveals a startling secret.  The most important chapter in the STAR WARS saga looks infinitely better in this HD transfer, especially during the battle of Hoth.  The film has remained largely intact from the 2004 DVD version.  Of course, noticeable changes over the years have attempted to bridge EPISODE V with the prequel trilogy.  Hence for the 2004 release, the holographic Emperor was replaced with Ian McDiarmid, and Boba Fett's raspy voice was replaced with actor Temuera Morrison's, making the film more consistent with Boba's origin story.  Again, despite these revisions, the film is always a treat.  RETURN OF THE JEDI  The Emperor oversees the construction of a second Death Star as the Rebels go to the forest moon of Endor to disable its shield and launch an all-scale attack.  Luke faces Vader in an end-all confrontation, while the Rebels befriend a stalwart band of Ewoks.  The film only looks that much better in High Definition, especially given the space battle toward the end.  The major addition to this release is the added line given to Darth Vader at the end of the film, making him sound comparable to the way he did at the end of EPISODE III.  It's debatably a pointless addition, but it doesn't stop the rest of the film from being a true spectacle.  Other minor revisions include CG enhancements to Wicket's eyes (he can now blink), and the addition of a dug in Jabba's palace (the species of Sebulba from EPISODE I).  And yes, Hayden Christensen is still portrayed during the end sequence.  Bottom line: If you really love these movies, there's no reason not to have this set.  The minor additions throughout the series are just that: minor.  If you can get past that, they're still just as loveable as they were upon their initial release.  STAR WARS purists canceling their pre-orders because of a few added lines of dialogue are living in a fantasy world: George Lucas has declared on numerous occasions that he has no interest in releasing his abandoned movies in a clean format.  The individual DVDs, which come packaged with the theatrical films as an added bonus, are as close as you're going to get.  My advice: either dust off your VHS tapes, or find the individual DVDs.  But don't let the little graphical changes be your deciding factor in making a purchase: it's easy to overlook the five minutes of tweaks when you see for yourselves how great these films look.  Now on to the Bonus Features.  This is where true STAR WARS fans might be left out in the cold.  Considering the three extra discs, we really aren't given anything fresh to explore here.  The two archive discs merely contain short interviews regarding the behind-the-scenes of each trilogy, and most of the interviews detail how the art departments conceived the planets.  The deleted scenes are incomplete and at times painful to watch.  Most of the deleted scenes contained on the prequel disc are simply unfinished animatics and are nowhere near as polished as the deleted scenes on the DVD releases.  The third bonus disc is where you'll find all the classic STAR WARS documentaries, as well as 90 minutes of STAR WARS spoofs (namely clips from THAT 70'S SHOW, SNL, and THE SIMPSONS).  The most engaging featurette on this disc is A CONVERSATION WITH THE MASTERS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK 30 YEARS LATER, in which director Irvin Kershner,  George Lucas and composer John Williams discuss the making of that particular film.  The behind-the-scenes documentaries are nice, but THE MAKING OF STAR WARS, which is narrated by C-3PO and intercut with interviews of the cast, comes off as severely cheesy.  And the absence of EMPIRE OF DREAMS is very noticeable.  So buy this release for the films and the films alone.  The bonus content is just that: nothing really that thrilling, but some of it might provide insightful.  The films are the real reason to get this set.  And the force is strong with STAR WARS on Blu-ray.

Gil Shaham plays the Brahms violin concerto with passion and at one with Abbado.However, Itzhak Perlman plays with feeling in the same concerto, conducted by Barenboim in a DVD. Being friends they have a great understanding with each other. There is nothing to choose between Perlman and Shaham.Except the sound is better in this blu ray. The symphony no 9, New world by Dvorak, will not disappoint. As an encore Abbado plays the Verdi overture Les Vepres Siciliennes. The orchestra plays with feeling in this bluray.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille is my favorite writer.  I read everything he puts out and this is the book that got me started.

The books is definitely suspenseful, grabs you and drags you into the story.  I read a lot, but I start more books than I finish, because there are too many good books than to have to push yourself through a bad one.  Fast pace is what I like and DeMille always delivers.

0385534639|3.0|When I first read all the glowing reviews for this book and then its synopsis, I was instantly hooked...on the idea of the book. The reality however, fell flat. I know that having too great expectations for something can ruin it but with all this hype around a new author and story, how could you not get a little excited to read it?<br /><br />Let me start by saying that some of my favorite books are fantasy: Harry Potter, 100 Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Hunger Games. I love a good story that sweeps you up and carries you away into a world you could only ever dream of. I love to get lost in the idea of fantasy and magic. This book is written in my favorite style, magical realism, and in that area it truly lives up to the hype. A maze made out of floating boards and clouds, a room filled with jars made of all different scents meant to transport you into your memories...a ship made of paper and books floating on an ink sea. It all sounds so dreamy and magical, and those moments were the ones i enjoyed the best.<br /><br />The real issue of this book for me was the flatness of the characters, mainly Celia and Marco, who fall in love...half way through the book! The fact that the book is pitched as this tragic love story (which it is) is a little misleading as the romance aspect doesn't come in until well over 100 pages. I had a hard time identifying with Celia and Marco who, one minute don't know each other and then next are madly in love. Their courting is bizzar and short and not heavily romantic (unless you count the settings they take place in. The love story just feels...fake. I hate to bash a book at all, but I was pretty disappointed in this. I felt that the story had SUCH a great potential and yet fell short from it every time I was expecting something more.<br /><br />For all the visual imagery, there is little drama or conflict unless you count the 'rules' of the challenge which are never clearly defined. Yes, Marco and Celia are in some sort of magical competition with each other but you'd think with magic having no limits, there would be more action and there was very little. I found myself skimming through pages (something I HATE doing) just to get a scene over with. There were lots of instances of boring dialogue and too many open ends that never get resolved. The rest of the circus characters were just okay. I enjoyed Poppet and Widget the most, finding their 'powers' the most entertaining of anyone involved in the circus. Surprisingly enough, I also enjoyed the charter of Isobel whom I though the author could have done more of.<br /><br />This story comes from a great idea, which is apparent, but it just doesn't live up to it. I wish the back stories were more detailed and informative and i wish the characters had more life to them. *SPOILER* The idea that Celia gets to travel with the circus and Marco has to stay in London at all times...why? The author never really tells us and the story would have been MUCH more interesting if Marco and Celia were given more chance to interact. The fact that they have very few interactions was disappointing. I wasn't expecting a grand love story, just something that met up with the book's description.<br /><br />Overall, the book is well-written and highly imaginative, which is what allowed me to finish it. But when it was over, i just felt frustrated that it was so heavy with imagery that it did not focus on the plot or the characters as well is it should have.<br /><br />This is a decent book but certainly not (in my opinion) great. It seems to be a book that is highly debatable in terms of opinion. Because of that, If you really want to read it, I absolutely think you should. We all have different tastes. I hope this review was helpful!rt of magical competition with each other but you'd think with magic having no limits, there would be more action and there was very little.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|There's really only one major issue with Unstoppable- that being, it's so fantastic the way it focuses on nonstop, high-speed chase train excitement that it'd be almost impossible for any OTHER film to come along and make a train movie any more action-packed than this.  It's THAT good!  I'm still pretty darn amazed just how much I enjoyed Unstoppable while watching it this afternoon.  I *almost* passed it up too, believing it couldn't be anywhere as good as the description says.  I was totally wrong!  It's exactly what you've been reading about- a train goes out of the control when the driver makes a silly, critical mistake and is forced to jump off the train to correct the problem (while the train is in motion).  Of course he's so out of shape he's unable to get back on the train before it takes off on its own and eventually builds up enough speed to become a serious threat to major populated areas.  Not only that, but the train is carrying dangerous chemicals that threaten the safety of innocent people all over town.    Throughout the film many people try to stop the train but everyone fails hard and heavy.  I'm surprised how much detail was involved pertaining to train knowledge.  The movie writers must have brought in some professionals to make everything seem so believable.    Overall, the action is beyond amazing and continuous, the acting is really intense and defines edge of your seat suspense the way it involves a rookie train driver clashing with the professionals and attempting to make a point that even a rookie can get the job done, and it's just a really spectacular movie overall.  Expect to have a LOT of fun watching this.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I purchased the actual hardcover book about three years ago soon after it came out and there was a lot of buzz going around about it. When I opened it and started reading it, the book started off extremely slow and I could barely make it through the prologue. A year later, I got my first kindle and on a whim, purchased this book for the Kindle thinking maybe I'd give it another shot and not have to lug around a huge book with me wherever I went. Two years since I've finished this book (and I read the other two in the trilogy as well) and I have yet to find a story and characters that have drawn me in as well as the Millennium Trilogy. Lisbeth Salander is one of the most complex characters I've ever come across and she's somewhat unpredictable. While this book does start off slow, and does drag on in some parts, you will not be disappointed by this story by any means. It is too bad Larsson passed away before being able to witness the success of his novels and see how popular they've grown to be. I only wish there was more, but for now I'm stuck rereading and finding new bits of information each time.

B003L77GH4|5.0|I have been a [[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]fan from the first season... from the first episode. But I wait for each episode to start heading off into a direction that is too indepth or unrealistic for me to enjoy anymore. Instead, each season, writers Julie Plec and Kevin Williamson, never fail to keep the episodes real and in touch with - well - reality.<br /><br />The actors who portray their characters - Ian Somerhalder as Damon Salvatore, Nina Dobrev as Elena Gilbert, Paul Wesley as Stefan Salvatore, and Joseph Morgan and Klaus - are absolutely great at what they do. They bring the show to life, and make you believe that this is really what's going on in Mystic Falls, Virgina. They are so indepth that you get to know, not only what is on the surface, but what is in their background, their entire past, they snap, they soften - every situation imaginable for a character's personal growth is portrayed excellently here.<br /><br />This season, it picks up right where the last episode in season 1 left off, and we really learn more about all of the character's backgrounds and the motivations behind multiple characters. We see Damon's character advance and mature, as well as see his true nature (Sorry, I'm a bit biased, he's my favorite character). We learn a whole lot about this Katherine, AKA Katerina Petrova and what a doppleganger is. We learn about Stefan's not-so-innocent past. We see Caroline's character advance, mature, and grow into a stronger, self-sufficent person. And a whole lot more. Each episode is like a grand finale with little room for dull moments.<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of the vampire genre, this is a series that is very genre flexible (unless you very strictly hate fantasy, sci fi, and horror) because it is so realistic, there is something that you can relate to in every character, situation, etc.
B000002KAT|5.0|Good thing this was recorded before Van seized too much control over his records.  Only wild, far-flung jazz guys who had seen it all could help Van materialize this.  Props to the producer.  And, thanks, Van.    If Moondance was the album that Van ultimately wanted to make, Astral Weeks is the album that GOD wanted Van make.
B00151HZME|5.0|Here is your anthem. The best album I've heard that captures the spirit of what it felt like growing up in the 80s. So much so that the memories are palpable.
B005DZMP00|3.0|OK, everyone's heard it...no real surprises there. The sound quality is fair, which is also to be expected. I like the minimalist approach to most things, but the packaging for this CD is \\"Uninspired\\" to say the least. First of all, the case is a cardboard tri-fold, so no trees were spared there, but when I opened it up to see completely blank white cardboard...no pics of the groovy time across the pond, no liner notes, nothing! Oh yeah, the track info on the outside back of the cover is printed upside-down to boot. Now maybe this is a bit of trippy fun, but I really don't think so. On top of all of that, the very thin (and inexspensive) cardboard case proceeded to tear as I removed the plastic shrink wrap and destroy one of the two cool things about the packaging...the cover art of the Ice Cream Kid. Well at least the chopper is in tact! This is one Deadhead that feels kinda duped.

B0028T6XXY|5.0|What more can I say about Michael Buble. He brings so much energy to his music and the DVD gives some nice insight into MB as a person. I would like to see DVDs of some of his complete concerts. They would be a hit.

B00021HBGS|5.0|This is a great tub toy, and educational also. My 2 /12 yr old grandson can't get enough of arranging and rearranging the assorted vehicles, road signs, etc. I was thrilled that he recognized so many of the vehicles, and was eager to learn the others and what their roles were. He also enjoys putting them away in the great little mesh bag that sticks on the shower wall. I will be ordering another set, as they come in other themes.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Katie has some real good songs for older folks not so good for the kids today unless you like your kids hearing some bad words.
157421327X|3.0|It's just a book of patterns, not too much instruction .  Frankly, I was disappointed and regret my  purchase.  Go for another author.
B001CU1RRM|5.0|All the song from the past and the present.  Good quality.  Three disc set.  Some of the best Michael Jackson.
0375826742|1.0|I have nothing more to add in with the other one and two star reviews: see them for examples of poor writing, pacing, a lack of overall vision for the series, and stab-a-fork-in-my-eye painful dialogue.  The only noteworthy achivement from this book is that it failed to even meet the dismally low standards set by the previous two in the series.
161524350X|5.0|This was a great book!  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It looks even better when you have it.  I bought it for my daughter as part of her classics collection.  She loves to read and collects books for her library.  She fell in love.  You won't be disappointed.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Where \\"Water for Elephants\\" meets \\"Harry Potter\\" It has the magic and mystery of Harry Potter, with the love story and circus theme of Water for Elephants.  I couldnt stop reading. I felt part of the circus. I fell in love with characters and the atmosphere. I recommend this book to everyone.    I wish it didnt end...
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Say it up front -- Midnight in Paris is a trifle.  But what a trifle! A short list of its pleasures would include: 1) the opening montage with loving shots of Paris that recalls Manhattan and its Rhapsody in Blue accompaniment, 2) Owen Wilson as Woody's doppelganger, delivering one-liners and pained or bemused looks like the master, 3) Kathy Bates playing Gertrude Stein. Like Tilda Swinton and Helen Mirren, the woman graces everything she does, 4) Adrien Brody doing an over-the-top Salvador Dali (wait, how can you be over-the-top of an original over-the top?), 5) genial time travel if you stand in the right place at the right time (hint for the time: check the title), 5) the gentle lesson that every golden age has its own imagined golden age.  What's ours now -- the Reagan years??  Sheesh.
B004ZQRFGM|3.0|Having been a fan of Ana's for some time now, I looked forward to her latest release. This one was a disappointment. Her guitar playing is still good, but there are many artists who outperform her. Her vocals on this CD are definitely subpar. The cover art is probably the most appealing part of the CD.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Fun, no technical issues on a Samsung Galaxy S 3G. Tapping the correct web can be a challenge at time, especially for those with large fingers.
1565115147|4.0|The book makes some great associations and explains things in fairly simple terms. The discovery of countries and their timing with the evolution of the peoples discovered coincides nicely with the theories of why roles aren't reversed. It's a thought provoking book but at the same time there were plenty of occasions I couldn't help but zone out.<br /><br />The narrator was great at inflection to keep things interesting without sounding corny or weird. He read smoothly and I actually enjoyed hearing the pages turn in the background.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this book to interested parties whom I know are avid readers.
B00000IZOR|4.0|I just had to get this for my daughter. I had one and so did my husband. This is a must. My daughter loves playing with this phone and pulling it everywhere.
B0031RG846|5.0|Very durable for my five year old to play with... nice detail and a good size... would recommend it to friends.
0316098329|4.0|With all of the medias attention on the REAL LIFE capitivity of JayCee Dugard, this fictional book was difficult to put down. The story is told through the eyes of 5 year old Jack who lives his entire life in a ROOM. I would love for this book to made into a movie. Very well written!
B00322PKBW|3.0|Love how this watch is water proof, easy to read and a good color.  The strap is a somewhat hard plastic so it has cracked and is about to break soon.  It is less than a year old.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|It blows my mind how many people can consider themselves Opeth fans, and yet they continually bash this release by saying &quot;It's not their style&quot;. Well, for one, there is no 'they'. In the documentary, I believe Akerfeldt said there was only one song that wasn't ENTIRELY written by him... but that goes for almost every one of their albums. Without a doubt, Opeth IS Mike's band. It always has been and always will be. Now for the music...<br /><br />I'm going to make this short and sweet. It is a VERY experimental album... More so than every other Opeth album, which came as a shock to me. But the more I listened, the more I began to appreciate the musical ingeniousness behind it. It has a classic prog vibe mixed with the 'traditional Opeth vibe' (whatever that may be). In layman's term... you won't like this album if you were 'hoping for another Opeth album'. But if you're a true music fan, as I am, it is quite possibly one of the most rewarding albums to listen to and fully comprehend.<br /><br />You either love it or hate it... So take it or leave it. Akerfeldt has made clear on many occasions that he doesn't give a crap whether the fans like it or not, he makes music that HE wants to listen to. As selfish as that sounds, most of the brilliant minds in the history of music were the same way.
0696204800|5.0|review by wife: this is a really good book to add to your collection if your a quilter. You will find so many interesting paetterns from easy to harder ones. You also will get Applique patterns. This book has a wide varried of usefull patterns.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|A lot of time a lack of chemistry between the main characters in a romcom will leave a movie down, they just aren't believable in their roles and can seem wooden and stiff, however Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis change this trend as it's their on screen chemistry that makes this movie what it is, very enjoyable.  The main synopsis of the movie is that both Timberlake and Kunis are unlucky in love and Timberlake moves from L.A to New York where Kunis lands him a job at GQ, the two quickly become good friends. The movie is fast paced and both Kunis and Timberlake are perfect for their roles, there is plenty of laughs a long the way and features a strong supporting cast. Woody Harrelson is Hilarious in his role as Tommy, the head sports writer for GQ who happens to be gay and is convinced that Timberlake is also gay. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis hippy loving mother who can't recall what nationality Kunis dad is. Richard Jenkins plays Timberlake's dad who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Emma Stone(who could probably have done a good job playing Kunis role if chosen) has a very small role as Timberlakes girlfriend who happens to be obsessed with John Mayer!  While the movie never strays too far from the usual romcom rules it is a funny movie that is well held together by it's lead characters.
B004G25V9S|3.0|Lots of divided opinion here, and deservingly so. My two cents..  Like Metallica (up to and through \\"Master of Puppets\\"), Opeth basically created its own genre of metal - redefining the rules and spawning countless imitators.  However, like the mighty Met, Opeth took its trademark sound to its logical conclusion. How can you continue to top every album prior with the same basic formula?  So, like Hetfield and Company with \\"Justice\\", Opeth decides to make a more progressively-leaned album, with more complex parts and less aggression - dividing its loyal fanbase.  It will be interesting to see if Opeth follows this album up with a full-on return to melodic metal, as Metallica did by following up \\"Justice\\" with the more streamlined and accessible \\"Black ALbum\\".
B004USRKX8|5.0|This album brings me back to when music was full of talent! Just a wonderful,wonderful CD to replace my album full of scratches.
B005FJ7EIC|5.0|Like many of the reviews stated, I was not expecting much from this movie either. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I have given up on American horror, but this movie was good. I do not know if it was worth the 5 stars I gave it, but I wanted to buffer any negative reviews this movie recieved.  This is because if anybody enjoys horror, they should watch this movie. It could be called good in several genres including post apocalytic, vampire, zombie, and road movie.  The acting, cinema qaulity, effects, and score are above par, especially for a movie I never heard about. I do not know why this movie was not released and promoted widely for the theaters because it could have really created a buzz.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie is as satisfying to the eye as to the funny bone.  The story is well written and easy to follow, but the colors are what will blow you away!!!  If you are lucky enough to have a 3D TV, you are twice blessed!
B0051T46XM|2.0|This movie is pretty boring. First of all it's all subtitled, the effects are decent....some of the trolls look awesome while some look pretty ridiculous. The acting is pretty flat. Too much time is spent explaining the troll situation instead of kicking troll ass.  2/5
B000002LCU|4.0|This review is for the original 1990 CD release - not the remaster. I recently purchased this used, being one of my favorite solo Beatle records from the 80's - the songwriting & Jeff Lynne production are really a great fit but if you want this album now, you really need to get the 2004 remaster because this 1990 version is very light on the low frequencies. I can't imagine how such poor mastering was allowed to be released.

B0048LPRCS|4.0|Gaspar Noe's intoxicating odyssey through the hollowness until reaching the antipodes of the otherness of being, a journey that multdimensional operates on several levels.<br /><br />The primary memory in which the two brothers kept the heinous faithful memory of his parents died in that fatal accident.<br /><br />Memory beyond the life: after Oscar (a drug dealer) is killed in a bathroom. He established a covenant with his blood sister, where I swear I will never leave her. Thus the spectral ghost wanders from the second half of the film, always taking care of his brother and visiting all the places he frequented in life.<br /><br />Chemical memory; where once the doors of perception are overthrown by the influence of drugs.<br /><br />Memory decay: a thunderous and insmone journey through the Tokyo night, drawing back curtains ls beyond the neon.<br /><br />Fetal memory: The film ends a regression to the antipodes to culminate with the primal scream.<br /><br />Where silence cryptic images than to words. It is not an easy film to watch. I can not give it five stars because I find it overly long and at times possessed of a kind of baroque visual exaggeration.<br /><br />However it would be ignoble to ignore its overwhelming impact and inquisitor that shakes the whole range of moods of the viewer.<br /><br />I must find a place to hide, a place for me to hide...

B00004XPPC|5.0|these days it is hard to justifiy the price of a movie ticket, expecially when the movies are made by a computer. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of the hollywood greats back when they made real movies. enjoy.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|With this wonderful staging, I must admit that Terence Malik surpassed all previous expectations. A leisurely-paced film, meditative character, deeply introspective, imbued with a poetic image like few films in the past.<br /><br />One feels the influence of Andei Tarkovsky (Sacrifice) over this radiant visual spectacle, where the words are secondary, the images spanning a character within magnificence of nature pastoral, that literally captivates and mesmerizes.<br /><br />When a middle class family suffers the terrible misfortune of the death of a child, the film as it were, through the resource implodes. An ellipsis narrative, we witnessed yesterday and now as a warp. The stage of childhood, the dream Unamuno, the primary concerns at the image of an authoritarian father, the silent complicity of silence and a mother who supports her children's antics.<br /><br />Malick uses large symphonic pieces of eloquent expression, to delineate the tapestry of existence, full of deep spirituality, such as suggestive of the autumn carat Fourth Symphony of Johannes Brahms, the renowned The Moldau by Smetana, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor Bach, the Pictures at an exhibition of Mussorgsky and a section of a sonata Mozartiana.<br /><br />Rightly, the film in Cannes swept quite rightly receiving the Palme d'Or for best film. I just hope that this film received a similar responsiveness on this side of the Atlantic, although I have my serious doubts.<br /><br />A legitimate masterpiece and unquestionably one of the ten films of the year.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Man... I did it again.  I bought these versions and I did it willingly.  I feel like I just bought snake oil off the truck.  Look great, sound great, lame changes still bum me out.

B005974C94|4.0|This is a very good compilation of jazz and blues covers. The one exception  being yet another version of Layla, which may be my least favorite track.   The band is solid, Clapton and Marsalis sound like they are having a ball.  This is not the Bluesbreakers nor the Dominoes nor Cream.  If you like New Orleans flavored blues with some Clapton guitar propelling it along, you will enjoy this music.

0553801473|2.0|I mean really, do we need an explicit sex scene or reference every other chapter?  George's writing has deteriorated to a bizarre medieval sex fantasy.  There is more carnal knowledge in the work than in his entire forst several books combined!  The story line takes place concurrently with the previous work.  We trace Tyrion at first through the expanded eastern lands on a journey to connect with the Dragon Queen.  After several bizarre hand offs, we are left to find him playing a stooge in front of the conquered city of Meereen.  The chapters are tightly written and the internal dialogue of characters is solid.  Theon Greyjoy, Jon Snow and Tyrion are particulalry well fleshed out.  The problem is that Martin seems to turn to extreme profanity, sexual predation and abusive circumstances in his scenes.  This becomes almost ridiculous throughout the book.  A perfect example is the scene in which Ramsay Bolton confronts his new bride in the presnce of the captured and beaten Greyjoy.  Suffice to say that the descriptive natur eof that scene is wholly unnecessary to the plot, establishing Greyjoy's subservience, Jeyne's victimization or the sheer insanity of Bolton.  I am certain this is Mrtin's way of getting the next miniseries installment onto the Playboy channel instead of HBO.

1451629184|3.0|Wow, Ms. Dugard is so very brave to relive her agony to write this book.  It was very difficult for me to get through the beginning as it was very graphic in describing the cruelty and brutality she endured. I have two daughters around the age Jaycee was when she was abducted so it was especially hard for me to read.  After that, she describes the birth of her two daughters and the absolute craziness of her captors.  I didn't give it more stars because it was very disturbing (not Ms. Dugard's fault of course) and the author is not a particularly good writer (again not her fault, she was abducted while she was finishing up 5th grader). I loved the author's reasons for writing this book: because she doesn't have to keep her captor's secrets anymore.
B000WTBMBK|1.0|Alvin and the Chipmunks purportedly broke up in the mid-90s due to \\"creative differences.\\" However, they never truly went away. Alvin and Theodore started shooting heroin and making truly horrible music which could be deemed emo-techno (known amongst hipsters as \\"techmo\\"). With Simon long gone, they began releasing music under the moniker Burial. Maybe they did this not to sully their reputation as creative and energetic musicians. In any case, their second album Untrue (which is exactly the same album as their eponymous debut, but with a different cover), captures a very dark and bland era in their careers.<br /><br />There are rumors that Burial is some British guy, and not actually the Chipmunks, but listen to any track and you will know this is the real deal.<br /><br />A very sad and pathetic album, and any proceeds from its sales will likely end up in the veins of two desperate and lonely rodents who need rehab more than they need a record deal.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|This album is alright, very R&B, dancey, sounds like most music out there which is not for me. I understand and respect that she wanted something new and have a different sound, but i loved her rock/pop sound like her 2 previous albums. Only songs i enjoy alot on this album would have to be skyscraper and lightweight.

I bought this book based on the reviews and I am very disapointed.  I never read anyhing like it and I hope I never will again. By now I am one third into the book and the story is very slow to develop and not very interesting.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|The fruits of their labor have most certainly paid off. Being able to pinpoint and have been directed towards musicians I would've never been exposed to, Opeth treat us with another darkly enriching album. Most notably on track 5, (Nepenthe) the solo section is very Holdsworth/Gambale-esque with fluid legato phrasing. It breaths and takes its time without feeling forced or contrive. It is very difficult for us as musicians to hold back and allow the piece to command both ebb and flow. The overall feel is strangely organic and very vintage sounding with semi-hollow guitars and perhaps old amplifiers with not a whole lot of gain. Either that, or they rolled the gain back. Bands like Witchcraft, Graveyard, and Ghost which all have similar sound scape designs, Opeth nurture the dark and cradle it coolly expanding an ever-widening palette of tonal color. I love Mendez's lyrical bottom end thump and circumstance throughout. Not since Marduk's B. War enthralled us with his throaty bass punch have we been treated with front end dynamics in an otherwise drowned out hum. The bonus dvd was a bit of a let down. I feel Mikael didn't need to explicate his vision so widely. Keeping it a mystery would've been just fine. Plus, I missed the guitar parts being played in the studio like in their previous albums. Anywho, it is justly so, that I feel this album will breath new life for other bands to explore different paths. Who knows, maybe Yngwie will release an album with no solos;-  Wait, I take that back. Happy listening.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|The best album she's ever had! She has out done herself vocally and lyrically. I highly recommend! It has a little something for everyone no matter if your looking for some dance music or something to connect to it's here!
B002UJIY7A|5.0|This movie reminds me back in the 90s when I watched NATURAL BORN KILLERS. The difference is that this one is not as ruthless. But there are some elements from KILLERS on here!!!<br /><br />This is a movie about 2 newly weds(air heads) and 2 more couples(tough ones) that are the CORE of the story. The whole movie is based on murders that have taken place in an island of Hawaii.<br /><br />I usually tell what the movie is all about in my reviews but on this one, out of 3 couples, the one that you will think the least, is the one killing people. That I thought was an interesting twist and it was brilliant. I was very surprised by the way all the details unveil before you towards the end.<br /><br />If you are looking for a THRILLER movie with a killer twist. This is the one to shoot for!!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|very nice app and works as stated. it has worked exactly as I expected and has very nice interface. definitely a must have.
B005LAZIRY|4.0|Okay, so blah blah blah... this is not the Opeth we are used to. So what? Do any of you hardcore metal geeks remember a little album called Damnation? Opeth has done this before. Certainly Damnation was a stronger album than this one, but Heritage is a quality Opeth album which, while not their very best work, belongs in their catalogue. Honestly I went to their show in Hartford on the 20th and it was fantastic, even though they only played their milder stuff and Mikael didn't do any songs with the death metal growls. Mikael is the Mozart of heavy metal; they could have played \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" and it would have sounded good. Seeing him perform four of the songs from the new album helped me appreciate Heritage a bit more and actually made me revisit other songs (such as Porcelain Heart) that I used to skip over.  Another thing I've been hearing is that this should have been an Akerfeldt solo project because it's all about him. How is that any different than the previous nine albums? Mikael has always been the driving force behind Opeth and this is no different. Give the guy a frigging mulligan if you don't like this album. Guess what metalheads.... EVERY BAND releases an album that you don't like if they stick around long enough. Black Sabbath released Technical Ecstasy, Iron Maiden released three crappy albums on a row at least (starting with Fear of the Dark), Pantera released Reinventing the Steel, etc. Either Mikael keeps the sound the same and risks pissing a few people off and he stays with the formula and ends up sounding repetitive like the last five albums Slayer has put out. What do you prefer?  If you rate this album less than three stars you're just being bitter. The guys' chops are as good as ever (especially Axe, who finally seems to have found a little soul in his drumming). There's some keepers like Slither, Famine, and I Feel the Dark. Overall a solid album. If you don't like it try going to see them live and you'll change your mind.

He does have one wish, that can only come true with his passing. A wonderful story that will make you both laugh and cry, it will make you angry at times and yet hopeful in human character...and a dogs relationship with his human family. A story of love and devotion....never giving up. I highly recommend this story and it is really a must read for dog lovers like myself.
B005MMYCY6|2.0|Not sure what others saw in this film. Pretty depressing, not realistic and I hated the Hesher character. Save your money and rent something more uplifting like the new Xman movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A friend with a houseful of teens/young adults frequently praised this book - I had to see what the fuss was about.<br /><br />Downloaded a sample onto my Kindle and read the first couple of paragraphs and bought the trilogy.<br /><br />I lost many hours of sleep due to this book and was glad I could go straight on to the next two books.<br /><br />At the end of the book though, and knowing there are two more to come, you wonder exactly what further is going to happen to Katniss and Peeta.
B004G25V9S|2.0|I am a VERY long time Opeth fan and am not impressed at all with this album.  I am not a huge death metal fan so I am not married to the growling vocals of typical Opeth releases and its omission is not the reason for me disliking this album.  I still love Damnation and listen to it frequently.  Here are my reasons for not enjoying this release:  One of the worst album covers from a good band that I have seen in some time.  The heads on the tree are really bad and remind me of the terrible Creed Weathered album cover.   I find this album to be predictable, boring, and cliched.  The God Is Dead lyric that is spread throughout Devil's Orchard is like fingernails down a chalk board. It is so cliched and breaks up an otherwise pretty good song.  The flutes have been done before and come across as a poor mans attempt at Jethro Tull.  I would stay away from flutes in a progressive rock setting because it is such a trademark thing that has already been done.  There are many waste minutes and near silence parts to these songs that do not serve to build anticipation or suspense and really are just a waste of the listeners time.  I feel that most of the songs never really go anywhere.  There are some decent moments on this album but the boring and cliched parts squash them to make for a not enjoyable listen for me.  I am not against Opeth continuing down this musical road but would appreciate a little more originality and creativity.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I note there has been some criticism of the pace of the second novel in this trilogy and some frustration over Katniss's inability to make a choice between Gale and Peeta. Although not much is said about her state of mind after surviving The Hunger Games, it would seem that Katniss is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, and hardly surprising after what she went through. Add to that the stress of the threat from the \\"government\\" and it's hardly surprising that she vacillates as she does.<br /><br />*Spoiler* I was devastated when she and Peeta had to go into the arena for another round of Hunger Games, but also fascinated to see how Suzanne Collins was going to keep them going into the final book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Tons of levels...really makes you think. Really loving the challenge that the game brings! Well worth the low cost. Definitely recommend!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I felt, when I finished this book, and therefore the trilogy, that I had been immersed in a devouring darkness for too long. It may have been that I should have read something else in between the three books.<br /><br />I also recognise that sci-fi isn't my favourite genre and there was more of the futuristic inventions in this than in the two earlier books which did not appeal to me.<br /><br />It is a thought provoking ending to the trilogy and a gripping as the other two books, but reading them one after the other is heavy going.
B0048EANPQ|5.0|Sandra Bullock nails it. Hard to tell her apart from the real person. Great trues story about a family and their adopted son, and real man of character.
B0010KX8F8|5.0|The book arrived timely and was in decent condition for pre-owned.  And I also enjoyed the little personal note about the previous owner; book lovers know there are stories not just within, but about the books themselves!!!  Thanks :-)
B005HEDJ02|5.0|Now that I've watched a majority of these \\"Re-mastered\\" episodes I want to comment on what a good job they did with the re-mastering.  The new special effect cut scenes and models integrate beautifully into the original content.  You barely notice that something is different, which means it's in perfect balance.  The cut scenes of the enterprise in space are there to add to the story line and transport you to that far off place, not a \\"wow\\" factor, and they work marvelously.  Kudos to the special effects artists and editors that made this happen.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This CD will grab you from the first notes of the first cut and it never lets go.  Their fresh approach to what will strike everyone as familiar yet new is edge of your seat stuff.  Looking forward to more of the Black Keys for years to come.....
B001DPHDCY|5.0|No joke, I got a better product than what I actually thought I would get. I bought a \\"like new\\" DVD for my son for Christmas, thinking it would be opened, but at least no scratches on the surface of the DVD. Well, to my surprise, the original packaging wasn't even opened. Yay! Thanks!
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I got this for our Baby Jogger City Select. It works great as long as we aren't using the car seat adapter. There is enough room for my drink and son's sippy cup, my keys, wallet and cell phone.
B000O599WG|5.0|John Wayne is always good, so no review about his performance. I know they put Ricky Nelson in to attract young fans to the box office and (thus) increase box office takings. However, the song he duets with Dean Martin (with Nelson on guitar)DISPLAYS WHAT A GREAT SINGER dEAN mARTIN IS. rICKY nELSON WAS ONLY 18 AT THE TIME OF FILMING. hE ACTS AS IF HE CAN'T ACT - AND IN THIS MOVIE, HE CAN'T.Even though Angie Dickinson was 27, she does not act that well , but I think she was given bad lines. Walter Brennan plays the best role in his career. Having seen him play a 'bad guy' in another western, it made me realise what a good actor he is. He steals the movie from John Wayne - and Wayne lets him (or, maybe, Howard Hawkes does). There are some expected good one-liners from Wayne. Walter Brennan's best line is the character he plays. I think I will add \\"Jumpin' Jehosophat!\\" to my expressions when I want to swear, but can't. Wayne's most famous line is \\"Sorry don't get it done, Dude\\". A quote that can be misinterpreted unless seen in context. Yet, Wayne's most John Wayne line is: \\"We'll remember you said that\\" - to a saloon customer who tells Wayne, \\"We ain't seen no one come in here\\" - when Wayne (the Sheriff) is searching for a murder 'suspect'. This is one John Wayne movie where Hank Worden is not missed. Wayne's middle-aged Union army Colonel/sheriff/land owner, etc. character didn't start with this movie, but with \\"The Horse Soldiers\\", I think in 1954. This era was John Wayne at the height of his career. So, if you know any people who say John Wayne can't act and/or they hate westerns, add this to the list of movies to show them to make them change their mind(s).
B00486070K|4.0|its a really good product. no problems or anything like that, plug it and thats it. nice product. you should buy it.
0060930349|5.0|Sweeping story of America.  Love a book like this that gives you just enough meat/detail to make it interesting but not so much that you get lost in the detail.  Really a great book and enjoyed it a lot.  Gives you a real understanding of how the US shaped up to form what we have today.  I always had a lot of questions about how the country ended up the way it did and how historical events \\"fit\\".  This book gives you the picture of how it formed up including movement west, formation of states, our relationships to other countries, wars, migration of people, slavery, I think every President, etc.  Really a great book and I am going to go back and read it again.  Also, thinking of offering my young kids a prize if they read it and retain the info.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have seen each Star Wars movie in the theater when it first came out, and have enjoyed them all tremendously. So now here they are on Blu-Ray, looking and sounding better than ever before.    Part of the fun (for me) is that with each release in each new medium, Lucas et al. continue tinkering with (and, IMO, improving--for the most part, anyway) the movies, allowing me and mine to enjoy these movies--which I've seen way too many times--with new eyes. So for the interested fellow customer, here's a list of changes (for as far as I've been able to spot them) that have been introduced compared to the previous DVD releases. This list is undoubtedly incomplete, so feel free to notify me of omissions or errors.  The Phantom Menace.   - Puppet Yoda has been replaced with a digital Yoda which better resembles the Yoda in the other movies.   - Most of the movie's shots, except some at the beginning, have a slightly wider framing. Looks gorgeous.   - new effect when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan speed away from the destroyer droids.   - the shot where the Neimoidians are watching Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan on their viewscreen is now a wider shot, clarifying that it is, indeed, a viewscreen.   - In Palpatine's office, his collar no longer changes color between shots.   - The hand of the two-headed podrace announcer has been fixed.   - \\"Vote now! Vote now!\\" in the Senate has been turned down in the audio mix, and various cries in other languages have been added.   Attack of the Clones.   - the scene where Anakin and Obi-Wan fly through the power couplings has been edited slightly differently, as has the ending of the Yoda/Dooku fight when Dooku escapes.  - the Kamino scenes now look less bright and have a greenish tint over them.   - The scene where Anakin has a nightmare about his mother now has added audio of his mother crying \\"Anakin! Help me!\\", by actress Pernilla August. (Sounds OK, but it does take away a bit from the Oedipal subtext that I assumed this scene was supposed to convey. Though maybe that's why they added it in the first place.)  Revenge of the Sith.   - The rooftop of the dwelling from which Yoda watches the Kashyyyk beach battle now has moss growing over it, making it look more organic.   - The transition to Anakin on Mustafar is now a wipe again, as it was in the theatrical version.   A New Hope.   - The audio issues that plagued the DVD have largely been fixed or reduced. For instance, the noticeable jumps in audio quality during the Leia/Tarkin dialogue have been fixed. Some issues remain, though--perhaps those things can't be fixed.   - Lightsaber colors have, in a number of shots, been fixed. In a number of other shots (e.g., on the Falcon), they haven't... which could be intentional on the part of Lucas et al.   - The hatch of the escape pod is now grey rather than blue ... Except in the scene where the stormtroopers find it. Go figure.   - Aunt Beru now says \\"Tell your uncle\\" instead of \\"Tell uncle\\".   - Digital rocks have been added over R2-D2 when he's hiding from the Sand People.   - Obi-Wan's cry when scaring away the Sand People is different again--and more prominent in the sound mix.   - The Han/Greedo shootout is edited tighter.   - During the Death Star escape, a laser blast from the Falcon no longer appears mid-air.   - The \\"humdinger glitch\\" has been fixed.   - When Luke climbs out of his X-Wing at the end, he now yells \\"Hey!\\" to Leia, instead of \\"Hey ya!\\" (or \\"Carry!\\").   The Empire Strikes Back.   - The Wampa snowmonster's arm has been fixed. In previous versions, you could see the operating pole in the lower left corner of the screen.   - Added reflection to the window in Cloud City through which we see Leia pacing.   - Sparks have been added to the fireplace where Chewbacca finds C-3PO, and its color has changed.   Return of the Jedi.   - The gate to Jabba's palace is now much larger.   - Slightly altered effects when the Carbonite melts away from Han.   - A dug (i.e., a member of Sebulba's species) has been added to Jabba's palace.   - A new shot of Han accidentally hitting Boba Fett's jetpack has been added.   - The Ewoks now have eyes that blink.   - When R2 goes haywire after being shot, several effects have been added. (Others have been removed--he doesn't \\"urinate\\" any more).   - Light saber colors have been corrected.   - The amorphous animated black spots on the sides of Palpatine's face (presumably to hide the makeup rubbing off on the costume) have been corrected.  - Darth Vader now goes \\"No ... noo!!\\" when he sees Luke being tortured by Palpatine.   That's it, as far as I can tell; apart from these changes and the improved A/V quality, the movies are similar as they appeared on DVD. That is, \\"Jedi Rocks\\" still sucks (though to be fair, so did \\"Lapti Nek\\"), as does the shot of the Executor crashing into the Death Star. Jar Jar still annoys in most of the scenes he's in (though I've mostly come to accept him)... And we still don't know why Han never bothered to pay off Jabba in the three years between \\"A New Hope\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", why the rebels didn't use that ion cannon on the Imperial walkers, why Luke didn't bring down the remaining Imperial walkers by just climbing up to them and throwing a bomb into them, why the Empire's initial attack plan was aerial bombardment, why Luke needed to be \\"frozen\\" for his journey to the Emperor, why Vader didn't keep an eye on Jabba's place waiting for Luke to appear, and so on, and so forth .... but, maybe those issues will be fixed in a later edition.   (Just kidding, obviously.)  As a side note, the documentaries are very informative. I found it surprising just how much of the prequel trilogy was done with models, and how much greenscreen was used in the original trilogy.
B0012GMVDK|3.0|I heard one of the tracts in a class on mediation and thought I would try the entire CD.  Leonard Cohen is an acquired taste.  I am in the early stages of this process.  Much of his work sounds the same to my novice ear, a man in a raspy voice talking poetry. Its also pretty dark.  Not like your mother making you eat liver because its good for you,...maybe more like when you first learned to drink coffee black.  Many \\"adults\\" I respect are wild about this artist so I have faith that his style is something I will appreciate if only on a very limited occasional basis.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|Now this was really, really cute. I did love this movie and I own this because I will watch this many times. Diane Lane---great actress.
1439170916|4.0|This book provides a very broad spectrum of information on history, politics, science of cancer and written in a very effective way of teaching that can help non professionals with gaining basic knowledge about the history and current status and future of cancer research, treatment, policies and activism (oh, also the whole business side of research/FDA/pharmaceutical companies in our complicated modern society).  The author keeps the book interesting and fun by mixing technical, (sometimes challenging medical/scientific) concepts with human stories of scientists and patients--their tenacity and perseverance, serendipitous findings and their ability to convert them into meaningful discoveries, philosophical understandings on living in the moment as well as accepting the unknown through the experiences of cautious triumphs and persevering sufferings. It is also obvious in his writing that this author loves and is erudite in classical literature which makes reading even more enjoyable.  There are so many lessons to learn from this book, the most important lesson I got from this book is that cancer, obviously is everybody's business, and that nothing is insignificant in research as the history teaches us about the potentials of one little discovery leading to something monumental, and the importance of collective effort in saving lives in general.  This is not an easy book, definitely requires note taking and active learning, but absolutely readable and very very helpful in enhancing our understanding of this disease.
B000002AS1|5.0|Forrest Gump's soundtrack quickly became one of the favored soundtrack of its time and has remained on the top of the charts for many people.  At the end of the second disc, there is a suite that is offered.  Upon that encouragement, one of my friends bought this CD and sent me a copy.  I loved it and decided to buy it, too.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I really enjoy every aspect of this movie, but the music is up there with the script.  Both the soundtrack and score are must haves, in my opinion, for any Gump fan.  It's wonderful Sunday music, or for a nice drive through the country.  I also listen to it whenever I need to calm down.  It's very soothing and still wistful at times.  I was so very pleased with this purchase.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I bought this CD specifically because I wanted the song \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" but discovered there were a few other songs on it that I liked as well. I'm a huge fan of Michael Bubles and pretty much have liked everything he has done.  I would recommend this CD.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The movies themselves are awesome. The way they did the bonus features is a HUGE let down. You start off being warned that they used the most current blueray disc technology. If your system isn't current then it wont work right. Well I do have the most recent release and things are till borked! There are a million menus to flip through and each time it takes forever for the new menu to come up. There are menus buried within menus buried within menus. By the time you get to the feature you want to look at there's more menus. There's no play all just more menu items to chose what to play. THIS IS A MAJOR PAIN IN THE TOUKUS! Once you make your way through this maze to watch 30 seconds of  let down.... you now get to proceed back through all the previous menus to get back to chose another path of mazes. You can try and use the top menu feature... when I tried the whole thing froze up. After getting so frustrated I wanted to burn the whole set, I went and saw if Sony had an update I missed...  but there's not. I basically wasted 100$ on this set. I had all the movies but looked forward to the special features in this set.... Live and learn I guess!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This mixer works perfect for what I need and barely takes up any desk space. I went from having a 12 channel Mackie to this and I don't miss any of the extra channels wasting space on my desk. I have computer audio, AJA kona audio for editing, a DVD player and iPod aux in.
0061801313|5.0|the books looked good. There was no scratches or anything and it came in the mail fast. I would use use this person again if I had 2.
B00338QENI|3.0|Fascinating from a scientific perspective. The repercussions of obtaining just a few cells was tremendous, and its impact on the world has been huge, though the story of their origin not very well-known. I found that the storyline of what happened to the family was drawn out and didn't terribly interest me, though it was very sad.
0393327345|5.0|This book is one of the best books ive read in a long time. A must have for any collection.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|my fav game and its not compatible with the mototola droid that really stinks please fix this problem thank you i think
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Good game, good graphics, lots of challenging levels. Hints are limited to once per day, so it really makes you think and plan your moves. Worthy game to get.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|great movie, more of a documentry regarding the financial sector and the greed that has led us to our current predicament not really one for the kids but great for young adults or anyone interested in why and how we got here and the reasons behind it.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I almost didn't buy this because I had heard the content was about a man that manufactures meth, but I realized that these people support their belief system and we should understand how everyone makes their decisions. This was a remarkable ride that shows the difficulties of a person that has enough emotional disabilities to be driven to manufacture meth. Acting and story line are out of sight.  Everyone should watch to learn about their fellow man and woman.
B005HSL626|5.0|it's a really simple game: slice fruit by flicking your finger across the screen while avoiding bombs and seeing how long you can do this for before missing 3 or hitting a bomb. This is the type of game a person like me ends up spending hours on and stop being social.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the best version I've ever watched. I think I have watched it more than 20 times. I love the book when I was about 12 years old. I love TD as Mr Rochester. I love his voice (so sexy), his eyes. Can't imagine anybody else playing that role.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I'm not good with words, but I have always enjoyed Tony Bennett's tunes. Duets II is no different.   == 5 stars for this ==  Now, the disc itself, is bundled with Sony's autorun software. Call me whatever you want, but I prefer a music CD to be a music CD. With the history of Sony installing \\"rootkit\\" on the computer in the past, I don't think I will trust Sony CDs in my computer again.  From a quick test, software bundled in this disc doesn't appear to be installing anything permanently on your computer. But the program appears to generate a unique code and pass it along to Sony if you click on the program.  Heck, I can't even read privacy policy without going on-line, and that code transmitted to Sony.  == 1 star for this ==  I've been trying to avoid purchasing music from these guys for a while. If it wasn't released as Tony's birthday album, I wouldn't have purchased it.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|Great movie, looks great in our player with our 37\\" lcd tv. couldn't be happier with the great price for this movie!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Yes this movie is action packed from Hollywood and if your a Railfan  all more the reason to purchase this movie.  Well packed and quickly shipped along with excellent Amazon Pricing make this a winner in my thinking
B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|Great movie, looks great in our blu-ray player with our 37\\" lcd tv. couldn't be happier with the great price for this movie!
0143034901|5.0|It has mystery, suspense and humour. The characters are interesting and it has a twisting and turning plot. A real page turner.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|We love the show. We were totally behind on the series and bought this to catch up. While we were disappointed in the ending of the series, we were very pleased with the quality of this set.
B005IEF27O|4.0|Primus finally releases another recording, and it doesn't disappoint. To compare, my favorites are Frizzle and Cheese, and those get 5 stars IMO, but this one was a good listen. I think I like it better than any of the other albums (besides the two I mentioned), not sure yet though. It's on constant rotation in the car, and other people that I played it to have commented positively as well.   Some songs are great, others good to bearable. Salmon songs were fun, I guess it closes out the whole Fisherman saga, whatever that means... regardless, the \\"feel\\" of the older songs was there. Lots of great guitar tones, and bass effects were well done. Some wild bass work on a few of the tracks, really like that...  Couple things were a bit sub-par I think, for example, once you get about 7 songs in you might notice some repetitive high-hat action. It's well-done but very similar at times. Couple other little things here and there that I thought could be better, but what do I know! These guys are true artists. I can only give my opinion.  Last song was a nice live addition. Big cheers for Les when he comes out, bass solo, etc... good stuff.   Bought the MP3 album for $6.99 here on Amazon, not bad!  Can't wait to see them live again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Other than the issues with Lucas keeping the crappy changes he's already made before, my husband, the Star Wars junkie is quite happy. Already watched all 6 movies and have made a good bit of headway through the extras. Good stuff all around :)
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I don't know that more can I say but WOW I love this movie. I can't wait for the next!! I think most will really like this movie as long as you think of it as a New/fresh start.
B0034G4P8A|1.0|The movie is outstanding. Solid, and dare I say, not too overly campy. I never read the comic, but this was enjoyable.  However, I got the combo pack here and for whatever reason, it simply won't work on my blu ray player on my computer.  Really? The studios so want to prevent users from making copies that they basically make innocent people unable to watch the movie?  Beware the Blu Ray version- it might not play.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|good game, runs great on DROID X.  I think it great to play while in the car. good for the kids too!
B0055SWM08|5.0|really beautifully done game. zenlike music and gameplay. some levels are pretty challenging but overall it's one of the best droid games out there.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Ama-za-zing! Can't stop playing even though I beat it 4 months ago. Brilliant. Love love love it. Think it would be fun to create a zombies vs plants game, reversed.
0553386794|5.0|Right when I thought I would never read fantasy again, I receive this long overdue book from a rabid friend who had insisted that I try this series for...what, over a year? Not having the heart to disappoint her, I cracked open to the Prologue and was utterly smitten about three pages in. My excuses for not having time to read? Gone. Now I was squeezing out little minutes between every action, time I never knew I had, just to find out what the heck would happen next.<br /><br />It's a very dark and enthralling world, filled with political intrigue that ends in assassination, deals, and even marriages, because why not? At first you shiver deliciously at the mentions of long-lost love, silenced witnesses, and conniving nobility. Then you realize that the world of Westeros is not so different from ours after all; it's just that Martin has the mercy to make the manipulative douchebags sharply beautiful, political scandals ten times juicier, and the setting breathtakingly exotic. Okay, fine. It's not all slaying beasts and golden potions, but the whole world is just so vivid with millennia of betrayed kings, lovely princesses, and even supernatural threats. You can't help but to fall into the castle towers, bloody battlefields, and stinking dungeons.<br /><br />I have a weakness for beautiful characters, obviously, but it only works if they have dimension and personality, ambitions and opinions to wear it with. Here, the knights are pretty when necessary to make the girls swoon, unsympathetic characters (well, relatively)become glamorous under their haughty good looks, and unfortunate girls are blessed with at least the gift of beauty. But wait! It's not an exaggerated fairytale. Seriously though, the characters that are good-looking occur in very normal proportions compared to the rest of the population. In fact, the presence of beauty in high places makes me simply adore one of the noble characters who actually isn't pretty at all. In this case, a character's other traits are brought out, and that makes him/her all the more admirable. The point I'm trying to make/fix here is that Martin has gifted his characters with beauty very cleverly. When a dark secret is revealed like an old maggot, the physically beautiful character suddenly makes you feel a bit sick- just like in real life, pretty faces can be horribly ugly on the inside, while a plain cover can be filled with powerfully moving good.<br /><br />As for the epicness, I think it's actually reflected in how raw and utterly REAL this book is. The characters act very believably- out of selfishness, out of desperation, out of spite and small-heartedness, out of sometimes blind honor, and occasionally out of love. Just like we do in our admittedly less colorful and deadly world. It's kind of up to the reader to decide what the actions are based on, and that's most of the fun, actually. There's no plot-carrying cheap devices like ancient prophecies that set up a youth for his obvious coming-of-age adventure. Oh no. Instead, there's unglamorous grown men and women involved. Sometimes slappable jerks carry the plot, as they tend to influence the real world, sometimes golden youth and potential is wasted, and devastation sometimes visits characters who deserved nothing of the sort. It happens, it makes your heart pound, and even when terrible things are happening to (hehe. Relatively) good people you really can't look away.<br /><br />I must say, reading this has ruined my outlook on life. Why are the scheming, fake puppeteers in our world so classless and dull? And if a betrayal does happen, why is it on such an annoying, yet unepically small scale? There's no chance of diving into deadly jousting tournaments or risking murder by beautiful lords and ladies. And yet...read this book, share it with a friend, and the two of you may find the world a delicious place indeed during your discussions.and that makes him/her all the more admirable.

B004EPYZXU|1.0|I went to see this movie the weekend it opened.  I had high hopes for it as the trailers and TV spots were pretty intense.  I love a good consipiracy theory and when it comes to space, I am in for almost any good flick.  This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The so called \\"previously classified footage\\" was so horribly done and so boring I found myself looking away from the screen out of boredom.  The story line was so thin the climax was laughable when you finally get what is going on up there.  By the time we got to about minute 50 of the movie two-thirds of the audience had gotten up and left the theater.  NASA backed out of any assistance in the making of this trainwreck and they actually need the publicity.    I know it is one man's opinion and I do encourage anyone to see it just so they can weigh in on how much they too wish they had kept their money.
B004SVM7BW|1.0|I have some large PDF files (maps) that do open with Adobe Reader, but take a little while to open.  I purchased RepliGo Reader because of claims that it is fast, so I was hoping that it would do a better job then the free Adobe Reader.   In fact, I can't view the files at all.  Each page just shows a big red-X.   I even got in touch with tech support who said that the file is \\"likely too large and complex for the device's memory to handle\\".

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I know it's not perfect but the picture quality is fantastic, sound is spectacular. I'd rather have the theatrical versions with no tinkering but I'm not going to be picky... I'm just happy to have Star Wars on blu-ray with some pretty good extras, too.
030788743X|4.0|\\"Dogs and cats, living together . . . mass hysteria!\\"  \\"You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada.\\"  Family Ties  Silver Spoons  DeLoreans  Rush's \\"2112\\" album  Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Donkey Kong  If these things mean anything to you, than Ready Player One is a must read. Ernest Cline has written his first novel and it's a blast. The 1980s are forty years in the past, but because of one man, James Halliday, it's the most important decade in human history. Knowledge of that decade's movies, television shows, music, and video games is going to make someone wealthy beyond their wildest dreams.   James Halliday is the creator of the OASIS, an on-line reality that most people now spend every waking moment of their lives inhabiting. They live there as avatars, going to school, working, completing quests, defeating dragons, and falling in love, all while they sit in a chair, looking through a visor, wearing a suit that provides the tactile sensations of the virtual world they're experiencing. The world outside the OASIS has fallen apart and the OASIS is the only world that matters anymore.  But the continued existence of that world becomes uncertain when James Halliday dies. In his will, he leaves ownership and control of the OASIS to the first person who can complete a contest; find three hidden keys that unlock three hidden gates within the OASIS and you'll receive the OASIS along with Halliday's immense fortune and wealth.   Ready Player One is really a lot of fun to read. Part of the fun for me was because I was a teenager during the '80s and grew up on all of the pop culture references Cline uses so well throughout the book. But you don't need to have fond memories of that decade to enjoy this book. The fate of the avatars is just as captivating as the fate of the real people behind them. And sometimes I found myself forgetting that the characters in the story weren't the real ones, but their virtual identity instead.
0061914177|2.0|I thought he was going to teach something new and useful. Most of this book can be found in a free website such as; John Chow or Shoe Money. Actually, those websites have way more information than this book. He went bla, bla about DNA and then talk about social media. Link here, submit there, and more DNA talk and then boom !! the book is over. I got \\"Crushed\\" blue balls after reading this book.   He is definitely a passion person about talking about wine on video but whenever it comes to writing a book you need more than passion, you actually need content, how-tos. Next time dig deeper Gary. This book left me looking in the fridge for that pint of Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia.
B000N0WCLC|2.0|The case that the blu-rary movie came in was horrible.  No more ordering from these guys. It is ashame that you spend your money only to get something that your're not happy with. I repeat, the case that the movie came in was horrible.
1419553429|4.0|This was a good second book to complete after the Kaplan Premiere.  The Verbal section had sufficiently difficult questions to mimic the high-level questions on the actual exam.  The Quant section, however, fell drastically short.  The practice questions in this book are only difficult enough to help you get a 700, at best.  I recommend the Manhattan GMAT Advanced Quant review book to supplement your studies.  I also agree with other reviews that this is a poor guide book.  It is only useful to provide extra practice, with little emphasis on strategy.  If you want detailed strategy coupled with extremely difficult questions, go with the advanced MGMAT books.

0385534639|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I agree with many of the other reviewers that the characters lacked depth and parts of it were confusing and unresolved (what was the point of the game??  How were Celia and Marco holding the circus together?) but in the end I didn't care.  I still truly enjoyed it.  It was certainly original and I appreciated the fact that it was like nothing I had ever read before.

0545259088|5.0|This is going to prove to be one of the hardest reviews that I have ever written. I know that I am probably exaggerating, but it is a hard one. When I like a book I tend to gush, when I gush I find it hard not to give too much away, which means that you will have to bear with me.  Linger left us with Grace & Sam having a very uncertain future. As expected, Forever opened with their roles and lives being totally reversed. This simple fact gave the reader a whole new perspective into the lives of all the main characters. For this reader, it was a wonderful experience.  As with all the other books in this trilogy, Maggie gave each of the main characters a voice. For me, it also gave them depth. I loved getting inside the heads of Sam, Grace, Isabel and Cole. It really made the story so much more, well everything.  There were really no surprises from Grace and Sam. They were in love from the beginning and that love never faltered. The growth and depth of that love was wonderful to experience though. I think what I enjoyed most though was the glimpses into both Cole and Isabel. On the surface they were shallow characters but when you got inside their heads, with Maggie's help, you actually got to experience their pain and felt it right along with them. As painful as it was some times, I wouldn't have missed a minute of it. Throughout Forever there are insights into all the characters that help you understand where they are coming from and how they got to be who they are. It was a wonderful ride.  There are a few surprises yet some of the characters are once again predictable in their cruelty. Some allies are gained that are very welcome but extremely unexpected. Grace's parents still made me mad and (surprise, surprise) Isabel's dad made me furious.  While reading Forever I knew it was the end for the wolves of Mercy Falls. I knew that when I read the last page it would be a final goodbye to Grace and Sam. Regardless, I could follow them (and whoever else is left - I'm not telling) into wherever fate leads them next. I'm sure I'm not the only reader who could see that there is definitely more to the story, but I'm willing to believe it's over and we are left to out imagination to wonder what happens next. :)
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Jethro Tull's Christmas Album is something that you don't necessarily need to read any reviews for to know whether or not you will enjoy it, for example if the very notion of a Jethro Tull Christmas album offends you then just let this one slide and wait for their next real studio album, but if you are willing to give it a fair chance this is actually a great album.<br /><br />I was pretty skeptical myself of how this could be any good, not overly being all that fond of Christmas music myself; but was actually surprised to find that there was indeed a lot of worthwhile and interesting music on here, for example the album opener `Birthday Card At Christmas,' is just a great little up tempo song with no sleigh bells or choirs and a good song besides, it would still be good if it were on either of their previous two albums Roots To Branches or Dot Com.<br /><br />The music is all fairly pleasant and positive, and there aren't that many heavy and driving rock tracks to be found but even so it still works surprisingly well as a new Jethro Tull record... yes the tracks are united in sound and lyrical themes, but so too were all the tracks on the band's many concept albums so it isn't as unnatural as it first seems.<br /><br />In addition to the new material there are some reworkings of classic and rare material from different periods in Tull's career, such as the late 60s track `A Christmas Song,' the late 70's tracks `Ring Solstice Bells,' and `Weather Cock,' as well as the early 80s `Jack Frost And The Hooded Crow,' and early 90s track `Another Christmas Song,' all of which are now connected by a shared vocal and production style on these re-recordings.<br /><br />Overall; forget the whole Christmas thing for a second, if you enjoy Ian's post-70's voice, if you like Tull albums with a lot of flute work and instrumental quality then this is something worth at least a curiosity listen, I put it off for a few years too many and now regret doing so.

030726999X|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase of this book. I was surprised when it arrived and found that it was a hardback book and not a paperback, which was what I was expecting. The book was in excellent condition, \\"like-new\\" in spite of the \\"USED\\" label attached to its cover.
B0059DOJGY|5.0|Edguy goes back to their roots after the terrible release of Titus-album which I have blocked out of my memory I mean hey every band is allowed one.  Granted this album returns Edguy home and the \\"Ltm Ed\\" is worth getting b.c. Cum on Feel the Noize track is good and Standing in the Rain should have made the orginal album cut as well.  However this album does have a few short comings such as Robin Hood song simply just trying to be to hard to be something it is really not which is an EPIC power metal song.  Honestly though I score the reg release of album a 4 and the Ltm Ed of the album a 5 b.c. the bonus tracks including the shorter verison of Robing Hood and Two out of Seven are nice.  Basically Edguy is back to making the type of albums they should make however this album is not as good as Mandrake, Vain Glory Opera, or Hellfire Club when the band peaked in the power metal scene.  Edguy has grown up an changed the style musically which is fine with me but still they stay true to their roots as well.<br /><br />Some people are saying the band is in it's Helloween \\"Pink Bubbles Go Ape\\" period which I feel is not true just listen to some of the riffs on this album they are killer and that alone will debunk that theory.<br /><br />Buy this ed only ~~ good album back to what Edguy does best.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Disturbing ......  This book deeply disturbed me.   1. It's not realistic to have a boyfriend but \\"sleep\\" in the bed with another straight guy.   2. The roommate at the dorm `Kara' made the most sense when she said its not normal to need someone as intensely as Travis did.  3. I do believe that this couple needs counselling. They are highly dysfunctional.  I would say this though the book is a definite page turner and I could not put the book down. I did find a few grammatical errors and typos but they were not too distracting.   Finally I'll say this; the title of the book `Disaster', beautiful or not I can not say, describes the book accurately.   To the teens and young adults that read this story PLEASE do not think this kind of relationship is romantic in any way. This is an example of an abusive relationship....
B005KWL2IW|4.0|This is a great album.  One of my favorite releases of 2011.  I doubt Anthrax fans or fans of heavy metal in general will be disappointed by this purchase.  \\"In The End\\" is just epic.

B005CM9DX6|4.0|The more I listen to Heritage, the more I seem to enjoy it.......<br /><br />  I've always loved both the heavy and the light, mellower sides Opeth. Damnation is equally as good as Ghost Reveries or Deliverance or Orchid.....<br />Basically there was always some sort of progression(hence the word \\"progressive\\") on every album it seemed. Once they used keyboards on Blackwater Park they could use them on every album afterwards and so on with any musical change they may have made to the \\"Opeth sound\\".<br />  I am somewhat surprised by this album, but once the shock wore off and I began to really listen to it as an album of \\"music\\" as opposed to an album of \\"Opeth's music\\" it became quite good..<br />  One thing I noticed quite by accident was the resemblance of the song Slither to Kill The King by Rainbow. I know Slither is a tribute to the late, great Ronnie James Dio, but I did not notice the resemblance of the two tunes until I left the room for a moment, and when I returned for a brief second or two I thought somehow my disc changer changed from the Heritage CD to Rainbow's Long Live Rock and Roll.....go take a listen, you'll agree I'm sure?<br /><br />I give Heritage a rating of 4 out of 5 stars..... it's a great prog. rock album, but not that good of an Opeth album.

B000QFW7UA|5.0|This was one of my most favorite movies growing up. I still remember how upset I was when I discovered that my sister had taped over the copy of the movie I had recorded when it was on TV. And, while growing up, we didn't have the kind of money to just go out and buy a copy of it on VHS. But now I'm all grow'd up, and I can buy it for myself, on Blu-ray, no less.  This 25th Anniversary edition is a bit much. I guess I didn't really look at what was included in this product before it arrived, but suffice it to say, all I really needed was the movie. This thing comes in a pretty big box, with a number of items I will probably never use (such as the board game?!?). Regardless, The Goonies is still a great movie, and I'm satisfied with this purchase.
B005D0TETA|5.0|The sound recording is nothing less than spactular. I have never heard live sound enginering to rival this one. If you have a Home Theater quality sound system, this will be your go-to demo disk. Spend the few extra dollars and get the Blu-Ray. The HD Master Audio will blow you away.

0321146530|2.0|After reading [[ASIN:0321336380 Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk]], i picked up this book and was expecting a book with TDD advocate material (and/or recipes, anecdotes, do's and dont-do's etc.) but was sadly disappointed by the content. The books is probably written for better minds where mine fell short by a long distance.<br /><br />No, i do not want to learn Groovy (or whatever language it was) while i write a test case tool to test drive my tests and have to think about bootstrapping my test cases. Sorry, this is too much for my little brain when a nice set of scenarios depicting usage of TDD would have been much easier to follow (and appreciate).<br /><br />Maybe i will read it in few years again (when i have collected enough intellect to grasp such content) and give it a better rating, for now it is a two star.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Everything that made Batman Begins a great movie was only improved and/or kept on par with this. The directing is even better from Christopher Nolan, he understands the necessary way to go about a superhero movie like no one else. You have two major character arcs in this story (Batman's limits to bring justice and Harvey Dent's descent to evil) as well as over four major villains and it is still able to be handled with ease. Christian Bale not only plays the Bruce Wayne that Gotham sees him as, but he is also its greatest detective and justice breeder. Then there is also the \\"real\\" Bruce Wayne. A man of compassion, even though he is haunted daily by his past daily by the people he goes up against. Even though he wants to kill them, he knows that if he did he would be no better that someone like Ra's Al Ghul and his league of Assassins.   Aaron Eckhart also does a great job of playing multiple roles because he is so believable as the well mannered District Attorney and also as the psychotic killer that is Two-Face. Heath Ledger was a perfect Joker and I feel like it got the praise it warranted, but I feel all three leads deserved just as much recognition. This movie excels in every genre it approaches. As a comic book movie it stays really true to the Long Halloween and Dark Victory storyline. As an action movie it shows more stuff to blow up than a lot of other action sequences than others and it's throughout the entire movie, not just the climax. As a drama it shows a number of clear character arcs and sees them through. Batman actually has to make a decision that neither Spider-man or Superman ever end up having to make, a life or an ideal. This builds on everything set up in Batman Begins, making it arguably the greatest sequel of all time.
B003UESJEW|4.0|Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) knots his silk tie, jumps into his silver Porsche Convertible, speeds out of the leafy drive of his seven-figure suburban mansion and heads off into his job as Regional Sales Manager for GTX - an $11 billion dollar ship-building  conglomerate based in the plusher part of Boston who employ over 60,000 people nationwide...<br /><br />In a less conspicuously wealthy  part of town Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) - a man whose been to Vietnam and then worked himself up from a 60-hour week doing dangerous riveting on the propeller shafts of oil-tankers to a distinguished 30-year managerial career - fixes his dapper cufflinks - albeit a little more wearily.<br /><br />Out by the waterfront in a palatial monolith too gross for mere adjectives, the Executive Vice President of Global Transportation Services (GTX) Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) looks down at a machine that polishes his leather shoes to a mirror-like shine. All three then look into their home mirrors with the faintest whiff of insufferable smugness.<br /><br />Little do any of them know that Black Friday is about to bring a particularly cruel and detached word into their vocabulary - 'downsizing'...<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\" deals with the American bank collapses of September 2008 and their devastating knock-on effect on US heavy-manufacturing industries and their already constricting workforces. As you can see from the principal actors outlined above - the cast is to die-for - and John Well's Script and Direction gives them real substance to work with. Another weapon in the movie's favor is the cinematography of the legendary ROGER DEAKINS (\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" and \\"True Grit\\"). Not only is the Blu Ray image immaculate throughout (he can make a car driving down a snowy road look like poetry) - the pristine sheen of home interiors and top floor offices strewn with Degas Paintings and iMacs is both beautiful and menacing - because beneath all that money, veneer and polish is a very real unspoken threat - poverty is only a corporate axe-swing away.<br /><br />The story begins by putting all three 'company men' in the firing-line - forcing each to reassess themselves and the promises of people they once thought they could trust. Tommy Lee Jones - an actor with as much gravitas as the Lincoln Memorial - does a stunning job of portraying Gene McClary. You can literally 'feel' his treacle-like slide into the abyss. His lifelong friendship with his boss Jim Salinger (a typically excellent Craig T. Nelson) is poisoned beyond repair as corporate greed callously axes 5000 jobs to meet shareholder's needs - and keep the big boys and their moneyed lifestyle intact (Bobby Walker is the first of these casualties). As the monetary noose tightens - another 5000 job cuts are called for and the blade comes closer to home. In a brilliantly written scene where they're deciding who goes and who stays - a lawyer tells Gene \\"...We're breaking no laws here...\\" to which Gene replies \\"...I guess I always assumed we were trying for a higher standard than that...\\" And is doesn't help either that Gene is sleeping with Sarah Wilcox (Maria Bello) - an upper-coming executive who does all the firing in a sexy dress with a concerned look...<br /><br />Chris Cooper too brings the film some badly-needed heart with a brilliant and unnerving portrayal of a man of a certain age losing his job - and by extension what defines him. In a particularly brutal scene - a tough female Career's Officer (Cady Huffman) tells Phil how it really is (her dialogue titles this review) and she doesn't mince her words \\"You're pushing sixty and you look like Hell...\\" She outlines what has to be axed and what has to be massaged in his old fart's resume. Sat there in a suit that no longer feels right and with his body crouched forward in an already defeated way, Cooper's look of puppy-dog bewilderment combined with a barely contained rage is so good that it's palpable. His disintegration later is both sad and painfully believable. He's a great actor and such an asset to this movie...<br /><br />But the whole thing pivots on Ben Affleck's character Bobby Walker and the arc of his painful journey. He starts out as an insufferable motormouth earning $120,000 a year plus incentives with a golf-club membership and eating-out expenses of $600 a month. His wife and two kids want for nothing and have every electrical gadget that screams 'we've arrived'. And when he joins the Jobseeker's club he cockily tells Danny (a huge presence in Eamonn Walker) that he'll have a job in a few days - he completely believes it. Three months later - with his car and possessions gone - their home foreclosed on - 100% of his phonecalls not returned and his severance pay running out - he's beginning to look and sound like a 37-year old loser who can't support his family. Luckily his wife Maggie (a superlative Rosemary DeWitt) keeps him and their world from falling apart with a practicality that her husband so clearly lacks (they rediscover each other in the process).<br /><br />Affleck is often accused of being too pretty boy and too lightweight to be taken seriously, but with his two excellent directorial works \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" (see review) and \\"The Town\\" and past performances in \\"Hollywoodland\\" and \\"State Of Play\\" - once again he shows here that he can easily stand up with the big boys. There's a scene in Jack's house (a wonderfully held-back performance by Kevin Costner - a working man who is incensed at the mere presence of this upstart he clearly feels deserves his comeuppance) when Bobby is looking around the room at the dinner table. He sighs - he's anticipating lectures about responsibility and prayers for hope - his eyelids weigh about 2000 tons. The slide of despair has begun - but there's still that arrogance there. It's a spot-on performance by Affleck for his character at that particular moment. By the time his Bobby gets to huffing sheets of timber about on a construction site for his hated brother-in-law - his dirty-faced blister-handed appreciation of having 'any' job is real and complete. It's impressive stuff...<br /><br />Niggles - despite the A-list cast, the beautiful presentation of the print, the often exceptional writing and the slick direction, there's a gnawing feeling that you're being asked to care about smug pricks with too much money - people you want to hit over the head repeatedly with a cricket bat. And worse - the movie slyly concentrates too much on the 'young' jobless type and not the men of 40, 50 and 60 who can be all but destroyed by such a loss. But luckily the script is smarter than all that and despite a rather pat happy-ending - the sheer quality of the cast and the material win out.<br /><br />\\"The Company Men\\" probably isn't going to trouble any Oscar Nominations List or fire up critics into spilling out orgasmic soliloquies - but like a good night in with friends where way too many drinks have been taken - what was said in liquered-up truth the night before stays with you for days afterwards. Mostly it'll make you think about 'work' - how it traps/frees us - how it even gives us life itself. And if \\"The Company Men\\" makes us appreciate what we have and value it - then it's a job well done...<br /><br />A good movie really. Put it high on your rental list.He's a great actor and such an asset to this movie...    But the whole thing pivots on Ben Affleck's character Bobby Walker and the arc of his painful journey.

There's a scene in Jack's house (a wonderfully held-back performance by Kevin Costner - a working man who is incensed at the mere presence of this upstart he clearly feels deserves his comeuppance) when Bobby is looking around the room at the dinner table. He sighs - he's anticipating lectures about responsibility and prayers for hope - his eyelids weigh about 2000 tons. The slide of despair has begun - but there's still that arrogance there. It's a spot-on performance by Affleck for his character at that particular moment. By the time his Bobby gets to huffing sheets of timber about on a construction site for his hated brother-in-law - his dirty-facedblister-handed appreciation of having 'any' job is real and complete. It's impressive stuff...   Niggles - despite the A-list cast, the beautiful presentation of the print, the often exceptional writing and the slick direction, there's a gnawing feeling that you're being asked to care about smug pricks with too much money - people you want to hit over the head repeatedly with a cricket bat. And worse - the movie slyly concentrates too much on the 'young' jobless type and not the men of 40, 50 and 60 who can be all but destroyed by such a loss. But luckily the script is smarter than all that and despite a rather pat happy-ending - the sheer quality of the cast and the material win out.   \\"The Company Men\\" probably isn't going to trouble any Oscar Nominations List or fire up critics into spilling out orgasmic soliloquies - but like a good night in with friends where way too many drinks have been taken - what was said in liquered-up truth the night before stays with you for days afterwards. Mostly it'll make you think about 'work' - how it traps/frees us - how it even gives us life itself. And if \\"The Company Men\\" makes us appreciate what we have and value it - then it's a job well done...  A good movie really. Put it high on your rental list.

B003Q6D2B4|1.0|I purchased this dvd months ago, just got arpond o watching it last night, the first 20 min. of the dvd was flawed so bad I could not watch it! Why is it when we purchace something \\"new\\" from amazon, we get used  quality merchandise??? Too late to return, but from now on, I will watch my dvd's sooner!!!!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my mom who had just recently undergone a surgery and was having to spend large amounts of time sitting or laying in one place, and when you're stuck like that some new music is the best thing in the world. I (and she) couldn't be happier with the quality of this album.   From start to finish the young British songstress pumps out nothing but timeless pieces focusing on emotion and human interaction, 2 things that never change. I imagine this being the sort of album I'll be able to play for kids or grand-kids in 20 or 30 years and still get an excellent response.   Honestly if you're even reading this review then this album is for you.

B005LAMY76|5.0|This show has the best all around talent of any show I've seen in a long time, the writing is excellent, every actor is right on spot.  The only big problem I've seen is the spanish speaking scenes, the actors who speak spanish are very good in english but they speak terrible, just terrible spanish, they're simply not believable as mexican or chilean drug dealers, they should've invented a reason to make the scenes in english. I'm from Mexico and half the time I don't understand what they are saying. What I don't get is that there are TONS of actors who can make very believable spanish speaking drug lords.  The show is soooo good that I wouldnt even have brought up the spanish issue if they kept those scenes to a minimum, but they went and made very long and important moments only speaking a terrible spanish, I do think it hurts the show. Other than that is an excellent TV series.

1401307450|5.0|I bought this for a friend who love the Red Hot Chili Peppers. On the subway ride home I started reading it just to pass the time and quickly became engrossed in it. I actually made her wait until I was done to give it to her.<br /><br />I had always kind of liked the band but after reading this book I have a much deeper appreciation for Anthony Kiedis and RHCP. This book made me a fan of their music.
B001OSIV62|5.0|A huge story with so many built in ironies--those being the Trade Center towers, the eccentric vision of one man, those who follow and love him, and the man at the end of his life now reflecting on the mission with reverie--that it is hard to believe it isn't fiction. However the director keeps the story down to earth even when most of the action is reaching toward the heavens.<br />The film is a great action flick. Tense. Original. True. Don't miss it.
0142418471|5.0|Before I get into how much I liked this book I feel compelled to say that, contrary to what one of the Will Graysons would have you believe, girls do not urinate from their vaginas. They urinate from their urethras, an entirely separate opening; ask any woman who's ever gone to the bathroom while wearing a tampon. I hope this is a mistake of the character and not the authors, because two adults as intelligent as they clearly are don't have much of an excuse for not knowing a basic fact of human anatomy. Having gotten that pet peeve out of the way...  The two Will Graysons, who I'll refer to as Will 1 and Will 2 for the sake of clarity, live in different Chicago suburbs and meet one night though some bizarre twists of fate. Will 1 is facing harassment at school for having defended the right of Tiny Cooper, his enormous and enormously gay friend, to change in the locker rooms like every other football player; despite this showing of solidarity, Will and Tiny's friendship is showing signs of heading towards the rocks. Will 2 is clinically depressed, almost friendless, and finds his sole source of happiness in exchanging instant messages with an online crush named Isaac. Both Wills are insightful, have a hard time expressing their feelings, and are depressed on some level. Will 1 has feelings for Tiny's friend Jane, but the apathetic attitude he tries to have towards life keeps him from actually dating her. Will 2 is pining for Isaac while trying to avoid prying questions from Maura, a moody girl who he stays friends with only to have someone to be around. Clearly, the future isn't looking too bright for either of these two. What does look bright is Tiny Cooper's larger-than-life, school-funded, autobiographical musical...that is, if he can actually pull it together by opening night while dealing with his uncertain friendship with Will 1 and his romantic feelings for Will 2. This is much easier to follow in the actual book, I promise.  What's really notable about this novel is how Green and Leviathan give their two Will Graysons so much in common while still making them very individual characters. They also do a great job of making the novel's plot improbable but not implausible - anything resembling this story is unlikely to happen in real life, but not because it literally couldn't. The book has an unusual amount of depth for a young adult novel and it pulls you in from the beginning. I read the whole thing in one day.
1595826971|5.0|The artbook is a fantastic purchase for anyone that can enjoy a set of unique and sometimes grotesque art. If the book was to disappoint me in anyway, it would have to be the fact that a lot of what is in the art book did not make it to the game. A shame considered when the game has great execution of the art style, but is lacking in so much content.  Highly recommended.
0756404738|5.0|This second book in Rothuss's series(Kingkiller Chronicles),<br /> is just as good as the first, maybe better.<br />According to my hubby,it was pure gold.<br />The hero,Kvothe,is on a mission for truth, justice and plain revenge.<br />In other words, his quest to find answers, held hubby spellbound while<br />driving around the state and kept him awake for this great read.<br />\\"A Wise Man's Fear\\" is worth reading at least once, or maybe even<br />twice to keep all the players straight in this most inveigling book.<br />This book is hubby approved!<br />Thank you men again, for picking out this book for my hubby.<br />Awesome job!<br />Oh, and I guess thank you to this author too.

0671024256|2.0|The first third of this book reads more like a memoir, and whilst some of it was kinda interesting, I didn't buy this book because I wanted an autobiography.<br /><br />When we get down to the actual meat of the subject, there's not that much there for aspiring writers.  To be honest, I found a lot of the advise Stephen King had to offer to be rather un-motivating.  King sets out way too many rules, and tells us if we don't follow these rules to the letter, it must mean that we're not at all serious about the craft.<br /><br />I appreciate reading about an author's methods of writing.  Every one has their various techniques, and none of them are wrong.  I did not appreciate being told that I must set aside three or four hours of my time every day in order to write, and that I must NOT leave my computer until I've written my word goal of (what Mr. King suggests to be a perfectly generous) 1000 words. This is exactly the sort of attitude that makes me afraid to write.  For some of us, (like me) the words do not come easily, and some days, they do not flow at all.  Trapping myself in front of the computer until \\"the magic happens\\" does nothing for me but make me feel depressed and frustrated.  I appreciate King sharing his own methods with us, but I do not appreciate that he leaves the reader feeling as though it's either his way, or you might as well not bother.<br /><br />I did not really learn anything new from this book when it came to the craft of writing.  I did learn some interesting thing about the author himself, which is why this review didn't award On Writing just one star.  I'm glad I did not pay a lot of money for my copy, as I would have felt it wasn't worth the price.  As it was, it passed the time interestingly enough, but unlike many \\"how to write\\" books that I've read, it did not leave me motivated and hungry to write.<br /><br />For beginner writers, by all means, read this book and take what you can from King's advise.  But don't assume it to be law.

B000AP04MO|4.0|There is good chemistry between Hepburn and Finney. How they work through their doubts and fears about their relationship is interesting to watch unfold. To me they are at their best form in this picture. The way the film goes from present to past to present keeps you interested. I love the movie.
0545259088|5.0|NOTE: You need to read the first two books in this series, SHIVER and LINGER, before you read FOREVER, in order to understand the story.<br /><br />The tables have turned.  Now, Sam is the one waiting.  Even though waiting for Grace to return to human form is torture, it is nothing compared to the agony he feels when he thinks about the danger she is in while running loose in the woods.  Mr. Culpeper has wanted the wolves in Mercy Falls dead ever since his son was killed by them.  After a girl is found torn apart in the woods, Culpeper has just the ammunition he needs to get his wish.<br /><br />While Grace is Sam's priority, he also has the added responsibility of saving Beck and all of the other wolves.  Sam and Grace attempt to come up with a plan, while Cole St. Clair, ex-lead singer of NARKOTIKA and newest pack member, takes dangerous measures to find a cure for the disease infecting his pseudo-family.  With the help of Isabel Culpeper and a very unlikely ally, the wolves finally have some hope.<br /><br />FOREVER has it all - heartwarming romance, angry teen rebellion, and dry, witty humor.  It made me laugh, cry, and stress in all the right amounts.  FOREVER is the final book in the WOLVES OF MERCY FALLS trilogy.  It provides the reader a satisfying ending, while still leaving enough room for us to wonder about the future of the pack.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has given readers a wonderful story in this trilogy.  If you haven't read them yet, run, run, run to the store and get them today.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Karin Librarian

0525422943|5.0|About three years ago, Mia and Adam went their separate ways - Mia off to Julliard and Adam off to live the life of a rock star.<br /><br />Adam is about to start a European tour with Shooting Star.  Since heading off on his own, he has attempted to push aside the emotions he still feels for Mia.  Doing so has created a whole new set of problems.  Adam is becoming cut off from his fellow band members, and the resulting pressure is becoming more than he can take.  His days are filled with annoying interviews, meetings, and rehearsals that he only manages to get through with the help of prescription drugs and cigarettes.  His equally famous girlfriend constantly berates him about living with a ghost from his past.<br /><br />In New York City for a brief interview before leaving for the tour, Adam has an angry outburst due to questions from a nosy interviewer.  Knowing he won't be popular, he takes off, avoiding his flight and, hopefully, the anger of his manager.  His thoughts are filled with Mia, and when he stumbles across her name on the marquee for a Youth Concert series, he asks if any tickets remain.  Fate intervenes and he finds himself sitting in the concert hall watching her perform.<br /><br />After the concert he plans to slink back to his hotel and attempt to make up for his earlier bad behavior by contacting his manager. But on his way out of the concert hall, Adam is approached by an usher, asking him to follow him to Mia's dressing room.<br /><br />What follows is a twenty-four-hour period of emotional ups and downs as both Adam and Mia confront the demons surrounding their complicated relationship.  Adam relives the terrible months of watching Mia struggle to recover from the accident that killed her parents and her little brother.  He knows he is the reason why Mia left.  He had prayed for her recovery and promised he would let her go if that was what she wanted.  For three lonely years, he has lived with the fact that that must have been her desire.<br /><br />Can Adam and Mia forgive each other and themselves before each must leave to fulfill separate responsibilities on opposite sides of the world?<br /><br />Author Gayle Forman takes readers back into the lives of Mia and Adam in her sequel to IF I STAY.  With the focus more on Adam and his heartbreak both during and after Mia's family tragedy, Forman broadens the heartbreaking story in an emotional yet realistic direction.  She explores the impact of death and separation as two people strive to overcome pain and connect with futures that satisfy them both.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka \\"Readingjunky\\"themselves before each must leave to fulfill separate responsibilities on opposite sides of the world?

B00005JPS8|4.0|Iron Man has a lot of talent behind it and can be very entertaining.  Jon Favreau directs with a verve that doesn't forget people as he keeps the super hero format intact.  Robert Downey plays Iron Man with a great sense of humor and as Tony Stark the weapons magnate who is his alter ego.  The movie begins in Afghanistan and Tony Stark is held hostage and escapes by making a protective suit to ward off deadly weapons.  He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.  Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.  Terrence Howard gets to play the sidekick in a fun way.  Jeff Bridges finally gets a bad guy role.  What fun!
B004TFZYNK|5.0|I haven't had so much fun listening to a CD or any music, in, I can't tell you how long!  I was hooked from the first note and felt like dancing the whole way through the album.  But that was a little difficult in the car, however.  These songs were not written and made for the \\"perfect\\" voice.  They are for us, everyone who would love to sing, but really can't.  To me Laurie's voice IS perfect for these songs.  I can't wait to hear more and am sorry I didn't know of this version with the 3 extra songs on it.  I'm really missing them.  Good Going Hugh Laurie! I can tell this is the music you LOVE!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I went to the store today with one goal in mind: to get hammered or wasted. The thing is, I really don't drink. I suppose it's a good thing that people can't come back from the dead, and no it's not because they'd be flesh eating zombies. It would be the sheer terror of Da Vinci wanting to add dinasaurs in the background that would ruin its cultural impact. Not to mention he'd probably give away any secrets ge may have had about the last supper.  So here it stands, Lucas is a flesh eating bastard. He eats away at the same meal, until there are only bones and then he preceeds to decorate those bones with uneeded yellings and dreadful cgi bone eating maggots. Lucas has even gone so far as to desecrate Jim Henson's memory by using cgi to replace one of the most beloved muppets. Shame Lucas.  I guess I could discuss more problems I have but I'd rather finish my rolling rock. R.I.P Star Wars the cultural movie I loved. Hello flesh eating mutant Star Wars!
B000FC1KBG|5.0|This book is awesome. It's full of simple tips that work like magic. I read it two months before giving birth to my first child and I have followed most of the reccomendations with great success. My baby is now four months old and the tips on baby feeding and creating sleeping habits have been very useful. A lot of people tell me how lucky I am to have a child that sleeps and eats so well. I think a big part of that is because of this book.

1400032717|2.0|The story starts out very interesting.  A 15 year old with some form of autism is trying to figure out who killed his neighbors dog.  It is written from the perspective of the child with autism and while this is what makes the book unique, it also becomes somewhat of a tedious book to read.  The mystery of the book runs out about 1/2 way through and there just isn't enough of a plot to make up for what occurs after that point.  I have a nephew who has some of the same problems and when the main characted is acting out in certain ways I can very much see my nephew in that.  The novelty of this point of view wears of quickly for me and that along with about 20% of the book just being random facts mentioned by the main character make this a forgettable book.
B005FNJL7K|3.0|I was actually, foolishly, anticipating a genuine symphony. Forget about formal structure, the 20th century composers took plenty of liberties with that. I mean themes, combined themes and variations on themes, major and minor statements of themes, key changes, etc. etc. This is a suite or perhaps a symphonic synthesis, whatever that is. Anyway, a symphony should be a symphony. I have no objection to the length, Mahler wrote one about an hour and forty minutes long. What a symphony this could have been! After waiting so long, such a disappointment.

B004K4AVAG|5.0|Lady Gaga as an entity in culture has turned into - to put it charitably - something unique.  Some love that, some hate it, but I do think her personality is distinct from her music, and it's helpful to remind yourself of that, perhaps over and over and over again.  The truth is I appreciate that the one thing Lady Gaga has never done is be boring, but even if that weren't how I felt, I would have trouble denying how much my mind goes back to these songs.  Some people heard \\"Born This Way\\" as a single and loved it, most of my friends - on Capitol Hill (Hipster Central) in Seattle - hated it.  I thought it a bit of a bridge too far on first listen, but the melody kept drawing me back in, and eventually its sense of celebration was so invigorating I just gave in and admitted I loved the thing.  Same with \\"Edge Of Glory,\\" whose melody overtook me to such an extent, I had to admit it was sort of brilliant, and probably the best single of the year.  But those are just the beginning.  Almost every song did it to me - sucked me in just by making me smile at its own tonic addictiveness and wackadoo personality.  The opera-vocal-climb opening of \\"Government Hooker\\" led into the strangest verses I'd heard in years (\\"Put your hands on me, John F. Kennedy\\").  The German spouting \\"Scheisse\\" turned out to be a weird, dance anthem to female empowerment.  \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" sounded like nothing until its dark bass kept rattling around in my brain even with barely anything but a couple of kinky lines running along with it.  So, my suggestion for this album?  If you like music that expands in personality, is fun, and - yes - you don't entirely mind this current era of pulsating, unapologetic club music, you really will find a lot to dig into with Born This Way.
