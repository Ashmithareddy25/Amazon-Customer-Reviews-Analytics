0385510454|3.0|In the Author's Note for this book, John Grisham observes that his background is law . . . and not satellites or espionage.  In addition, he admits to being a technophobe when it comes to electronic gadgets.  Be aware of this information before deciding if you want to read this book or not.<br /><br />The Broker is a book about high tech satellites, espionage and involves advanced use of all kinds of electronic gadgets.  Those are clearly the weakest parts of the story . . . for the reasons stated above.<br /><br />You can also read the book as a variation on the old television series, The Prisoner.  The book works better that way.  A lame, lame-duck president is encouraged by a Machiavellian CIA director to pardon Joel Backman, a traitorous deal maker.  The CIA wants to see who kills Backman as a way to solve some old mysteries.<br /><br />From that premise, the story mostly moves to Backman's perspective as he is unexpectedly removed from a very unpleasant solitary confinement into being shepherded around Italy in a process of assuming a new identity . . . as an Italian.  You will struggle with Backman as he learns Italian (and pick up a lot of phrases and words yourself) and follow him through the tourist sites and back streets of Bologna.  You will probably also get some ideas for Italian foods you'd like to try.  This part is the most appealing aspect of the book.<br /><br />From there, Grisham puts a target on Backman's back and the thriller part of the story begins.  I found that aspect of the book to be well below average.  Grisham would be well advised to follow the advice of those who tell writers to stick to what they know.<br /><br />As compared to most page turners, The Broker is perfectly acceptable.  If you are looking, however, for a book that captures the early Grisham style and appealing story lines, this isn't it.
B000002HH2|3.0|Bonjour, mes amis! I am le Professeur Henri de Mofou, of the l'Ecole Des Arts Amoureux, un Ph. D. in le fine art of seduction. In ma classe, you have learned much about this most intricate of arts. Ah, la femme, so capricious in her whims, and lovely as the summer's day! But I digress. Take out your notebooks, and let us consider la Bjork, a well-known artiste of, how do you say, \\"le techno.\\" Today, we shall study her second disque, une affaire called, let us see...Post.    For those of you who came in late, let us recall l'histoire de Bjork: she started her solo career in 1993, with a disque entitled Debut. It contained both les hooks and les grooves in good measure, in le style de \\"dance-pop,\\" but la force principale of the disque was la personnalite de Bjork. Yes, when she sang les chansons comme \\"Violently Happy\\" ou \\"Big Time Sensuality,\\" she sounded like une femme in love, maybe not for the first time, but with that great ecstatic power of youth that lets one truly believe that an attractive stranger can really be one's true soul mate, heedlessly laugh away the obvious absurdity of this belief, and at the same time - and this is most important! - not really believe it at all! Ah, sweet youth! Yes, mes amis, our masculine cynicism is but a guard against our despair at being no longer young! And, though we have experienced much pleasure in l'amour, we have forever lost those days when a few words, a flick of the hair, a brush with one's hand, could mean the world to us.    And so, it would seem, are they gone for la Bjork. On her deuxieme disque, Bjork displays a far different personnalite. Yes, now she is une femme schooled in the way of the world! Alas, she now flirts without falling in love, she gets bored with her petit ami and leaves him, ah, she uses such vulgar phrases as \\"Give her some time / Give her some space.\\" Sacrebleu! Yes, mes amis, she is older, experienced in the ways of love. Consider la chanson \\"Possibly Maybe,\\" un single from Post. Ah, this isa track meant to be listened to in the cities of Europe! There are no distinct musical phrases, only an impossibly smooth, icily sensual cosmopolitan air, a sheen of keyboards as soft as pillows, and crackling, blunt drums. We might play such a track (I hope you're writing this down!) when we return home from Le Club with une belle jeune femme. Oui, you say, if la Bjork writes songs like this, then surely there is no way to win her heart. Is that not so, mes amis?    Ha, ha! Do not despair! Let us continue notre analyse! Yes, at first, it may seem that la Bjork has become cynical towards such gallant hommes as ourselves. But let us look closely at \\"Enjoy,\\" une chanson in which Bjork acts overtly jaded, singing, \\"I'm only into this to enjoy.\\" Do the dissonant bass and percussion sound familiar? Naturellement! This song is produced by none other than Tricky, that funky seducer who made whole albums out of getting sultry femmes to sing lascivious chansons with dark, dense trip-hop productions. Here it is no different, only Bjork is singing instead of Martina Topley-Bird.    I see you are surprised, mes amis! But in fact, we can make similar comments about much of the whole album. \\"Army of Me,\\" which features a cold, aggressive Bjork performance, is a rewrite of \\"Safe From Harm\\" by Massive Attack. The bass line is almost exactly the same, and has the same sort of production. \\"I Miss You,\\" though it has un tres groovy electric accordion sound, uses the beat of \\"R-theme\\" by Rhythm Is Rhythm. Critics praised this album for its musical diversity, but it seems to merely co-opt numerous then-popular production styles. Yes, for all the genre-hopping going on here, there's little substance to these tracks. \\"Isobel\\" has a sort of fairy-tale atmosphere, drenched in strings (and lyrics from Bjork's acquaintance Sjon, who I am certain is secretly in love with her), but there's just not much there; the strings come to the fore in one musical phrase, and tread water, as it were, therest of the time. Oui, Bjork may say, \\"I'm going to prove the impossible really exists\\" on \\"Cover Me\\" (which is very similar to \\"Like Someone in Love\\" from Debut, with a harpsichord), but alas, the album doesn't. And \\"Headphones,\\" the experimental closing track, is really a bit boring, is it not? Bjork whispers seductively, but there's just no music there aside from a little plunking bass.    Sacre Cerise! Yes, mes amis, the album does not achieve greatness, I am afraid. However, there is une chanson that does. On \\"Hyperballad,\\" Bjork sings disarming lyrics about how she imagines herself falling off a cliff every morning in order to feel happier later with her love. Oui, her love! Here, Bjork is secluded on a mountaintop with the man of her dreams, with no need for the cunning intrigues of the heart that we weave in our cities! Thus does the purity of nature rejuvenate our long-dead emotions. This fine chanson is the most straightforward dance number on the album; after the second verse, that simple, insistent house beat enters, that beat that carries us so far away whenever we hear it at Le Club! And it is matched with beautifully clear keyboard counter-melodies, as well, and in the end, a melancholy, tender violin surfaces to gently bring us down again. Ah, would that all the songs on the album were like this! Would that we could be young again! But alas, our cries fall upon the silent face of heaven and go unanswered. C'est la vie.    That is the end of my lecture, mes amis. Go forth and conquer hearts, but remember, always be gallant, witty, and magnanimous! Au revoir!
B0007GAEW6|1.0|ok first I got this cd because I read the review in the usa today   paper and they said it was good, they also said another cd that I got was good also, both are not good, but this Mars cd is just bad, its terrible  I listened to it once already and it is without a doubt the worst cd I have gotten this yr and the worst I have gotten ever. Its mixing of it is bad, it sounds like they just put on the mixer and put the bass and drums and everything else and just put it together, theres no sound that you can connect to and its very hard to follow the music, its all over the place fast , slow, theres no way to get into the music because its just that bad to listen to, IM sorry but this is bad, I cant say it any other way except the only good thing about this cd is I paided 7.99 for it which is about 7.00 to much, dont get it thats all I can say,
0380789019|3.0|The first book I ever read by Neil Gaiman was \\"American Gods.\\"  That work was actually written after this one that I've now read reviewed.<br /><br />Authors generally have a distinctive style.  Samuel Clemens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and other famous writers can be identified by their writing alone, without reference to the title or author on the cover.  The major difference between a good writer and an excellent writer is, in my opinion, the ability to write a number of very good books without copying themes, plotline and style too much between them.  At least not allowing such copying to be done in a manner that is distracting to the reader.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is a good read, but it is very similar to the later \\"American Gods\\" in the behavior of characters and the theme of a world existing parallel to our own, right before our eyes.<br /><br />A practical drawback for North Americans and others who have never been to London is the heavy reliance in this book on place names and terms that are familiar mostly to British people, and to Londoners in particular.<br /><br />Between this book and \\"American Gods,\\" I would recommend the latter as the best first book to read by this author, especially if it might be the only book by him that you read.  I do plan, however, to read Mr. Gaiman's other works.  So perhaps my perspective will improve.

0393964582|4.0|This book is a classic novel and thus has gained a reputation due to the films about it that are completely different than the novel. Mary Shelley's own husband Percy edited and changed the writing quite a bit so this version is appealing because it is Mary's version, not Percy's.<br /><br />The language of the novel flows well; it is very beautiful. Just reading the descriptions is easy to enjoy regardless of what they say because of how melodic they are.<br /><br />The story itself is very simple and not as exciting as one might expect. A monster is created. His demands are not met so he destroys the life of his creator. He has motives; he speaks well; he is logical.<br /><br />The monster is not the grunting green representation from the big screen. This book by modern standards is not a horror novel.<br /><br />This does not hinder it; it simply changes the way a reader should begin it. It is more of a political statement that can be analyzed when contemplating modern issues like cloning. Imagine that it was written during the Romantic era! That alone is a tribute to its genius.<br /><br />Read it and make your own conclusions.

B00003CXCT|4.0|Ever since \\"Star Wars\\" was re-released in 1979 I have been hooked.  The \\"galaxy far, far away\\" teems with adventure, intrigue, ethics, and myth.  I was one of those people who believed the Prequels would happen when most others thought the Force had \\"gone out of the universe\\". <br /> <br />Even though I knew Lucas was not including the classic \\"Star Wars\\" editions, I was still thrilled to see the trilogy come to DVD.  Some of the new material is a delightful surprise, but I do wish he wouldn't have toyed with \\"Jedi\\" the way he did in 1997--the Sarlacc Pit now reminds me of the scene from \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\". <br /> <br />However, if you're looking to rekindled the fun of these films, or share them with youngsters who were merely a gleam in your eye when the saga first appeared, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />The only thing keeping me from \\"5 stars\\" is that I wish George (Lucas, not President Bush) would have included the original versions along with his post-Special Edition versions.  People generally like a choice and if they had both editions most would probably prefer the new to the old, but not me, I would have fired the first shot at Greedo!  : )

B0006SSOHC|4.0|\\"Saw\\" is a creepy low budget film with high wattage actors. It promises to deliver tense moments and it does. Several reviewers have stated that it puts up one too many red herrings and, you know, maybe that's true, but frankly I love that stuff - I eat up Agatha Christy-type story lines. And this is somewhat in that vein - just extremely gory. <br /> <br />A couple of guys who don't know each other wake up in a disgusting bathroom (I think it's the one that Ewan McGregor went toilet diving in Trainspotting...)chained to the walls. The corpse of someone who blew his own brains out lies between them. They can't free themselves unless one or both of them can saw off his leg using a saw provided by their tormentor (yes, they try it on the chains first to no avail).  Provided with piecemeal clues, the men try to devise a way out of their prison, only to find that if they don't do exactly as their tormentor has stated one of the man's family will be murdered. <br /> <br />The cast includes Cary Elwes (Princess Bride and Twister), Danny Glover (do you really need help here?), Monica Potter, and a few unknowns (one of whom wrote the story). <br /> <br />The acting is well above par for such a film. The film is sufficiently claustrophobic when it needs to be and expands outside to give us a bit of breathing room only to reel us back in for more. <br /> <br />If you have a stomach for some gore and a few really good thrills, check this film out.
B0007O38F8|1.0|50 was already ripped, is this 'photoshop',or did he bulk up to olympian standards? The music is horrible. If you like  the muscles, go the to the Mr. Olympia contests, and see the real thing.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|The wait is over.  Was it worth it?  That seems to be the burning question in regards to the latest full-length effort from Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, known the world over as Daft Punk.<br />Four years is an awfully long time between album releases these days.  When the Aerodynamic duo returned in 2001 with &quot;Discovery&quot;, the long-awaited follow up to 1997's ground-breaking &quot;Homework&quot;, critics and consumers alike heralded the disc as a refreshing breath of fresh air to an all to often stagnant electronic scene.  Now we see the arrival of the pair's third full-length album(Alive 1997 and Daft Club being live and remix discs respectively) &quot;Human After All&quot;.  Is it up to par with their first 2 releases?  Well, yes!  And no.<br />The album opens strongly with the title track &quot;Human After All&quot;.  Building on vocoded vocals and filtered guitars, this pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the set.  &quot;The Prime Time Of Your Life&quot; could have been a great track, but it unfortunately never really kicks into the groove you keep expecting it to.  The lead single &quot;Robot Rock&quot; follows next, reminding seasoned listeners of &quot;Da Funk&quot; with it's steady, rock-derived beat and hard, pulsating guitar loops.  It's easily one of the catchiest tracks on the disc and contains the only &quot;credited&quot; sample on the album.  &quot;Steam Machine&quot; chugs along nicely, and &quot;Make Love&quot; offers the listener a chance to catch their breath before plunging into the acid-rock fury of &quot;The Brainwasher&quot;.  &quot;Television Rules The Nation&quot; could have been a great track to address social themes in the media today, but relies on the loop and guitar formula found throughout the album.  &quot;Technologic&quot; is by far the best track on the album, with it's catchy vocoded lyrical deliverance and funky musical backing.  This is Daft Punk at their best, it's too bad the rest of the discdoesn't follow the groundwork found here.  &quot;Emotion&quot; closes the set with another laid-back sounding piece with a vocoded vocal loop saying &quot;Emotion&quot; throughout.<br />Overall, this disc is actually a great listen and provides a lot of exciting moments, but for those expecting a carbon copy of &quot;Homework&quot; and &quot;Discovery&quot;, this ain't it.  The one saving grace could be the remixes that get released with the singles, as there is plenty of potential for some re-working of the originals.  It's great to see Daft Punk moving in new directions and not pigeon-holing themselves, but for an album entitled &quot;Human After All&quot;, it seems that their music had far more emotion and feeling when they were pretending to be robots.  This set is best approached with an open mind.
B000268QB2|5.0|This CD is guaranteed to stop you in your tracks and listen. It may seem absurd to not have a guitar in a rock band, but Keane is not your conventional band. Comparisons to Coldplay and Queen are superficial because Keane are in a class of their own (in no way diminishing the fantastic music of the other bands).  <br /> <br />Keane's biggest strengths are the sustained power of Tom Chaplin's vocals and the soft, catchy appeal of their instruments. Every track has a unique sound but are similar in their emotional content. <br /> <br />Somewhere Only We Know - Excellent start, stunning vocals and a very endearing tune, sensational hit, and deserves to be one. <br /> <br />This is the Last Time - Fantastic chorus, very meaningful, definitely one of the best songs <br /> <br />Bend and Break - Similar in structure to \\"Somewhere...\\", easy to listen to <br /> <br />We Might As Well Be Strangers Now - Is a bit tiresome at first, but towards the end becomes really good, very simple tune <br /> <br />Everybody's Changing - Has a very poppish sound, no surprise that it was a hit as a single. <br /> <br />Your Eyes Open - A piece of brilliance in every aspect, probably the most underrated song in the album. After a few times of listening to the CD, this will be one of your favourites <br /> <br />She Has No Time - Everything about this song is very simple, which serves to show off Chaplin's vocals soaring to new heights here <br /> <br />Can't Stop Now - Also very pop oriented, but with a original touch of Keane, which makes it all that much better <br /> <br />Sunshine - The most unusual song on the album, has a very eerie beginning but gradually settles into a down-tempo, soulfull and powerful melody <br /> <br />Bedshaped - Reverts to the style of \\"Somewhere...\\" with a dazzling chorus and a more rock-ish feel. A great ending with one of the best songs in terms of the \\"awe\\" factor <br /> <br />Overall, this, in combination with Coldplay, Travis and Franz Ferdinand is one ofthe must-have Brit pop CDs!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002AH9|5.0|Words can hardly do justice to a recording like this. The depth of emotion in the interpretation of these songs is breath taking, heart breaking and at times gut wrenching and just plain difficult to listen to, as it is laid so bare. Years of hard living had taken its toll on Holiday's voice, reducing it to a cracked shadow of its former glory. The irony here ( the \\"Lady in Satin\\" of the album's title ) is that her weakened croak of a voice is wrapped in a delicate sound; it is surrounded by a multitude of strings, horns and choirs, courtesy of legendary arranger Ray Ellis. This isn't the hopping, hot jazz of Holiday's early years and some fans who hear \\"Lady in Satin\\" complain it is too light, that it sounds like elevator music or easy listening. I beg to differ. This is the blues, pure and simple. No matter what the instrumentation is, the sound coming from Holiday's voice - the ache, the longing, the regret, the loss - make it so. The opening line on the album \\"I'm a fool to want you\\" sets the tone for the album, it's theme of a loveless, empty life echoed throughout many of the song lyrics, in songs like \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\" and \\"The End of a Love Affair.\\" My favourite track \\"You've Changed\\" could very well be seen as Holiday's ode to herself. When I hear her sing \\"you've changed - that sparkle in your eyes is gone\\" and \\"you've forgotten the words I love you\\" I can imagine Lady Day looking into the mirror and wondering where it all went wrong. Grotesquely fascinating but  ultimately incredibly rewarding, \\"Lady in Satin\\" is the literal sunset of Billie Holiday's career as she would be dead within 18 months.
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica proved that heavy metal wasn't the only thing they were good at.  This album is arguably one of the best albums ever to come out by Metallica.  It has the best mix of their heavy metal days and of their creativity to produce some pretty good ballads such as Nothing Else Matters.  I'd have to say this is their best album ever.  Almost all the songs on here are really good that's including songs that weren't hits (who knows why).  Overall, if you're planning on getting it, BUY IT!!!
B0007O38F8|4.0|50 Cent's \\"The Massacre\\" is not \\"Get Rich Or Die Trying part 2\\" <br />so with that out of the way lets talk about this 21 song juggernaut.  Lyricaly he is not the man that brought us \\" Power of the dollar\\" The lyrics sound kind of childish.  He talks about Guns, Guns, Drugs, Sex and heroin there is not much depth on this album. But he trys with \\"God Gave me style\\" a great song that shows how happy he is with his life.  \\"So Amazing\\" should have beem cut out the album, its 50's worst son of all time.  Producer Scott Storch has proven to be a great producer and he shines on this LP, He's the guy who ghost producing for Dr. Dre for years. \\"Disco Inferno\\" could have been written by a 7 year old, but hey it gets the women on the dance floor.  And \\"Magic Stick\\" oops i mean \\"Candy Shop\\" is the song that proves 50 can not come up with an original hook.  \\"I Dont Need em'\\" and \\"Position of Power\\" are better than anythin on \\"Get Rich\\" and are the best song 50 made in a while, these songs remind me of \\"The Power of the Dollar\\" days.  The rest of the Lp is on point and its not as bad as people are saying.
B0007NFL18|1.0|\\"I'll take you to the candy shop i'll let you lick the lollipop dont stop till you hit the spot\\" ENOUGH SAID!!

B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera is one of my favorite bands to listen to. Every member in that band had talent. Phil Anselmo's brutal lyrics, Dimebag's unforgettable guitar riffs, Rex's bass and Vinnie's drum work...who could ever hate this band? This CD is a classic. Every track speaks for itself. \\"Walk\\" is a fan favorite and was the first Pantera song I've ever heard. This got me into the band. \\"This Love\\" is an outstanding track, especially with Dimebag's guitar solos. \\"Mouth For War\\" and \\"F**king Hostile\\" find the band heading for a faster pace.<br /><br />Come on, I dare you to hate this band. If you hate Pantera, prove it by posting a review that says \\"cotton_hell is an idiot and Pantera sucks\\".

B000050XEI|4.0|After Sept. 11, I heard that everyone was getting this CD. I was wondering what was so special about it until I heard it. I thought that this CD was great, uplifting, and well just great. I knew God/ddess knew that people were going to need something to rejuvanate them and that's why this CD was made. The only problem is that two songs aren't as uplifting as the rest, that is 4 and 5. It sounds like it predicted that Sept. 11 would happen and I didn't like that. Well,  the only other thing I like to mention is that this CD is not short, it has 12 songs in them. I don't think a CD has to have 16 or more songs to be known as long.
B0002X314C|5.0|Anyone who writes a bogus review for this CD obviously hasn't seen John live. You can't even begin to appreciate his talent until you've seen him perform with his amazing band. I saw him on tour with Alicia Keys and he was flawless. His voice is so strong and powerful in person. The audience was definitely feeling John Legend while singing along to \\"Ordinary People\\" and moving to \\"Alright.\\" His songs sound even better in person. They sound great on the CD, but they are absolutely blazing on the concert stage. He has so much energy that it's overflowing. I would get \\"Get Lifted\\" because it's great exposure to his music. And since you can't have John Legend singing in your living room, it's the next best thing. But the most fulfilling part will be the live experience. Nothing can replace that. This is real music, no backing tracks or lip-syncing. Just live singing and live instruments. So if you like music with style and substance, then put this album on the must-buy list.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|Rodney Copperbottom (McGregor) is a old-model robot with dreams of inventing.  He sets out to the big city of Robot City to find Bigweld (Brooks), an inventor who is always looking for new ideas.  When Rodney gets there though, he finds Bigweld nowhere to be found.  Instead Phineas T. Rachet (Kinnear) is in charge, with the help of his mother Madame Gasket (Broadbent) who is really pulling the strings.  Their plan is to get rid of the outmodes and make everyone into \\"upgrades\\" that are all shiny new and resemble Rachet.  It seems that even in the robot world, greed is a problem.  Rodney sets out with some new friends to find Bigweld, and make things right. <br /> <br />This is a great looking movie.  Children and adults will be drawn into the robot world.  Full of gadgets and bright colors, there is always something to catch your eye in every frame of film.  The public transportation is a wild and crazy Rube Goldman-esque ride through the city that is fun to watch.  The voices behind the robots are all solid with Robin Williams being the only standout as Rodney's friend, Fender.  You can't help but wonder how much of what he says is scripted and how much was just ad libbed. <br /> <br />\\"Robots\\" is good family fun for all.  With the adult humor that has become standard for animated features in recent years, adults will not be bored.  The ideas of following your dreams and being yourself are nothing new, but they are presented well.  Fox has also showed that they can make animated movies as well as Pixar and DreamWorks, which can only lead to higher and higher levels of movie making in the future.  I highly recommend \\"Robots\\".
B0006IIPIK|4.0|ok so it's not deep, it's not the best acting ever, but it's one of the greatest homages to the old movie classics i have ever seen, it's style is breath taking, as a fan of those old films, it was great seeing them on screen, the goxzilla cameo, king kong, lots of action, jungles, it has it all.

B00004WEJZ|2.0|This movie is not based on an Ian Fleming book. I read them all many years ago. Okay I can live with that since I have enjoyed most the later movies that were not based on Fleming's books. I especially like the ones that Pierce Brosnan has done. The movie just plods along, but never makes you say wow like the other Bond movies have done. I can't take Sean Connery playing Bond in a movie that lacks anything new and exciting. His acting is good as always, but it is like watching him in a remake of \\"Hunt for Red October\\". What's the point? I liked the original \\"Thunderball\\" but I don't need to see a remake that lacks inspiration. I have all the Bond DVD movie sets and even the comedy \\"Casino Royale\\" which although the same title as an Ian Fleming book, has nothing in common with the book. I will not buy this movie though since the story isn't new and the movie is only mediocre. I think Sean Connery is one of the finest actors of our time and I love all the other movies he made with MGM, but I think this one does not measure up to the other movies.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I did not like this film.  It might have had a great concept, looked good via story boards, but the end result was just.  boring.  How do I know it was  boring?  It was so boring that I fast forward the DVD scenes for a good twenty or so minutes jumping to the end.  We all know the movie, I am sure.  Two chaps wake up chained in a bathroom.  Sounds like something from Married with Children eh?  But not this, some psycho (like there is not one hanging around every corner these days?) did this two them and they have to \\"piece\\" (excuse the pun) the clues together to solve the mystery.<br /><br />The movie tried too hard to have psychological horror and gore horror.  The psychological horror seemed, at least to me, as if it was trying too hard to be suspenseful and terrorizing to the mind.  Solid clues and hit and miss clues just didn't go over well with me.  It seemed to me as if the direct was trying to throw all the old and new cliches together (i.e. Hitchcock meets SEVEN meets X-Files meets CSI and on and on and on).  In this case, the charming psycho (who we think we see but ahh the ending the ending) kidnaps lads and lasses who are having a poorly lived life from their own making and puts them through a psychological horror test to see if they regain the appreciation for living.  For example, the torture of a young lady who takes drugs, well she will get a bit of a headache if she doesn't learn to appreciate her life.  This headache will be a everlasting one due to the fact that if she fails this test, her head explodes.  Charming?<br /><br />Then there was the gore.  We all know there is going to be gore in a movie called Saw (as if you would be thinking this movie is aimed toward helping you with wood working techniques).  Now it wasn't the kind of gore you would see in, say, Freddy vs. Jason or Seven.  The film writer and director tried to have the gore too sinister.  The film tried too hard with this department too.  An example of on of the gore scenes that was a bit subdued but still a bit to the ol' stomach is when some fellow who has a bad life has to find his way through a maze of razor wires due to the fact he tried to commit suicide (not the best way to help people with mental handicaps if you ask me).  If he makes it, he lives, he doesn't.  So he is cut to shreds.  Even better we are hit repeatedly by the images of gore.  Again. and again.  and again.  I think we get the point here, at least I did.<br /><br />I dont know.  I am sure many of you like this film, and I am sure it has some good qualities.  But for me, someone who's seen many a film come and go, eh, I just would rather read a book and go to bed then watch this snooze of a movie.  Maybe though.  Maybe what bothers me the most is that, taking into account the psychological horror and the gore, we are suppose to ... in some sick way ... say that what the psycho killer is doing is good.  Like with the girl who takes drugs.  She \\"regains\\" her humanity or something to that effect.  Are we suppose to say that this sort of treatment is good? I dont know.  Maybe I am giving this film too much credit.that was a bit subdued but still a bit to the ol' stomach is when some fellow who has a bad life has to find his way through a maze of razor wires due to the fact he tried to commit suicide (not the best way to help people with mental handicaps if you ask me).

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Even De-Loused at the Comatorium couldn't prepare you for this. I've heard some brilliant music over the past five years, but I'd have to say this one takes the cake. And as many others will probably go track to track analyzing every sound, I want to take a moment to describe another side of why you should add this to your cart immediately and request rush delivery. This is an album that will make you feel things. <br /> <br />The kind of feelings you get when you know you're listening to something truly inspired, even when it missteps. The kind of feeling you get when you hear a musical idea and it literally takes your breath away. The last two times I heard an album that so bravely took such a broad - dare I say thematic - approach to its sound were the first time I heard Dr. Dre's The Chronic and Tool's Aenima. And I find it extremely difficult to categorize this album, even though the most obvious way to categorize this sound of soaring vocals and wailing drums, bass and guitar is simply rock and roll. One listen, though, and one look at the huge list of musicians who participated in the making of this album, rife with strings and horns, will reveal its greater depth.  <br /> <br />Exploratory, fearless and unhinged are the most appropriate ways I can describe what The Mars Volta have done with Frances the Mute. It feels so free and unstructured at times that I can't fathom how this band could keep this material faithful to the record in concert. But that's a good thing. It's as if this album, and The Mars Volta's sound in general, is truly organic and a protest to everything pre-packaged and compact that has always - but seemingly much more lately - flooded the music industry. But instead of doing it with blind rage and mindless raucous noise, TMV is doing it with ear-shattering virtuoso performances.  <br /> <br />And many might not be prepared for it. Many might find the eccentricity of having the influnces of Jimi Hendrix, Tito Puente, Led Zeppelin, Iggy Pop, Suicidal Tendencies and Chick Corea all present on the same album, sometimes on the same track, a bit overwhelming. Many might be bored by the long, seemingly aimless passages of noodling and quirky sounds. Many people aren't used to such broad, loose musical structures. Learning to enjoy jazz and classical music at an early age has probably helped me appreciate such musical gestures, and I urge any who find this album meandering to just slow down and listen to the what is being played. Listen to what sincere creativity and musical exploration sound like. You're hearing the most well-made and forward-thinking music you can spend your money on today - and be grateful: The way today's music industry built on cross promotion and product association is going, it may one day be a crime to create such glowing work.  <br /> <br />Don't even think twice.
B000002H33|5.0|This is my favorite Metallica album. My favorite tracks were; \\"Battery\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\", \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", and my favorite track of all, \\"Damage, Inc.\\" The other tracks were great, but didn't really have anything that was as outstanding as the tracks previously mentioned.
B0006213WG|4.0|As a band, Sum 41 has an extreme amount of potential, both skill wise (as demonstrated in songs like The Bitter End) and in terms of their songwriting abilities (Some Say).  However, the album that seems to come with the intent to serve as the American Idiot to their Green Day, the band's magnum opus, falls a little short.  (The band denies any larger purpose for this album, but the consistent lyrical depth alone makes it clear that the carefree nature of past albums is gone, at least for this project.)  Themes such as blame and trust are thrown around often, but not so deliberately that the listener is sure it's on purpose. More time could have been spent on the lyrics; it's a sad thing for a band as talented as this to get caught up in the words. <br /> <br />Intro- This 40 second instrumental piece paints a bleak picture of society.  It is extremely well-written, and features Brownsound's delicate but well placed guitar work. <br /> <br />No Reason- From the very beginning of this song, it captivates the listener.  It is a high-powered start to the album and is very well-written.  While overall not a remarkable song, it is catchy and interesting. <br /> <br />We're All to Blame- Had Chuck been the grand culmination of Sum 41's work thus far, We're All to Blame still would have made the cut.  The change in tempo from verse to chorus is well-planned and alters the seemingly predictable course the song starts down.  It does not dabble for too long in the self-pitying chorus and keeps the listener interested. <br /> <br />Angels with Dirty Faces- This song flows in the same vein as the intro, but the tone is more angry than melancholy.  It is high energy and moves quickly, but the high point of the song is the bridge.  It is well-placed and focuses the listeners straying interest. <br /> <br />Some Say- A nice change of pace to the album, Some Say slows the pace down, but does it without becoming too much like a martyr.  This is a fresh track with interesting counterpoint in the vocals and an interesting drum part.  It does fall into lyrical clichs, however, and one does question any affiliation with the Oasis song \\"Some Might Say\\". <br /> <br />The Bitter End- Without question, this song was written to feature the exquisite guitar work.  Solos are reminiscent of Metallica and very refreshing to hear from a modern band.  This song is just what the listener wants to hear at this point in the album. <br /> <br />Open Up Your Eyes- This song sounds a little too close to Linkin Park for comfort, and not only in the bridge, when the lyrics and rhythm are frighteningly similar to \\"Place for My Head\\".  In addition, the lyrics are far too vague to hold any weight, and it is clear that the main focus in writing them was making them rhyme. <br /> <br />Slipping Away- This song is weak on the whole.  It falls into the trap of Simple Plan-esque self-pity that Some Say avoided earlier.  Musical and lyrical clichs are happily embraced and recycled throughout the song, but to its credit, the harmony in the vocals in the beginning are well-placed.  The bridge does not take the song anywhere new and is not very satisfying to the listener. <br /> <br />I'm Not the One- The lead into this one is intriguing and draws the listener in.  The vocal is surprising when it comes in, and the song's refusal to sound the way the listener expects it to makes it a very strong number. <br /> <br />Welcome to Hell- The listener is reminded of The Hell Song (off \\"Does This Look Infected?\\") and is a great second chapter.  This song moves quickly and remains entertaining; pent up rage, frustration and spite are released skillfully in this song.  The instrumental bridge is especially captivating and original. <br /> <br />Pieces- While at first listen, this ballad seems as sorry for itself as Slipping Away, the band's second single off the album features much more attention to detail.  The instrumentation is very nice, and while the theme is a little tired, the wording is original.   <br /> <br />There's No Solution- The bass line shows great writing, especially in combination with the guitar line.  This song is exceptional; it isn't predictable and reminds the listener again of the Intro to the disc. <br /> <br />88- Although the beginning of the album is stronger than the end, Chuck closes with a bang.  Again, the band's experiment with different tempos is a success, and this time around, both the fast and slow are expertly written.  It wraps the album up nicely by again featuring impressive guitar, and the drums that were consistently strong the whole album remained so.  As it winds down, the high tones are reminiscent of London Calling (The Clash), as many other songs are, such as Time and Time Again (Chronic Future), but it elaborates on the much-imitated ending with a musical base and added vocals. <br /> <br /> Despite its shortcomings, Chuck is an excellent album that would appeal most to pop-punk, alt rock and emo fans, but can be appreciated by any music fan at all.  <br />
B0007GAEGC|3.0|That is strage. <br />This CD wasn't on the charts late last night.  <br />I guess people were watching PBS last night. It was on the air for about 30 min. <br /> <br />I myself was quite mesmerized by the women, the lighting, the orchestra, but when I listened to the CD, I just couldn't feel what I felt while watching the show. <br />I guess it isn't too bad. But if you're a serious music listener, you'll be bored with it after the fourth time.  <br />The voices are angelic, but they don't have much depth, and the numbers are all arranged and recorded quite poorly.  <br />Pretty voices, pretty tunes, but a shallow album.
B00009TB5G|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The Two Towers extended edition is absoultely great.  My whole family loves the movie.<br /><br />I am probably one of the odd-balls that hasn't read the books, so I can't complain about how they do and don't match up.  For me it is just a great movie to watch with my teens.
B000002UR7|4.0|A lot of people bash Pablo Honey, namely because Radiohead became so much more as the years progressed. True, Radiohead's later albums are superior to this grunge-britpop fuse album, but the album in itself is a decent one. <br />Here is a rundown of the songs on the album: <br /> <br />You: Very agressive opener that sets the tone for the album. Pretty much an angry pop song. Sometimes hurt by its three guitar attack. 8/10 <br /> <br />Creep: Radiohead's most popular song and also personally detested by the band themselves. Its basically a song of angst and inadequacy in the face of love. Its popular for a reason. 9/10 <br /> <br />How Do You: Anthem-like, rock driven song where Thom basically screams a lot. Its a catchy song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Stop Whispering: Very catchy, pleasant pop song. Almost drowns in its own electric guitars, but a good song nontheless. 8/10 <br /> <br />Thinking About You: A beatiful acoustic piece about a man who loses the woman he loves as she becomes famous and drifts away from him. This song is beautiful and alluring, and drives its point into the listener. 10/10 <br /> <br />Anyone Can Play Guitar: Very scratchy, upbeat tune with references to Jim Morrison. Neat Song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Ripchord: This is a solid song, probably the one on the album most benefited by the three-guitar attack. 8/10 <br /> <br />Vegtable: This song is somewhat overplayed, but the lyrics are very good: 8/10 <br /> <br />Prove Yourself: Starts off very good, but dies in the three guitar attack. One of the major flaws in this album is most exhibited in this song. 7/10 <br /> <br />I Can't: Decent song. That's about all I can say. 7/10 <br /> <br />Lurgee: A beautiful, soothing song. The lyrics are very simplistic and nothing is overdone. This song stays on a mellow plane until the very last note. 9/10 <br /> <br />Blow Out: A neat sounding song with cool lyrics. Not the best song on here, but it warrants a listen. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Creep [Clean]: Just creep again. The radio version without the profanity. 9/10
B000002H2H|5.0|I thnik this is their best album. some filler in the middle, otherwise its perfect.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Tim Burton is a genius and I applaud this film to show that fables, tales and stories told in rural parts of America can have real meaning in the end. The cinematography, art direction, acting and casting are superb. My only trouble with the film is that the stories spun by these rural people, which they pass on to their children and grandchildren are not always the innocent, charming and poetic lore the film paints them to be. They have been responsible for a lot of suffering and pain for a lot of people. They are often the catalist for misunderstanding, prejudice and ignorance we see in much of our society today. This film reminded me so much of my father, who passed away 3 years ago. He was also from the south, like Mr. Bloom in the film. I still feel the effects of the tales he told me as a boy and the pain it caused me and my family as we grew wiser and learned the truth. It was not charming, so in that way, this film did not ring true for me.
B0000019PA|5.0|I bought this album in 1998 and ever since it has been one of my favorites. I first heard the song \\"ghost\\" and the untitled song after, while at work, with the radio in the background. The song came on and I thought \\"holy crap. Who is this?\\" I had to find out. I bought the album, and with each new song, the hairs on my arms stood higher. The singing saws blow my mind to this day. \\"how the notes all bend and reach above the trees\\". Ahh! Anyway, I never thought it would catch on. But, after reading page after page of these adoring reviews, I get the sense that the album is gaining steam. Word of mouth. I think that's great, because now the group memebers might be rewarded for their music. They have gone on to do other things, but they can always look back with great pride. It's great. To quote one of the musicians at the very end of the 8 minute long \\"Oh, Comely\\": \\"Ho-o-ly S***!\\"
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I would have actually liked to be able to give this two and a half stars, I feel that three are just too many, but two seems too harsh, even for this. <br /> <br />Let me put my cards on the table, I liked Discovery a lot, but was less impressed with Homework.  I just felt Discovery had a little more soul and I loved the neo-disco feel, Homework felt kind of cold. <br /> <br />Cold is the first thought that came to mind listening to the contents of Human as well.  Ironically, as has already been mentioned, Discovery felt more \\"human\\" to me, there was a certain warmth and almost, dare I say, magic to it, like listening to the CD gave me a sort of warm glow. <br />But now we come to Human After All, and suddenly all the vocoder use and repeated samples really do make them sound like a machine rather than people.  Am I supposed to be laughing at the irony? <br /> <br />It's not horrible, indeed I'll go so far as to say I really like a few of the tracks.  Of course I like Make Love, just like everyone else, it actually suits the massively repetitious style they've used.  It comes the closest to feeling like my favorites from Discovery, it ALMOST recaptures the magic.  I enjoy Human After All too, but after a while it starts to get old, I just want to say \\"come on, come up with more lyrics!  you proved you can do it with Digital Love, why the sudden lack of inspiration?\\".  Robot Rock feels like another potential classic, it's still seriously repetitious but I see it getting lots of play wherever it is they play this sort of thing. <br /> <br />Now on to the bad..  First off the apparently universally hated Emotion.  Oh boy.  Why is it the worst track is also the longest?  And why call the flattest dullest song in the pack emotion?  More irony?  And how about On Off.  It's 19 seconds of the sound of changing the channel on the TV or radio.  Are they trying to be so avante garde they're putting a track on the CD that isn't even a song at all?  Do we get a track of a minuteof silence on the next track, their version of the blank canvas hanging in the modern art gallery?  Next we come to Prime Time of Your Life..  For a few moments it almost sounds like they're trying to be industrial rockers here.  And then they start repeating it over and over again (big surprise) only for a bit of splash and dash they also speed it up until it becomes a blur at the end.  Great, you have a jog control on your recording gear, very clever.  How about you have a song on the next CD that gets progessively quieter until you can't hear it at the end.  That'll really break new ground. <br /> <br /> <br />You know what though, I'm not telling anyone not to get it.  I'd advise serious fans of Discovery to make sure they listen to all the tracks first and know what they're in for, but those Daft faithfull among you will probably find enough here to keep you happy.  I was hoping for a lot more myself, but to tell the truth I didn't expect to get it.  As different as Discovery was from Homework I had a feeling this one was going to be different again. <br />
B000002GY9|5.0|This album has it all you come to espect from Tom. It has the pretty balads like Ton Traubert Blues even with his bad voice it does not ruin song. Then next there is step right up one of the most cleaver songs i ever heard as funny as hell he probably has not ever perform it live the same way twice. I also like I can't wait to get of work and the piano has been drinking they are sweet cute songs. I usually just like singers with good voices but i like Tom even though his voice kinda of sucks because he is a great songwriter.
1400032717|3.0|I bought this book on the basis of glowing reviews: \\"Amazing,\\" \\"Fascinating detective story,\\" etc. Actually, the detective part of the story doesn't last too long. And the regular tangents that give us insight into autism eventually become tiresome. I flipped through the last one-third of the book because I was no longer interested in these lengthy and largely irrelevant sidebars, and just wanted to find out what happened in the end. Even that wasn't too interesting.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card is a riveting tale of politics, war, and the will to survive. Card masterfully puts together a plot that drags the reader from start to finish. It begins with a conversation between unknown individuals, and fills the reader with anticipation about the upcoming events taking place. The book seems to aim at a rather large audience, probably from about 13 and above. It aims to please young adults by placing children above adults at an intellectual level, and showing that intelligence isn't indicative of age, it is inborn. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and thought Card showed great aptitude for writing in its creation. <br /> <br /> The story takes place on and above a futuristic Earth. The bulk of the story takes place at \\"Battle School\\", a large orbital space station where young children are trained for future military command. The characters include Ender, a child genius who shows great promise as a leader, Valentine, Ender's sister, deemed to gentle for military leadership, and Peter, Ender's older brother, deemed to violent, sadistic, and power hungry for leadership, and Colonel Graff, the man who \\"recruits\\" Ender for Battle School. He controls Ender throughout most of the book, and guides him, often unwillingly, along the past he believes Ender must take in order to save humanity. When evaluating this book, the reader must always keep the idea that the Card's vision of the human mind is that it is limitless, and that intelligence has no bounds. Card imparts to the reader that through ingenuity salvation is obtained. <br />  <br /> The book begins with Ender getting his \\"monitor\\" removed. The reader can derive from the text that this monitor is used to get into the mind of children deemed intelligent enough to garner evaluation as seen here, \\"And now the monitor was gone. The experiment entitled Andrew Wiggin hadn't worked out after all.\\"(5). Soon after, Ender meets Colonel Graff and decides to go to Battle School. From his initial submergence into \\"military\\" life, he is isolated by the command staff. As seen here, \\"There's only one boy on this launch with any brains at all, and that's Ender Wiggin.\\"(31-32) through Graff's praise he is hated by his launch group, and is therefore isolated by him. He eventually gains the respect of a fellow \\"launchy\\" (a derogatory term used for the new, very young cadets at Battle School) named Alai. Soon after, Ender is transferred out of his launch group in an \\"army\\". It is here the reader first sees a strong focus of the book, the battleroom. In the battleroom mock battles with lasers take place between opposing armies. The game is as psychological as it is physical, and it's primary task is to see how various soldiers react to various situations. To some, as seen in the character of Bonzo Madrid, Ender's first commander, winning is all, and that is done through strict discipline. With Bonzo, it is obvious that Ender is considered useless, as seen here, \\"But you will not pass through the gate until four full minutes after the beginning of the game, and then you will remain at the gate\\"(77). Ender eventually disobeys, and emerges at the top of the \\"standings\\", the ranking system for individual soldiers. Ender passes through many armies, and eventually is given one of his own. Through trials and tribulation at command, he eventually \\"wins\\", and after a 3 month break on Earth, is sent to Command School to finish his command training, and to soon after battle the Buggers, eventually destroying them in an magnificent plot twist at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> The book achieves its goal superbly. It conveys to the reader that age is not the determining factor in what one can do. The reader sees that though he is not yet a teenager, the fate of humanity is given to Ender. Power and maturity do not always coincide with age, which is also seen in the subplot with Peter and Valentine, where Peter effectively gains control of postwar Earth. The book tends to shy away from any sort of racial discriminations, besides the obvious hatred of the Bugger race, but it does dally rather heavily into nationalistic tendencies. It effectively imparts to the reader Card's opinions of human nature, where bully tendencies reign supreme. Even more effectively seen in the semi-sequel of Ender's Shadow, in all situations there will be those who strive to gain power and followers, and then abuse that power, often with cruel side effects. The author effectively develops his characters to a lifelike state, to the point where the reader has a clear understanding of the mood and temperament of each individual character, and there are quite a few of them. From Bonzo's prideful arrogance, to Ender's calm, benevolent understanding, the reader sees that Card uses superb character development in Ender's Game. Card also effectively creates a strong tone throughout the novel. The reader can feel Ender's anger, depression, loneliness, sympathy, and many other feelings through Card's excellent diction and syntax that effectively set the mood throughout the story. <br /> <br /> To conclude, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is an extremely enjoyable piece of literature. Though often a genre scoffed at by literary minds, Card shows that there are true literary masterpieces in this genre. Through his brilliant story, effective plot development, masterfully crafted characters, effective tone use, the reader of this book will not be disappointed. Ender's Game is an effective critique on human nature. Through battle for supremacy in the launch group, to the inner strife of the armies, to the battle for army standings, to the battle for the human race, and to the aftermath of that victory, the reader sees that Card effectively human nature in it's true form; brilliant, deadly, power hungry, but compassionate.

0143034901|3.0|This book promises a lot more in the first half than it is able to deliver in its second half.  Zafon vividly sketches about a dozen major characters in 1940s Barcelona but they become less and less believable as he pushes them toward the finish line.  By the end, it seems like every single encounter is dominated by moody Silences of the Doomed.<br /><br />Plus, despite its setting, the book has almost nothing to say about the Catalan people, which is quite an amazing feat for a book set in Barcelona!
B00025ETIW|3.0|At first I had written off this band as pathetic with lots over hype. After listening to the album numerous times I realized that they were actually good. Should they be headlining with Offspring, absolutely not, but hey bands become famous very quickly nowadays. Sort of like athletes. This is a good album, but whoever says its amazing, well I guess you were too young for the early 90's scene. That was amazing.
B00070DK5K|5.0|David Live, Bowie's legendary recording from Philadelphia's Tower Theater was one of the very first albums that I owned. I have been listening to the various versions of it for 30+ years and know every nuance, musical cue, lyric and sound emitted from the audience - well, at least I thought I did - until today. Though the performance itself, along with the arrangements in a `Philly Soul' style, was outstanding, the muddy production values on previous versions were accepted as a necessary downfall of the live recordings of the day. Yes, this new version is still a recording from 1974, and will never be technologically what it could be were it recorded in 2005, but what a vast improvement it is over the original. It's almost hard to believe this recording was taken from the same analog tapes as the others.<br /><br />I've given the new remastered release of David Live two listenings since purchasing it today, one on my average car stereo and one on my above-average home system (in stereo) and can report that the new version of David Live is nothing short of brilliant. I should say that I am very leery of the `remixed / remastered' marketing ploy in music industry, but difference between the previous versions and this release is remarkable.<br /><br />Gone is the flat, one-dimensional sound. Perhaps the most noticeable improvement is the aural depth of the concert recording. This is particularly true of DB's voice, as it reverberates with warmth and places him in front of the band. The stereo separation is also more pronounced, and the musician's individual instruments and backing vocals are clearly recognizable. The production can be described as clean and true, but not polished. On several tracks, the hum of the theater's sound system is actually audible, lending to the authenticity of the concert recording. The audience applause and cheers remain understated, but also seem to be more dynamic. And all of this on the stereo CD. I can't wait for the DVD audio version to be released in the US (it's available in the UK). Now if we could only see a re-release on vinyl - that may be asking a bit much.<br /><br />Tony Visconti oversaw the remastering of this version, returning the recording to the show's original running order and including previously unreleased material in order to do so. No filler here though. It's particularly interesting that Space Oddity was finally able to be included due to technology that simply didn't exist in 1974. (The song was sung into a telephone in the concert and the quality was so bad it could not be included on the original.) Another worthwhile feature are the new liner notes by Visconti and a complete list of DB's 1974 concerts - including cancellations.

B00080ZG10|4.0|hi folks, <br />THE Aviator - a movie about a man called Howard Hughes (Leonardo Di Caprio) who cared very much about aviation, who thought himself as a self divine power, who made is dream come true. His passion, madness, future thinking and belief in himself led him to extreme success followed by downfall. Martin Scorse is quite successfull in bringing the life of Hughes on the wide screen. Leonardo Dicaprio and Cate Blanchett also performed very well with supporting actors such Alec Baldwin and Kate Winslet who were not so impressive. But in few scenes Leonardo forgot that he was Hughes, Scorse forgot that he is in 1920-1940's and the crash scenes were shot such as we are watching The Matrix or I,Robot of 21st centuary not The Aviator of 20th centuary. overall it was a good movie (8.7 out of 10) if you got enough potential to sit for three hours.
B00009Z576|3.0|I think every one will agree that 1971-1975 was the heyday of YES. Nothing approaches the creativity of this period. Wakeman was good, but Kaye had his moments. Howe was an overall upgrade. Squire was constantly a superior bassist. Anderson had uniqe vocal stylings, if somewhat repetitive, and the lyrical content, no matter from what quarter, could get tedious if one is honest. <br /> <br />So what to make of The Y-uggl-ES? I'd heard a couple of tracks from DRAMA on the radio (late night of course) many years ago. Thought it was decent, but nothing to run out and buy, especially when $$$ was extremely precious and very fine judgements needed to be made where to allocate it. <br /> <br />But this is good. Better than 90125/Big Generator stuff IMO. 90125 has some good cuts (I do like it overall), but BG (what I've heard of it) makes my head hurt. When the chicks started to dig it, I had to punch out. Love didn't find a way and YES found a way out of my pocket book.... <br /> <br />Machine Messiah is good, though seems a bit contrived in its complexity. White Car - fine. Does It Really Happen - opens good, sustains a punch. Into The Lens I liked the few times I heard it on the radio, haven't changed my mind. Tempus Fugit-very good, but overhyped a bit as an all time classic. I like Into The Lens a little better. <br /> <br />Overall the album is very punchy, Alan White seems to be a lot more upfront in the mix (to my ear). Very riffy, though Howe still has his affectations that makes him Howe popping in now and again, but doesn't become tiresome. It just has a fresh sound, but is still proggy without sacrificing totally to the pop element.  <br /> <br />There just must have been something about this time in the prog timeline - between the heavy prog period of the 70's and the 'sell outs' by Yes, Asia, Genesis, etc etc. IMO this disk and Genesis' Duke (also 1980) could be played back to back and be in the same groove. Lighter and new wavey in spots, and crunchy in others. But still this side of the prog fence. Not that some of the 80's stuff from the prog guys in general wasn't good stuff, but I'm just in a different place when I want to listen to it. It's the difference between music for the road and errand running and music for the headphones and dimlights. This is still for the headphones and a couple hours of 'alone time'. <br /> <br />Squire is said to see this as the low point of Yes, but I wonder if he meant the material produced for this album, which is, overall, very good, or the subsequent tour when Horn's voice couldn't handle the strain of singing a key higher than he was naturally made to, and Squire refused to change the key in which it was played. It is felt the live shows suffered at the end, and the seeds of discontent were sown. <br /> <br />
B00079FUI6|4.0|First off, let me begin by telling people that this is an excellent show, that is full of interesting characters, and storylines that engage the viewer. Its an absolutely great show, that when I found out was to be released on DVD, I was so excited. This and \\"Lost\\" were my two favorite new shows of the year. <br />  However, when the press release came out, it indicated that, although this was filmed in HD Widescreen(aspect ratio: 1:78:1), it was indeed being CROPPED to a lousy  and inexcusable 1:33:1(Fullscreen. Please understand that you are not seeing everything that was meant to be seen in that scene, and that is why I am  having to give it four stars. Everything else looks awesome. Awesome extras, Great cover art. \\"Desperate Housewives\\" needed to take a page from how the \\"Lost\\" DVDS are being presented and release this show the way it was shot....In Anamorphic Widescreen.

0060012218|4.0|The novel Geography Club is about a kid named Russel who goes to Goodkind High School.  He believes he is the only gay kid there.  Then, he is shocked when doing a search online and instant messeging another boy who goes to the same school and is also gay.  The two meet up and attraction begins. Russel is always talking and thinking about Kevin, but denies there's anything going on. After Russel outs himself to his good female friend Min, she reveals that she is bisexual and has a girlfriend Terese .  Those three, along with another friend from Terese named Ike, meet up for pizza after school one day.  They come from a diverse group of people at school, part jock, part geek, and somewhat in between, they have to think of a creative way to hang out, without having people notice and getting suspicious.  They create a club that nobody would be interested in: the Geography Club.  Things aren't perfect and sweet for long though.  After disputes, problems, and overall disorganization, the club is falling apart.  Can everyone remain true to the club, and true to themselves?  I think this novel is quite well done.  I do think that the overall story line is highly original and interesting.  However, I also feel the main character Russel is very predictable and somewhat cliche.  The book is an easy fun read.  So if your looking for excitement, you've definitely found it.  If your looking for a book to challange your mind, this wouldn't be the one.  Many of the sentences are 7 words long and very basic english is used. <br />Anyways, I would recommend this book because it does a good job of making you feel connected with Russel.

0684833395|5.0|I'm a recent college graduate and having just finished the book, I'm wondering why my prof in college didn't make us read this instead of something as sleep-inducing as Moby Dick.   <br /> <br />I took up this book because I was just curious at what exactly the term Catch-22 means.  I found the answer out pretty early in the book but by that time, I was hooked. <br /> <br />To put it in simple terms, this book is crazy. <br /> <br />The book is crazy because it's funny, sad, horrifying, touching, romantic, and ridiculous all at the same time.  The basic plot, you've probably had a good idea from all the other reviews.  But the juice is in the writing. <br /> <br />Please don't be put off by all those \\"best book ever,\\" \\"modern masterpiece,\\" and \\"deep meaningful complex book of great importance\\" claims.  I promise you:  this is not Moby Dick. <br /> <br />The book introduces us to a world that we've never seen before with logics that we've never considered.  And strangely, after reading it for a while, I began to accept all of these logics.  I mean, of course I have the right to do what you can't stop me from doing, right? <br /> <br />So yeah, get this book and start reading it now.  It's very very good!  And the fact that you're reading something that many people consider the \\"best book ever,\\" \\"modern masterpiece,\\" or \\"deep meaningful complex book of great importance\\" is just a nice bonus.

0375507256|5.0|I sensed that David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas would be unlike any other book I've read when, about 40 pages into it, the storyline stopped at the end of the page mid-sentence. I flipped forward a bit, licked my fingers to unstick the pages, and counted the page numbers to determine what was amiss. Nothing, as it turns out - Mitchell intentionally stopped mid-sentence and flashed forward in time from the mid 19th century South Pacific to early 1930's Europe. <br /> <br />The back cover was of no help in trying to determine what the novel was about: \\"postmodern...Nabokovian...fiction that reveals how disparate people connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.\\" Thanks. The back of the title page was a bit more helpful: the Library of Congress categorizes Cloud Atlas under \\"fate and fatalism.\\" Finally, in his acknowledgements, Mitchell hints that Nietzsche's philosophy will play a role in the novel. Now we're getting somewhere. <br /> <br />I won't give away how the six stories in Cloud Atlas, from six different times and settings, blend together. Each is presented in a unique style and voice, with five of the six reminding me of Toni Morrison, Ray Bradbury, Thomas Pynchon, Choderlos de Laclos, and a contemporary author of your choice. (The sixth is in the style of a sub-par mystery thriller.  Were the rest of the book not so brilliantly written, I would suspect Mitchell missed his mark here; as it is, it seems he intentionally low-browed this segment to add to the pulp fiction feel.) <br /> <br />Don't let any of this put you off. Cloud Atlas is neither intimidating nor obtuse. It is in fact fun to read. Amazing, then, that the novel comes across as optimistic when most segments begin after a major international conflict, racial and colonial domination is a major theme, and more than one of the major characters die before the novel's close. <br /> <br />One of the characters, evoking Cloud Altas's structure in musical terms, describes the novel thus: \\"a 'sextet for overlapping soloists'...each in its own language of key, scale, and color. In the first set, each solo is interrupted by its successor: in the second, each interruption is recontinued, in order. Revolutionary or gimmicky? Shan't know until it's finished.\\" I've finished and I can say that Cloud Atlas is perhaps 90 percent revolutionary and 10 percent gimmicky. Read it and decide for yourself.

0393312836|5.0|For those who enjoyed the Stanley Kubrick film, A Clockwork Orange, the novel will serve to be the Special Edition of the film, complete with deleted scenes and an alternate ending unknown to those who have not read the novel.  <br />   Inside this novel by Anthony Burgess, he explores the capabilities of free will, and the transformation from boy to man. With tools like character, theme and language, Burgess succeeded in creating a not-so-distant future with a language solely reserved for teenagers and a government struggling for control of its people. <br />   The main character of the novel is a teenager named Alex, who is the leader of a gang of his droogies. Each night they prey on the people on the streets committing acts of violence which bring them joy. As Alex sees the blood running from his latest victim he is filled with ecstasy and this passion only serves to drive the violence onward, \\"it was real satisfaction to me to waltz... and carve left cheeky and right cheeky, so that like two curtains of blood seemed to pour out at the same time,\\" (17). This violent nature is only amplified by the fact that Alex is a boy who appreciates fine music from the composers like Ludwig Van Beethoven and many others, however the music only serves to inspire more violence, \\"for now it was lovely music that came to my aid...and I could just slooshy a bar or so of Ludwig van...and I whished out my cut-throat britva,\\" (53). The fact that Alex is young with a violent intelligence creates a world controlled by him exclusively; there is no room for another competitor, not even the government. <br />   Through Alex, Burgess also introduces the themes of free will and also the question of when a boy becomes a man. Alex chooses to be bad, it is what he knows and that is what he will do. He will commit acts of violence until he is stopped. When he is arrested however, the government offers Alex a chance to get out of prison if he volunteers to be part of an experiment in which he watches films. Early into this experiment Alex realizes that these films are violent in the most gruesome ways, films of concentration camps, rape, and murder. These were things that used to thrill Alex, but now they begin to make him sick, \\"I had like pains all over and felt I could sick up and at the same time not sick up...I was heaving away but could not sick, viddying first a britva cut out an eye...while red krovvy shot on to the camera lens,\\" (104). That was the experiment, to rid Alex of any pretense of violence, \\"he will be your true Christian...ready to turn the other cheek,\\" (129), and to fill him with only the drive for peaceable actions inside society.  <br />   The theme of growing up comes in the final chapter of the novel, the chapter that was not included in Kubrick's film. Alex has been out of prison and finds himself not wanting to perform the old violence in the streets anymore, instead he wants to make a family and grow old with children of his own, \\"like a picture of me sitting before a bolshy fire in an armchair...I seemed to have turned into a very starry chelloveck, about seventy years old,\\" (186). By having a main character like Alex, Burgess was allowed to show through the world of Alex, the themes of free will and mental growth. <br />   I agree with Burgess and his views of society. The only person who should have the power to change one's mind is the sole owner of that individual mind. When the state tried to take Alex's mind away from him people began to take advantage of his inability to defend himself. Through this failure in reprogramming I believe that Burgess demonstrated the dark side of government and how far they are willing to go to preserve order. Also the use of an entirely new language which was created by Burgess brought the reader into the world of Alex, and made them a part of his gang, seeing what transpired through the eyes and mouth of Alex. <br />   Anthony Burgess wrote a fantastic novel featuring a character named Alex, who armed with a razor and a language all his own brought violence to the streets and also spoke toward the dangers of government control. After his release from the prison Alex becomes a man no longer interested in the violence of his childhood, now he is interested in starting a family and having a son that would grow up and resemble his father. This fact made the novel complete in my eyes, bringing Alex from violent teenager to passive adult made the novel a complete masterpiece. Burgess created a novel told by a teenager, a novel that was to read by a teenager. \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" (192). <br />
B00008BRB5|5.0|\\"Synchronicity\\" was known by the band to be the last album they would record together. Sting was ready to explore his jazz interests, and was ready to leave his new wave/reaggae/rock band behind. It is always a pleasure to see a legend leave on top of their game, and that's exactly what the Police did with this album.    \\"The Police\\" were pretty much the world's biggest band in the early 80's. \\"Zenyatta Monetta\\" and \\"Ghost in the machine\\" were both best sellers when they were released. However, Sting and the boys had other interests to explore outside of their band. They knew that this was to be their last album together, and to make it their best. This included being ambitious and smart with their music arrangements and lyrics. The Police put this all together on \\"Synchronicity\\" to become the #2 album of 1983.    As much as a group effort as \\"Synchronicity\\" is, more than anything it is Stings album (much like \\"Wham!'s Make It Big\\" was George Michaels album). The biggest cuts and hits from this album focus on Stings distinctive vocals and humming basslines. Also Stings interest in complex psychological takes over, making for less calypso/reaggae numbers of simplicity and more of a variety of music with worldly and jazz influences. It helps in making \\"Synchronicity\\" a critics and consumers favorite.    The album launched five singles, four which hit the top 40, three which hit the top ten, and one that hit number one. \\"Synchronicity II\\" is a complex song full of lush arrangements, with the lyrics dealing with bland and boring suburban life middle aged adults face. \\"King of Pain\\" is a dark song with a fast beat to it and very complex lyrics making metaphorical comparasions. It hit number three on the charts. \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" deals with the mind games that men and women play with each other and what they truly are thinking about when they are courting one another. Again, he uses a deep vocabulary in the song, along with Indian sounding style to make for another complex song. It hit number eight on the charts and is the last charting single by the Police. \\"Every Breath You Take\\" is the infamous number one hit and also the biggest song of 1983, inching past Michael Jackson's big three of '83 (\\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Say Say Say.\\") Written by Sting overnight when he awoke from a dream, the song remains one of the most misunderstood songs in history (along with the Eagles \\"Hotel California\\" and Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\"). It is in essence NOT a love song, but instead a song about inner thoughts and feelings of a stalker when finding their crush. The pop arrangements of the song and the humming bassline from Sting made it the most pop/rock style song on the album even though the dark lyrics hid another meaning. It also foreshadowed Sting's solo career as this was truly his song, though it is credited to the Police.    The other songs are okay. \\"Synchronicity I\\" is another complex song. \\"Walking with a dinosaur\\" and \\"Mother\\" are pretty basic filler, \\"Oh My God\\" is Sting's confession of losing his belief in religion and faith, and \\"Tea in the Sahara\\", the only non-charting single, is a beautiful way to close out the album, a foreshadowing of things to come with the mysterious, jazzy feel it had, which is what Sting worked a lot with in his solo career.    After releasing the album, the band launched a worldwide tour, which lasted until early 1986, making that truly the year that they broke up. Unlike the Beatles and Led Zepplin who didn't give a final tour, it was nice for fans to get to see the legends live one final time. Going out on top is a rare feat for people to do, but \\"the Police\\" did it with \\"Synchronicity\\". It allowed Sting the ability to start his solo career with nothing hold him back.
0743455967|4.0|This book is for people who are both aspiring writers _and_ Stephen King's fans. If you are one _or_ the other, the book is conveniently divided into `C.V.' and `On Living', the autobiographical parts; `Toolbox' and `On Writing' itself, the master class part, sandwiched between the other two. The autobiographical parts are enjoyable (the guy knows how to tell a tale), and that gives credibility to what he'll say on the parts about writing. However, the only advice aspiring writers will get from King's autobiographical musings is, `don't do drugs while writing - it will spoil the good moments of performing the craft.'  Because of this, I will concentrate on the longer `On Writing' stuff. <br /> <br />King constantly complains that he's always asked `where do your ideas come from?' and never about the language in his stories, so he continues by focusing on the language. He touches a bit of everything: narration, description, dialogue, the pitfalls of prose (repetition, overuse of adverbs, passive voice), the writing market, etc. This makes it a good introductory book if you'll want to read more books about writing after digesting this one. `If' because, as King informs us, most of the other books aren't worth your money; the only exception is Strunk Jr.'s and White's 'The Elements of Style'. <br /> <br />You can sense an underlining boastfulness in King's prose so strong that I decided to pick up his `It' after having read `On Writing'. I was somehow disappointed by the language in that book. There was an expression (`quagmire of mud') too often repeated, and I was able to catch a few `Swifties' (adverb-laden dialogue attributions such as `\\"The Losers,\\" Mike Hanlon said softly.' and `\\"But of course,\\" Rose said demurely.'). I don't know if those were intentional or not, but I could spot fewer of those blunders in King's more recent works like `Dreamcatcher.' Do as I say, not as I did. <br /> <br />Speaking of advice, there is a moderate amount of practical advice in `On Writing.' Rather than giving advice, King tells us about how _he_ writes, and then you take from that whatever you find useful. For example, as I'm not much of a first-draft-second-draft writer, the formula `second draft = first draft - 10%' didn't make much sense to me. <br />
B0007NFL18|4.0|No hatin.  This a good cd for 50 but not like GRDT.  When you tell the whole world that you gonna sell more then your last we expect that you are.  I dont think he can do it.  He needs to be more versital.  All he do is talk about the same sh$t.  The only reason why he is selling so many now is because of the stunt he pulled with Game.  He was mad that Game was getting more hype then him.  Its al bout the paper tho.  4 stars is good for this.  Not 5.  It's too many rapper's out there that can eat him alive.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind was one of the most breath-taking anime films I have ever seen! I've been a huge fan of anime for most of my life, and Nausicaa has made me love it even more! <br /> <br />Nausicaa is one of Hayao Miyazaki's (creator of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, etc.) earlier films. To be frank, it came out in 1984, I believe. However, don't make the mistake that because it's a little old, the animation isn't very good. It was gorgeous! It gave that indescribable feeling of it being REAL, unlike so many animated works today (including Japanese animation). <br /> <br />The characters are realistic and inspiring. The main character is Nausicaa, princess of the Valley of the Wind. She is a sweet sixteen-year-old girl who is not afraid to fight for the good of others. Being an older teen girl myself, I found myself almost cheering out loud for Nausicaa. She has become a sort of role model for me. Another good character is Asbel, prince of Pejite. He's a strong character; a good role model for the men watching.  <br /> <br />Since there are so many other reviews, I won't go into detail about the plot, but PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! It has a beautiful message woven into its lush world that will leave you really thinking. Also, Joe Hasaishi's soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. <br /> <br />The dub work was great, with Alison Lohman as Nausicaa, Shia LeBeouf as Asbel, Uma Thurman as Kushana, and some other famous names.  <br /> <br />All in all, Nausicaa presents some very real messages and characters that make you want to watch it again and again.
B00078XGRO|5.0|I am not going to review the film itself since the disc has already been out for several years. <br /> <br />Instead I wanted to comment on the new collectors edition treatment.  The added extras are a great addition since the Borg essentially carried the villian story line through seasons 4-7 in STTNG.  Seeing more about them and their Queen adds to the flavor of the story. <br /> <br />The added DTS soundtrack is superb, surpassing even the great DD 5.1 mix in the original disc.  The Enterprise flyby of the Defiant is amazing! <br /> <br />Even though this is a double dip for most Star Trek fans, I recommend it and it is a must buy for anyone that does not yet own this excellent film!
B0007TKH66|5.0|A lot of people slam this show. However, it was a brilliant concept and a great pilot episode. Too bad the people behind it lacked talent for execution of good ideas. They should have hired a better writing staff (like that of season four) and let them take the series where no series had gone before. <br /> <br />And while most episodes in season one were very good, about one out of every 5 were pretty bad. Terra Nova with it's not so clever alien language morphed from English was a low point. But others were super episodes including the hailed Shuttlepod One, which was one of the best Trek episodes of all time. <br /> <br />Out of the 26 season one episodes, at least 15 to 20 were very good, and better than the first seasons of Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager, all of which took 2 to 3 seasons before the great episodes actually outweighed the bad ones in any given season. <br /> TNG had season 3 before it found it's footing. DS9 had to let Avery Brooks Hawk-ify his role before things got good. And Voyage floundered aimlessly like Battlestar Galactica 1978-lite until 7of9 came on board.  In most cases I started watching the previous series in their first season, then bailed out only to return years later when it was in syndication. Even now, I never watch reruns of seasons one two and three of any of those series when they air.  <br />But Enterprise had me at hello. I watched it from beginning to end, and never missed an episode. Sure, season two lost some focus and had too mainly aimless episodes. And season three had it's single story arc which they couldn't keep interesting for a whole season and ended up havng filler episodes to avoid showing the holes in their storytelling ability. But season four got it all right. And just like the previous series, season four was to be the real start of better things to come. But it got cancelled. <br /> <br />People scratch their heads and wonder why it couldn't get the ratings to stay on. Yet no one recalls thatall 3 previous series launched in syndication, not on UPN solely. In fact UPN launched on Voyager's back as a network, yet I watched Voyager on the local Fox network which played all Trek shows in syndication. SO ENTERPRISE was the first of the series to actually only have UPN as it's home. So less people were able to see it. Somehow people forget that. <br /> <br />And when we talk about Trek people who slam Enterprise heap praise on the original series, which I can happily say I can't really bear to watch a full episode of. For the time, it was revolutionary, but out of that time... well, it's aweful. No doubt about it. It stinks in a modern context. But then again, I was not born until 5 years after it got cancelled, so I had no original point of entry. The first original Trek cast thing I saw was ST 4 The Voyage Home. From there I became a fan of Trek. <br /> <br />But it is perspective. I like the New Battlestar Galactica quite a lot, but I love and adore the original which came on when I was 8. The original was a classic and will always be. Yet some of the fans of the new series who were born less than 2 decades ago, seem to have a hatred for the original, which offends me. I am sure my dislike of the original Trek offends some of those fans similarly. >But I digress. <br /> <br />Enterprise is great Trek. But like all Trek, is flawed by often weak writing and poor executive producer mindset. But everyone knew that going in. And if they say they didn't, they are having selective amnesia. Go back and watch Seasons one of TNG, DS9 or Voyager. Then watch season one of Enterprise. Tell me which of the four has more quality episodes.  ENTERPISE. Pound for pound, more satisfying than the others.
B000003N7G|5.0|For those that get this album it is nothing short of a masterpiece. For those that don't it is anything but a masterpiece. Before judging this album one way or the other I recommend multiple listenings over a fairly extended period of time. Try listening to it 8 or 9 times over the period of a couple of weeks. I've actually known people who at first thought this album was awful, but after a while their ears opened up to it and they absolutley loved it.
0767802470|5.0|Most war films are separated into 3 categories I find: aerial dogfights, ground combat or subs/battleships. Das Boot can be looked at as the quintessential submarine movie. Although at some places it can be long, as most director's cuts are, it's still filled with enough tension that can't be cut with just a simple knife.<br /><br />One nice thing is that instead of following the typical Hollywood \\"view history from good guys\\" perspective, we're now looking at Germany. Hitler seems to love his U-boats, enough to send them to attack british naval ships. One such boat is the boat we'll be tracking for 3 1/2 hours. Added aboard is a newspaper correspondent who's not used to this kind of thing.<br /><br />One thing that separates submarine films from combat films like Saving Private Ryan is this more focused look on suspense. Rather than dealing with gunfire, explosions and screaming, you have to be deadly quiet or else you'll be picked up and depth charged. So the most suspenseful moments in the film are the quiet moments, and in one part, we're focused on the depth meter of the sub underwater. At around 200 feet, the sub can't take the immense pressure of the water, so we're dreading that needle going any lower.<br /><br />One thing that I found was that I started caring for the characters even when I didn't know their names, I only knew their faces. But standouts like the calm and collective captain, the chief who wants to get back home to his wife, and the lieutenant who's also a newspaper correspondent. The rest you don't really get too attached to.<br /><br />The ending to me works but then kind of doesn't. It's supposed to be a \\"war is hell\\" ending but it seems to come out of left field a little. But, it is quite a good film even if it is 3 1/2 hours long(and don't even mention the 5 hour miniseries version, ugh).

B0007Y08IS|5.0|Everyone should see this movie, provided they don't have a problem with swearing and mild violence. I was in tears and pain from laughing so hard during this movie. And even if you don't watch this entire movie, you have to rent it, just to see the sex scene. Brilliant!
0671027573|5.0|I've heard a lot about Linda Howard over the years but have never found the time to pick up one of her books and read it. I even have a copy of Under the Boardwalk (an anthology written by several authors) signed by Jillian Hunter and have been meaning to peruse it. Then one day, I picked up Mr. Perfect and started reading. Did I like the book? Let me put it this way, I finished it that weekend - my housework didn't get done, I was a couch potato, we ate take-out, the laundry piled up, and I read the entire time. Wow, was it good!<br /><br />What I liked most about this story was that Linda Howard made me burst out laughing at times. Her characters were very down to earth and believable, and I found myself cheering the spunkiness of Jaine Bright, the lead female in this tome.<br /><br />Jaine Bright and three friends/co-workers meet at a bar for drinks once a week to ponder life. The trouble begins one night, when they started joking around about what characteristics would make up \\"Mr. Perfect\\". A list is conceived for their future entertainment, including not only personality characteristics, but physical attributes as well (Oh My!). When the list is published by accident, getting national attention, it only adds fuel to a psychopath's belief that these women must be destroyed because they are making fun of him - after all, what kind of woman would describe physical attributes that he didn't possess?<br /><br />The first friend is killed and the other three feel it's just a terrible coincidence. But when the second friend is killed the day of the funeral, a sick feeling begins to envelope Jaine as she realizes that she too is in grave danger.<br /><br />Ok, so that is a bit much, and pretty basic for a plot line, but when you combine that with the sexy detective, Sam, who just happens to live next door to Jaine, then the really great story line comes into play!<br /><br />It seems that Sam was working undercover when Jaine first moved into her new house and Jaine thought her neighbor was a drunken bum. Since he was \\"stumbling\\" in when Jaine was leaving for work, she assumed the worst. But when her friend dies, she finds out that Sam is the only one who can protect her and find the identity of the killer.<br /><br />Yes, the story line seems a bit predictable but the witty conversations, fantastic sense of humor shown by Howard, and the character development make this book worthwhile!<br /><br />This is not your ordinary mystery, it's much more. And I'm very pleased that this novel was my introduction to an author about which I'd heard great things. I can't wait to find another one of her books!use and Jaine thought her neighbor was a drunken bum. Since he was \\"stumbling\\" in when Jaine was leaving for work, she assumed the worst.

B0000AM6K2|1.0|Maybe as an infant, and subsequently, Josh Rouse heard some of the mainstream soft rock fare from his high chair in his parents home and his inspiration for \\"1972\\" possibly came from groups like Sailcat(\\"Motorcycle Mama\\")- America(\\"Ventura Highway\\")- Seals & Crofts(\\"Summer Breeze\\"). I'm not knocking those three bands - they issued some memorable classic pop during their respective runs. 1972 was a much livelier year for music than Rouse's vision and interpretation suggests here. I vividly recall mainstream Pop artists[to name a few here]such as Paul McCartney(\\"Hi,Hi,Hi\\")-Carly Simon(\\"You're So Vain\\")-Raspberries(\\"Go All The Way/I Wanna Be With You\\")-Temptations(\\"Papa Was A Rollin' Stone\\")-Led Zeppelin(\\"Stairway To Heaven\\"-a radio staple Fall '72) soaring all over the radio and charts with inspired upbeat, rocking offerings which three decades later, make Rouse's \\"1972\\" sound lifeless, lackluster and uninspired - his band doesn't even sound like they warmed up for this mush. Even the soft rocking Carpenters experienced fan backlash when they issued their rocking \\"Goodbye To Love\\" power ballad that summer, another Top 10 hit! Josh Rouse has been known to produce higher quality music than this stale oatmeal he served up on this platter - it doesn't stick.
0375713751|4.0|In general I liked this book. The author does a great job portraying the working world and the unfairness in how women are treated. The constant barrage of sexism from those who are simply unable to see it rang true to me! And while others have said they were impatient with Kate's desire to compete with the \\"Muffia\\", I'd have to say that, while I refuse to compete also, I too feel the pressure. That Kate can't resist it is just a part of her character. Too many reviewer, in my opinion, wanted her to be perfect, and were angry when she wasn't. By contrast, she seems like a lot of women I know.<br /><br />At the same time, the author doesn't do as good a job at conveying Kate's love for her children. They come across more as an annoyance that get in the way of her true passion, her job. Since there were supposed to have been 4 years between her 2 children, it made me wonder why she ever had the second one! When she described her frustrations at work, I FELT how she felt; when she talked about her love for her children, I didn't feel it at all. She seemed to be claiming something that wasn't real.<br /><br />I also agree that the ending didn't quite ring true. It was too abrupt and did in fact read like the author had a great story that she couldn't quite work out how to end. Still, I enjoyed the book, and some parts were truly memorable, even lyrical.
B0007P3582|1.0|The Massacre : No Stars    In this gangsta rap album without gangstas, 50 goes after jadakiss, nas, fat joe and many others, songs are stupid, beats are pathetic and the gggg G-Unit catch phrase is the worst catch phrase creation of all time.    and 50's talent worse than MC Hammer.    This is absolutely the worst albums of 2005 and it surely won't be a classic anytime soon.    Big Thumbs Down for Me on the massacre.
B00000JCB2|1.0|As crappy as this band is, and as ridiculed as they are now, there are much bigger fish to fry. Limp Bizkit these days are the butt of  pretty much all music enthusiast humor, from the lowliest of ex-Nu Metal freak to the grandest of musical elitest snobs. Whilst I completely implore the public's decision on their hatred of these morons, there are still bands that roam freely with very little critisism, I.E Slipknot, Dashboard Confessional, etc. <br /> <br /> Trust me, we all know that Bizkit sucks. Making fun of them isn't funny anymore.  I used to feel nothing but hatred for Fred Durst (especially with his self-indulgent and incredibly lame cover of Townshend's classic Behind Blue Eyes), but nowdays, \\"Noone knows what it's like, to be hated, to be faded.. to telling only lies\\", I can honestly see where Fred is coming from.  Everybody hates him now. I wouldn't really feel over the weather if I were him either; even with his riches, it means squat if absolutely noone respects you. Now insulting Fred Durst is as passe as actually listening to him. Lets move on, people.

0930289234|5.0|This book is basically about characters which are quasi-versions of JLA superstars. It is set in separate universe, so there is no Batman or Superman, but there is high tech guy in a flying mechanical bird and ex boxer who could be cousin to Wolverine.<br /><br />It describes a tension of cold war and menace of atomic war really well.<br /><br />The story progresses slowly through lives of main characters: someone started eliminating costumed ex heroes and ex villains and some old heroes get back together to find out who did it.<br /><br />This is THE best Alan Moore's work (if you are not rabid horror fan, though) and story was quite logical, considering when it was written. The Rorschah character story  is so well written that it can sell the book itself.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Since their debut of 'Hybrid Theory' way back in 2000, I have never really considered Linkin Park a good band. Although at the time many people were calling them simple 'Limp Bizkit' rip-offs, they were more than that. But is that really saying much? This is Limp Bizkit were talking about, and I dont really need to explain to you how I feel about them (in short: they're awful). Well, even though their debut 'Hybrid Theory' wasent too great, it had some interesting elements, and they were somewhat better than most of the lame, generic nu-metal bands at that time period. I gave 'Meteora' a chance anyway, even after not liking 'Hybrid Theory' or 'Reanimation' too much, because I thought they had some potentential, and because countless people reccomended this album to me. Well, its not much of an improvement, and I think the reviews who say that this is the \\"Best cd ever!1!1!1!\\" dont know too much about music, and need to start listening to more than what MTV and their local radio stations play. 'Meteora' isn't horrible by any means, but Linkin Park have a long, long way to go before being considered truly great musisians. Some songs on here are decent, but the lyrics aren't too great, and while the musicmanshiop is decent, its really amateur stuff, and I have heard a million times better than this. If you're a brain washed MTV addict who listens to eveything they tell you, then buy this album, log on to Amazon, and write a five star review saying how it is the greatest album of all time and how Linkin Park is the best rock band ever. Ifi you're a free thinker who knows what quality music is, skip this, and listen to something like Malevolent Creation or CKY instead (and dont watch that terrible Viva La Bam show). You can thank me later. This is just a horribly mediocore album from a band that needs alot of work.
0684830485|5.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls, by Ernest Hemingway, tells the story of Robert Jordan's mission to blow up a bridge during the Spanish Civil War and takes places over the four days prior to the blowing of the bridge.  This fictional war novel which takes place in the pine covered hills of Spain, discusses the themes of the futility and barbarity of war, death, and friendship. <br /> Robert Jordan is an American fighting in the International Brigades against the fascists in Spain. The orders he is given are brief: \\"To blow the bridge at a stated hour based on the time set for the attack\\"(13) \\"so that no reinforcements will come up over the road\\"(14).  With these orders, he slips across the battle lines and meets up with a band of gorilla fighters led by Pablo, an experienced gorilla warrior.  This small band of fighters is to assist him in taking control of the bridge so he can blow it up as ordered.  Over the next three days he lives with Pablo's band and learns about true friendship.  He also learns about true love when he falls in love with a girl named Maria.  Robert Jordan reflects \\"I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time.\\"(402).  Jordan, feeling that his time is limited, lives life to its fullest in the four days and firmly believes that he has been lucky.  \\"And you had a lot of luck, he told himself, to have had such a good life.  You've had as good a life as any one because of these last days.\\"(491).  Ultimately, the end of the novel leaves an optimistic and pessimistic feeling with the reader; Hemingway leaves it to the reader to decide how they feel at the novel's conclusion. <br />  Hemingway brings forth several themes in this novel.  The foremost is the futility and barbarity of war.  Nowhere in the novel is this stressed so well as Pilar's account of Pablo killing the fascists in the town of Avila.  Pilar says of it: \\"all of it [is] ugly.  Even that which is glorious...it is brutal\\"(112).  The fascists who were in the town were \\"beaten to death with flails and thrown from the top of the cliff into the river\\"(116).  This story is the most brutal example of war in the book and successfully shows that \\"war is a bitchery\\"(489).  Another important theme is death.  Death is discussed before El Sordo, the leader of another band, dies in a standoff with the fascist calvary.  \\"One's death is difficult to accept.  Sordo had accepted it but there was no sweetness in its acceptance even at fifty-two, with three wounds and him surrounded on a hill.\\"  He goes on to think, \\"Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it nor fear of it in his mind.  But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill\\"(330).  The novel reinforces the fact that death must occur, but shows that life is far more pleasing.  Lastly, the novel discusses friendship.  Jordan finds true friendship among those he has known for four days, but must fight alongside.  Jordan notes, \\"Anselmo is my oldest friend.  Agustin, with his vile mouth, is my brother, and I never had a brother.  Maria is my true love and my wife.\\"(402).  Ultimately, it is shown that those which life and death occur with, understand each other the best and become the closest together. <br /> Hemingway constructs an extremely believable story with the novel.  In part he does this with the style he uses.  Hemingway uses a formal diction for the narration and a informal diction for the dialog.  The informal diction fits the characters well since one would expect them to speak in that manner.  Hemingway also uses Spanish words intermingled with English to remind the reader that they are in Spain.  This technique is done effectively, although one must guess at some meanings if one does not know Spanish.  Hemingway also effectively paces the book.  Robert Jordan spends only four days with Pablo's band, however, the pacing is slow enough to include alot of imagery of the setting and enough detail about the characters and the war to develop the themes. Hemingway is able to stretch the time out, especially before the battles, just as a person living through them would experience it.  As a result, the reader gets a slight indication of what life in war is like.  With this in mind, if Hemingway's goal was to write a beautifully narrated, well paced and believable war novel which causes a reader to think about the themes it brings up, then I believe he achieved his goal. <br /> Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls is not simply about blowing up a bridge during a war.  It is about who we are as people and what it means to live and to die.  I believe Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an enjoyable story and an education, just as Robert Jordan received when he lived his life in four days.  The title comes of the book is an allusion to \\"Meditation XVII.\\"  \\"Any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.\\"  Hemingway sought to leave the reader with an appreciation for mankind.  For when one dies, everyone dies; and when pain and suffering is brought on one it is brought on all.  Without a doubt Hemingway effectively and pleasurably presents these ideas while narrating a tragic but wonderful story.  I would highly recommend this book, as it is a true classic.
B000002UAU|5.0|I was reading the other reviews here, and the kid is the only one who gets it right. This is a terrific album! If you're like me and the weird, trippy Beatles music is your favorite, this album is for you! Don't listen to those other people, they're crazy! Buy it and enjoy it!  <br />\\"A Day in the Life,\\" is my favorite Beatle song, by the by.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I stumbled across Celtic Woman on PBS last night and was captivated by the lovely sound. I will buy the DVD. However, it all had a \\"been there/done that\\" vibe to it. The Enya selections sounded like Enya's arrangements, \\"Theme From Harry's Game\\" sounded like Clannad, and all the arrangements sounded like reprised Riverdance. Those aren't bad things, of course; the ladies and their voices/playing are lovely and the chorus and musicians are excellent. It just sounded to me like 5 new performers doing Enya, Maire Brennan/Clannad, Katie McMahon/Anuna, Eileen McMaster/Carol Lavelle, etc. They most certainly did it well. For me, \\"There's A Place For Us\\" (exquisite) and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" were more exciting.
B00008EY65|4.0|A flick that can easily rival XMEN, but unfortunately , than characters are a little more complex than \\"Dude with metal claws that kicks ass!\\" or \\"Hot chick that can move things\\". That's one thing that I loved about this movie, and it's a welcome change. The movie is centered around Hellboy ( Ron Perlman ) and a gang of pseudo Xmen as they live among human, battling evil in all of it's forms, etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie rocked (the best part was Selma Blair's blue fame thingy), unfortunately, the plot was so overwhelming, than fans will be left wondering if Hellboy #2 (if there is one) can measure up! But hell, I can't wait for it!<br /><br />Acting - 3.5<br /><br />Fight scenes - 4<br /><br />Sfx - 4.5<br /><br />Plot - 3<br /><br />Time given to go to the toilet - 2<br /><br />Good first date movie - 3<br /><br />Total - 3.75
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I am blown away by the music on this album.  It is so beautiful.  My favorite track is the song Danny Boy.  It is a  solemm Celtic standard that is usually performed when someone dies.  It sounds very peaceful.  I also enjoyed the song Ave Maria.  The harp playing gives this track a very romantic quality.  Orinoco Flow is another highlight on this album.  This song  sounds even more powerful and majestic when performed by an excellent emsemble of musicians like Celtic Woman.  I also enjoyed the fiddle playing on the track The Butterfly.  I thought this track sounded playful and fun.  The fiddle playing on the Ashoken Farewell conveys a sense of sadness and sentiment.  Another noteworthy  song is You Raise Me Up.  This track sounds very inspirational and uplifting.  I loved listening to this CD.
0141301155|4.0|This book could be seen by some as an allegory of modern conservative-Republicanism run amok. A CEO traffics in human cargo and destroys indigenous tribal cultures to provide cheap labor for his company and protect against corporate espionage. The haves (Salts, Teavees, Gloops, etc.) all grow wealthier, fatter and more demanding at the expense of the hardworking have-nots (the Buckets.) Overweight children, kids with ADHD and post-feminist loud-mouths are skewered, while the child who keeps his mouth shut and plays by the rules of corporate culture is the ultimate winner.

It's over rated.  <br />Metal is better.\\" <br /> <br />Excuse Me? Is your English off?  You decide that because you don't like punk that you are going to bad mouth a cd you probably have never heard? This cd is great and I love it.  These guys brought a new sound to America that has rocked the nation. People have said it before and I'll say it again without the Ramones, no Green Day, no Blink-182, no Simple Plan, no Good Charllotte.  So if you have an open mind unlike In Flames 666 \\"Death metal pioneers\\" get this cd and try it out.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I first heard of Kanye West when glancing through the back of one of my older Rolling Stones.  His 'All Falls Down' music video was listed as fourth or fifth on the Editor's Choice list, which I duly forgot within twenty seconds of seeing.  Last October, however, I got into my friends car and was astonished at the completely amazing song that was playing on his stereo: All Falls Down.  R&B meets beautiful rap meets a guitar hook that for some reason reminds me of the Clash?  Unheard of! <br /> <br />Turns out that this wasn't the only good song on the CD.  When I got it for a christmas present from my mother, I immediately popped it into my stereo, where it stayed for the next two weeks.  It was amazing.  Besides the addictive hooks and rhymes so slick they make rapping look easy, Kanye has something I haven't seen a lot of since the days of Public Enemy and Run DMC: political belief.  In an era where even the best rappers find it easier to rap about smoking, pimping, and homicide, Kanye drops in rhymes like \\"you know the kids gonna act the fool/when you stop the programs for after school\\" (We Don't Care), \\"let some black people walk in/I bet they show off their token blackie\\" (Spaceship), and \\"To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah/Jesus walks with them\\" (Jesus Walks).  This is a man who's taking on the oppressor, big brother and the treatment of America's poor all in one go. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />All Falls Down <br />Jesus Walks <br />The New Workout Plan <br />We Don't Care
B00000099Y|5.0|I love this cd! Its a personal favorite and I get a tingling sensation when ever I listen to Aenima or Stinkfist.  Tool thank you so much for this album it has helped me with stress and sorrow.  Get this cd and I'm not overating it this cd is really good.
B000696PWC|5.0|Now *this* is how you do a greatest-hits package: two CDs, nearly every conceivable major track from the artist, original versions of all the songs, sound quality exceeding the original albums in every case, and a smart package with extensive liner notes. Bravo! <br /> <br />That being said, you won't think much of this compilation if you don't like Kylie's music. For a big fan like myself, this CD is fantastic. All my favorite songs of hers are here: <br /> <br />\\"Got to be Certain\\", \\"The Locomotion\\", \\"Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi\\" (sounding the best it ever has), \\"Shocked\\", \\"Breathe\\" (my favorite Kylie song), \\"On a Night Like This\\", \\"Love At First Sight\\", \\"Slow\\", the list goes on and on. <br /> <br />Monster hit \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" is included, along with current smash \\"I Believe In You\\". <br /> <br />Some tracks I hadn't heard before have become staples in my CD player (\\"Can't Start Giving You Up\\"). <br /> <br />An excellent job by EMI on this collection. Five stars!
B00009KM7U|5.0|Ok now listen up here this is one group u should NOT pass up. Im telling you this is the best music i EVER heard.Why you ask? Ill tell you just that. You know how you listen to a CD and your like I dont like that song skip it then you have to use all that energy to press the skip button. Well guess wut they have so many AWESOME songs on there that you wont want to skip any of them. It is like the first cd where they made all the songs good. There lyrics are what really make it great. They really pull you in and make you think. These are the most thought thru lyrics and they mean somthing. If you havent already gotten this Cd you better go get it now no joke. This is my first review and I felt I really had to tell people about how good they are cuz they deserve to be spread around. It doesnt matter what kinda of music you like The Postal Service is music.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The \\"Rolling Stone album Guide\\" once opined that not liking the Beatles was perverse, like not liking the sun.  <br /> <br />They were correct, and I don't trust someone who doesn't like the Beatles. Interesting, then, that when President Bush was asked in an interview once what his favourite Beatles album was, he was at a loss... <br /> <br />These are the #1 hits by the greatest band ever to plug in an electric guitar; the band more people of every generation alive love than any other; these are the songs they proved they loved by buying them; therefore, the greatest CD ever released.  <br /> <br />Plus, it sounds great. Buy it now.

B000294SFW|5.0|Having been a Motorhead fan for twenty five years, I must admit, I found some of the band's material circa early 1990's to be somewhat lacking.  Motorhead had become too \\"generic\\", while some of the songs packed a bigger punch live, the studio efforts were coming across as \\"by-the-numbers\\" Motorhead, not terribly memorable or interesting, not awful, but not good, either.  \\"Hammered\\" was a pretty good album, however, and \\"Inferno\\" is in my opinion the best Motorhead studio album since \\"Bastards\\".  The production is a lot cleaner, albums like \\"Sacrifice\\" had a sort of cheap sludgy sound that wasn't truly representative of the band's talents.  The band has really come together as a three piece after struggling for a while to define themselves, Lemmy is in fine form throughout, and having seen Motorhead on their 2005 tour I can attest they are as tight and savagely loud as ever.  This is a solid, ass kicking rock and roll album, as performed by men who know what they're doing and are utterly unrepentant about it.
0385510438|4.0|The Last Juror started off excelent, it had a great plot and Grisham built on it well. It may have started to stray somewhat in the middle of the novel, though I still enjoyed it thoroughly. I have been reading many complaints about how Grisham focus's more on the characters than on the \\"Suspense\\" of the novel. I agree that the book wasn't really what you might call suspense, but it was just as good if not better. I became attached to the characters and I actually cared about what would happen to them on an almost personal level. Not many books I have read have made me feel the same way as The Last Juror. I commend Grisham for this and I recommend the book for anyone who likes reading books for more than just a heartpounding, suspense, thriller.
B0000666DW|1.0|The title of my review says it all.  I want to be a rock star too.  I think what I will do is go get me some amplifiers, musical instruments, and a jackyl.  Then, I will puncture the jackyl's wind-pipe, set fire to the equipment, and then record the gurgling howls and firey explosions - and sell it to Mastadon fans for $15 a disk.  I'll make a killing!  People will say, \\"Oh, that Robert Barnett is such a technical musician,\\" or they'll say \\"Man, all those jackyl noises, he must truly be a dedicated and emotional musician.\\"  Folks, this is not heavy metal - hell, this isn't even music.  If you are a hard core Mastadon fan, you need some serious help - or as I like to call it, \\"metal rehab.\\"  Get yourself some Black Sabbath, Cathedral, and Pantera albums, get a good buzz going, find someone willing to have some good sex - and let the rehab begin.<br /><br />Mastadons belong in museums, not on stage.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's enormously influential sophomore effort, Led Zeppelin II, demonstrates the energy and intensity that the band was capable of creating. The album is the most consistently heaviest of all the band's releases (Though some would argue that this is true for the amazingly overrated Physical Graffiti double-album) and also, I believe, runs more fluently from beginning to end than all other Led Zep albums.  <br /> <br />Also, without retracting any respect for all of Led Zeppelin's other albums, Led Zeppelin II is unique to the band's releases in that every song on the album is a classic: <br /> <br />[Whole Lotta Love] - The biggest radio success from the album is an undeniable Zeppelin classic. Page's immediately recognizable riff is often considered one of the best of all time, and rightfully so. The presumed drug-induced mid-song nonsense is followed by a fantastic solo by Page, which then segues into some trademark wails from Plant. All in all, a great hard-rocker. <br /> <br />[What Is and What Should Never Be] - Although this song does not receive a lot of recognition, it is truly one of my favorite Zeppelin tracks. WIaWSNB has a bit of a jazz feel to the verses with Bonham tapping lightly on the cymbals throughout them, but kicks in with a hard-pounding (if perplexingly-worded) chorus. A very underrated Led Zep classic. <br /> <br />[The Lemon Song] - Perhaps the weakest track on Zep II, but not by much. A cover of an old blues tune, originally entitled \\"Killing Floor,\\" The Lemon Song exhibits obviously sexual lyrics and some intriguing tempo changes, but lacks a certain undefinable quality present in the rest of the album. <br /> <br />[Thank You] - With clich lyrics (compare to Jimi Hendrix's \\"If 6 Was 9\\") and a lack of any true stand-out guitar licks, the acoustic \\"Thank You\\" would seem to be, at first glance, the weak track on the album. However, Plant's scream of 'for you to me are the only one' overshadows all of the songs flaws with its sheerpower and emotion. <br /> <br />[Heartbreaker] - A true embodiment of the entire album, Heartbreaker is my favorite Zeppelin song of all time. The classic blues-heavy riff is accompanied by superb lyrics and vocals by Plant. What makes this song truly stand out, however, is Jimmy Page's dumbfounding guitar solo, which he performs partially with no assitance from the rhythm section. Heartbreaker is one of the greatest guitar performancesby any guitarist ever. Truly incredible. <br /> <br />[Living Loving Maid] - Another riff-driven catchy rocker that flows nicely from Heartbreaker. This being true, it is often played back to back with Heartbreaker on radio. The chemistry between Page, Plant, Bonham, and Jones is especially impressive on LLM, making it yet another classic on this album. <br /> <br />[Ramble On] - Here, John-Paul Jones turns in one of the best bass performances ever recorded. This is also one of many Zeppelin songs featuring Plant's Tolkien-based lyricism, this one with mentions of Gollum and Mordor. Ramble On is definitely, you guessed it, a classic! <br /> <br />[Moby Dick] - An all-instrumental track that kicks in with a grooving riff from Page then regresses into a nearly 3-minute drum solo by Bonham. While John Bonham is arguably the best drummer who ever walked the earth, a 3-minute drum solo is boring. Sorry, John. <br /> <br />[Bring it on Home] - Another cover of a classic blues song, BioH begins and ends with Plant singing with some kind of speech impediment and showing off his considerably impressive harmonica skills. In between this, however, is sandwiched a fantastic hard-rocking, riff-heavy tune. The meat of this sandwich makes BioH a true...classic! <br /> <br />All in all, Led Zeppelin II showcases the group at their hardest-rocking, most energetic, and all-around best. He who has ears to hear, let him buy Led Zeppelin II! <br />
B000002U82|5.0|This cd will always be in my collection.  It doesn't get much play time these days, but I will forever respect this excellent piece of work.  It is one of the top ten albums I have ever heard.  It's theme of madness is a universal concept that every generation of music lovers will tackle and be fascinated with, which is part of its lasting appeal, I think.  As well as the fact that none of this music sounds dated to me.  \\"Time\\" is one of those songs that had to be made, if not by Pink Floyd, then someone, somewhere would have to invent it.  Same as \\"Money.\\"  But this album canot be broken apart and seperated song for song - it is a concept album done to perfection, beginning to end.  If you are a fan of rock n' roll, it is imperative to listen to this album.  You don't have to love it, but you gotta repsect it.  This music effected the history of music - and arguably, still continues to.
0060012218|4.0|Opening the scene in a boy's locker room, where the main character who knew he was gay was afraid, on some level, that his sexuality was obvious to everyone around him, was brilliant. Every gay teen, male or female, has experienced this. Imagine a co-ed locker room - but then remove the expected normality of the guys checking out the girls. <br /> <br />A gay teen absolutely cannot look at other guys in the locker room, although most do. They live in constant fear of being discovered. However, that locker room is the one place where they get a glimpse of what they're missing out on. And what are they missing out on? From very early on (perhaps too early these days) boys and girls start dating, start learning about their attractions to each other, both emotionally and sexually, and they (hopefully) begin to mature. This gives them a tremendous advantage over gay teens, who normally don't have an opportunity to start youthful exploring that should have begun at the same age as their straight counterparts until after they're out of high school. Thankfully, there are attempts at correcting that in some of the more liberal areas of the country. So, all gay teens have at their disposal is the ability to look. They can't touch, they can't kiss, they can't wonder if they can ask another boy (or girl) out for a date...all of that is off limits. Kudos to the author for taking us right into this taboo area. <br /> <br />Russel, the main character, knew that he was gay, and wanted to find other gays. He turned to the internet (which has helped and hurt the gay community, and the book is still out on what side it comes down more) to find other people like him. He was surprised to find out that there was an entry for his hometown, was more surprised when there was actually a person in that room, and then *stunned* to find that the person in the room went to the same high school with him. Eventually they agree to meet, and when they do meet, Russel is shocked to discover that it'sKevin Lands, someone he thinks is \\"hot\\", and someone who had a role in the opening locker scene. <br /> <br />Russel decides to confide in one of his closest friends, and finds that she is a lesbian - and has a girlfriend. They discover one other person who is gay, and decide to form a club, and they call it the Geography Club, thinking geography was boring enough that nobody would attend. <br /> <br />There are some very interesting subplots, mostly involving Russel finding himself in the \\"in\\" crowd, and then finding himself in the \\"out\\" crowd very quickly. While \\"in\\", he does something that he hates himself for, as it makes him a hypocrite. <br /> <br />This handles typical teen gay situations very well, and covers a gamut of emotions, chief amongst those honesty and betrayal. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />
B00007G207|4.0|Cinema Paradiso: The New Version is an extended restoration of the Oscar-winning drama from Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore that came out a couple of years ago. The almost one hour additional footage has (for me) lessened the overall charm that so permeated the original which I love.<br /><br />I was very enthusiastic to get the new version with added footage (Directors cut), but after viewing it, and still enjoying the film, I noticed a difference, but not for the better really. My mood wasn't as good as it had been on my two previous viewings of the original in the theater and at home. It wasn't until the following day when I was more awake that I remembered that some scenes were totally different and some of those added changed the entire mood of the last third of the film and it's ending. Most of the additional footage not seen in the original is devoted to the star-crossed love story bewteen Salvatore (also called \\"Toto\\") and Elena, and may give you some closure to their relationship. I thought the first version got it right by leaving the affair where most are left behind...far in the past. Alfredo the projectionist and mentor/father figure to Toto has also not faired so well in this new version to my eyes. He comes off more surly and a bit too domineering as an older man. Thank goodness with this new DVD you get both versions to relive the beautiful moments and you can decide for yourself which one you prefer. Both versions of this film about people who love films are still touching and at times haunting in a very sentimental but tasteful manner. I just like the old axiom: 'If it ain't broke..don't fix it'. I was going to watch the original on the other side of the DVD the next morning, but relied on my memory instead. Some other time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always been a fan of Green Day so when I heard that they were coming out with a new album I was happy, but I would have never expected that this band would release the best rock album of the year (and no, not one of the best, \\"the\\" best rock album of the year). It was one of those great moments, one of those moments when something totally unexpected happens, a moment when you hear a marvelous album, a album where every single song is excellent! These guys rocked, tore, and ripped this album to pieces with amazing skill. IT WAS SO SURPRISING!!! I've always looked at Green Day as one of my afternoon bored wanna just rock out lazy kind of day band, like Good Charlotte, Blink-182 or Yellowcard. I now hold these guys as one of music's most treasured acts. There's no point in talking about songs individually like I ususally do because, honestly, every single song is magnificent, of course I will say that \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is a masterpiece and will be one of the songs Green Day will always be remembered for, but this album is perfection of any genre. It proves that punk rock, alternative or whatever you want to call it, is a true and relevant art form of music. Go get this album, you won't regret it.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|What a refreshing role for Hugh Grant!  We've all seen him as the bumbling charmer, but those roles in the past seem to melt together.  ABOUT A BOY is different in that Hugh Grant's character shows more emotions, flaws, fears, and frailties.<br /><br />Hugh plays Will, a single 30-something guy who has never had to work a day in his life because of royalities he gets from a song his dad wrote.  While not working sounds like a great idea, it has turned him into an immature man-child that enjoys isolation and breaking his day up into \\"units of time\\" for different mundane activities, like surfing the web, playing pool, and watching game shows.<br /><br />Realizing that no self-respecting women will ever want anything to do with him, Will joins SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) to hit on those beautiful single moms that are so desperate that they'll even go out with him.  The fact that he has to conjour up an imaginary child is a small detail.<br /><br />Along the way he meets Marcus, a thoughtful boy of a single mom played by Toni Collette.  Marcus is mature and observant and very isolated at school, but not by choice.  As their odd friendship grows, Will and Marcus begin to fill the holes in each other's lives and in their personalities.<br /><br />This is an original story with great characters and a unique plot.  It will leave you with a smile and thinking about these characters you grow to care about for a while afterwards.<br /><br />Enjoy-
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I'm a former classic trained musician, played for 20 years and was blown away by the unbelievable talent these women have.  I even was able to get my teenage son to drop what he was doing to listen.  He has a great ear himself but I loved it when his jaw dropped.  The old standard Danny Boy almost had him in tears. <br /> <br />The control these ladies have in their voices and the complete production was so moving. <br /> <br />Thank God PBS bringing us quality like this.
B000059T1E|5.0|\\"John Barleycorn\\" was Traffic's first album after Stevie Winwood's time with Blind Faith. The album is far more jazz-oriented than their previous albums, though songs like \\"Medicated Goo\\" ( from \\"Last Exit\\" ) had indicated which direction their music might take.<br /><br />Originally Stevie had intended a solo album, but his old Traffic friends Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood soon came by, and Traffic was practically re-formed. Guitarist Dave Mason never rejoined the band, but made a short re-visit for the \\"Welcome to the Canteen\\" album.<br /><br />The title track, which got some radio-play here in Denmark at the time of the album's original release, was the song that made me buy the album back in 1970. This is an old traditional folk-song, beautifully arranged by Stevie. The early 1970's was the time when folk-rock was at its highest.<br /><br />The opening instrumental \\"Glad\\" is almost pure jazz, and though I'm not by far a fan of the that particular music-style, there is an optimism in the track that (at times) hits even me.<br /><br />\\"Freedom Rider\\" and \\"Stranger to Himself\\" are the closest Traffic gets to their old sound; both outstanding songs.<br /><br />Another favourite is \\"Empty Pages\\".<br /><br />The slow but majestic \\"Every Mother's Son\\" closed the original album.<br /><br />So apart from \\"Glad\\", I find all songs here among Traffic's greatest, and the album as a whole is a clear five star album.<br /><br />The bonus-tracks are interesting; but I think it's a shame to put the unfinished demo \\"I Just Want You to Know\\" in the listing as track 4. The song might have developed into a great song, but at this stage (with no finished lyrics ) it is, at best, interesting.<br /><br />The other outtake \\"Sitting Here Thinking of My Love\\" is much better and sounds more finished.<br /><br />The three final tracks come from a projected 1970 live album, which unfortunately has not yet been released.
0679424741|3.0|Besides this book, I have read \\"A Member of the Wedding\\" by Carson McCullers. It is very striking to me that when I read each of these books, my mental images of the characters and settings were in black and white. Well, really, I saw it all play out in shades of gray. The people and places in this book are dark, often dirty, lowly, depressed, depressing and teetering on the verge of hopelessness. <br /> <br />The title aptly states the novel's theme; the overriding feeling of the book is stark loneliness. The characters cannot connect with one another - even when they are trying very hard to do so. They don't have authentic relationships even when they think that they have found a soul mate. Each of them wants to share his or her inner-most truths, and without exception they are impotent in their attempts. They each have things that they want to do, talents that they want to express. In each case, they can't or don't overcome their personal burdens to reach their goals or to achieve any sort of success. In the end, they are each alone with little hope for a more fullfilling life. <br /> <br />The book is very well written. Each chapter is written as a stream of consciousness of one of 4 main characters who each move the story forward a (very tiny) bit. This book is all about characters. It is definitely NOT about plot. McCullers remains stylistically consistent throughout, which seems to be quite an accomplishment in this very ambitious first novel. <br /> <br />For me, reading this book is a literary accomplishment. I can check off another classic from my list of books to read. However, it was not a book that I found enjoyable. I would suggest that ambitious readers should tackle it. Its style, mood and characters are very effectively created and sustained. On the other hand, if you prefer plot, uplifting or hopeful themes, happy endings or characters that grow or overcome their limitations, you may not want to spend your reading efforts on this book.

B00004RF9I|5.0|With the possible exception of Stanley Kubrick's 1964 masterpiece DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, there hasn't been as sardonic or prophetic a cinematic satire as the 1976 classic NETWORK.  Thanks to the talents of screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky (MARTY) and director Sidney Lumet (12 ANGRY MEN), both of whom got their starts in the early days of television, NETWORK is a powerful indictment of television and its ability to make an audience believe anything it sees on that 21-inch screen.    The film revolves around a fictional fourth-place TV network, UBS, and its news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) who has just been canned because his ratings have slipped badly.  After announcing on the air that he is contemplating killing himself, however, the head honchos at UBS soon realize that they've got a potential ratings bonanza on their hands and exploit Finch's rantings and ravings for profit by making him \\"The Mad Prophet Of The Airwaves.\\"  Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway are the two who mastermind this, and William Holden is Finch's best friend, who can't do anything but sit on the sidelines as he sees Finch falling apart.    Eventually, however, Finch's rantings against corporate hypocrisy, including UBS being bought out by a Saudi Arabian-based conglomerate, attract the ire of the real head honcho (Ned Beatty), who steers Finch into telling the world that corporate control is a \\"good thing.\\"  The ratings fall right through the floor, and a disturbing decision is made by Duvall and Dunaway.    NETWORK justifiably won Oscars for Chayefsky's original screenplay, and Dunaway's and Finch's performances (the latter posthumously).  When it was released in late 1976, television network executives were openly dismissive of the film's savage attack on what Chayefsky perceived TV was becoming.  It seemed like a paranoid fantasy then.  It isn't now--not when we have nutjobs like Jerry Springer, Sean Hannity, and others turning television upside down with foolish stunts and political fascism masquerading as entertainment.  Chayefsky definitely saw this coming even then.  But in the guise of Howard Beale, he gave rise to a battle cry that has gone down in movie history: \\"I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\\"    Besides Finch and Dunaway, the entire cast, including Holden in one of his greatest roles, and Duvall in one of his most steely performances ever, explodes with gusto, and Lumet's precise direction keeps things rolling along.  It is Great American theatre, complete with extremely salty dialogue and concise points made about television's corrupting influence on people, and it definitely retains its considerable satirical and prophetic power today in the 21st century.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|In my opinion although it is not something that you play in your car at full blast but it (the cd) has very romantic songs so it is mainly for dates and weddings and what not. In short i liked it and i hope other people will too.
B000683VI4|5.0|Definitly a wonderful and emotional story line. I'm a guy and this movie made me full so emotional so............. what does this mean it means that this really is good movie.

Only the director could make this classic story and turn it into a wonderful movie. A truly touching story.
006072448X|3.0|Kevin is one of a recent series of \\"Columbine\\" books--those that try and plumb the characters of young boys who plan high school massacres.  Some are just bad (Vernon God Little), others are great (Project X).  Kevin falls in the  middle. <br />     Its major strength is the compelling nature of the premise--just what is it that caused young Kevin (in prison at the time of the novel's present) to kill several of his classmates and some school staff?  It's the sort of question we all know there is no real answer for, and yet we feel the need to ask it anyway. Both the question and the  need to ask it are examined through the course of the narration--structured as a series of letters from Eva, Kevin's mother, to her estranged husband and Kevin's father, Franklin. <br />  While the structure allows for a lot of introspection and detail, it also feels a bit gimmicky in places.  On the one hand, it's seems self-evidently clumsy when she spends so much time telling Franklin things he already knows, having lived through those same scenes.  On the other hand, that self-evident clumsiness eventually too obviously hints at what is supposed to be, as Publisher Weekly puts it, \\"a huge and crushing shock.\\"  Without giving much away, I'll say it didn't seem all that shocking by the time it happened and somewhat worsened the contrived feel of the structure. <br />  The other negative aspect of Shriver's choice of structure is that it locks us into a single voice, that of the mother, and over the book's 300+ pages, that voice starts to wear on the reader. Actually, it began to wear on this reader pretty early and Eva's voice was one of the major stumbling blocks to continuing the book.  She is not a likable character through much of it and though I give Shriver credit for taking such a risk, Eva is also at times not a particularly interesting person which makes reading her for pages and pages tough to do at times. Worse than uninteresting or unlikable, she can be downright annoying (whiny, self-interested, self-deluded, passive, unbelievable) which makes it even  harder to follow  her for so long. <br />   Character in general is a flaw in the book.  While Eva is tough to swallow at times, there are enough times of sharp insight (into people or society in general), of incisive humor, of complexity (a woman truly torn over motherhood) that one can sort of ride those moments over the rougher sections.  The other characters, unfortunately, almost never offer such redeeming  moments. The father, Franklin, is mostly a dolt, almost a caricature of one, and is simply too hard to believe.  There is denial, there is delusion, there is a reader's suspension of disbelief, and there is \\"I just don't buy a real person would be this dumb this often\\".  Franklin falls into the last category.  The sister, Celia, is far too shallow, far too docile, too clearly Kevin's opposite, and therefore comes across as more plot contrivance than character.  And what happens with her ratchets up the suspension of disbelief to the stretching point and then beyond. Other characters are barely felt, though even some of these are hard to believe (especially in a plot involving a school teacher and district board). <br />   The plot, as mentioned above, does have some major flaws of believability, especially as Kevin ages and his behavior becomes more serious. The book's strengths I think lie more in the pre-Kevin descriptions of Eva's honest ambivalence over motherhood and in Kevin's early, pre-vocal years.  After that his precociousness becomes more difficult to believe, as does his parents' passive response to his behavior and language.  His father is portrayed as more dumb and  deluded and other adults as more clueless.  And there's simply too much plot.  One of the reasons Project X is so good is that Shepard knew to keep it tight.  There is at times in Kevin agonizingly unnecessary detail.  And so much time detailing Kevin's behavior only makes it all the more  unbelievable that nobody does anything about it. <br />    As mentioned before, the big \\"surprise\\" at the end wasn't really all that surprising. The murders itself, when finally shown, are somewhat anti-climatic, partly because it's so hard to believe Kevin's set-up actually worked and partly because not only have we spent almost 400 pages aimed at them and being exposed to lots of smaller but similarly evil acts from Kevin,  but also because we've also been given in some detail many of the well-publicized actual killings such as Columbine etc.  But if the big shocker and the murder scene aren't all that successful, the ending is.  One just wishes it would have come sooner and cleaner.  There's are some real gems in We Need to Talk about Kevin, but they would shine a  lot more clearly and powerfully if the book had been cut by at least a third and if a few of the side characters had been more fully dimensional.  It's an interesting read, at times a compelling one, but also a slow and eventually disappointing one.  It's much, much better than Vernon God Little, nowhere near as spot-on or compelling as Project X.  Slightly recommended for its good parts and its close, with forewarning that it has a lot of flaws, any one of which might make you put the book down well before the end.

B00005ABX0|4.0|NOTE: I own the 1990 version of this twofer not the later remaster, so I'll comment on the songs rather than sound quality. Some others have said that the first edition transfers sound better because of the NoNoise processing used but I haven't been able to compare the two yet.<br /><br />\\"Smiley Smile\\"'s biggest problem is it will always be compared with \\"SMiLe\\". The album had HUGE hype around it: Rock critics had praised what they'd heard, Leonard Bernstein praised a track from it, Brian Wilson himself had referred to it as a \\"teenage symphony to God\\". Group politics, label pressure, Brian's own perfection, drugs and more all swirled together to in the end make it the most famous UNreleased album ever {well until recently at least..)(Visit [...] to get all the particulars). After \\"SMiLe\\"'s implosion, Brian and the rest of the Beach Boys had to cobble something together for the label and \\"Smiley\\": a combination of less produced re-recorded \\"SMiLe\\" tracks, completed tracks, and very drug influenced songs is what we got. Carl referred to it as \\"a bunt instead of a grand slam\\". but that's much too simplistic. Music needn't be glamorously produced to be memorable.<br /><br />\\"Wild Honey\\" was another huge departure from the usual Beach Boys sound as they celebrated R&B, playing most of the tracks themselves instead of using hired studio guns. It confounded most fans at its 1968 release.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Smiley's best bits include \\"Heroes and Villains\\", astounding even in its re-recorded form for its shifts of mood and multilayered sound. What Jimi Hendrix intended as a jab at the band (he called it a 'psychedelic barbershop quartet') actually points out how unique the song sounded. NOTHING has ever sounded like this tune. \\"Vegetables\\" is a charming health food ode, \\"Wind Chimes\\" is wonderfully eerie, \\"Gettin' Hungry\\" is a great rocker bouncing verses that sound like something out of a spaghetti western against the zippy organ infused chorus, \\"Wonderful\\" is at once achingly beautiful and shatteringly bizarre (check out the \\"hey ba ba rebop\\" interlude), and \\"Good Vibrations\\" was deservedly a #1 smash and a groundbreaking piece of art (Brian called it a \\"pocket symphony\\"). An alternate take of \\"Heroes and Villains\\" included is also breathtaking.<br /><br />\\"Wild Honey\\"'s successes included the joyful title track,  zippy #19 hit \\"Darlin'\\", \\"Here Comes the Night\\" is a passionate soul-infused midtempo rocker, and \\"Let the Wind Blow\\" is one of the finest mostly unknown Beach Boys ballads. The bonus cut of their cover of the Four Freshmen's \\"Their Hearts Were Full of Spring\\" is a mesmerising acappella number.<br /><br />LOW POINTS:<br />\\"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\\" is too 'out there' for its own good. I almost always skip this one. \\"With Me Tonight\\" and \\"Whistle In\\" are pretty, but way too slight lyrically. \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\" is a great song, but this is a poor rendition. \\"Mama Says\\" was intended to be a portion of the \\"SMiLe\\" version of \\"Vega-Tables\\" but doesn't really stand well on its own. \\"You're Welcome\\", a B side to the \\"Heroes and Villains\\" single, is a throwaway.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This is not music you \\"get\\" on first listen.

B000002J1U|4.0|That's right! There's more to Led Zep than meet's the ear (or the eye), and this album is it. I have a copy of this album on vinyl LP and it's the only Zep album I've got on vinyl. The rest are ON cassette tapes. But whether on vinyl or cassette, I'm pretty sure the songs on this album remains pretty much the same. Honestly, I did not like this album when I first listened to it. It's because I was expecting more heavier sounding cuts and more foot-stomping grooves. So I shunned it for while. Hey, but I must admit, Led Zep is Led Zep and that is a fact that cannot be shunned away just like that. So I played IT over for a couple of days and... WHAMM! I realized then that this is the mellow side of Led Zeppelin. And I loved it!    The opening cut, \\"Immigrant Song\\", is typical Led Zep blaster; so is \\"Out On The Tiles\\" (I love Bonzo's bass pedal workout here) which pretty much embodies the groups signature hard-pounding songs. But even if these two cuts are typical Zep grooves, they still stand out from the rest of the cuts. And speaking of the rest of the songs, I believe they were an indication that the group, at that time, was evolving and experimenting with new sounds and unusual musical textures (check out \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\"). Four successive cuts would've made it to the current mainstream acoustic genre of today: \\"Gallows' Pole\\", \\"Tangerine\\", \\"That's The Way\\", and \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\". Of these four, \\"Tangerine\\" is a worthy pick because I find it very very ear-friendly. It brings a soothing kind of air to it which is occasionally topped by Page's soothing guitar licks. Another acoustic delight is \\"Friends\\". Check out also another version of this song on the \\"No Quarter: Page/Plant Unledded\\" live album. Both are equally great versions. \\"Celebration Day\\" romps up after \\"Friends\\"; which reminds me that this album is really a celebration of the band's desire not to remain the same, but instead, to evolve and explore into other styles as well. Check out also Page's ad lib on \\"Celebration Day\\". It may not be quite long but it's succinct delivery summarizes the joyful quality of the entire song.    And to top it all, the most brilliant cut in this album: \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". It is a classic example of how a blues song should be played, should be sung, and should be performed. Everything in it is fully-laden with emotions; from Page's elegant riffs and solo, to Bonham's emotional beat which rode in perfect contrast to the bluesy air, to the soft-toned background painting of Jones' keyboard and bass pedals, and to Robert Plant's indignant cry for justice for a love gone haywire. Simply put, this blues tune is a killer!    \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" is well worth it for the ear and for the mind as well. Throw in the heart, too. Because I believe, this is an emotional, if not the best ever, Led Zep album you'll ever hear. But I must agree, it's the most underrated! So don't wait too long to grab this emotional experience!!! BUY IT NOW!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|A great recording takes the thoughts and feelings of the artist and creates with them a work that enables the listener to say \\"I've been there...I know EXACTLY what they mean\\". For the 40 some minutes \\"Pet Sounds\\" plays, I *am* Brian Wilson....<br /><br />The disc encompasses the full range of human emotion: the wide eyed innocence of \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice?\\", isolation (\\"I Just Wasn't Made for these Times\\"),gratitude (\\"You Still Believe in Me\\"), longing (\\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\"), infatuation (\\"Don't Talk (Put your Head on my Shoulder\\"), insecurity (\\"That's Not me\\"), homesickness (\\"Sloop John B.\\"), envy (\\"Let's Go Away for Awhile\\"), desperation (\\"God Only Knows\\"), benevolence (\\"I Know There's an Answer\\"), pity (\\"Here Today\\"), disillusionment (\\"Caroline No\\") and the devil-may-care ebullience of youth (\\"Pet Sounds\\").<br /><br />When someone tells me they've listened to this and didn't like it, I really begin to question their humanity. EVERYONE needs a copy of this in their home.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|This is yet another of those films that make people a little nervous when they see the DVD on the shelf of their local video rental store. Maybe you remember the TV spots. Maybe you've read some of the reviews. If so, you probably know that some of the subject matter here is pretty bleak. Well, please don't let that dissuade you from giving \\"Mystic River\\" a chance. I did, and I'm glad for it. First of all, a round of applause, please, for Clint Eastwood ... because who would have thought that the man who would make \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan both an icon and a cliche would become such an assured director? In \\"Mystic River\\" he handles a lot of potentially gratuitous subject matter with dignity and grace. There are also some startlingly good performances here, most notably by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Some other reviewers here have complained about the film's ending, but I don't share their views: I thought the denoument of this film was both unexpected and emotionally devastating. So yeah, \\"Mystic River\\" is a very weighty film, but it is also a very good, very POWERFUL film ... for emotionally MATURE audiences.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I think alot of you who are writing the negative reviews of this album have completely missed the point of Daft Punk in general.  If this album dissapointed you, take a step back and REALIZE that you're probably the type of person that's been dissapointed every time an artist you like creates something new.  I did agree with the statement from another review \\"If you're looking for another Discovery, this is not it\\", but I definitely think this one is VERY similar to Discovery in many ways.  As an engineer/producer/musician I can assure you that they used alot of the same groundbreaking tricks and ideas that they used in the creation of Discovery.  The main thing this album is lacking in comparison to Discovery, is the lack of a plot.  It has no story...  just like Homework.  It still has the same charming, rigid, experimental sound that we have loved about their previous releases.  And most importantly... it's DEFINITELY worth buying.  I really don't think that these two guys give a rats butt what any of us write here, they just want their fans to be loyal, like every other musician out there. <br />--Thank you for taking the time to read my babbling review--

B00005JKGV|5.0|The films of Lynch are symbolic, metaphoric, atmospheric, and poetic indeed. Lost Highway is no exception. I read the LH FOUND rewiew, and while I agree with some points of it, I can say it leaves out alot. It is rare that Lynch divulges his motivations in a clear manner when discussing his films. But in an interwiew taken not long ago, Dave did admit one thing- that the films Lost Highway, and the Twin Peaks franchise occur in the same world. And while I will state herein that there is no singular meaning to any Lynch film, I have watched it enough times to write an informed opinion on Lost Highway, and the main character Fred Madison. <br /> <br />Fred is, as stated in another review, a disgruntled husband. His wife(Renee) is disinterested in him, her past as a porn queen still haunts her. Fred knows it and feels powerless to do anything about it. It is not off-par to say he wishes her dead, right from the beginning of the film. This sets off the metaphysical chain of events created by the now \\"invited\\" Blake(Mystery Man), culminating in the creation of a tangent or alternate universe, in which Fred is able to kill his wife, escape prison through transmutation, kill his wife's porn associates, learn the truth about his marriage, and travel back through time to kill his wife's lover, and set in motion the chain of events that occur throughout the movie. The whole film takes place in this tangent universe, and is initialized by the message over Fred's intercom, which is Fred's future self telling his present self that \\"Dick Laurent is dead.\\" We then hear a car speed off, and the police sirens enter chase and vanish out of auditory range. So in a way, Fred has already killed his wife, but it hasn't actually happened yet! <br /> <br />The film becomes linear for a time. Fred plays his musical gigs as his hatred grows, unknown video tapes of their house and persons show up on a regular basis. They call in police to investigate, to no avail. Fred's increasing hatred ofhis wife then allows the mystery man to materialize into Fred's life, first masked over the face of his wife after some particularly bad sex, and then in person at a party, in an etherial exchange that should tell the viewer that the mystery man has metaphysical powers over time and space not clearly explained visually. It is after this encounter, that Fred does indeed kill his wife, and the transition between his home and the police station does indicate a mental incapacity for remembering events. Fred foreshadowed this to the police earlier in the film by saying he likes to remember things the way he remembers them. <br /> <br />Fred is now incarcerated on death row, a place he needs to escape from if he is to complete his new-found destiny, a destiny which he samples through a hallucination of a boathouse exploding in reverse(reverse space-time continuom). Once again, the mystery man, in control of time and space, physically combines Fred into the body of another person, Pete Dayton. And Since Pete is not Fred, at least physically, the jailors are forced to release Pete to the custody of his parents. <br /> <br />Pete was picked by the mystery man, because Pete has a direct connection to the people Fred intends to kill. Pete works as a mechanic at the shop where Mr. Eddy(Dick Laurent), the porn king gets his cars fixed. Here is where the movie becomes not so linear in structure. Pete begins to relive the affair he had with Renee, and Renee appears to him as Alice(Renee w/ Blond hair), simultaneously as a memory, and a spritual projection controlled by the mystery man who is trying to lead Fred to Dick Laurent. Slowly but surely these memories begin to pull Fred's personality out of Pete, who manages to kill one of the porn people, and scuttle off into the desert with Alice to meet the mystery man at the boathouse which explodes in reverse. During Pete and Alice's final love act at this point, Alice reminds Pete that he will never have her. This is because she isdead- Fred killed her. And this moment not only draws Fred out of Pete through memory, but it also brings Fred back through time to a point in time before any events of the movie have occured, and Pete Dayton is thereafter erased from existence. This is also part of the event that happened in front of Pete's parents that they will not speak about. They saw Pete vanish into nothingness when he came home with the mystery man, before he wound up in Fred's jail cell. <br /> <br />Fred now ends up at the Lost Highway Motel, where Renee and Dick Laurent are having sex. Renee leaves afterwards, and Dick Laurent is then accosted and killed by Fred and the mystery man. The mystery man then whispers something into Fred's ear. Fred then goes back to his old house, and says through the intercom \\"Dick Laurent is dead\\", closing the chain of events in this tangent universe like the mystery man told him to do in that whisper. Fred then flees from the police who he believes have been tailing him(they are the remnants of his earthly memories), and out onto the Lost Highway, Then Fred too is erased from all existence, and his tangent universe created by the mystery man, officially ends with the credits. <br /> <br />Remember this is only my opinion. I am not saying I am right or wrong, or anyone else is right or wrong. My gut tells me that Dave meant for these events to be actual occurences, rather than a psychotic dream. But you decide for yourself. Also the film Donnie Darko works in quite the same fashion, if you are looking for a comparison.
0316168815|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold, was beyond what I imagined it would be about. As I read the back of the book, its unreal and unique plot already captivated me. After I read the first sentence, I knew this book would be worthwhile. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" allowed readers to see a story from an unusual point of view, heaven. Emotion and suspense is introduced right as the first chapter begins and does not cease for a moment. Susie Salmon tells of her story from heaven after she is murdered and how it affects her family. As the days go on after she is dead, her family slowly falls apart. Her father and brother cling together for support while her mom turns to her past life of freedom and her sister starts to grow up fast. Even at its low points of the story, the emotion still thrives. I couldn't believe how fast I had read this book, four days at the most. I usually don't enjoy reading, but as I read this book my social life went on a hold. I caught myself reading in the strangest places and at the strangest times. Whether it was during Foods class or out running around, it seemed I couldn't get \\"The Lovely Bones\\" out of my hands. It caught me off guard on how detailed and touching it was and had a hold on me until I reluctantly read the last sentence.
6303471714|4.0|Shape Your Body was Cindy Crawford's first workout video, which she created in collaboration with personal trainer Radu.  Shortly after its release, it was criticized for containing dangerous moves, largely because Cindy sometimes shows poor form and often moves much too quickly through the exercises; however, experienced exercisers who know how to modify should not have any problems.  The video contains 3 strength-based workouts:  a 45-minute workout focused on stretching and toning your legs plus working your buttocks, chest, back, and abs; a 40-minute workout aimed at building power and strength in your legs plus working your shoulders, arms, and abs; and a quick, 10-minute full body training routine using no equipment.  Because the first two workouts target different muscle groups, they are designed to be performed on consecutive days, while the third workout is meant as a short bonus for days that you don't have time do more than that.  The style of these workouts is high repetition, low weight training; you definitely don't have time to switch to heavier weights between the various exercises.  Radu provides voiceover instruction for the first two workouts and occasionally appears on screen to adjust Cindy's form; Cindy herself also makes frequent comments throughout the workouts, which are filmed in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings to a pop soundtrack.<br /><br />The first workout begins with a 6-minute warm-up containing fast-moving stretches.  The next 12 minutes focus on standing leg work:  you'll do a series of \\"leg swings\\" while holding on to a chair for balance and moving to the front, side, and back (these are sort of modified ballet-type movements).  You then perform a lunge combined with a front kick.  The leg swings and lunges are repeated for a total of three sets of each.  Next, you'll move to the floor for 4 minutes of buttocks work, again doing a tri-set:  pelvic lifts lying on your back with your heels on the chair, leg lifts lying on your side, and leg lifts back from an all-fours position. Moving on to the upper body, you do 3 sets of 10 push-ups.  Next comes a lying tri-set of flies, chest presses, and lat pullovers, again repeating for 3 total sets.  Continuing with back work in a standing position, you do a 1-armed row, a standing double row, and a seated row tri-set; total time for the upper body portion is 10 minutes.  Last comes 7 minutes of abs work, and in this segment, Cindy moves particularly fast.  She performs crunches, a full sit-up, reverse curls, and a side jackknife for 3 sets of each.  The workout ends with 5 minutes of lying and seated stretches for a total of just under 43 minutes.<br /><br />The second workout begins with a 5 ½ minute warm-up that is virtually the same as in Workout 1.  Again starting with the legs, you'll perform an interesting side lunge series in which you lunge, lift, and turn, raising your back leg.  This is combined with a plie squat, front lunge, and regular squat, with the entire series being repeated for 3 sets.  To finish of the legs, you do just 1 set of leg swings from each of the 4 positions, bringing the legs segment in at a total of 9 ½ minutes.  Next comes the 9-minute arms segment.  Here, you'll do 8 different exercises (bicep curls, barbell press, flies, triceps kickbacks, reverse curls, shoulder press,  front raise, French press), repeating the entire series 3 times total.  Finally, there is a 9-minute abs section in which Cindy performs a variety of crunches at a lightning-fast speed; in fact, the moves are better thought of as pulse rather than crunches, as there is little time for a full crunch.  The workout ends with a 4.5 minute cool-down stretch and comes in at just under 39 minutes.<br /><br />For the last workout, Cindy is instructing alone without Radu.  She does not use any equipment and is not even wearing shoes for this segment, but she addresses virtually the entire body in this short 10-minute workout.  After a few quick warm-up stretches, Cindy begins with the legs, alternating squats and lunges for a total of 3 sets of each.  Moving to the floor, she performs 3 sets of 10 push-ups using different hand positions.  Next comes the abs work, and Cindy uses 4 different crunches to target the upper abs, obliques, lower abs, and entire midsection.  Finally, she does some pelvic tilts to work the buttocks, and the workout ends with a brief stretch.  I would rate these workouts as at an intermediate level and above; they would not be a appropriate for beginners who would be unfamiliar with how to modify the moves for safety.  The exercises included are varied and interesting and I felt thoroughly worked out after each session.  Despite these positives, this is not a video that I am interested in doing on a regular basis, mainly because the extremely fast pace made the workout feel more like a chore to me; I prefer Cindy's A New Dimension, which moves at a slightly more reasonable pace.  However, if you are an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser who likes performing high repetition strength training workouts at a quick pace, you may enjoy these workouts.  Overall, I rate the video as 3 ½ stars.p stretches, Cindy begins with the legs, alternating squats and lunges for a total of 3 sets of each.

B0000027RL|5.0|This album is just so incredible it belongs in everybody's collection. Yes that's right-it's an ESSENTIAL album. It belongs there in the rack next to Led Zeppelin IV, Nevermind, The Wall & Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Even if you've owned this album from the beginning, there is always something new that appears.<br /><br />I've heard Black many times, but the other day I really heard it; at the end, when Eddie is screaming in torment it hit me like a two ton heavy thing, that blood curdling scream question that reminds you of a time so long ago, when in the naivety of youth you discovered that the world isn't fair.
0767812166|3.0|I hesitated to use that title because most of you who will bother to vote on this review will probably take it as an insult. It's not, and I felt more comfortable using it when the professional reviewer made an almost identical comparison. I rented \\"Starman\\" because one of the reviews I read of \\"K-Pax\\" suggested it as an alternative. It IS quite different E.T. First, for its added romantic sub-plot, and second for its well... otherworldly wit, made so by Bridges' impeccable delivery. All in all I must say that I liked \\"K-Pax\\" better, mostly because its focus was more interesting to me--the subject of human doubt. Plus, it was the film that immediately preceded Kevin Spacey's downward spiral--although some would argue that K-Pax was the beginning. To them I say, \\"Starman\\" is a good film in its own right and \\"K-Pax\\" was made less than it should've been by one of the most incomprehensible directorial choices I have ever seen: the selection of an ending that according to the commentary departed from the script. The ending is restored in the Special Features on the DVD and I suggest that all of you who enjoyed \\"Starman\\" should give that film a second-look as well. <br /> <br />

B0000DJZAH|5.0|This album stood the music world on end. It changed the way we viewed rock-n-roll almost to the same extent that The Beatles' album \\"Sgt Pepper\\" did. \\"Tommy\\" was the ultimate concept album in that it is a fully integrated piece of music which tells a single story.     The Story: \\"Tommy\\" showed that a two disc rock album could be used to tell an operatic style story. Interestingly, the author, Pete Townsend, admits that he was unsure as to exactly what the story was until the movie was made of the \\"opera!\\" The basic story is of \\"Tommy,\\" who was born while his father, \\"Captain Walker,\\" is away at sea. Captain Walker returns home after several years absence and discovers Tommy's mother with her new lover. Tommy's mother and her lover kill Tommy's father in front of the young Tommy. (The movie has the lover kill the husband; the TV concert has the husband kill the lover.  It does not really matter!)  Although left vague, Tommy may have been beaten to keep him quiet. At a minimum, he was forcefully admonished not to let anyone know about the killing. The mother and lover sing \\"You never heard it! You never saw it! You'll never tell a soul what you know is the truth!\\"  At the same time, Tommy sings at a nearly inaudible level, \\"I heard it, I saw it ...\\" but complies by adding, \\"I'll never tell a soul what I know is the truth.\\"  The psychological trauma from the incident caused Tommy to comply by becomming deaf, dumb and blind so he could never reveal what he knew, or anything else, leaving him alone with his thoughts and feelings.  The only contact he is able to have with the world is with a pinball machine.    Thereafter, Tommy is put through physical, sexual and psychological abuse by his family. (His uncle rapes him, his cousin tortures him, and his family take him to the Acid Queen in a failed attempt to break Tommy out of his sightless and soundless state.) Because he is cut off from sight, sound and communication, he is able to have some sort of spiritual contact with the universe which others are unable to experience.  (\\"Strange as it seems, his musical dreams ain't quite so bad;\\" and \\"Simpleness will surely take the mind where minds can't usually go.\\")    But, despite his lack of sight and hearing, he becomes a pinball wizzard and a celebrity. When his senses are returned, he is hailed as a messiah. But, as with all messiahs, the masses eventually rejected him because his path to spiritual enlightenment is too difficult to follow. In the end, he was as alone as he had been without his sight, hearing and speech.     The work is on several levels, the first of which is described above.  On a second level, Tommy is representative of the entire post World War II generation, and how the younger generation (rightfully) felt it was being abused by the older generation.  This was one of the great themes of the \\"younger generation\\" in the mid to late '60s, as they were being shipped off to an unpopular and nearly endless war in Viet Nam to protect the United States' oil interests.  Those who served in the war came home home physically and psychologically maimed to a world where they were not given a hero's welcome, but, like Tommy, were rejected, mistreated and alone.    The Music:  Tommy was the first \\"rock opera.\\" (OK, Pete Townsend will tell you that \\"Tommy\\" it is a song cycle, whatever that is!) It is complete with an overture and an underture.  The Who wanted to be able to perform it live, so an orchestra was not brought into the studio. Townsend and producer Kit Lambert added in all kinds of queues from classical music, such as the occasional use of a French Horn, trumpet and flugelhorn, and extended instrumental passages. Producer Kit Lambert worked hard to make a four piece rock band sound like an orchestra! But, this album is not one of the middle of the road pop rock operas which were to follow such as Jesus Christ Superstar or Evita.  This was the Who.  At the time, they were the loudest rock band around with something like 125,000 watts of power.  This is still the Who which performed Live at Leeds, The Who Sell Out, and Who's Next.      Many of the songs became hits, including \\"Pinball Wizzard,\\" \\"See Me, Feel Me,\\" and \\"The Acid Queen.\\" Personally, I prefer the extended musical sections as they are more challenging and satisfying passages.     And Keith Moon was brilliant on drums.    There are two reasons to buy the SACD:  First, the medium is better! CDs are harsh and brittle. They produce listening fatigue in minutes, and have always left me fiddling with the treble in a feeble attempt correct the uncorrectable sound. Nothing worked. So, for serious music appreciation, I needed to resort to the long playing vinyl album. These have their own problems such as limited dynamic range, transient distortion, poor pressing quality, tape hiss and noise, scratches and thousands of pops and ticks, rumble, wow and flutter, and expensive playback equipment which needed care and tuning. And worst of all, I had to get up to flip the album half-way through! (In this case, four sides.)      It is hard to explain the subjective difference between Redbook CD sound and the sound produced by SACD and DVD-Audio.  Essentially, it is like trying to reproduce cool seaside air and ending up with the dry brittle air blowing out of a nozzle in a jet airplane.  The CD is like playing a violin with a hack saw -- there is simply no way to smooth out the saw teeth sufficiently to make it sound correct.  SACD and DVD-Audio fix the problem by giving you enough data to filter out the audible errors created by digitizing analog sound.    Second, the production is very revealing.  The liner notes indicate that the original album was from a \\"sweetened\\" version of the original master tapes.  Producer Lambert allegedly destroyed the final master from which the \\"sweetened\\" version was produced.  This turned out to be untrue:  Townesend found the original tapes while conducting research for the new 5.1 version.  The twotrack version presented here is from the original \\"unsweetened\\" master tapes.  The 5.1 track goes back to the earlier 8-track tapes on which the music was recorded.  Both versions breathe new life into the old masterpiece.    EXTRAS:  A second disk of outtakes is included, along with a multipage booklet reminiscent of booklet which came with the original album.  Unfortunately, it is not the original booklet.    Enjoy!

1400049628|4.0|Be warned:  The Zombie Survival Guide is NOT a gut-buster.  This is not to say it isn't funny, just that the humor is very subtle.  Brooks adopts a tone that is so serious that its seriousness becomes funny.  That said, this is a good book.  You can even allow it to fairly young children, because the text is pretty dry (go back to the second and third sentences) and the illustrations are comparably bland--they would be literally bloodless even in color.  Brooks uses Romero-style assumptions for his context:  Zombies are victims of a communicable disease that has 100% mortality; only head trauma will \\"kill\\" them; and they consume living animals, preferably humans.  In fact, one of the jokes is that Brooks refers to zombie movies.  Although these movies are clearly his information source, he denigrates them as merely entertainment, on the grounds that they sacrifice realism for drama.  An point of semantics that I found interesting is that Brooks uses the more correct word \\"ghoul\\" interchangably with \\"zombie\\".    If you're not a zombie fan, buy it for a friend who is, then borrow it.  Even if you don't want your own copy, you'll enjoy reading it.  This is a good book, and I hope Brooks has more in the works.

0061015725|5.0|Throughout my life I have read a great deal of science fiction, but as a mechanical engineer, I am constantly bothered by the fact that the majority of this genre contains little or no actual science.  However, Michael Crichton's novels have always been an exception to this pattern.  Instead of merely entertaining the reader, they imbue him with a deeper understanding of what science and technology are capable of, and what resultant dilemmas we may have to confront in the future. <br /> Like most of his novels, Prey is a suspense novel set in the near future.  A company is attempting to build extremely tiny robots that operate on a molecular scale.  As is often the case, they neglect safety concerns in order to hurry development.  Things go wrong, and the resulting developments are sure to make any reader have a hard time putting this book down.  Despite the technical nature of this subject, that aspect of the novel is always explained in a way that allows nearly anyone to grasp what is taking place.  Understanding the science will often allow the reader to predict what will happen next, but it is not necessary to enjoy the book. <br /> Because this book is based on a scientific concept, anyone reading it will be certain to learn a lot about nanotechnology.  Don't be concerned that this book will be boring or pedantic though; it is by no means either.  The author has certainly done his research well, but rather than make it less interesting, this greatly contributes to the realism and the immersion of the plot.  If you're interested in reading a great suspense novel, be sure to pick this one up.  You may even learn something from reading it.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Weighed down and looking for music as a soundtrack, I found a recommendation for Damien Rice's \\"Cannonball.\\"<br /><br />The plaintive guitar couples with his achy strained voice creating a song that is bittersweet and emotionally raw.  The lyrics are beautiful and insightful, with a tender sensuality -- \\"there's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth...\\"<br /><br />I listened to it over and over, until finally experiencing the rest of the album.  The song \\"Volcano\\" combines Mr. Rice with a lovely female vocalist, Lisa Hannigan, and a darkly emotional string arrangement with obsessive lyrics \\"what I am to you is not real.\\"  \\"Delicate\\" begins with a simple beat and gently sweeping strings, as the singer asks his love why she stayed with him if he means nothing to her, and builds to a heartbreaking overwrought pleading.  You can clearly picture him, drunk, standing in the rain outside her door, begging for answers.<br /><br />The album leaves you feeling slightly chilled and empty, and I mean that in the best possible way.  Damien Rice has beautifully melded indie folk rock with his Irish heritage, the paradox of deep emotions and restraint.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This score is much like the film. Perfect, goofy, exciting, scary, ad fun! It begins with a quiet eerie piece, and morphs almost seamlessly into the loud and exciting track 2.  <br /> <br />The album is a little short, but hey, the music is still great.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This CD has some of the most original sounds that you'd be able to find today! The have elements of jam bands, psychedelic rock, classic rock, and Latin rock. And they are genius enough to make it work. It's reminiscent of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Phish/Grateful Dead, Santana, the Doors and so much more. The lead singer, Cedric, has a mind-blowing falsetto voice. Ikey plays the organ remarkably like Ray Manzarek but more jazz\blues influenced.  Omar, the guitar player, is incomparable. He is like a new breed of guitar virtuosos. Altogether, the Mars Volta are in a category all their own. They are simply amazing!
B00005JMXX|5.0|I am a fan of Roland Emmerich's films. This one is almost as good as Independence Day! I saw this in the theaters, and when it came to DVD I snatched it right away. <br /> <br />This movie is full of great action/disaster scenes. It also has a surprisingly good score by Harold Klauser, \\"a composer who is not that well known.\\" I am used to hearing David Arnold scores on Emmerich's movies, but Klauser has proven himself to be a worthy oppenent. Also, Dennis Quaid does a wonderful job portraying the scientists who nobody believes. In fact, all the actors do a splendid job! <br /> <br />A must see for action lovers!
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Would it have been any possible for this movie to have made me curse a little more?  It was not ENTIRELY hideous.  The costuming and sets were good.  The battle scenes were nicely choreographed.  There was acceptable bloodiness.  Naked Brad Pitt--enjoyable.  Eric Bana--well-cast.  As for the rest...I'm pretty sure they could not have gone much farther from the actual Iliad and still claimed to have based it on the Iliad.  I might have enjoyed this more were I not a college literature teacher with a deep and abiding love for the Iliad.  Unfortunately, that was my viewing perspective.  The writers made changes that were completely unnecessary and in some cases make no sense (e.g. killing Menelaus.  HOW is it remotely possible in the Odyssey that Odysseus' son goes to visit Menelaus and Helen in Sparta if MENELAUS IS DEAD?)  The gods were pretty well entirely left out.  Interesting, considering the polytheistic culture being highlighted had a deity for just about everything.  The scene where Achilles stood outside the walls of Troy screaming \\"Hec-tor!\\" every 30 seconds or so would have been laughable had it not been so completely incorrect.  And the scene where Priam strolls into Achilles' tent to negotiate for the release of Hector's body?  Fortunately, the student I was sitting next to during the film was not offended when I said, \\"What the flying f*** is THIS?\\"  For the rest of my teaching career, I will be undoing the damage this travesty has done.   <br /> <br />If, however, you don't know anything whatsoever about the Iliad, you might enjoy it.  Me, I'd need to be drunk.

B0007GAEW6|4.0|This cd is sonic (...). Ok, that said..it's an amazing listen. I think many people try to 'figure' out the Mars Volta; an open mind is essential to the enjoyment this band. To appreciate their music, it must be recognized as pure expression; not a collection of popular singles. This cd brings to mind elements of of other artists such as Yes, Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd, Edgar Winter, even a touch of Black Sabbath. The individual performances on this cd are nothing less than virtuoso, however I was unwilling to give it a perfect 5 star rating. This cd lacks something in it's continuity, sometimes incoherent at best. Evenso, I have been listening to it non-stop.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is an intense thriller that does not let up until the end. Adapting a Phillip K. Dick story, Steven Spielberg blends stunning visual effects in with powerful acting to make a movie with twists turns and suspense that will have you guessing who the real murderer is.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, head of a Washington D.C pilot police program that prevents crimes from being committed in the year 2054. He's extremely effective in his job catching murderers before they commit murder. Working with information from three psychics the \\"Precogs\\" they've reduced murders in the nation's capital to 0%. On the eve of the program's expansion nationally, the precogs predict John Anderton is going to murder someone in 36 hours. This puts him against his own program in an attempt to clear his own name. Note how the story uses the word murder, which is a premeditated intentional act of killing someone instead of the word kill. This one simple use of a word definition as a plot device makes the story all the more intriguing because Anderton is not a murderer. He has his issues, (drug abuse, dealing with the death of his son Sean,) but has the restraint not to deliberately murder someone in spite of those issues. So his attempt to clear his name has meaning. I don't want to give away any of the great plot twists; I have so much respect for this film I don't feel its right to spoil it for people who haven't seen it.<br /><br />Spielberg treats us to some wonderful action sequences (the chase in the alley is great, the fights in the Lexus factory are amazing.) Spielberg thankfully keeps these sequences short to keep the story moving. But the special effects are secondary to the storytelling as they should be. He focuses on the characters and their motivations and that is the key to GOOD science fiction/ fantasy. I was more interested in finding out whether or not John would commit murder in 36 hours than anything else.<br /><br />Tom Cruise gives a powerful performance as John Anderton showing us his intensity, drive and emotional pain. Colin Ferrell is nasty as a Justice Department official. You just hate him. The actress who plays the female precogs makes the movie. Her intense performance makes you feel her character's fear and sense of overwhelm in her first trip out in the real world. The actress who plays Anderton's wife is great too. She makes you feel tension and fear of her character. However, The best performance comes from veteran actor Max Von Snydow. He's a total chameleon not letting us know his true intentions until the end of the movie.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is at the top of his game here making one of the best science fiction movies since Robocop. He uses less special effects and more storytelling and character development to show us a clear picture of what life in the near future is like.<br /><br />A Shawn James Essential video Buy this one today because it will be one of the best movie experiences you will ever have.John Anderton showing us his intensity, drive and emotional pain.

B00003CXQY|5.0|This movie is hilarious.<br /><br />The film is basically about a spoiled prince that is turned into a Llama by a witch and gets abandoned near a large water stream. Upon his drifting, the prince finds himself seeking help from the one person he can trust, but that guy hates him for wanting to tear down his village. After working out some type of agreement, the two wanderers set out on an adventure to restore the prince to his throne and avenge against the evil witch herself. This film doesn't have the charismatic charm most Disney films have, and it does fall into some cliches. If you're looking to find an original movie from Disney, then I highly recommend this one.
B00070DK5K|4.0|Ok, so it's great to have \\"David Live\\" remastered with today's modern technology and re-released on CD. Certainly the sound quality is an improvement on the previous Ryko version- Bowie's vocals are clearer and seem \\"punchier\\" and it sounds like a gig which could have been recorded yesterday in terms of production values. Historically however, this is not Bowie at his live best and particularly not a highlight from the 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour. This recording is always touted as Bowie's precursor to Young Americans and held up as an example of Bowie experimenting with \\"plastic soul\\" (as he called it). The inclusion of Here Today, Gone Tomorrow (an out-take from the Young Americans album) is a nice touch as is the inclusion of Space Oddity (why was it ever dropped?) however overall this is a fairly lacklustre performance. This gig was recorded half way through the tour and Bowie already sounds tired from performing the same old routine (1984, Rebel Rebel, Knock on Wood being particular standout fizzers).  One thing that puzzles me though, is why did Bowie & Visconti go to the effort of remastering this fairly average performance when there are other superior recordings from the same tour?  The recording of the gig from the Universal Ampitheatre in Los Angeles three months later is by far a much more energetic performance with Bowie and the band in full funky swing. Practically all the tracks are given the Young Americans funky workover (as opposed to just one or two tracks on David Live). Unofficially circulating under the title \\"Strange Fascination\\" the LA gig is infinitely superior to David Live, contains the lengthy \\"Diamond Dogs intro (dropped from David Live) and all the bizarre somewhat drug influenced chit-chat from Bowie inbetween tracks.  So it's a pity they didn't go to the effort of remastering the previously unreleased LA gig, rather than just re-hash the old Tower Philadelphia recording. \\"David Live\\" remastered and re-released is a nice to have, but if you want a truly superior example of the funky sound of the Philly Dogs leg of the 74 tour try to get your fingers on Strange Fascination. You'll be pleasantly surprised.want a truly superior example of the funky sound of the Philly Dogs leg of the 74 tour try to get your fingers on Strange Fascination.

B00009UW0N|5.0|the most horrific piece of work ever to be made, this movie will cause shudders and will force the hair on your neck to stand up. imagine being isolated inside a house with 2 children, as a serial killer stalks his victims, and in a grisly fashion he murders them, leaving them with no mercy. imagine thinking youve escaped a horrible fate, only to be plunged back into the maddening whirlpool of horror once again, and come face to face with the most infamous serial killer of our time - Michael Myers.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|With a serial killer on the loose, two men awake to find themselves trapped within a decomposing bathroom, chained to the walls, together they are forced to find out who and why this is happening to them. This movie is disturbing, graphic, and mezmerizing and will have you sitting on the edge of your seats in disgust, horror, and pure enjoyment. This movie brings horror to a new level, and the thrills and chills are so constant you might have to pause the movie to let it all sink in.The gore in this movie is grisly and disturbing and sometimes extremely hard to watch - so watch at your own risk - but this movie will chill you to the bone, and will make you think twice about ever doing something that is considered \\"not acceptable\\" in today's society.

0385510454|2.0|I'll have to admit that I was disappointed with John Grisham's lastest novel, The Broker. I purchased the book new but wish now I'd waited and picked it up at the library. I was hoping to read something close to the \\"The Firm\\" or one of his better books. But this one left me sadly disappointed. I think he got a little carried away with speaking Italian to the point that at times I thought it was almost boring. And if there's anything I hate, it's paying for a book that can bore me. Something in me wants to think he had the right idea for a really good plot, but just didn't know how to carry it through to make the story exciting...a real page turner. I'm sure Grisham put lot of effort into this, so I can only wish him better luck next time.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and very nearly walked out during the first half hour but didn't hoping that the movie would get better. The middle and end lived up to the less than stellar beginning. I won't go into detail over the inaccuracies that the movie made; I do understand that it was an adaptation of The Illiad and not the Illiad itself yet it seemed that the only similarities there were were the names of the characters (Did the writers even read Homer's epic?). I found the acting lackluster at best and the dialogue inane and not out of place in a badly written soap opera. The one exception to this was Eric Bana who actually spoke his lines with conviction. Unfortunately, even he couldn't make up for the rest of the film. The most unsympathetic character of the lot, Paris, lived while the more admirable characters of Hector and Priam died--a decision on the part of the writers that I could not understand other than the rational that twue wuv should conquer all.  <br />The story dragged and could well have been consolidated into much less than the almost 3 hours running time of the final version. And then the ending seemed rushed and incomplete, ending on an almost anticlimatic note with nothing really resolved. Paris and Helen were both still alive; with the two of them still together, the war seemed pointless and the victory over the Trojans was an empty one for the Greeks. <br />This movie took itself very seriously--a little too seriously, I thought. It wanted to be the next Gladiator but fell far short of the goal. This might be a rental if you're really curious but I recommend that most people steer clear, especially those with any familiarity with Homer's Illiad.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is simply a beautiful CD.  These Irish women's voices are so angelic, so ethereal, that it is simply a joy to listen to.  No, it is not pure Celtic.  Yes, it is a bit glam, but, you can't deny that these ladies can sing.  I saw the Celtic Woman concert on PBS and looked for the CD.  Was delighted when I found it on Amazon and didn't have to shell out the big donation to my PBS station for it.  I have many Celtic CD's and this is one I will listen to over and over.  Don't be narrow-minded.  It is worth a listen.
0425152251|1.0|I have to read this book my Career & Personal Planning class, and let me just say that it has been a pain. Everything about this book is just so DULL. The characters are flat as paper (not to mention, the dialogue is horrible and unrealistic) and the philosophy lectures just got increasingly boring and dragged on. At first, it was slightly interesting, but it got rather frustrating to read midway. Perhaps if those things were at least a tiny bit more interesting, this book would be more enjoyable.

B000002H6C|5.0|when you look at this and then master of puppets, its hard to tell that this was released only two years following puppets, or even that it is the same artist. i think this was one of Metallica's biggest turns in style, they didnt sell out, but the lyrics and complex song structures are a lot more sophisticated and more progressive than the thrashy, angst-ridden metal of Master of Puppets. Justice follows the same basic song layout as puppets, with the fast, explosive opener, the epic title track, the slower paced 3rd track, the ballad, the recovery 5th (and in this case 6th also) track, the instrumental, and the thrasher at the end. This is in my opinion James's strongest vocal performance, and Lars's strongest drums, especially on the epic ONE, and Kirk Hammet lays out some complex, spitfire guitar riffs and solos. <br /> <br />yet justice is not without its flaws. the production is thin, and Newsted's bass is barely audible. But even the fatal flaws cant stop this from being one of Metallca's strongest and most influential albums to date.
B000002I4W|5.0|Ornette Coleman pioneered free jazz. He was one of the firsts to throw away the \\"rule books,\\" as one might call it. He left chords behind and made the most free musical art form even more free.  <br /> <br />This was the album that started it all. As opposed to Cecil Taylor, the other free jazz pioneer, Ornette wasn't as badly cut up from the criticism he got from main stream players, and especially Miles Davis, who called Coleman, according to Ken Burns, \\"All screwed up inside.\\"  <br /> <br />Many people respected and loved Coleman's music as Jackie Mclean, Lionel Hampton, Percy Heath, and John Lewis.  <br /> <br />This album is clearly like no other in jazz before it. You hear the musicians more free, and though not the most listener friendly, the improvisations seem to wrap themselves around you. <br /> <br />The album opens up with Lonely Women. The band is truely one and they compliment each other pefectly. The music is evidence they were on the same wave length during the recording of the album. <br /> <br />The haunting \\"Eventually\\" is next. The tune is a very fast piece. It is very challenging, and very exciting. The more laid-back, \\"Peace,\\" is just as adventerous and all the other songs, but has a certain subtleness to it.  <br /> <br />In the Ken Burns Jazz Documentary, this whole album was basically played through Ornette's somewhat brief segment. Which is why I knew all the melodies before I even bough this cd. One of the melodies that stuck out the most for me in hearing most of this album on the documentary is \\"Congeniality.\\" Chronology, is perhaps the most well known song on the album. \\"Focus On Sanity,\\" was appropriately titled, as the haunting intro builds up to Charlie Haden's bass solo. <br /> <br />There will never be four musicians that interacted with each other as well as Don Cherry, Ornette Coleman, Charlie Haden, and Billy Higgins did during their run as a quartet. This is a jazz classic. And should be treated as such.
0316172324|3.0|There are some interesting narratives in the book- strung together with useless chatter and fill.  (Too much about Kenna and Coke, for example.)  I think Gladwell had enough real content to make an excellent magazine article and spent some time creating enough filler to turn it into a book.
B000067DNC|5.0|That is one of the best advantages of Season 2 - it can build on the events and characters, the history, developed within Season 1.  Not only do such great characters as Bra'tac, Apophis and Hathor return, but new Goa'uld System Lords such as Heru-ur and Sokar can now be brought in.  Also, we meet the Asgard and the Tok'ra, who will play major parts on later Seasons.  Season 1 set the rules, gave us a detailed setting and even ideas for future plots. Now Season 2 has mined those ideas and taken them farther, making a foundation for Season 3, 4, 5 and so on.  Nothing stays the same in this series - everything changes.  The balance if power is always changing and Earth is always in danger.  But if it was too easy the characters would never develop and there would be no action, no adventure, no cool battle scenes.
0312995423|4.0|Too many people have read The Da Vinci Code first, only to compare Brown's earlier works to the purportedly greatest novel of our decade.  Despite the awkward, James Rollins-ian title, Digital Fortress is actually a great thriller that utilizes Dan the Rubberband Man's now world renowned modus operandi: suspense that stretches on and on.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the 10 sentence Prologue.  What Alistair MacLean accomplishes in eight chapters, Brown requires 128.  America's most famous author knew the formula for attracting the attention span of today's market.  Combined with the brute-force attacks of his trademark histories, Brown learned how to intertwine his ultra-weak character development with fascinating bits of trivia.  In fact, Mr. Brown starts the excitement right off the bat: \\"...a quiet thank you to the two faceless ex-NSA cryptographers....\\"  Now who wouldn't fall for this wonderful touch of marketing brilliance?<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly what strings Mr. Brown tugged to publish Digital Fortress, but as a first work, it's not bad.  It's fun to see where he came from, how his writing style *hasn't* changed, but how he learned to incorporate more legends, myths, and the usual controversial fare.  You'll find a few things here including some history of the NSA, a couple of amusing parodies of the NSA anagram, a definition of a word, and just enough background on cryptography to satisfy our demands for a high narrative-research ratio.<br /><br />The book is remarkably easy to read.  And every time I put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it back up.  I really did enjoy reading it.  Brown's weaknesses are pretty obvious: repetition (to make sure you understand an element before the twist is revealed -- a dead giveaway), and making intelligent characters a touch dimmer in some areas (so the reader knows more than they do), and then ever so slightly ultra-resourceful.<br /><br />Do not ruin this little anecdote by expecting another Da Vinci Code.  There is a reason why he was a late bloomer..  There is a reason why he was a late bloomer.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. (1993.), the Pearl Jam's second studio album<br /><br />Vs. saw the already hugely successful grunge band produce another timeless classic to follow up their monster success with their fantastic debut, 'Ten'. 'Vs.' just like its predecessor is a real heavy rock album containing plenty of firepower, emotion and drive but at the same time giving a good variation of different styles of track giving the album a real multidimensional feeling. The songs on 'Vs.' are shorter and snappier than those on 'Ten' but are by no means inferior - the album is amazing from start to finish with plenty of killer moments, from the acoustic style 'Daughter' to the brilliant garage rocker styled bash of 'rearviewmirror'. 'Vs' again demonstrates why the Pearl Jam are so good, they do one very simple thing .... create music with meaning and a tremendous amount of appeal. The Pearl Jam also put quality of what they did over the proceeds they would get - they deserve real respect as they never got sidetracked or ultradriven by money and didn't allow success to go to their heads (like some artists/bands have been known to do). They are also very much committed to their fans and an example of this, in the shape of them campaigning against high ticket prices for their concerts is proof of this. They are one of the best, if not the best band to come out of the Seattle grunge revolution - look no further than Vs. to see why myself and many other fans think this. The Pearl Jam haven't yet disappointed me with their music.<br /><br />So, what we see with Vs., is perhaps the last true really heavy rock capture of the PJ, before in later albums experimenting with different styles such as punk. Since 'Ten', the band had switched drummers - Dave Abbruzzese, who drums on Vs. in my opinion is slightly better than Dave Krusen who is in the band on 'Ten'. Aside from this change, the outfit is the same for Vs. - with Eddie Vedder still howling out his amazing, growling vocals and Mike McCready, who on this album produces another fair share of excellent guitar work (well supported by the rhythms produced by Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament). Trust me, listening to Vs. is a very well spent 45 minutes of your life - its an exhilerating listen! It may take a few listens to really appreciate fully but it is another one of those great albums that grows and grows on you the more you listen to it. Oh, and the album cover .... hmm sheep in a field is interesting but it is a cover you never forget - theres also an eerie, weird face figurine pictured on the back inside cover which just gets you thinking a little.<br /><br />So, to the tracks. 'Go' is a great opener with a heavy deep riff and some powerful drumming and 'Animal' is a heavy but short and sweet follow up. 'Daughter' is one of my favourites on the album seeing the Pearl Jam at last venture into the acoustic world and they do it so, so well with some brilliant vocals over the top. 'Glorified G' is a catchy track which opens with a great riff which stuck in my mind the moment I heard it and 'Dissident' the follw up incorporates a slower pace with some pleading, passionate vocals from Vedder. For an example of some great drumming, look no further than 'W.M.A.' the longest track on the album at 6 minutes which is underpinned by a great beat - for some reason a lot of people criticise this track .... I don't know why??? Prepare for a blast with 'Blood' - it is really heavy with some highly effective screams from Eddie Vedder which are extremely well timed to the rhythm of the track. The heavy theme further continues with 'Rearviewmirror' which has a great riff and 'Rats'. 'Elderly Woman .....' is another good acoustic track with a storyline about meeting an old friend - it stands out on the tracklisting as it is the first long title PJ gave to a song (all their other works have names as short as possible!!). 'Leash' is another hard rocker with a great chorus. However, my favourite track is the last one, 'Indifference' anunusual PJ track with a good progressive bass line - Eddie Vedders vocals are at their most expressive here and it makes an unbelievable finish to an unbelievable album.<br /><br />I don't think I need to say much more. As you can see, I find it very difficult to fault this album as it is just so amazing. One of the best things i did in listening to music was to start to listen to the Pearl Jam ....good progressive bass line - Eddie Vedders vocals are at their most expressive here and it makes an unbelievable finish to an unbelievable album.

B000002572|5.0|I guess there is not much to say, everybody knows about this one. Best selling debut album for a LONG TIME, I guess it stills keeping that record, I am not sure. <br /> <br />Incredible sound, even now, young kids hear it and they like it. Every song of it rocks with great riffs and new guitar sounds, at that time, Tom Scholz great innovator. <br /> <br />If you want to buy a single song from this one, you are wrong, this one cannot be played in peaces. At the time you hear the first song (More Than A Feeling), you don't want to stop playing the whole album. <br /> <br />It is a shame that at that time the albums were too short, as at this time, you may listen some that lasts up to 75-80 minutes. <br /> <br />This one, as many other albums in rock history, is the one that you have to own it. <br /> <br />This one is for everybody, young ones, old ones, and also not to young nor old. <br /> <br />Buy it, play it, and have a good time.
B000002UBU|5.0|To start off simply enough - if you know Don Mclean's music, you are fully aware of the tremendous \\"American Pie\\" song. Nothing really needs to be said about that song. What needs to be focused on is the fact that the rest of the CD is great as well.<br /><br />Without question, \\"Vincent\\" is a stellar song. The lyrics and music are powerful. \\"Vincent\\" is as relevant today as it was thirty plus years ago. It's unfortunate that the \\"American Pie\\" song overshadowed \\"Vincent.\\"<br /><br />Mclean is a master of words, a true song writer. Despite obvious musical differences, I believe that a strong comparison can be made to Jackson Brown's \\"Running on Empty\\" CD. The \\"American Pie\\" CD flows beautifully from the first song to the last.<br /><br />Unlike so many CD's, each song intertwines with the others for a full, satisfying experience.<br /><br />This is a top CD of all time...
B00004W50T|4.0|Largely influential on the currently voguish Americana and alt. country scene, this first album grew out of the music the Band were creating with Bob Dylan at the house Big Pink, near Woodstock NY in 1967, and includes several new Bob Dylan songs - I Shall Be Released, This Wheel's On Fire and Tears Of Rage, the latter two co-written with the members of the Band who sing them. Probably the best known song was the single The Weight, which also appeared in the film Easy Rider (but was not licensed for the soundtrack album). There is one cover, Long Black Veil, which was influential on Robbie Robertson's writing style, and which he learned from Lefty Frizell's version.<br /><br />If you need to own one Band album, this is the one to go for. It was hugely influential, an album unlike any other, and caused huge ripples across the music fraternity, changing the way people like Eric Clapton experienced and created music.<br /><br />Beautifully re-mastered this new edition has copious notes and is almost doubled in length with bonus tracks, mostly appearing for the first time. It is fascinating to hear alternative arrangements of some of the songs, such as Lonesome Suzie which turns up with a big band horn arrangement. Musically, it sounds great, but was discarded, rightly, for being inappropriate for the song. A couple of covers recorded for fun, never intended for release on the album, are included - the Stanley Brothers' bluegrass If I Lose, and a less successful stab at the Jazz Allum and Big Bill Broonzy blues standard, Key To The Highway.<br /><br />Some of the songs were included on The Basement Tapes, the Bob Dylan and the Band album of demos and home-recordings made at Big Pink. Orange Juice Blues and Yazoo Street Scandal are alternative versions, but of especial interest are Katie's Been Gone and Dylan's song Long Distance Operator. These are presented here as full stereo studio recordings, but are clearly the same takes that appeared on The Basement Tapes, demonstrating that the eight tracks by the Band on that album had not been recorded at Big Pink at all but had been muddied up to sound as if they had. Long Distance Operator now spawns an extra verse, but unfortunately there is a mistake in the editing so that the first line of the last verse is missing.

B00024BHTC|5.0|It was bound to happen - Nightwish's recording budget increased, and the Finnish quintet added an entire orchestra to their new album, thus forging the most epic and powerful doom album to ever be released. The album is very similar to their previous release, Century Child, but with strings, horns and woodwinds in absolutely every nook. Oh, yes, it is absolutely over-the-top, but in a band such as this, it is fitting and magnificent.<br /><br />The opening song, \\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" begins with a metal riff unlike anything else on the album - very reminiscent of \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\". However, it doesn't last. Soon afterwards, trademark Nightwish power-riffs kick in, and the symphony does not go unheard. The last chorus is absolutely beyond belief. \\"Wish I Had an Angel\\" is very similar to \\"Dead to the World\\", with bassist Marko Hietala taking over the vocals in the chorus of this heavy piece. \\"Nemo\\" (released as two singles) and \\"Planet Hell\\" are Nightwish staples, accessible and tremendously melodic. The album has two longer pieces, both of which are exceptional tracks. \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\", an 8-minute eulogy to the destruction of native Americans during the colonial period is woeful, slow and touching.<br /><br />But it is nothing in comparison to \\"Ghost Love Score\\", a near 10-minute concoction of tremendous melodic fireworks. The song left me speechless, and would surely have impressed Carl Orff. Everything from the chorus to the symphonic bombast to the choirs is absolutely hypnotic and energetic. The song makes any other song seem pale, ordinary and thoughtless, including the last two tracks on the album. It is that good.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest (and a bit cynical), the symphony in the album takes a little too much credit. The guitar-work on the album is far from impressive and, if the orchestra were removed, many songs would sound very similar. If it weren't for Turunen's voice and the orchestral onslaught, Once would be quite ordinary. Regardless, it is the symphonic album of the year, and the best of Nightwish's career thus far. My congratulations go to keyboardist/songwriter Tuomas Holopainen and his magnum opus.<br /><br />See also: Nightwish - Wishmaster, Nightwish - Century ChildRegardless, it is the symphonic album of the year, and the best of Nightwish's career thus far.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is one of the finest documentaries I have ever seen, and Errol Morris is to be commended for having the vision and foresight to record, in full, the McNamara story while it was still possible. It is both enlightening and chilling, far more compelling than some of the trite documentaries that have found their way to the screen in recent years. This is one to watch.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the movie Webber fans and Phantom fans have waited for and it lives up to the stage version in every sense with stunning costumes, and wonderful sets. This movie deserved more Academy Award accolades than it was given.<br /><br />This movie made feel like I was transported into a hidden world of passion, maddness, and music. Emmy Rossum delievered a stunning performance as Chirstine who is charming, sweet, and innocent-- I can only hope to see more of her-especially on-stage. But, the best performance in my opinon came from Patrick Wilson who plays Chirstine's protector and lover he does a simply stunning job and I find myself falling in love with him each time I hear his beautiful voice. Gerard Butler in my opinon was a poor choice for the mysterious Phantom who takes control of Christine's mind- his voice didn't seem to fit the role despite the fact that he is the veteran stage performer in this movie.<br /><br />The newly added song is perfect for the feel of the movie and is beautifully sung by Minnie Driver in the end credits. There are a few moments I will skip watching this DVD \\"Prima Donna\\" will be one of them.<br /><br />All in all this a beautiful movie and it's one to own in your collection especially if you love musicals or the movie \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" I can't wait to get this one! Please rent or buy this one and listen to the music of the night.
B0006399FS|4.0|The only way to listen to this album is by starting with the second track, \\"Mircacle Drug\\" and then let it play all the way to the end. \\"Vertigo\\" is a fast-paced party tune that gets your blood pumping but it doesn't belong in this collection of songs. In fact, it causes you to expect the type of album that never materializes. \\"Miracle Drug\\" sets the perfect tone for what you will experience the rest of the way. When you tack on the original final track, \\"Mercy\\" (if you can find it on the Internet), you would then have a five-star CD and the band's third \\"perfect 10\\" album along with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. \\"Mercy\\" provides an exhilarating, climactic ending to an album that builds and grows with each song and with each successive listen.<br /><br />Thankfully, the band has rediscovered their 80s sound. Those who like the JT and AB albums and not this one have not given it a chance. (It took me four months to fully appreciate it and I've been a fan since 1982.)<br /><br />In its totality, HTDAAB is a mature work that shows U2's willingness to embrace their past along with their musical strengths individually and as a band. As someone who owns all of their releases (and then some) I hope to finally see them in concert for the first time on their current tour.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I dont know what these other reviewers have been smoking??? This movie is so worth seeing and even owning. I admit I do own very few movies only because most I only watch once, but this one I will definatly watch over and over. The acting wasnt fantastic, but it kept you interested and was well done with the material, and the plot twists were awsome. I was on the edge of my seat through at least 90 percent of the movie. Finally the ending....WOW!!! The ending is DEFINATLY one you will NEVER guess. I was blown away!!! So out of 5 stars I give \\"SAW\\" 5 stars, it is defiantly worth it!!!!
0930289331|5.0|Written by Frank Miller and hauntingly illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, YEAR ONE was serialized in Batman #404-407. <br /> <br />It tells of the first calendar year in which Batman emerged in Gotham City, beginning with Bruce Wayne returning to Gotham after studying martial arts abroad. Wayne becomes a vigilante, at first without the Batman outfit, at first fumbling a bit.  The sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old clich from Batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment; YEAR ONE gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of Wayne's parents.  In a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals, Batman encounters Catwoman, here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender, her sadomasochistic elements heightened.  James Gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time, adjusting from his move from Chicago to Gotham, where the police force is dominated by corruption.  He investigates Batman, suspects Wayne, has an affair, and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down.  In a tough city, he goes from crusader against Batman to the first stages of his relationship with Batman. <br /> <br />A masterful work, BATMAN:  YEAR ONE possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any Batman tale and, with a breakneck pace, does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of Batman's career, performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing Bruce Wayne, James Gordon, and Selina Kyle with true character, personality, and history. <br /> <br />This is the second best Batman story ever made, second only (perhaps) to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. <br /> <br />-- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels)
B000002LEE|5.0|You cna rag all ya want about Jane's Addiction's feminism i.e., kissing each other on stage, and Perry dressing in drag, but Jane's was truly influential. You can hear their influence in Nirvana, Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Rage Against the Machine, and countless other bands. A gothic singer, punk bassist, teenaged metalhead guitarist, and an African-influenced drummer painted this masterpiece of music, truly, entertainment itself. It showed how to brew together the clashing personalities of the members to a unified whole. Nothing's Shocking was a perfect bridge from Guns N' Roses to Nirvana.
1563894696|5.0|THE LONG HALLOWEEN is probably the fourth finest Batman story ever (after THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, YEAR ONE, and THE KILLING JOKE).  In fact, this may be considered a kind of extended homage to YEAR ONE. <br /> <br />THE LONG HALLOWEEN was serialized as a 13-issue mini-series written by Jeph Loeb and illustrated by Tim Sale -- the team responsible for much above-above-average or slightly-less-than-classic works for both Marvel and DC.  THE LONG HALLOWEEN is by far the best of their famous collaborations, however. <br /> <br />The story begins on Halloween during BATMAN:  YEAR ONE, even featuring the same otherwise disposable gangsters.  Gotham at the time is a city of corrupt cops and powerful gangsters.  By the end of the series, on Halloween a year later, Gotham has become a city of zany and crazy villians along the lines of Dick Tracy.  The narrative is strung together by a series of murders attributed to Holiday, with each chapter occurring on a holiday and featuring another murder or attempted murder.  Along the way, Batman encounters a series of villains and District Attorney Harvey Dent becomes the villain Two-Face.  The tension with Catwoman from BATMAN:  YEAR ONEis here too, but the story is simultaneously a gangster tale heavily influenced by The Godfather. <br /> <br />The story's final issue / chapter seems to reveal the identity of Holiday, only to quickly undermine that by revealing that multiple people committed the crimes, copying each other -- including, we find out in a moving and mind-boggling scene, Harvey Dent's loving and sympathetic wife.  The beginning and the ending are tied by the phrase \\"I believe in,\\" which succinctly expresses characters and their motivations, turned in the final chapter towards devastating implications.  Beginning and ending are also tied by a secret meeting atop Gotham's police headquarters -- at the first a sacred pledge to clean up the gangster-run town, at the last a recognition that this quest has been won at the cost of Harvey Dent, poignantly absent, and not without new threats in the form of costumed villains.  The paradigm has changed for Gotham. <br /> <br />Truly an epic, no chapter more powerful than the ending, THE LONG HALLOWEEN shows nothing less than personal tragedies (none more subtle than that of Dent's wife) and the transition from one era into another. <br /> <br />For the record, THE LONG HALLOWEEN was preceded by three worthy but less poignant prestige format Halloween specials (for the series BATMAN:  THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS) by the same team; these have been collected in BATMAN:  HAUNTED KNIGHTS.  THE LONG HALLOWEEN was in turn followed by BATMAN:  DARK VICTORY, by the same team in the same format, which attempted to resolve the ambiguity around the Holiday murders but which was less artistically successful. <br /> <br />-- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for the sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels)
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|I own Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service, so I expected more of the same.  This is not in the same body of work. <br />    <br />While the animation is beautiful, and the heroine brave and resourceful, it is a cautionary tale of man's destruction of his environment.  There are endless war sequences which I find boring as an adult, and which are entirely inappropriate for children. <br />   <br /> In fact, the entire film should not be watched by anyone under eleven years of age. <br /> <br />   There are bloody stabbings, the murder of an old man, the grappling of insects which children will find \\"cute,\\" and one of the main characters is a multiple amputee. <br />  <br /> It is good, but not great, and doesn't bear multiple viewings, as some here suggest.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I loved ELF and thought it was a perfect vehicle for Will Ferrell.  But it had a story.<br /><br />ANCHORMAN plays like a scattershot series of sketches.  There are some laughs (some of them good ones), but the movie never comes together.
B00005KHJV|5.0|This movie has a man who is a silent killer. He dosn't use one weapon. Like in Psyco Norman Bates only used that one knife. Michael Myers will use anything like, a knife, dental, and doctor tools. Basiclu anything that will kill you. He is after people in his family because hes is angy for no reason, so he thinks if he kills all of his family members he will not be angrey anymore. Parents I would rent , and watch this movie before you let your kids watch it, if they are under fifteen years old. This movie is very violent, and is famous for its creepy theme song.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"...burns half as long.\\"  By that reasoning this show should not have lasted ten minutes.  Joss Whedon has created an incredibly believable world, a surprisingly effective mixture of the Old West with Science Fiction, with an ensemble of character actors at its heart that shine as brightly as the cutting-edge special effects surrounding them.  The writing in this show is exceptional.  The acting is superb all around, even all the guest actors that show up give good performances.  The only gripe I may have had with the creation of the show is all the hand-held cinematography.  But this show is a different animal.  They mix in the special effects shots with the same type of camera-work, as if some bystander is capturing all the effects as they happen, which makes for an immediate feel to the scene, special effects and all.  The idea is ingenious, and the fact that the visual effects are all top-notch and extremely expensive make this one of the most effective Science Fiction shows ever created.  If you love great Science Fiction with action, humor, excellent writing, solid acting and a collection of some of the finest visual effects creatively rendered then look no further than \\"Firefly\\" for a solid Sci-fi fix.  I will warn all newcomers, however, that this is all they made before the show was cancelled.  Believe me, with a show this well-made, the episodes burn up by like a brushfire on a windy day.  \\"Firefly\\" is Science Fiction at its finest.  Highly recommended.

B00005JNEI|3.0|Any American who doesn't live in a cave could tell you that. With Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore presents his admittedly biased case against Bush and the war being waged in Iraq. Unfortunately, when you're watching a Michael Moore film, you never know what to think because the only information you are privy to is presented to support his own views.    Fahrenheit 9/11 is split up into basically two parts: the first is an indictment of President George W. Bush, the way he has run the country, and his motives for starting a war in Iraq; the second focuses on the people fighting the war, and is easily the better piece of the film.    Moore makes the case that the presidential election of 2000 was a sham because votes from racial minorities were not counted appropriately, and that had they been, Al Gore would have won the election. Regardless, we all know that Bush did win, and in August of 2001, he decided to take a rather long vacation, with which some in the country took issue. Bush didn't seem to be terribly serious about his job--until September 11, and we all know what happened then.    What was our president doing when he heard the news that two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York? Reading to children in Florida. What did he do for seven full minutes after hearing this news? Absolutely nothing. Why? Well, this film provides us with some background, linking the Bin Laden family with the Bush family through the oil industry, in which both families are major players. So, members of the Bin Laden clan were rounded up and flown out of the country immediately after the terrorist attacks on the WTC. Why?    Fahrenheit 9/11 also accuses Bush of manufacturing the war in Iraq, claiming that he invented ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and weapons of mass destruction in order to rally the American people behind the war effort, which was only for his own personal financial gain. Is this true? Who knows?    So where does this film succeed? It succeeds in telling thestory of Lila Lipscomb, a Flint, Michigan native who, when we first meet her, is a fervent military supporter, citing that the military helps young people who otherwise wouldn't have a chance to get education and travel the world. However, after her son is killed in combat in Iraq, Ms. Lipscomb becomes disillusioned, questioning why her son had to die, and what good it did for anybody.    Moreso than in his other films, Michael Moore managed to stay off camera for a good part of Fahrenheit 9/11, though his voice is heard throughout in narration. When he is on the screen, he is usually grandstanding, like when he asks for Congressmen to enlist their own children in the military. A true documentarian observes and lets the audience make a judgment for themselves, but that is not Moore's M.O. He wants to present an impartial story, and he does, and I wish I could believe every word of it, but with Moore, you never really know.
0192838679|3.0|Les Liasons Dangereuses (sometimes referred to as Dangerous Liasons) is a classic story. <br /> <br />Written as a collection of letters (like Dracula), it chronicles the adventures of two morally bankrupt socialites as they manipulate, seduce and toy with others for their own amusement. It is very good and, in certain respects, very corrupting. <br /> <br />One observation I did make is that some of the film versions made from this novel (for instance Dangerous Liasons, Valmont and the modern-telling, Cruel Intentions) are quite faithful to the book. If you're familiar with those films, it is unlikely you'll find much here that's new. Also, the tone of the novel (written as epistles, remember) might be a little off-putting to modern readers; it is upper-class with stilted sentence structure and an extensive vocabulary, and tends to hint at, rather than outright say, what it means. Sometimes the letters repeat themselves a little bit, just as letters do in real life. <br /> <br />If you're already a fan of this story, you will probably enjoy reading the novel. If you're new to the story, you will probably enjoy it more. I, myself, was hoping for something that would expand on/develop further the story I'd already seen in the movies, but found that the movies really had shown me what it was all about.
B0007P0XNC|5.0|In the middle of the fascist Italy every people has to live or apparent it. Many of them are devoted admirers of  Benito: fervent followers of his charisma and incandescent speeches. In this state of things you don't realize about those little details such be kind with your wife or to be worried by your son : they are minor issues when the Big Brother invites you to another spelling encounter, the mighty crowd will become the combustible for the solemn ego, the silence and the fear simply disappear when he talks: the collective flattening the individual will. That's the way.<br /><br />But fortunately not everybody likes this totalitarian proposal: a solitaire and unsatisfied woman decides not  to assist to the great occasion. She is simply an outsider, far from the statistics.  In the other hand a refined man, neglected by his sexual condition renounces also to be part of the absurd mass spectacle. The stage is propitious for the unavoidable encounter: two human beings linked by few common aspects but really important: every one of them values each other. She is a housewife a simple woman who suffers in silence the weight of the indifference, who cares about less than nothing the outdoors politics  while her life is a real hell of ingratitude and respect; she is simply an object.<br /><br />These are the basic premises employed admirably by Ettore Scola  to make a colossal film plenty of little details: the fine dialogue, the  discrete eye camera  searching for the intimacy, the inner conflict of both, furtive and unhappy. But they will build though brief instants, the life's magic: to feel loved without worrying by tomorrow.<br /><br />This poetic film is loaded with expressive pulse and superb distinction, maintaining its status and its multiple virtues that seemed to revalue it through the years. Superb tour de force acting for one of the most famous couples in the screen: Sophia Loren as the unhappy woman and Marcello as the outsider. a sensitive and repudiated human being but filled of details to give and share.<br /><br />Watch this golden film. This is the supreme masterpiece of Ettore Scola!udiated human being but filled of details to give and share. <br /> <br />Watch this golden film.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|As a recreational bodybuilder myself, I must say Pumping Iron is a very inspirational, informative, and funny documentary. It really revealed the behind the scenes of bodybuilding through the eyes of the world's most famous if not the greatest muscle-god Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film has it's longevity since it was released in the '70s, and it will sure continue to capture anyone who has a curiosity or passion for building a fabulous body.<br /><br />In this film, we get to see the lives and daily workout sessions of Arnold and numerous other professional bodybuilders training at the gym in preparation for the world's top competitions include Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe. Arnold set the record for having won the Mr. Olympia title more than 5 times straight, and he was about to resign from all competitions. He talks about the physical and psychological aspects of bodybuilding. It's NO PAIN, NO GAIN! when it comes to weight training. We get to see the expressions on the faces of all the guys when they are working out madly.<br /><br />The supporting cast include other famous bodybuilders like Lou Ferrigno and Frank Columbu who were rivals to Arnold at the competition scene.Ferrigno was very driven to take over the title from Arnold, but he didn't win, and he was as furious as his The Hulk character. Columbu, the Italian, though relatively short in height, but his body was the most perfect of all.<br /><br />Although most of the guys in this film were not as keen on their image(grooming) like today's bodybuilders, they were more devoted to the definition of muscular bodies.

0780020685|5.0|I hope you all will have patience with my little essay.  My parents' recreation was the movies, and they dragged me along with them from the very beginning.  So I've seen thousands over the course of, by now, almost a lifetime, and three stand out from the rest: Fantasia, which I saw when I was five, The Seven Samurai, which I saw when I was 16, and City Lights, which I saw when I was about 40.  The Seven Samurai is the best.  It might not be the best movie that might be made, or that should be made, or that could be made, but it is the best movie that actually has been made.<br /><br />By the time I first saw it I had already seen many of what might be called the good important movies.  I knew enough to be aware it had a reputation, and when Channel 28 in Los Angeles put it on their schedule it enjoyed a write-up in TV Guide: they gave it about half a page (unusually much for them), a synopsis, a still from the film, and a cast list.  So I finally watched it with all this build-up, and was stunned.<br /><br />It's hard to put into a few words why it is so good.  One might break it down into its component parts as a start.  How about lighting?  Although there is nothing spectacular, yet it is evident they were paying a lot of attention to light, even to selecting times of day when they could get sharp lighting, such as when Kikuchiyo raises the false alarm in the village: shot close to either sunrise or sunset.  Not unlike many other movies of its time, the actor's face is often brightly lit, frequently with a strong toplight or backlight.  The scene with Old Gisaku (Grandad) in his mill where we see him for the first time being a good example.  Fortunately for me I like that style.  It makes sense to emphasize the actor against the ground.  And it contributes to making the shots look good as photographs.<br /><br />Another notable aspect is the music; this is a powerful element from the very beginning: the drums under the stark black and white titles.  Just from the credit sequence alone you can tell it's going to be a good, check, great movie.  Fumio Hayasaka's score is probably the best score -- original score that is (leaving out Fantasia, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and so on) -- of any movie I can think of off-hand.  It uses leitmotifs (another technique I happen to be fond of), and is far more variable than most.  Now that I've obtained a recording of it I seem to notice echoes (borrowings?) from \\"Lieutenant Kije\\" and \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" but I won't hold that against it.  Whatever works.  Kurosawa said somewhere that sound in a movie does not just add to the visual impression, it multiplies it, and the multiplying effect here is a whopper.  What it really does is to help usher the viewer into a kind of magical zone few other movies have achieved.  If you're going to make a great movie, it's good to have a great score on your side.<br /><br />Kurosawa's staff, I have heard, thought he was the best director in Japan and the best editor in the world.  Of course movies come in different styles, but for this style , where the editing is used as an active storytelling element (but not so pronounced with its montage that it just takes over), the \\"touch\\" on the editing is perhaps the best I've ever seen -- either this or something edited by Orson Welles.  The Battle sequence is pretty famous for that, but the editing throughout is phenomenal.  The imagery flows very powerfully.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have noted how well the shots are set-up.  Kurosawa was trained as a painter, and the care evident in setting up of the shots seems to reflect that discipline.  And there are some shots which start off with one composition, and then the actors move (without an editing transition) and then they end-up in a new configuration that also looks good.<br /><br />What else is there.  Acting: for its style it's probably safe to say it is among the best; all of them, but especially Toshiro Mifune as Kikuchiyo.  Seiji Miyaguchi (who played Kyuzo) remarked: \\"People tell me I was good in the role,...It was he [Kurosawa], I now know, who created that performance for me.  With pure skill he somehow got the very best out of me.\\"  Story: they made it up by themselves -- not borrowed from Shakespeare or anything else (as far as I know).  Shinobu Hashimoto and Kurosawa squared off against each other like chess players, writing simultaneously.  Hideo Oguni was the umpire.  Asked whether Kurosawa tended to choose his own version, Hashimoto years later said, \\"No, I don't think so.  The story itself decided.\\"  Kurosawa said most of the best ideas came from Oguni.  If you abstract everything else out of the movie, such as the music and the editing (the way the story is told) and focus just on the story itself, it's still a great story.<br /><br />Can anything negative be said?  Yes.  Over the years the subtitles have come and gone in various forms, none of them as good as the original ones I remember.  Somebody else here said they were flat.  I agree.  They were redone some years ago, more than once, it seems, so it's hard to be sure of which version to cite.  No doubt they are more accurate than they were, but I prefer the older ones, from the sixties, which were more pungent.  For instance, when Kikuchiyo surprises the other six on their journey to the village, he says, \\"This way.\\"  It used to be, \\"Follow me, men.\\"  The latter has more impact because the sense of Kikuchiyo's usurping authority is stronger (and more incongruous).  Similarly, once in the village and the villagers have been flushed from hiding by Kikuchiyo sending the false alarm, and Old Gisaku comes up, Kikuchiyo originally said, \\"Any objections, dotard?\\"  Then at some later point he was translated with something like \\"Any objections, Old Man?\\"  Dotard is more insulting than Old Man, even if it is an antique expression.  Now (Criterion) he is translated with \\"Got a problem, Gramps?\\"  There are a lot of other citations that could be made: they're all over the place, really.  Oh, here's another.  Shino, by her actions, invites Katsushiro to perform a sexual act, and he is slow to respond.  Originally she said, \\"You sissy.\\"  Then at one point it was \\"You're not a real samurai.\\"  Now it's \\"Coward.  Act like a samurai.\\"  The old subtitles had a certain flair the ones from the VHS days entirely lacked, although the newest ones are an improvement over those -- in terms of their impact in English, not in terms of their fidelity to the Japanese (which I cannot judge).<br /><br />Finally, the combined effect of all these devices, in telling the story, is tremendous.  The director, so to speak, did his job.  The Seven Samurai is the only movie, the only movie, which, for me, succeeds in creating its own ultimately believable self-contained universe along the lines of what Tolkien achieved when he wrote The Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien called it, \\"sub-creation.\\"  For that reason I would say The Seven Samurai is not only the best movie I have seen, but it is also the best directed movie.<br /><br />One other thing.  It's called the ANAGNORISIS.  Not every story has one, but this does, one of the strongest.  It's after the decisive battle (I'm not going to tell you who wins).  One of the survivors makes an interesting observation: \\"We lost.\\"  That is the real climax.  Go ahead, watch it, see for yourself...It was he [Kurosawa], I now know, who created that performance for me.  With pure skill he somehow got the very best out of me.\\"  Story: they made it up by themselves -- not borrowed from Shakespeare or anything else (as far as I know).  Shinobu Hashimoto and Kurosawa squared off against each other like chess players, writing simultaneously.  Hideo Oguni was the umpire.  Asked whether Kurosawa tended to choose his own version, Hashimoto years later said, \\"No, I don't think so.  The story itself decided.\\"  Kurosawa said most of the best ideas came from Oguni.  If you abstract everything else out of the movie, such as the music and the editing (the way the story is told) and focus just on the story itself, it's still a great story.  Can anything negative be said?  Yes.  Over the years the subtitles have come and gone in various forms, none of them as good as the original ones I remember.  Somebody else here said they were flat.  I agree.  They were redone some years ago, more than once, it seems, so it's hard to be sure of which version to cite.  No doubt they are more accurate than they were, but I prefer the older ones, from the sixties, which were more pungent.  For instance, when Kikuchiyo surprises the other six on their journey to the village, he says, \\"This way.\\"  It used to be, \\"Follow me, men.\\"  The latter has more impact because the sense of Kikuchiyo's usurping authority is stronger (and more incongruous).  Similarly, once in the village and the villagers have been flushed from hiding by Kikuchiyo sending the false alarm, and Old Gisaku comes up, Kikuchiyo originally said, \\"Any objections, dotard?\\"  Then at some later point he was translated with something like \\"Any objections, Old Man?\\"  Dotard is more insulting than Old Man, even if it is an antique expression.  Now (Criterion) he is translated with \\"Got a problem, Gramps?\\"  There are a lot of other citations that could be made: they're all over the place, really.  Oh, here's another.  Shino, by her actions, invites Katsushiro to perform a sexual act, and he is slow to respond.  Originally she said, \\"You sissy.\\"  Then at one point it was \\"You're not a real samurai.\\"  Now it's \\"Coward.  Act like a samurai.\\"  The old subtitles had a certain flair the ones from the VHS days entirely lacked, although the newest ones are an improvement over those -- in terms of their impact in English, not in terms of their fidelity to the Japanese (which I cannot judge).  Finally, the combined effect of all these devices, in telling the story, is tremendous.  The director, so to speak, did his job.  The Seven Samurai is the only movie, the only movie, which, for me, succeeds in creating its own ultimately believable self-contained universe along the lines of what Tolkien achieved when he wrote The Lord of the Rings.  Tolkien called it, \\"sub-creation.\\"  For that reason I would say The Seven Samurai is not only the best movie I have seen, but it is also the best directed movie.  One other thing.  It's called the ANAGNORISIS.  Not every story has one, but this does, one of the strongest.  It's after the decisive battle (I'm not going to tell you who wins).  One of the survivors makes an interesting observation: \\"We lost.\\"  That is the real climax.  Go ahead, watch it, see for yourself.
B000006MS3|5.0|\\"I will not let you in, don't you bring back the reveries, I turn into a bird, Carry further than the word is heard.....you'll let me in\\". The end section of 'Get out of my house' has to be one of the most terrifying and exhilirating set to music as the main character fights against being possessed. Not the usual start to an album review but 'The Dreaming' is not your usual album. By the time you get to the last track your hair will have been standing up on the back of your neck for a number of different reasons the main one being Kates voice which is quite frankly amazing all the way through. She takes no prisoners. You either buy into it or you don't as she glides up scales, screams and whispers. Sometimes her voice is almost too much to take it sounds so pure and heartbreaking. Its a shame she's become so reclusive because her music demands that you either love her or hate her and for those who love her music they want to hear more.   <br />I love this album and hope that you give it a listen.
B00005UKE0|5.0|If there's anybody who benefited from the Beatles' breakup, at least initially, it was George Harrison. It's a shame he had to fight so hard to get even two songs on a record with them, because what he was writing was quite on the level with Lennon-McCartney's explorations. So when the Fabs finally split, George had a massive backlog of first-rate material to get off his chest. And he did, big time, with his debut solo album, 1970's All Things Must Pass.    With that catalogue of unreleased Beatles tunes at his disposal George was able not only to throw together a brilliant record, but to do it before a year had passed since the Beatles' disbandment. For ATMP he called in a whole host of great players to help him - Eric Clapton, fellow Fab Ringo Starr, Klaus Voorman, Dave Mason, and the Apple band Badfinger, to name a few. George was never one to really dabble stylistically, preferring to keep to his own spiritually melodic groove. And it certainly works here. Although he swings from moody ballads and spiritual anthems to ringing folk and blistering guitar rock, it's all distinctly George Harrison. Some of his finest work is included on these two CDs from three LPs - Isn't It a Pity, What Is Life?, Let It Roll, Apple Scruffs, the #1 smash My Sweet Lord, and many others. For sheer quantity of quality he never again approached this album.    There are a few problems, however. For one, the third vinyl record consisted entirely of long jams between George, Eric Clapton, and others, and while good for a few listens, there's nothing there that ATMP couldn't have lived without. My biggest qualm though is Phil Spector. I have always detested his over-the-top, bombastic, syrup-laden production, and nothing changed by having him on a George Harrison album. His \\"wall-of-sound\\" treatment buries the songs in a cacophony of double-tracked guitars, echoing drums, and overblown orchestras. George himself wished in the new liner notes that he could liberate it all from the Spector'sbloat. Luckily the songwriting is uniformly excellent, so the recording process takes a backseat.    These complaints aside Harrison fans and critics regard this as George's biggest, best album, and if I personally prefer Living in the Material World or Cloud Nine, there's no denying this is his grandest, most enduring gesture. Like Band on the Run with Paul, Imagine with John, and Ringo with Ringo, if there's one George Harrison album to own, this is it.
0143034901|4.0|Several of the reviews here complain that this is \\"just a thriller with literary pretensions\\".  Well what's wrong with that?  For the most part, this book is really beautifully written (credit due to the translator) yet keeps up a compelling pace.  It just goes to show that you don't need to write prose like a hyperactive 14-year-old to make a real page-turner (are you listening Dan Brown?)<br /><br />What lets the book down for me is the ending - everything is set up nicely, then stops for an overlong, overly convenient bit of exposition, then is wrapped up so quickly and neatly that i was left feeling decidedly cheated.<br /><br />Still, this is better written than 99% of thrillers out there, and a more gripping read than most \\"literature\\", and i don't hesitate to recommend it.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|I remeber feeling slightly let down by Discovery, but still happy that there were at least a few great tracks on the CD.  Our French friends have clearly changed for the worse with this one, plain and simple.  Each track contains only a few different loops and the mixing doesn't sound like mixing at all it sounds like they just throw in a loop and then switch it off a few minutes later.  Homework had so many creative fades and crazy loops that you can go through the entire album and have trouble telling where one song ends and the other begins.  I was disappointed, let's hope they spend more than two months on their next album.
B00004YA66|4.0|\\"Frequency\\" caught my eye a couple of years ago whenever I saw it on the satellite.  I missed it when it was out in theaters.  I wish I hadn't.  It is a brilliant tale filled with wonder, mystery, fantasy, and baseball.<br /><br />The story bounds seamlessly between 1999 and 1969, when the aurora borealis cause a tear in time that allows Quaid to talk to his son(Caviezel) via a ham radio.  Caviezel manages to tell his father how he will die and what he must do to avoid it.  The result is a twist and turn of happenings that wouldn't have occurred if Quaid would have died as originally planned.  With new events underway that make significant changes in the lives of the entire family, Quaid and his son begin to work together in order to set time right.  I won't say much more than that about the plot, so that I don't give too much away.<br /><br />Quaid is solid as the lead character, Frank Sullivan.  Caviezel does a great job as Frank's son, John.  The rest of the cast, especially Andre Braugher, do an excellent job.  The story moves at a good pace and there is plenty of action for folks who crave it.<br /><br />The science fiction is key to the story, but this feels more like a drama than a sci-fi flick.  Also, the background story that ties the entire film together, the run of the Amazin' Mets of 69, is brilliant to watch unfold(even though the end result is pretty obvious).<br /><br />I consider this flick a wonderful edition to anyone's collection who enjoys suspenseful drama, science fiction with a little twist, or baseball.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000002KIE|5.0|Here is what I have to say: these stupid punk bands of today have got NOTHING on the originals. Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Simple Plan are just a bunch of wailing crybabies complaning about how life is soooo hard. Well, back in the 70s life was alot harder for up and coming punk artists who couldnt even get gigs. These kids threw away their lives to try and make their careers as serious artists. Some made it. Some didnt. And those who did make it had a certain something that kept them going. <br />Now a word about Busted: Busted was a band that only released ONE song. Better yet, it was in the UK. Still, they toured America, where no one had ever heard of them, made loads of money, had their own TV show called \\"America or Busted\\", were featured in magazines as the \\"hot new thing\\", and then broke up less than 4 months later. <br />I realize times have changed. But they should not have changed so much that we cannot recognize great music like the Sex Pistols.

B00005JKJA|4.0|Laura Elana Harring and Naomi Watts star in this confusing but highly entertaining movie about dreams, suicide, and mistaken identities.  The first two hours of this film are a dream of a woman known as Diane Selwyn, while the last half hour is actually Diane's real life. <br /> <br />What makes this movie somewhat hard to grasp is that the viewer is never made aware that they're watching a dream sequence.  The movie just flows along without the viewer knowing that what they are actually seeing is someone's dream, not what is really occuring. <br /> <br />Betty (Naomi Watts) is the dream version of Diane.  Wholsome and down-to-earth, Betty is portrayed as an aspiring actress who has come to Los Angeles from Ontario, Canada in hopes of finding an acting job.  But, Diane is not Betty in the dream, she's really Rita (Laura Elana Harring).  Rita is a woman who was involved in a horrific car crash and somehow lost her memory.  She comes upon Betty's Aunt's apartment, where she ends up meeting Betty.  She convinces Betty to help her search for her lost identity, and the two become very close along the way, as evidenced by the steamy sex scenes between the two. <br /> <br />Although this movie is hard to follow at some parts, I did enjoy it overall.  Naomi Watts and Laura Elana Harring are simply perfect together, as evidenced by their excellent on-screen chemistry and the attraction and passion that develops between their characters of Betty and Rita.  The many sub-plots in the movie are very exciting as well, and everything is tied together in the end.  I recommend this movie highly.  The acting is first-rate, the directing is good, and the story is fun to watch.  However, just remember to pay very close attention while watching so you can figure out the ending.
B0000041DF|5.0|This live recording by Argerich of Tchaikovsky's 1st and Rachmaninoff's 3rd is breathtaking!  I own at least 10 versions of Tchaikovsky 1st and 4 versions of Rachmaninoff 3.  This performance is one of the best.      Argerich plays the Tchaikovsky 1st with such passion and fire; her speeds are on the fast side, yet she does all the running passages with such virtuousity and excitement! The slower 2nd movement is played with much feeling, and Argerich builds up to a tremendous climax during the end of the 3rd movement.  The listener is just amazed and awestruck after hearing this performance!  This is one of the most exciting live versions of Tchaikovsky 1. I prefer it over Horowitz due to the better sound quality;  Argerich's performance is on par with that of Horowitz.    Kirill Kondrashin (Tchaikovsky) and Richard Chailly (Rachmaninoff) can barely keep up with Argerich and it makes for a fascinating listen -- the interplay between artist and the conductor on both pieces.      The Rach 3 does not disappoint either.  Argerich also does a great job of building up to a tremendous climax at the end of the 1st movement.  The slower passages are very moving and are played with a great sense of tone and finesse.        Actually, I'm more a fan of the Tchaikovsky than the Rachmaninoff 3 but I really enjoyed her re-endition of the Rachmaninoff 3.      All the versions of Tchaikovsky done by Argerich are oustanding (the studio version with Dutoit, and the other 1994 live version with Abbado) and are highly recommended.     Hold your breath while you listen to this recording.  It is that good!
0385512058|5.0|\\"Never Eat Alone\\" has encouraged new thinking for me.  This book makes \\"closely held \\"C\\" level intelligence\\" (often reserved for those that have already made it to the top) yours for the taking.  I got excited as I read and found myself taking notes on how I could put Ferrazzi's ideas to use.  Soon I was making list after list of the poeple I'd negelected to maintain conncections with in the \\"RIGHT\\" way.   <br /> <br />\\"Never Eat Alone\\" has a quality difference from many other business, networking, sales, and or marketing books.  Rather than \\"borrowing\\" key concepts from favorite authors such as Tom Peters, Mark McCormack, Malcolm Gladwell, Harvey Mackay and more...Mr. Ferrazzi expands on their best works and adds his own practical suggestions and experiences on how you can really get from A to B.  I've begun incorporating the powerful values he teaches into my daily life.   <br /> <br />\\"Never Eat Alone\\" is a book you'll want to read more than once to capture the many great ideas and solid practical examples. It's not a workbook - but if you're smart you'll use it as one!
B0007G89G4|5.0|Outstanding performances by great young actors would go for starters. The interaction between four boys on a search for a dead body during the late 1950s makes this film a classic!  <br />I had to laugh my head off at numerous parts of the movie - WIDE LOAD, THE LEACHES, THE PENNY COLLECTION HIDDEN UNDER THE HOUSE, SICK BALLS - THAT IS THE DOG SCENE - are just a few to mention. Then there are the serious parts of the move too. <br />The movie captures much of the essance of what kids are like between 6th and 7th grade.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This magnificent, swashbuckling epic takes place during the Napoleonic Wars, aboard the British frigate, HMS Surprise.  Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) has orders to destroy, or take as prize, the French warship Acheron, off the coast of Brazil.  Most of the film concerns the day to day life aboard ship and we get to know the men very well.  The Captain is a warm, intelligent man who enjoys puns and playing the violin as much as he loves the sea.  There is the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany) who is the Captain's friend and confidant and  Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis), one of many young boys who are learning about the sea and will one day be captains of their own ships.  The crew engage the Acheron in battle, and  the Captain asks the men to defeat the enemy for England, for home, and for the prize.<br /><br />This is Russell Crowe's best role to date, and he rates a 10 on the Macho-Meter.  He is gallant, brave, handsome, and kind in a very appealing performance.  The story is told at a leisurely pace, allowing us to feel the rolling of the ship, the camaraderie of the men, the adventure of it all.  The battle scenes are exciting, but not gory.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to those who want heroic, sensitive characters that you care about, a literate script, and masterful direction.<br /><br />Kona
0694013889|2.0|I bought the book to help my daughter with potty training but we (my husband and I) found it a little to explicit for such young children, I could have done without the little girl bent over telling us this is where the poop comes out, I've recently gotten a few other books that do a much better job without being so, well gross.  I wouldn't recommend this one over any other potty training books.
0553212540|5.0|Dorian Gray was quite the read.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.<br /><br />Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"<br /><br />This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.<br /><br />The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.<br /><br />The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read.recommended to anyone looking for a good classic read.
B000000XB9|5.0|I just recently started listening to Classic Rock and I have to say that this CD is some of the best I have heard yet.  Their lyrics are original and i think that you will be suprised of how many of the songs you have already heard on this CD.  I never even heard of CCR when I listened to this CD and I was blown away by how many of the songs i already knew.  Some of my favorites are: have you ever seen the rain, who'll stop the rain, Lodi, and Proud Mary but I think that every song is great.  one of the songs that i found interesting that i had never heard of was: Someday Never Comes, Which is starting to become my favorite song by them.  The song is about how his parents are getting divorced and how he deals with it, then he grows up, has a baby and then divorces his wife.  It ends with him telling his son that someday he'll understand and I think that it is just a great song.
B00028HBKM|5.0|One of the best movies of the year. Forget the gore, forget the controversy. American Cinema is a visual medium and being such, employs the use of visual aspects to tell a story. The makeup and costumes and language is excellent. You will be emotionally moved by what you watch and yes, that's what movies are supposed to do. If I didn't cry at the end of Old Yeller, what kind of movie would that be? Visually the film is magnificent - from the serpent at the bottom of Satan's feet to the aerial view through God's teardrop after the crucifixion, this is a well-made movie and is recommended. After all, there is a reason why the movie made a ton of money - why should you be left out. Buy a copy today and watch it with your children. Answer their questions - and be honest. Why? Want to guess how many parents out there don't know where their children are 3 in the morning (or don't care)? This will bond father and son, mother and daughter, and vice versa. Thank you Gibson!
B000069HPL|5.0|How many times have you woke up on a workday, the feeling of dread so heavy that you feel like you have one of those cartoon anvils around your neck, and you'd love to \\"just not go.\\"  No phone call pretending illness or lying about a fake catastrophe to the boss, just go back to bed and \\"don't go.\\"  Then, live vicariously through Peter and watch this movie.  Don't rent it, OWN it.  Watch it over and over!  It's truly comic genius from fellow North Texan Mike Judge, who knocks it out of the park.  His previous doings such as King of the Hill and Beavis & Butt-Head should indicate his dry, honest, plain ol' hilarious sense of comedic timing and satire.
0743454529|4.0|The story opens with a flood of medical speak, and you know at once that this author has done her research. Overall, it's an interesting and engaging read, however the mother \\"Sara\\" is written as an absolutely unsympathetic character, and several of the other character's actions and motivations are not easily understood. In particular the opaque relationship between Campbell and Julia relies heavily on confusing flashbacks and encounters that make little sense. <br /> <br />Like other readers, I did not like the ending. I did not think that she needed a \\"deus ex machina\\" to end her tale, and the epilogue was unsatisfying. Perhaps Picoult felt the need to tie up all the loose ends, but it was just plain implausible. <br /> <br />It's worth a read, though, certainly plenty of food for thought.

0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton films are delightfully witty and creative. They are visually stunning and the wild twists of plot are very entertaining. He also pushes his actors into \\"over the top\\" performances, and Johnny Depp is totally over the top in this film.  <br /> <br />There is a certain charm to this tale even if there is one decapitation after another. I lost count of all the heads rolling around after about 20. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Craine, a young man wrestling with his internal demons and memories while trying to solve a mystery with a real monster. Ichabod's mother, a nature lover or deist, is tortured and killed by his fundamentalist Christian father to save her soul. This small commentary on the dangers of Christian fundamentalism I found interesting as a sub-plot for the film. <br /> <br />Another aspect of Burton is that he does not sentamentalize children, in fact he lets them get killed just like the adults. The scene where the headless horseman decapitates the mid-wife and her husband while their child is hidden in the basement is pretty grim. The average director would have the child peek throught the floor boards and watch his parents die but the child would escape to tell the tale. Not Burton!  He has the horseman also find and kill the hiding child along with the parents. Strong stuff!  <br /> <br />The visual effects were creepy, the plot offered a suspenseful tale of mystery and murder, and I felt entertained from beginning to end. Burton is so good at mixing horror and humor. I recommend the film highly. Don't expect philosophy, expect to be entertained.
0060594888|4.0|Let's face it, you're most likely to have read or heard about most of the success principles he's shed light upon in his book, from somewhere else before.<br /><br />That's because they're all common sense! If common sense is so common, why isn't everyone successful?<br /><br />I agree to his choice of naming the book \\"The Success Principles\\" instead of \\"The Success Secrets\\", because I believe there are no secrets to success, only inhibitions that we've created for ourselves. And that's what he's talking about in his first principle, that is, to take total 100% responsibility for your life.<br /><br />This book is so complete in giving you a roadmap for you to follow to get from your current position or situation in life to where you want to or aspire to be. It is complete in that it gives you a holistic all-round approach, but in this approach itself, lies the flaw of not going into the down-to-earth, \\"what you can apply now\\" details of each principle.<br /><br />Actually, he pays more attention to some principles more than others, probably because they are more important to your success, but I believe that you can get to where you want to be faster and better if you deeply and truly internalise and apply all the principles in concert, and the only way to do that is through persistence (or 'trial and error').<br /><br />It's not perfect, no book is ever perfect, but it's complete in its own way.

1400032717|5.0|A triumphant autistic fantasy.<br /><br />Haddon manages to write a consistently engaging book from the perspective of an autistic teenager. It feels too palatable to me as non-autistic to feel the structure and style is utterly authentic - but it's still an impressive imaginative feat.<br /><br />It's more than that. It's very satisfying as a detective novel. Who did kill the dog? And finding *that* out only invites more questions - bigger and more threatening ones. There's that lovely twist of the knife when we realise this diverting investigation about other people actually is coming right back to suddenly be very personal. There are plausible surprises that really manage to effect you while integrating perfectly with the crime plot and building intensity.<br /><br />It's more than that. These characters, Christopher, his family and neighbours, really manage to come across as believable people. They are imperfect, they do good things, bad things, but always understandable things. Sometimes you want to get into the pages and shout at them, but even when they arouse our anger they've still got our sympathy: not bad given the extremity of their behaviour.<br /><br />And this is not even to mention the pleasure of Chris' deadpan narration of constant, often laugh out loud funny, dialogue misunderstandings, nor the thought-provoking (if at times straw-man) philosophical asides. Or the page turning odyssey in Chris' epic flight to London - as riveting a narrative as any dramatic escape I've come across in any thriller.<br /><br />Top stuff. Very original. Good characters. Good episodes. Excellent structure. What else do you want?
B0007OASII|5.0|3 words of advice: BUY IT NOW. <br /> <br />King Arthur would be proud, bcs Black Halo is the best album from the mighty Kamelot metal knights.  After the great Karma album (an awesome melodic metal piece) and its more epic successor (properly named Epica), Kamelot rewards us by mixing the two together and adding more complexity, variation and heaviness to create an album that defies your senses and leaves you thirsty for more.  Awesome, to say the least.   <br /> <br />If the future of melodic metal is what we see in this album and the latest releases from Edguy, Masterplan and Angra, then the dark days of grunge and new metal are definitely over.  In Black Halo, Roy Kahn is singing better than ever, incredible feeling and melodic, but without the exageration common in this genre.  Youngblood is guitarring with rage and inspiration.  Great compositions, heavy riffs, effective solos and no Malmsteenian masturbation.  Traditional Kamelot slow downs in the middle of the songs are better than in Karma and Epica, more contained and more emotional.  Keyboards are also better and more contained, but making great solo battles with Youngblood's guitar.   <br /> <br />About the songs, hard to choose a fave from so many good ones:  <br />- March of Mephisto is a great opener, not very fast but with a great chorus complemented by Shagrath's black metal vocals.  <br />- When The Lights Are Down accelerates, the first heavy riffs, another great chorus and a guitar/keys solo battle.  <br />- The Haunting is a slower, growing with time, emotional song.  Simone Simmons angelic voice adds to Roy's perfection making you singalong from the start while Youngblood's solo have you humming its simple, subtle and perfect notes.   <br />- Soul Society is the best Karma-like song in this album, reminding me of Forever, wonderful.   <br />- Abandoned is an emotional, slow and sad ballad, complemented by symphonic elements and Miss Simmons angelic notes.   <br />- This Pain slow start, toned-down heavy riffs, mistery movie keyboards and variations of tempo prepares you for more singalong chorus and a great, heavy, fast guitar solo.   <br />- Moonlight's opening hides the heaviest riff in Kamelot's history, a perfect riff for a Marvel-based movie like Spider-Man, followed by traditional but better Kamelot typical stuff.  Awesome, incredible.   <br />- The Black Halo is a great song, with all vocal, guitar and keys notes growing with time and leading you to a chorus full of epic and grandiose.   <br />- Nothing Ever Dies is the melodic/speed metal song, but in Kamelot's style.   <br />- Memento Mori is something hard to believe. It mixes Savatage from Dead Winter Dead and Wake of Magellan, Kamelot's slow-downs and choruses, Nightwish Once's symphonic moments (mostly Ghost Love Score),  Dream Theater solos, and even some Angra/Shaaman slower moments.  What can I say besides the fact that it is an awesome, kick-a** grandiose masterpiece of epic metal.   <br />- Serenade brings the band back to melodic metal, but on a slower and keyboard oriented manner.  Great ending for a great album.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is the best puck, rock, alternative, grunge whatever you wanna call it album ever. Every song is different from another and has a specific identity. I was 13 when this album came out and it changed my life and the way I was perceiving music, like thousands of teenagers. I wish all the 15-18 year old kids today could have an album like this coming out because this is Music, it has nothing to do with all the commercial products that we hear nowadays and that people call \\"music\\". Anyway kids, listen to this album, event it's 14 year old now, I'm sure you'll love it and I hope you see what a great loss Kurt's suicide was.
068987474X|2.0|Sorry, I bought this book thinking I would see and learn more about how we men think and relate to women, to improve in this area. This book shows nothing more than one type of guy, your basic dysfunctional jerk, and does nothing to help people get real in relationships. I gave it two stars because it helps women see what a careless jerk would be like, but not every guy is the same. I was disappointed in the read.
B00002Z88D|2.0|to me this is metallica throwing in the towel after 20 years of solid heavy metal. (glad they did it before another reload)
B000001AFY|5.0|This self titled album marks a transitional point in Ross's musical career.She was steeped very deeply in movie acting at this time but still have her songs a sensually soulful bite.And certainly that quality is present on the the vocal pause and release of \\"Love Hangover\\",a funky proto disco classic that builds luciously in tempo and was thankfully a HUGE hit for her.This also includes the alluring but meloncaulic theme from<br /><br />'Mahogony' \\"Do You Know Where Your Going To\\",this album being the best place to get that song.Her version of \\"Ain't Nothin' But A Maybe\\" actually rivals Rufus & Chaka's two year old rendition,despite sounding very similar musically.\\"I Thought It Took A Little Time\\",\\"After You\\",\\"Once More In My Lifetime\\" and a triumphant version of \\"Smile\\" deliver slow,sensuas backups in Ross's familiar style,even while tempered by the upbeat soul of \\"Kiss Me Now\\".As of this 1976 album Diana Ross hadn't yet lost her original soulful quality to showbiz schmaltz and this album proves that somewhere underneath all that glitter and glam the ol' lead singer of the Supremes is there intact,as she is here!
B000002H97|5.0|ENTER SANDMAN- great way to kick off the album, hetfields lyrics are great 9/10<BR>SAD BUT TRUE- easily could be the best track on here. Great riffs/solos/lyrics 10/10<BR>HOLIER THAN THOU- my personal favorite. Quick fast riffs from hetfield and jason newsted bass cannot be beat 9.7/10<BR>THE UNFORGIVEN- just another wonderful preformance. 9.4/10<BR>WHERE EVER I MAY ROAM- awesome track, starts good ends good great solo and riffs 9.9/10<BR>DONT TREAD ON ME- Maybe lars's best preformance on this album, great lyrics 9.1/10<BR>THROUGH THE NEVER- very nice riffs/solos  8.9/10<BR>NOTHING ELSE MATTERS- almost better than sad but true, this song is done to perfection with slow strong lyrics and nice riffs 10/10<BR>OF WOLF AND MAN- nice lyrics and riffs, also noticably good back up singing. 9.5/10<BR>THE GOD THAT FAILED- good song, but the last 3 just cant match up to the top dogs 7.9/10<BR>MY FRIEND OF MISERY- another strong preformance on all parts, nothing special though. 8.1/10<BR>THE STRUGGLE WITHIN- pretty nice song, amazing chorus. nice way to close out a great album 8.7/10
B00000GUZP|5.0|After four highly sucessful albums with the group Blondie the multi-talented Debbie Harry decided to make a go of a solo career.She very wisely chose the production team of Chic's Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers for the studio work-their groups influnce was heard strongly on Blondie's \\"Rapture\\" a year earlier and on songs such as \\"Jump Jump\\",\\"Surrender\\" and \\"Backfired\\" Harry does a superb job of bettering that earlier tune's funky rock approch.But characteristically she is too much of a musical eclectic to remain confined to a single style-\\"Jam Was Moving\\" and \\"Chrome\\" both have a spikey new-wave approch whilst maintaining a strong groove while on \\"Inner City Spillover\\" she flirts with a poppish reggae rhythm.The ballad \\"Now I Know You Know\\" has a much more melodramatic reading then anything Blondie ever did and she continues to maintain her own experimental elan throughout the rest of the album.So to end this review to I prefer 'Koo Koo' to Blondie last three records?I wouldn't say that but while Blondie was (as Harry has admitted) more from the new wave rock scene this album stands out with a much more groove centered funk style.They're all matched to terrific songs but this album was a success for her and,such as it was something of a final nail in Blondie's coffin as a group.But still,what a way to begin a career!
B000002KKS|5.0|I never really liked Black Sabbath until Dio joined the band. I didn't liked ozzy's voice, but I love Dio's voice. Dio is one of my favorite singers, and Osbourne just can't sing. So buy this one and the others with Dio, and don't buy the ones with Osbourne.
0142001104|5.0|The Art of Possibility rates as one of my top 5 of all time.  Others will tell you the details.  I will simply say that it will change your life.  Hard to believe that someone could have created what I think is THE reference book for possibility.

B000063DI9|5.0|People are blinded by Run to the Hills and The Trooper. Iron Maiden began slipping from popularity around the time of Seventh Son, due to \\"excessive synths\\" and a changing popular music climate at the end of the 80's. This is a concept album and along with Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, represents one of the most fully realized and smooth flowing albums. It feels 100% complete and whenever I listen to any of these tracks individually I feel a little guilty, knowing that these songs should only be heard in the context of this album. It has always been my favorite Maiden CD, although it is by far their most progressive album, keeping the distortion down, but the number of tempo and key changes are staggering, and not one of them misplaced.  Sure their earlier records are flawless also, and this one has some cheese in it, but I think you should give it another chance.<br /><br />Favorite Track - Infinite Dreams<br /><br />Least Favorite - Can I Play With Madness
B0000019PA|5.0|Plain and simple... \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" is one of the best written, performed, recorded, and engineered records of the last 20 years (if not ever). The poetry of Jeff Mangum's lyrics is at a near unheard of level on this recording and every second of it is sheer bliss. If I were asked to make a list of my absolute favorite 3 records, this would be on it. <br />Perfection. A must have. <br />
B00008AY3L|4.0|When I listen to this cd, and Ben Harper in general, I think its probably how someone in the 60's felt listening to Bob Dylan, or in the 70's listening to Bob Marley. Everyone of Ben Harper's songs tells a story, and it never gets tedious. Its also refreshing to hear spiritual themes, without being hit over the head with a message. With My Own Two Hands, Diamonds, Brown-Eyed Blues, and Amen Omen are examples of this using vastly different styles.  <br /> <br />The only downside to this is that Diamonds on the Inside is kinda all over the place, it doesn't quite flow together like his previous works. I am glad though that Ben isn't getting complacent. This is a great transitional album. I kinda compare it to Pearl Jam's No Code. By experimenting on this album and on his new one with the Blind Boys of Alabama, I'm sure fans like myself can expect a lot more great songs from Ben Harper for a long time to come.
B000002OCP|4.0|I love it when a record causes this much passion from reviewers. I must admit that for blues purists this record is a bit of sacrilege, but taken for what it's worth there are some gems here. One listen to 'Tom Cat' will show you what I mean. The track is just *dope*. Should be taken in by Funk aficionados... You'll be happy.
B000002J1H|4.0|It's a sign of how much things have changed in rock music, that back in the 70's if a popular band went more than a year or two without a new album, it was considered a comeback if they did a new one.  Adding to the comeback tag for Yes's Going For the One was the return of wayward keyboard player Rick Wakeman.<br /><br />After 1974's Relayer, Yes had gone their seperate ways to work on solo projects, then the punk/new wave movement broke and the writing was on the wall for the classic prog era.  The band had dropped hints prior to its release that the record would tone down the excesses of the past and make some concessions to the new wave.  In actuality it did little of the former and none of the latter.  Going For the One is in retrospect just a solid if unspectacular entry in Yes's 70's discography, and one of the better late-era prog albums.<br /><br />I remember quite liking the title track as a teenage prog fan, but these days I find the song almost unlistenable due to Steve Howe's out of control slide guitar.  Howe is an enormously talented musician, so this was a very rare misstep.<br /><br />Things take a huge turn for the better on the poignant \\"Turn of the Century\\" featuring some killer acoustic work from Howe.  Jon Anderson's lyrics are poetic yet tell a literate story, and it's a touching one.  Chris Squire's \\"Parallels\\" is a hard-charging rocker marred only by Wakeman's decision to use a church organ where a good old Hammond should have been.  Still it just may be my favorite track on the record, with some truly energetic jamming.<br /><br />\\"Wonderous Stories\\" was a rather half-hearted attempt at a radio hit, but is harmless enough in it's mellow acoustic way.  That leaves the closer, a good old Yes epic.  The band almost always excelled at the long-form stuff and \\"Awaken\\" does not disappoint.  At 15 1/2 minutes it's only slightly trimmed from the old side-long epics and runs through a variety of motifs, key and tempo changes.  Wakeman is said to have hated Alan White's percussion interlude but I like it.  It's unique in the Yes discography.<br /><br />\\"Turn of the Century\\" \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Awaken\\" are great enough to earn Going For The one 4 stars in my book.d to have hated Alan White's percussion interlude but I like it.

B0000541AM|5.0|I'll never forget seeing this in the theater in 1979. I was 20 years old. It's hard to overstate the impact that this film had on my friends and myself. At the time it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. When I watch this now it doesn't have quite the same impact as it did 25 years ago but it still gets me going, and there are a few scenes that are just unforgettable. I am disappointed with this DVD release. The picture quality is anamorphic widescreen which looks great. The audio, however, is Dolby Digital Mono. I realize this is the way the original audio was recorded, but this needs to be remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS. This soundtrack could be fantastic but sounds very flat on this DVD release. If they can remaster old low budget horror stuff like The Evil Dead into 5.1 surround they can do anything. There is no excuse not to. It would also be great to have commentaries and maybe some interviews with some of the actors. I'm sure a new release of this will be coming at some point and I will buy it on DVD again. This will always be a very special film to me and it deserves a better treatment on DVD than this.
B000005H40|5.0|Blue Note released a slew of these \\"blowing sessions\\" in it's heyday, but what makes this one unique is that it's John Coltrane's one and only recording for the label.  Blue Train finds 'Trane leading a sextet as opposed to his familiar later work in the quartet format.  The Miles Davis rhythm section of Paul Chambers and \\"Philly\\" Joe Jones is joined by trombonist Curtis Fuller, blues influenced pianist Kenny Drew and the outstanding trumpet player Lee Morgan.<br /><br />The set kicks off with the familiar \\"Blue Train\\" one of Coltrane's most memorable themes.  The band chugs along to the fast blues while everybody but Jones solos, with Drew and the horn players getting plenty of room to stretch out.<br /><br />\\"Moment's Notice\\" makes it clear that this is the kind of session where just about everybody is going to solo on each cut.  This track is happy and upbeat after the bluesy opener.  To me it has an almost New Orleans-y vibe especially in Lee's solo.<br /><br />\\"Locomotion\\" is an uptempo blues with nice use of some unison horn riffing and more fine soloing all around in hard bop mode.<br /><br />\\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" is the only standard in the set and the only ballad, a a style Coltrane handles with his usual authority.<br /><br />\\"Lazy Bird\\" brings things to a close as the band barely touches on the theme, seeming as though they can't wait to take off on the round of solos.  It's the perfect summation of the free-blowing mood of the record.<br /><br />Any jazz collection, any Blue Note collection, any Coltrane collection...heck any music collection should include Blue Train.
B00028HBL6|3.0|The Passion of the Christ is powerfully moving and fanatically obtuse in equal doses. The typical star rating doesn't apply, because scenes range from classic to poor and all stops in between. But name another Hollywood icon who would spend $30 million out of his own pocket to bring his personal obsession with Christ's agony to the screen and film it in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles. Jim Caviezel, who plays Jesus, doesn't so much give a performance as offer himself up as raw meat. So graphic are the torture scenes -- flayings, a crown of thorns, whips with barbed metal tips, nails driven into hands and feet -- that the film seems like the greatest story ever told by the Marquis de Sade. Gibson introduces horror elements, such as an androgynous Satan with Gollum-like spawn. And tricked-up sequences -- a tear from God the Father that falls from heaven like the bomb from Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor -- cheapen the film's purpose: to show the enormity of Christ's suffering. More questionable is the caricature of the Jewish high priest Caiaphas (Mattia Sbragia) and the sympathetic take on the Roman governor Pilate (Hristo Shopov). But Gibson's immersion in the blood of Christ is an act of faith filmed with a zealot's rapture. It's a shame he has no faith in audiences to feel Jesus' pain without rubbing their noses in it. By filming New Testament Gospels with Old Testament fire and brimstone, his Passion emerges as something contrary to Jesus's spirit: unforgiving.
B000683VI4|5.0|Movies rarely make me cry, but this one does every time. It is the only movie I prefer over the book, because you get a sense of who the characters really are rather than imagining them. I don't suggest you rent this movie; BUY IT. You will want to see it more than once, trust me.
B0002858YS|5.0|My favourite album of 2004, `Hot Fuss', restores my faith in the future of good music.   The Killers are an amazing new band, whose style is a blend of 80's inspired Indie rock/pop. They draw influences from bands of the past generation, but still manage to     maintain their own unique sound.   Hot Fuss is a fantastic collection of songs that feature extremely catchy melodies, meaningful lyrics and gorgeous vocals.  The lead singer conveys so much emotion in his voice, particularly evident in the tale of jealousy `Mr Brightside'. This is another appealing aspect of Hot Fuss, the songs follow a story, and actually have meaning, which seems to be a lacking component in the music released today.    These songs are just plain fun to listen to, and it's almost impossible to resist the urge to sing along. There is no denying the sheer brilliance of tracks such as `Somebody Told Me', `Mr Brightside' and `Smile Like You Mean It'.   The Killers have created some great musical gems that many bands would be lucky to make in their whole career, let alone their debut album.  I cannot stop singing the praises of this album and this band, and can't wait to hear more from them in the future.

B000062YAZ|2.0|First off, let me say I love metal. Sabbath, Pantera, Iron Maiden, (old i.e. pre-Black Album)Metallica, Megadeth, it's all good. But this....what is this? It's just noise, that's it. Yeah, there are some VERY good riffs (Angel of Death and Raining Blood come to mind), but everything else.....it's just noise. Seriously, I'd listen to St. Anger before I'd listen to this.* I dunno. Personally, I do not like it. But there are a lot of people out there who do, and that's fine I guess. It is without a doubt one of the msot influential and (in)famous albums of all time however.  <br /> <br /> <br />*Ok, a bit of an exaggeration, but still...
B00005OWEG|4.0|Well, I finally saw APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX last night and have to say I was somewhat disappointed. After reading several reviews (professional and amateur) which stated that ANR was the equal to or better than the original film, I have to say I respectfully disagree. At 2 hours and 33 minutes, the pre-REDUX cut of APOCALYPSE NOW was hardly a model of concision (which, to be fair, hardly seemed to be Coppola's intent). Clocking at 3 hours and 22 minutes (yikes!), ANR strikes me as a bit too sprawling. There is this, however: if what you enjoyed most about the original was its unique atmosphere of bad-acid-trip dread, ANR has even more lysergic weirdness to love/be disturbed by.  <br /> <br />One thing is about ANR is superior, though: the new Technicolor print of the movie is absolutely gorgeous, pretty much convincing me that this is the most beautifully-shot color film of the last 50 years. Vittorio Storaro (who was also the DOP on LAST TANGO IN PARIS and THE LAST EMPEROR, among others) really outdid himself here - you feel like you can reach in through the screen and wipe the beads of sweat off Martin Sheen's face. <br /> <br />The DVD edition is good, albiet pretty bare bones: very nice widescreen transfer (though I've read complaints that it is not true to the original aspect ratio of the film - honestly, I'm not sure about this) and 5.1 surround sound (as is only fitting for the film that set the standard for cinematic sound design), English subtitles, theatrical trailer (for ANR), and that's about it. Maybe someday they can do a 2-disc deluxe edition with audio commentaries and Fax Bahr and George Hickenlooper's must-see \\"making of\\" documentary HEARTS OF DARKNESS. How 'bout it, Miramax? <br /> <br />Final rating (1 - 5 star scale): <br />Film: 4 stars <br />DVD: 3 stars <br />Average: 3 1/2 stars
B0000B1OFL|5.0|Why should I say I love this movie? Because its got Donald Sutherland. Ever since I saw him whistle and silence those dogs in \\"The Eagle has landed,\\" I have been a fan of his. Or is it because of the reference to Napster by one of the characters and some multiple nerdy scenarios with him incl. \\"You can't shut down the real Napster,\\" in what must be one of the most adorable \\"thumbing the nose,\\" scenes in movies! Or is it because of Edward Norton, who excels at being the vulnerable evil guy in a movie? Or the prevalence of Money by Floyd all thru the movie? Or due to the fantastic background score & music by John Powell? Maybe all of these reasons. And hey, don't forget the Mini Cooper. Adorable little creature. The flick is slick and hence I shall stop raving and recommend you see it if you haven't already. If you have seen it, see it again and enjoy the show! A slick movie deserves a slick review ;)  <br /> <br />
0385337388|4.0|Disclaimer:  No, I'm not an MD.  Yet.  Check back with me in ten years or so. <br /> <br />That said, coming from a family where every other person is an MD, RN or allied health provider, I've spent more time in and around the medical profession than I care to think about.  I also spent two years as a volunteer patient care liaison in the Emergency Department where this book takes place.  (Yes, it's the old BI, nowadays amalgamated into BI-Deaconess Medical Center.  For that extra touch of realism, take the Green Line D to Longwood, go sit in the plaza outside the Shapiro Clinical Center and read this book.  The Wing of Zock will be two hundred feet up Brookline Ave, and if you walk half a block past that, you'll see the old ED.) <br /> <br />\\"House of God\\" isn't all that well written, but it is truthful in a way that very few of its more polished brethren can hope to approach.  Put bluntly, life in medicine today is about as far from what you see on \\"ER\\" and its ilk as you can get.  It's a world of bad caffeine, inhuman call schedules and increasingly sicker patients, more and more micro-management of patient care and less and less regard for the people who provide it.  In such a world, it is small wonder that your average emergency MD goes in knowing that he or she will be completely burned out after maybe five or ten years in practice. <br /> <br />As a volunteer, I watched scores of MS and PGYs (medical students and interns/residents, in Medspeak) stumble through exactly the same trials the protagonists of \\"House of God\\" face, except none of them got to score with the nurses, and most of them suffered the same kinds of breakdowns, too.  The punch of this book hasn't diluted any with time, either - if anything, its key points are even more salient in this world of managed care and patient-a-minute \\"efficiency\\" mandates, where doctors and nurses are increasingly seen as faceless, disposable \\"health services providers.\\" <br /> <br />Read this book, and then go giveyour doctor a big hug.  After what he or she went through to earn those letters, it's far too well deserved.
B0006B29WA|5.0|I'm not a music expert by any means, but Franz Ferdinand strike me as a cross between The Clash and The Cure, with more modern Interpol-esque elements thrown in.  What results is a highly (re)listenable, original, catchy sound that'll satisfy that need to listen to some \\"Good Stuff\\".<br /><br />A friend of mine suggested I listen to Interpol, so I ordered a couple of their albums off of Amazon and thought they were decent, although it seemed something was missing.  Amazon always lists similar artists underneath any given CD, and I saw that Franz Ferdinand was listed.  Having never heard of them, I offhandedly read a couple reviews and promptly forgot about them... until a few months later when I saw their CD combined with a bonus CD at a local \\"City\\" of the \\"Circuit\\" variety during their bi-annual $9.99 CD sale.  I picked it up not expecting anything, but I gotta tell you -- I love it!<br /><br />The bonus CD is really the deal-maker, with a faster-tempo'd rerecording of This Fire (it's entitled This Fffire on the bonus CD) that's much catchier than the great, original version (it makes me think of \\"That Thing You Do\\", which started out as a slow song until Guy sped it up; some songs were born to be fast... \\"That Thing You Do\\" and \\"This Fire\\" are two of them).  \\"Van Tango\\" is fun and one of the better songs on the two-CD album, along with \\"All For You, Sophia\\", which is currently my favorite Franz Ferdinand Song.  \\"Words So Leisured\\", while not their best work, is interesting as sort of a \\"respin\\" of \\"Darts of Pleasure\\", track number 8 on the main CD.<br /><br />The main album, also, isn't lacking great songs.  I've greatly enjoyed \\"Take Me Out\\", an instanly recognizable song (after the 45-second introduction), even if you've never heard it before. \\"This Fire\\", of course, is excellent, and \\"Auf Achse\\" will have you pressing the repeat button a few times.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are all good; some may like the others even more than the ones I've suggested, proving that there's something good for everyone here.od for everyone here.
B00008R9KF|5.0|A Pakistani (Gordon Warnecke) in England befriends a Briton (Daniel Day-Lewis) and together, despite their racial differences, open up a laundrette. The two young men become lovers, which is kept secret from everyone else. Warnecke's father wants him to go to college, which adds to his pressures, but that is nothing compared to the racial tensions brought about by the anti-Pakistan street gangs that both boys face together. Extremely well acted with an intelligent script, despite being rather depressing.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I recently caught a viewing of Celtic Woman on my local PBS station. I must say that this performance really took my breathe away. The music was a good mix of celtic and classical/pop. I thought the four singers were quite good. I could not help but take notice of the clarity in their vocal performances. I love classical-crossover artists like Sarah Brightman and Josh Groban but those artists don't restrain their vocals a lot of the time. The women in Celtic Woman shows that you don't need to enunciate every single note to show that she can sing or to emphasize the emotion in the song. Don't get me wrong, I like Sarah and Josh but I often find their voices overwhelming at times. In the case of Celtic Woman, they have shown that they can sing without restorting to vocal acrobatics. The other member of Celtic Woman is a violinist named M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt who I found very engaging to watch. Her enthusiasm for performing really showed. The songs in this performance were fantastic. I was completely blown away when I listened to 15 year old Chloe sing \\"Walking in the Air\\", a song that my favorite heavy metal band Nightwish has performed on their \\"Oceanborn\\" cd. It was quite a contrast from what I was used to hearing. My favorite song that Chloe sang has to be the beautiful ballad \\"Someday\\". I was simply moved by the song. My other personal favorite performance was for the song \\"Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring\\", my favorite song by Sebastian Bach. I couldn't help but notice that the group did quite a few songs by Enya which were really excellent. I couldn't help but notice how similiar their voices were to Enya's. On a couple of occasions I closed my eyes, I thought I was listening to Enya herself. The one thing about this performance that I found rather unintentionally funny is the audience members. A few of them looked about as 'enthusiastic' to be there as I am at the dentist office. My most deeply personal favorite moment of the performance was the women's interpretation of \\"You Raise Me Up\\". Their version by far is the best I have heard. I was speechless when I heard them sing this lovely song. Otherwise this was a really great performance. Too bad when I saw it on tv, I had to put up with the annoying interrruptions because it is pledge season at PBS. After seeing this wonderful performance, I so want to see them live in concert when they come to my neck of the woods in October this year. They just made a new fan out of me.ou Raise Me Up\\".

B00009RAJH|5.0|i was the first on my block to hear RHIANNON and knew it was something special. i had heard OVER MY HEAD and liked it but after RHIANNON i knew i had to have this album. in the next six months i watched as the album ascended to number one. LANDSLIDE is now a classic but back then ROLLING STONE was not so kind to it. lindsey buckingham is one of the best guitarists and some of his best songs are on here. christine mcvie shines also, i just love SUGAR DADDY. it set up her and the mac's shuffling song sound that would follow. though the extras on this album are not as extensive as they are in TUSK and RUMOURS reissues, its still nice to have them. for an album that means so much. it introduced me to the voice i hear in my head, in my dreams...ah stevie nicks...
B0000028UK|5.0|grunge....ahh, the days of rock n' roll's return to the forefront, not pushed forward by lust or money or greed, but for the music. And that's what pearl jam is all about, too. the music. they're not another hair metal sleaze-garbage throwaway, they're not jane's addiction clones, they're who they want to be. They're eddie vedder, a troubled man who was and is seemingly the forceful, nearly more passionate rebirth of jim morrison; mike mcCready and Stone Gossard, 2 guitarists who play so differently than anyone out there, hitting just disco-esque riffs and lines, so surreal considering the band hearkens back to classic rock so much; jeff ament, a bassist whose liquid basslines give vs. some extra kick; and dave abbruzzese's full, sharp drums which punctuate an already impeccable sound. Face it folks, pearl jam, for a little while there, didn't just have the chance to become a band the caliber of led zeppelin and the stones- THEY WERE as good as most classic rock. <br /> <br />the album starts on a fiery note with 'Go', a hard hitting message to kurt cobain, chock full of incredible solos and another mesmerizing vocal performance by eddie vedder. 'Animal' is a great anti-rape song, driven forward with crushing guitar and another vocal performance (noticing a trend?) to die for. 'Daughter' is perhaps the single most recognizable song from the album- another anti-child abuse song by pj, which somehow uplifts and depresses all at the same time, an interesting talent that only the best of alternative bands seem to pull off. However, it couldn't be perfect forever. 'Glorified g' is a disappointing song, never seeming to get anywhere. instead of this song, yellow ledbetter or footsteps would have been good choices, as the album's songs are somewhat lacking in the length department at this point, and footsteps and ledbetter are both songs that are just too good to stay off of a major cd. however, this is only one song, and can easily be skipped. <br /> <br />'Dissident' isa pretty good song, heartfelt and sincere, although this song should have been much longer. i mean, it's not a direct downfall, but something tells me this song would be as good as alive or jeremy, even, if it was stretched out. 'WMA' is one of those songs that is just so original and interesting that it would seem cool even if it wasn't that truly great. But eddie....jesus christ, eddie vedder knocks down the house again on this one. man, these are some great anti-racist lyrics, and the way there sung...makes you wonder how not every rock fan knows of these guys.  btw, go rodney king! anyway...lol, anyway, 'Blood' is pure anger. Sure, i love black metal, etc, but THIS is the face of true anger and agression. Seems like an anti-heroin song, and eddie practically screams himself hoarse, including one incredible 14-second wail a minute in or so. And so we come to perhaps the best song in music no one knows about- 'Rearviewmirror'. God, this is beautiful: great riffs, a achingly emotional vocal performance, and such emotion that would make anyone with a bit of a crying tendancy to break out in tears. i mean anyone, including me. And if you know anyone who has ever been raped or abused, this song WILL make you cry. just perfect. if there's one song that shows how great this album is, it's this one. <br /> <br />'Rats' is such an interesting departure from rearviewmirror- while 'mirror is a rockin-weeper, rats is a maniacal, funky freak out that may not have the best vocal performance of eddie's career, but still rocks. 'elderly woman...' how can you describe it? besides footsteps, this is pearl jam's best all-acoustic song ever. and then leash brings you in and kicks your arse all over the place- rockin, anthemic, everything clicks on this one. and then comes my single favorite pearl jam song ever, maybe the SINGLE BEST song ever- 'Indifference'. Simply no way to describe it. it WILL make you cry, no matter what. unless you are lacking a soul, this song will really touch you. Vedder 'screams his lungs out', and solidifies his place as one of the greatest vocalists ever with this song alone. you need this album just for this song. simple.  <br /> <br />so what are you waiting for? pick up this masterpiece asap, no matter how much you're into music. Truly, Vs. has something special in store for every music fan.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I bought the DVD set thinking I wouldn't really care about the changes. Han Solo does that stupid CGI shifting when Greedo shoots at him, and I thought: Yeah, so what? Tons of other changes pepper the movie. But now, after owning the movies for awhile, I really DO care about the changes. They annoy me, they make my eyes roll, and now....well, now they even make me NOT want to watch the movies anymore. They just sit there on my shelf, all because I don't feel like watching the movie with my eyes rolling or my complaining sighs. Yeah, it matters. I want the originals. Sigh.
6304698623|5.0|Although not quite as great and visually stunning as the previous Frances Hodgson Burnett film adaptation, The Secret Garden, \\"A Little Princess\\" is a delightful film to watch any time, anywhere.  The story centers around Sara Crewe, a young girl brought from India by her father to be left under the care of Miss Minchin at her institution for girls in New York.  Sara has all she could ever want at the school, the most delightful riches and confort and a bunch of new friends, however, when Miss Minchin informs Sara that her father has been killed in war, Sara is then turned into a servant.  She is now required to work for the school in order for Miss Minchin to recover the financial losses caused by Captain Crewe's tragic death.    This Warner Brothers film is wonderfully done.  Very detailed surroundings give the movie a believable air that it is set in a more old-fashioned New York.  Liesel Matthews does a magnificent job of portraying the main character, Sara Crewe as well as all the other actors and actrices portraying their own characters.   I have never read the original F. H. Burnett book, although I have a copy and I plan on reading it soon, so I can't really compare the movie to the book.  Either way, the movie is definitely an inspiration to reading the novel, which I expect to be quite different based on other viewers' reviews.  I almost forgot to mention that the movie has beautiful music, nice soft ballads that are a combination of a classical rhythm and an indian-like chorus, as well as the repeated addition of the lovely song, \\"Kindle My Heart.\\"    If you enjoy this movie, I also recommend viewing the 1993 version of The Secret Garden, filmed by the same studio.  I give this movie five overall stars, I've added a VHS copy of it to my collection and plan on enjoying it for many years.
B00009RAJI|5.0|what can you say about the biggest selling album of that time? after FLEETWOOD MAC expectations for the band were so high. and they were met with this amazing album. stevie produced her most radio friendly song to date and gave the mac their first and only number one single DREAMS. christine kept on shining like a SONGBIRD with the heartbreaking OH DADDY.its demo is amazing with stevie singing back up on it. lindsey should have kept that version in the original. wasnt too often the two female leads sang that close together. love all the demo extras...wow...SILVER SPRINGS, classic. songs of desperation,seperation,anger and yes, hope...classic angst /rock masterpiece. please...dont ever break that chain.
B00003CXDB|5.0|To watch this movie in Moscow in 1988 as a student was a liberating and exhilarating experience. Here is the capitalism close-up, warts and all. And we loved it. In three more years the Soviet communism will be dismantled, free market hurriedly introduced, and some of my friends and fellow students will proceed to become very rich people themselves. I did not know then, that Gordon Gekko, a villain who incidentally was much admired by me, was a thinly veiled portrait of Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who incidentally was a son of Russian immigrants, became a center of the biggest insider trading scandal and government investigation in the 1980s, which let to the collapse of junk bond powerhouse firm Drexel Burnham. However, I knew that Gekko must be much more than a villain, otherwise how this ugly character could be so attractive? Of course, a huge part of it was a superb acting by Michael Douglas. But watching this film now, 17 years later, gave me an opportunity to ponder more on the subject from a different perspective. I think now that Gekko's character is archetypal and has the same qualities as Bulgakov's Woland from `Master and Margarita'. He is the Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand seducer, not just some greedy upstart and `faux bonhomme'. But one of the qualities of Lucifer is that he `brings out the light', he helps to illuminate things, partly because of his own darkness. Untimely, in the movie it was his turbulent encounter with Gekko, which helped Bud Fox to find his character and, in a way, redeem himself.  So in some strange way, the movie is a Wall-Street-version of age-old story of Faust.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|I'm a huge fan of zombies, a huge fan of horror-comedies, but this one just lacked zest in too many places. Boring spots here and there, slow pace, and it takes forever to get going. For the longest time I kept thinking, \\"C'mon, movie, get moving!\\" There are flashes of brilliance, no doubt about that, but it's too rare.
B00000255F|5.0|I was born in the year when this album was first released, so perhaps understandably I had little awareness of it at the time. Growing up, Bruce Springsteen to me was always Born In The USA and Glory Days, and none of the copious airplay devoted to the \\"Live 1975-1985\\" box set in my parents' house could shake that initial impression.<br /><br />But I always quite liked what bits of Springsteen's live performances I happened upon; whether or not you're a fan, you can't help but feel the energy that the E Street Band projects. That in itself is a rare enough commodity (especially in the current music scene) and one to be appreciated, so I eventually relented and bought Born To Run.<br /><br />What can be said about this album that hasn't already been committed to the page over the past 30 years? Not much - and for good reason, I'd wager. This is one of those records that I've assiduously avoided trying to dissect and intellectualize. The songs here are too visceral and too affecting to be waved aside by some dismissive categorization.<br /><br />You needn't be a staunch American patriot or blue collar worker to relate to these songs or to feel an endless affinity for the way that Springsteen evokes the plight of the characters that inhabit his stories. God, if you've ever felt the frighteningly boundless passion of youth you know exactly what it means when you hear \\"Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness / I'll love you with all the madness in my soul\\". If you've ever felt the gnawing need for escape from a situation that peels your soul away, you feel \\"It's a town full of losers / And I'm pulling out of here to win\\" in the pit of your being. If you've fallen short of the ideal version of yourself you saw stretched out at the peak of your youth, you've never heard more bittersweet words, I would wager, than \\"Remember all the movies, Terry / We'd go to see / Trying to learn to walk like the heroes / We thought we had to be.\\"<br /><br />For me, these songs resonate with something very primal, and the fact that I've lived a comparatively comfortable middle class life in a perfect family detracts in absolutely no way from my appreciation of this album. Springsteen has captured the essence of the most human experiences on Born To Run, in a way that links the most disparate demographics together in the commonality of struggle through everyday life.<br /><br />What more can be said ...? It's all said with infinitely more meaning in each note, in each word on every song on this record.s resonate with something very primal, and the fact that I've lived a comparatively comfortable middle class life in a perfect family detracts in absolutely no way from my appreciation of this album.

B00009RAJJ|5.0|coming off of the biggest album of all time the mac had their work cut out for them. though they were splintered emotionally as couples and friends, they had a lot to say. lindsey was trolling the punk scene. christine still mining the wanderlust. stevie found in her soul some of her most personal and touching feelings in songform. STORMS  will break my heart till i die. BEAUTIFUL CHILD is simply beautiful. ANGEL and SARA are poetic heartsongs that move me towards heaven. the demos are a must have for any machead. 25 years later this album is still a most exciting journey into the soul. rock on.
0375703764|1.0|Bret E. Ellis's much touted blurb should be embarrassing to him, but more so to those who buy his books.  To mention Danielewski's charade in the same sentence as Pynchon, Wallace, and Ballard shows only that Ellis hasn't read any of those other writers. King, who is indeed the King of Hacks, is a proper comparative I suppose. <br /> <br />In Infinite Jest Wallace used copious footnotes to help tell the story.  In House of Leaves there is one footnote that helps tell the story, and that is the group of letters from Johnny Truant's institutionalized mother.  Those letters are the best part of the book.  The rest is typing.  99% of the footnotes can be ignored, and as you approach the end, you can pretty much skip every other paragraph to the finish.  Fake scholarly works inserted into a rewriting of The Amityville Horror (or pick your haunted house story) do not make it scholarly.  Lots of Latin and Greek references do not make it intellectual, and telling a story within a story does not make it literary when you don't care about the people involved.  None of these characters is particularly endearing, and putting the words on the page in imitation of the geography the characters are experiencing is impressive only to those easily impressed. High school kids probably love this book.  Or college business administration majors.   <br /> <br />Anyone who wants a challenge or to read something experimental should try Robert Coover's The Public Burning or John Hawke's The Beetle Leg. <br /> <br />If this book changed your life, you need to get out more, go to a bookstore, then get in more. <br /> <br />There is nothing deep or deeply intellectual about this book, it is not a difficult read, unless you are unable to physically turn the book to read upsidedown or sideways, and there is certainly nothing to lead any well-read person to compare it to Wallace, Pynchon, or Ballard.  THere was not one sentence in this book that made me laugh the way Wallace does, or marvel at its genius the way Pynchon does.  As many have pointed out, it is simply dull.  I think a lot of people probably love the fact that they can say they read a 700 page book that is actually about 100 pages long if all the nonsense is removed and there aren't 20 pages with only one sentence or one word on them. <br /> <br />Most of all it's dull.  I usually toss aside a book this boring, but I wanted to be able to review it in its entirety.  I don't know Danielewski personally, but as a writer he and Ellis are a good pair, all hype. Two literary big hats with absolutely no cattle. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|For some reason I didn't think of this movie in terms of geeks or losers or outcasts, I just watched it as a quirky movie with quirky characters, all of it taking place in a surreal movie world. Why try to equate this movie with reality? It's just a nostalgia-tainted movie that shows one weird scene after another. Anyone who was a teen in the early 80's will love the atmosphere, anyone living in rural America will grin at the scenery, but other than that...c'mon, let's just chalk these characters up to playful cinematic fun. I've seen this movie, like, around 10 times or so, and never has it bored me. Each time I watch it, there's always something new I find funny or interesting.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've never really been a hardcore Green Day fan. I do own all of their albums, but not a single one of their albums were great from start to finish. I would skip around between the songs I liked, and thought to myself that none of the songs on the last couple of albums were as good as the gems on the \\"Dookie\\" album, except maybe Macy's Day Parade. That is until I bought American Idiot. Not only has Green Day managed to out do the album that made them famous in the first place, they managed to make the most addicting album of the year. No longer do I skip around from song to song. When I listen to this CD I have to listen to it from star to finish, and I love every minute of it. The best songs are the flawless 9 minutes of \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Novacaine\\", and \\"When September Ends\\", but when you pick up this album do yourself a favor, and take out the lyrics put the CD in your radio and listen to it from start to finish. You'll be glad you did. Green Day, I salute you!
0385510454|5.0|Far and wide, I have heard \\"This book should have been on the cutting room floor\\" and \\"If it doesn't move the plot forward, leave it out.\\"  While this is true in most cases, it is not true for The Broker.  The extra information is, in my opinion, intended to immerse the reader in the life of Marco/Joel (the main character), and to firmly establish his growing comfort in his new Italian lifestyle.  I find it thoroughly engrossing, and the extra information only adds to the sudden change in lifestyle when his whereabouts are leaked.  This book is an extremely good read, and John Grisham's latest has by NO means let me down.
B00012BD0S|5.0|there are a few guys who reviewed this cd as being 'boring'. now if this style isn't your 'cup-of-tea', then don't bother trying to like it. BUT, if you have any musical awareness, then you'll find beauty in the midst of some heavy riffs.  <br /> <br />saying that romeo's shredding is 'boring' and 'redundant' is an absurd statement made by someone who simply can't keep up with what he's doing. his 'shredding' is nothing of showing off, if that were the case, just to show people what they want to see, then i suppose that symphony x would be another sell out like metallica, giving in to the desires of fans instead of following where the music leads. michael romeo, being the main contributor to the bands amazing song collection, is not about an ego, he is solely interested in the beauty of his music, which he seems to pull off quite well. so before taking the criticisms to heart, try listening for yourself. and no, dream theater is no where near 'infinitely' better than symphony x, it's quite opposite actually, and that comes from an ex-diehard fan of DT. petrucci taught me what i know on guitar w/ his music, but romeo blows him out of the water. now some of the musicians are debatable in regards to which person from which band is better, but overall symphony x delivers a much more rich musical experience. case closed.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Intelligent movie, haunting, beautiful in its surreal \\"rundown world\\" way, sapped of happiness or freedom or natural human life. It's perfect. The book is great, but the images you see in the movie are simply artistic. It really does take you to a different time and place, an alternate reality that COULD have happened. I have this DVD in my collection, and I love it when I'm in the mood, but it DOES get depressing a tad much near the end. But still, a movie relies on characterization and story, as does this one. The romantic elements, the true spark of life and interest to all of us, is what keeps this movie from being a total dour mood piece. You so totally want this man and woman to beat the odds and find a way to stay together. Mesmerizing.
B000000XB9|5.0|There is no one like John Fogerty. There is occasion in one's life when you look back and say...ok...if you give me one musician in the world...who would I want to spend an evening with...who would I want to say thank you personally to? Who would I want to say...you are my memory of then, now, and the way you are going John...into the future. John Fogerty. This album is a no brainer...there is not a bad song on here. Fact is there is nothing less than a superb song on here. I recently saw John on Crossroads with Keith Urban. If you have not seen that watch for it. Here is a pure legend...serious pure legend...in John Fogerty, and through that whole show you can tell that John throws the spotlight over to Keith. Granted...Keith is awesome...but such a humble and caring man in John. I digress. Trust me that this is an awesome album...and trust me that if it has the name of John Fogerty on it...it is pure legend...pure class...and pure good guy. Nuff said except one more thing. John...I love ya man...thanks for some awesome memories and some awesome tunes. I look forward to traveling with you into the future. Kick butt my friend. Kirby
B00005O5CM|4.0|In my experience with college teaching, I've realized that blonde Barbie looks and a bubbly persona do not necessarily come with cotton-candy brains. At face value, \\"Legally Blonde\\" is fun and frothy. However,  the movie exhorts us to look behind a person embodying a stereotype to see an individual.<br /><br />Elle Woods, Sorority president, decides to follow ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington, III to Law school. This East Coast blueblood has decided to put his carefree college years  firmly behind him and has set himself on the path to the U.S. Senate. Obviously, a frolicksome blonde does not fit into the picture and is conveniently disposed of before the ascent to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law. His jaw literally drops in surprise to see that the selfsame blonde has gained admission to his exclusive program!<br /><br />Warner is not the only one who does not quite know what to make of the walking, talking Ivy League Barbie; neither do the other students or even the professors. This speaks to the power of stereotypes in our culture. I also noticed a subtle but pervasive attitude towards attractive young females I've personally observed in academia: that of being objects simultaneously of desire and derision.<br /><br />In the end, it is Elle's knowledge of a cosmetic procedure that nails the guilty in a court case. The very attribute that is often seen as a liability by her peers ends up being her trump card. The last laugh, therefore, is on those who purportedly claim to impart impartial judgement but misjudged HER. This sly turnaround collectively pokes fun at the pretentions of extreme feminism and academia in general - mainly at the notions that style and substance are mutually contradictory attributes and that analytical thinking necessarily comes in a grim, no-frills package. Whether or not you decide to delve into the deeper significance of this movie, it does not detract from its entertainment value.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Simply one of the most cinematic and powerful films of all time. I recently bought this to add to my collection and seeing it on DVD for the first time was just incredible. The transfer is amazing and the images of the desert are profound. The politics of the middle east, are sadly, still the same except no white man would have such an impact there today as Lawrence did in his time. But then again - depending on who you read Lawrence might have been good for a tall tale everynow and again. But that fact does not take away from Lean's great masterpiece.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I'm a fan of low-brow humor just as much as anyone, but low-brow still needs to be FUNNY and entertaining. This is just stupid humor, not low-brow. Stupid as in \\"not funny,\\" and you will be amazed by how many jokes fall totally flat in this borefest of a movie. I like Will Farrell, but man, he totally flops when he does his obvious ad-libbing with his dog...or with anyone. I was rolling my eyes through the movie a lot. I easily vote this the worst movie from 2004.
0515125024|3.0|Die Trying is like a fast food meal: it satisfies you while you're digesting it, but it doesn't really stay with you. Ian Fleming wrote the same kind of adult comic book material, but he also always took care to flesh out the characters, especially his hero, James Bond. Lee Child's Jack Reacher, however, does not get the same treatment. We know he's 6 foot 5 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. We know he was a military policeman who survived the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut. We know he's a crack shot who can hit a target from 1000 yards away. But our knowledge of him is still skin deep -- even after 422 pages. And when your hero is so sketchily defined, the supporting characters invariably are even less defined. Outside of Holly Johnson, the only major female character in the book, the rest of the characters all blur together and, unless you have a good memory for names, become sort of a faceless unit. The villans are all garden variety white supremacist right wing types with little to distinguish them than sneers or harsh language. Add to this so-so mix is an ending that ties things up too neatly and quickly and involves a character making a romantic decision that almost none of us would make. Die Trying will never bore you, but it definitely will be a case of \\"out of sight, out of mind\\" when you put it down.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This CD was something I probably would never have heard of or seen if it were not for an afternoon spent wandering aimlessly in  my local library. Whilst sorting throught the CD's my library offers, i noticed a CD with a very interesting cover and design. I thought \\"well, i have nothing to lose.\\" and i checked the CD out.  <br /> <br />Well, let's just say i think i've found my new favorite CD. <br /> <br />This collection of songs is shockingly well put together, with complexity and simplicity combined. I loved the rawness of the singer's voice, and the lyrics were beautiful. the first song is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I feel so thankful for having found this CD! Really, it's something everyone should listen to.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I usually hate movies about hitmen. It's so comical how in hitmen movies that they can go on a rampage, shooting things, exploding things, and still wander away from a scene without much police attention. When's the last time you saw a news story about a hitmen on a rampage? Yeah, never. It's just Hollywood story time. Anyway, that said, I had fun with this movie, to my great surprise. Talent is the key - talented acting, writing, and directing. Some parts of the movie had serious artistic flair. Am I the only one still haunted by the scene were Cruise and Foxx come across the coyotes crossing the street?
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Finaly bridget jones has landed the man of her dreams, but can their relationship survive a sexy, meddling coworker and the return of bridget's old flame? <br />DVD includes an alternate beginning. <br />worth renting, not buying.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|All CGI hype and pizazz, but not much of a story to keep you interested. As the movie goes on, it bogs down horribly, making you look at your watch. But it just goes on and on, all effects and fighting and so on, but no compelling characterization to keep any interest. I have to say, I hated this movie. I wanted to love it. The atmosphere and look of the movie was brilliant, but what needed serious polishing wasn't the look of the movie, but the script itself.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is an awesome CD. The main theme is so lyrical, you hum it all day long. The action music will get your blood pumping, and the icy tone of the raptor tracks will send shivers up your spine.  <br /> <br />It is an excellent score to a truly excellent film. There will never be an equal to John Williams.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Do I really have to say how great this movie is? If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on a classic. If you found this page by accident and have no idea what Re-Animator is, rent it. If you love it, then you're one among millions of fans. If you hate it, then you clearly aren't a horror movie fan and you can go on your merry way. One of the best horror movies of all time. Period. Oh, and it's hilarious. Gore + Humor = Very Fun.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This is my absolute favorite show, I can watch it over and over even thought I know what happens! It's a smart drama with heart without being corny.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I was so amazed when I heard this movie flopped. I expected it to be a huge blockbuster, and there was so much buzz about it on the internet. Then I finally got the dvd and watched it myself, and all that failure is explained - yeah, a boring story. The special effects are interesting, but only for a little while. Boring story, boring characters, boring ending. Just blah. The script needed some serious doctoring.
B000002UB6|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. I have always liked the melancholy vibe of  this CD. Unlike \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"The White Album,\\" or \\"Abby Road,\\" there is a certain bittersweetness, sadness and longing in the songs. It's as though it were destined to be the Beatles final album. But the songs are not overly depressing. \\"Let It Be\\" while morose, at the same time possesses humor (mostly due to Lennon).<br /><br />A lot of fans have a bone to pick with \\"Let It Be,\\" the band's second to last recording, and final album to be released. There is very little criticism that I can give this album, apart from its version of \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\"  Any kind of flaw or \\"sloppiness\\" people complain of, I see as part of the album's charm. As much as I love \\"Abby Road\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" must every Beatles album be as perfectly produced and crafted? \\"Let it Be\\" has a hand-crafted, organic feel. I like the sloppiness of this album. I also think Phil Spector did a good job with the production (except for TLAWR). Spector helped give the album a little polish, but didn't go over-the-top with it. As for \\"Let it Be...Naked,\\" I am also fond of that album, but the original is better. It's too late to paint eyebrows on the Mona Lisa. I hope someday the REAL \\"Get Back\\" sessions will be released--with no added anything. Just these songs, in their proper chronological order.<br /><br />The album starts with the bittersweet \\"Two of Us,\\" which is Lennon and McCartney's finest duet. Lennon and McCarney's overlapping vocals are some of rocks finest hour. The ballsy mid-tempo \\"I dig a Pony\\" is an underrated Lennon classic. \\"Across the Universe\\" is beautiful and enchanting. \\"I Me Mine\\" is an errie but melodic Harrison number. Although some would say \\"Dig it\\" is just filler, it actually is important to the album because it gives the album a little humor and it flows in perfectly with the beautiful \\"Let it Be.\\" One of the things lacking with \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" is the absence of that song. The same is true of the \\"filler\\" song \\"Maggie Mae\\" which is actually important to the overall sound of the album. \\"One After 909\\" is a cool, oldies sounding song, that gives the album a little variety. My one and only complaint with this album is its version of \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\" I actually am quite fond of this song--but the version here is not the best one available. Phil Spector's orchestration ruins it. The stripped-down version on \\"Anthology 3\\" and \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" sound MUCH better. \\"For you Blue\\" is another excellent Harrison song. The offbeat riff is quite cool. \\"Get Back\\" is a cool rocker that is an excellent way to close the album.<br /><br />In conclusion, I don't think the Beatles wrote one bad song together. EVERY song they wrote was terrific, every album was brilliant. \\"Let it Be\\" is no exception.of the \\"filler\\" song \\"Maggie Mae\\" which is actually important to the overall sound of the album. \\"One After 909\\" is a cool, oldies sounding song, that gives the album a little variety.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I would. In my opinion, Christina is the greatest singer to ever walk planet Earth. She really blows me away with the power in her voice. Christina contributed to the creation of all the musical pieces on this album, and that is why it is one my all-time favorite albums ever. I have owned this album since October 2002- I know what I'm talking about. I thought that \\"Dirrty\\" was a brilliant number, but Redman did ruin the recording a bit. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" was ruined a bit by Lil Kim's appearance too, but it's no biggie. \\"Walk Away\\" is one of the best songs I have ever heard in my seventeen years on this planet. Christina sings about an abusive relationship like she actually experienced it. \\"Fighter\\"- OH MY GOD. There are no words to describe how much I love this song. Some people may say that this song is full of rage: and it is. I don't think I've ever heard a song this angry before, with the possible exception of Alanis Morissette on \\"You Oughta Know.\\" The video is probably the best music video that I have ever seen. What a concept. Whoever came up with that concept must be a genius. If you haven't seen the video yet, then go the musicvideos.com right now and watch it. Alicia Keys and Christina are dynamite together in \\"Impossible\\", the ninth recording on the album. The album closes in the best way possible with \\"Keep on Singin' My Song\\" where Christina pushes her four octave voice through the roof and into heaven somewhere. At least that's how I feel when I'm listening to it.

0517221160|4.0|I finally read Little Women when I wa 23. When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try.  Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her.  I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book.  I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie.  I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant.

B000286RKW|5.0|It's a cinch to see why this classic deserves every bit of its stature; five times and I still don't tire of it. Kudos to Scorsese's visceral cinematic style, for this could quite easily have been your garden-variety gangster tale.<br /><br />The rough and tumble world of mafia can be intoxicating, as we follow our protagonist Henry Hill's rise through the ranks in the underworld (Liotta has yet to equal this incredible early performance). His voiceover permeates the entire film, breathlessly, in awe of the things he gets away with.<br /><br />He slowly ingratiates himself in this hood, first as a gofer and then to become a mid-level \\"family member.\\" The appeal of the good life is summed up brilliantly in the simplest terms possible, \\"I was a part of something.\\"<br /><br />It's both shocking and fascinating to watch these guys work. There's even an unexpected tinge of sardonic humor along the way, albeit the gallows kind.<br /><br />But between a constant cavalcade of Italian cheese and wine we soon discover that there's a reverse side to getting the best seats at plush restaurants and walking scotfree because cops are on dough. No one in this crowd seems to have a conscience, and eventually Henry begins to look over his shoulders even with his closest friends.<br /><br />His higher-ups include a hitman who is feared and respected in the organization (Robert DeNiro in an understated by chilling performance), a volatile loose canon who may make you laugh one minute and blow your head off the next (Joe Pesci), and the local kingpin who lets others do his dirty work and to whom respect must always be paid. Danny DeVito rounds out the studded star cast.<br /><br />Goodfellas has attracted flak for taking a sympathetic look at violent criminals, but let's face it, Hollywood is hardly to blame for the allure of the mafia. Plus, if anything, Goodfellas demonstrates better than any other movie on the subject how fleeting that heady charm is.<br /><br />It's the most ruthless depiction of the underworld I've seen apart from Scarface, an absolute catnip for mafia movie aficianados but a pretty good watch for the rest of us too. Get a DVD for your own collections, this'll stand up to repeat viewings.s depiction of the underworld I've seen apart from Scarface, an absolute catnip for mafia movie aficianados but a pretty good watch for the rest of us too.

B000009ED0|1.0|Sorry that you had to leave this planet a little too early Joe C., but that doesn't excuse this album from sucking. If you think this is good, you are saying that bad nu-metal/rapcore is good. Let's all instead listen to Rage against the Machine, shall we?
B00005JLFC|5.0|This is one of those moments we are all waiting for...YENTL on DVD. Fantastic, superb, a masterpiece!. One of the most unforgetable film in the history of the cinema. No one else could have made this film but the truly legend Barbra Streisand. We love YENTL, we love Barbra! No matter what happens, get it as soon as it is released, you won't regret. This is my favorite film of all time.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I've read a lot of people saying that this s GD's best album. Yes, of course it's their best album, and maybe Jimi Hendrix is still alive, he's just living as a monk in the himalayas. Cotton Hell and wheelchair Assassin are right. Go buy anything by GD up to Nimrod and ignore anything after that. As for people sayin this is the 'best CD of 2004', go buy 'The System Has Failed\\" by Megadeth and tell me what's the best album of 2004!

B000002R0P|4.0|The eighth Gentle Giant album, 1976's \\"Interview,\\" finds the art-rock band *just starting* to step away from their earlier progressive sound, and crafting tunes that were a bit looser and more accessible to the ears (the change in musical direction would be complete by the next album, \\"The Missing Piece\\"). But there's still enough of the ol' Gentle Giant sound here to satisfy the diehard GG followers, while the more streamlined, simpler elements the band incorporate on \\"Interview\\" actually sound quite refreshing (honestly, I don't mind it when bands try different approaches to their music, just so long as the end result is still genuinely good music!). The title song is punchy & fun, as GG put rock music interviewers firmly in their place, while \\"Give It Back\\" has a surprising reggae-ish swing to it in parts, but it works well. \\"Design\\" is the song that sounds the most like classic Gentle Giant, featuring the group's trademark, haunting vocal arrangements. \\"Empty City\\" sounds a lot like Jethro Tull (one of the bands GG are always compared to), but that's cool with me, and it's both a very beautiful & powerful number. And the album concludes with \\"I Lost My Head,\\" an instant Gentle Giant classic that is both elegant AND rockin'. It's definitely my favorite song on the album. There are those GG purists out there who say that \\"Interview\\" is the band's last good album, as many of them did NOT warm up to the group's later work, starting with \\"The Missing Piece.\\" I don't think the band nosedived after \\"Interview\\"---for starters, I happen to love \\"The Missing Piece\\" (but that's another review). \\"Interview\\" is an excellent Gentle Giant album, but it certainly isn't their \\"last\\" excellent album. There was still some great music yet to come from this Gentle ol' Giant.
B0000931OG|5.0|This is a phenomenon in the Blur catalog. Very different than their previous albums and minus lead guitarist Graham Coxon Think Tank is ethereal and beautiful.<br /><br />Very reminiscent in spirit to the experimental phase of David Bowie (Low/\\"Heroes\\") Think Tank has a very loose and adventurous style to it. I'm not saying that he is imitating those albums just that there is a real sense of exploration in it. Not only does the album feel more adventuresome but the music feels more honest and bare than from previous efforts.<br /><br />Personal favorites include the epic Ambulance, Good Song and Battery In The Leg.  The latter includes Coxon before he left the band.  The only song I can do without is generic punkish \\"We've Got A File On You\\" which fortunately runs in at barely over a minute.<br /><br />Albarn said in an interview that he felt like this was Blur's first true album. I can see why. His adoration of Ray Davies (Kinks) was always very clear in his song writing. Although it never felt like a total parody it always seemed like he took too much from that kitchen. Blur was definitely showing signs of breaking away with the menacing 13; Think Tank comes off like its stranger cousin. Although it doesn't have as sharp of a hit single like Tender (Crazy Beat was the single, which is catchy) Think Tank has kept my attention more than their previous beloved records because it seems like there is more substance in it because of its personal nature.<br /><br />(The five stars are primarily based on the music that was released when Think Tank came out.  On the grand scale of things I would give it 4 star rating.)
0226264017|4.0|Friedman has written a classic book on capitalism that has sold over half a million copy. The most interesting element of his book is that Friedman has accused the Federal Reserve Bank to be responsible for the depression of the 1930s due to their lack of interference by not helping the failed banks and by contracting the money supply. The Federal Reserve Bank is in charge of creating money whenever it is needed, in order to prevent such occurences as major recessions and depression.(The Federal Reserve Bank is embodied in five to six privately owned banks in Europe and America that took over the central financing of the United States in 1913 during the Woodrow wilson presidency when the Federal Reserve act was passed, which marked the beginning of the privatization of American financial and political institutions into the hands of the global corporate world).<br />Friedman has borrowed most of his concepts on capitalism and freedom from the father of free market economy the brilliant Austrian economist Friedrich Von Hayek, and made them his own.<br />This book will provide the reader with an interesting perspective on free market economy and the elusive concept of freedom.
B000093BDX|5.0|\\"The Beach Boys\\" are either number one or two in biggest American bands in history (along with \\"Chicago\\"). The California boys knew how to write addictive ditties about cars, girls, surfing, the beach, and summer fun. However, they dove into more complexity and deeper as they progressed in their music career. \\"Sounds of Summer\\" grabs 30 tracks, over 20 of them top 40 hits in the day, and puts them together.  <br /> <br />The simple numbers about topics talked about above are on this disc. That means \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", \\"I Get Around\\", \\"Surfin' Safari\\", \\"Fun Fun Fun\\" and \\"Little Deuce Coup\\" are included, as is the cheesy \\"Be True to Your School.\\" These songs show the boys at their most breezy and easy going. However, where the Beach Boys truly shine is in their more complex and deeper numbers. I'm talking about compositions like \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"Sloop John B.\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\". The lush arrangements, the diversity in sound, and the deep issues at hand about questioning love, life, and going on in a challenging world is similiar in vein to what the Beatles did around the same time. The album includes the surprise number one hit from the 1980's in \\"Kokomo\\". Sure, by then Dennis Wilson passed away and Brian had numerous issues to deal with, but you can't help but smile at John Stamos becoming a Beach Boy for this song and playing the drums! The song also shows how even though the Beach Boys experimented for a while, they couldn't stay away too much from what they loved: songs about girls, beachs, surfing, and summer fun. <br /> <br />Only two things deter this collection. One is that it is not chronologically ordered. This might not be a big deal for some, but the Beach Boys showed a progression in their sound until the mid 70's, when it started decreasing to their brief comeback in 1988. Also, some songs should have been included with the others. These include \\"Wendy\\", \\"409\\", \\"Caroline No\\" and \\"Warmth of the Sun\\". However, with 30 songs, it's a heavty collection in itself. <br /> <br />The Beach Boys have lots of influenced over many contemporary bands of today. Cake, Weezer, Blink 182, and Rooney all took a page out of the Beach Boys playbook. If you want to get a collection of not only great music but some of the most recognizable in history, \\"Sounds of Summer\\" might be a good place to start.
B000002H97|5.0|\\"Metallica\\" (1991), also known as \\"The Black Album,\\" was the sound of the beginning of a new era of music.  The album sold more copies than any other Metallica album, and is considered to be one of the greatest albums ever made by many.  For some reason, early Metallica fans seem to enjoy bashing this album.  The reason is understandable in some terms.  People were upset because Metallica no longer had the 7-8 minute songs that included the fast riffs and classic solos that were the trademark of Metallica up to this point.  In my opinion, however, Metallica may have changed their music to fit in, but still left a mark on music.  The songs on this album continue to be played to this day on radio stations around the world, almost 15 years after its release. <br /> <br />The album starts off with one of Metallica's most famous songs, \\"Enter Sandman.\\"  The mellow start to the song quickly works its way up to kick-ass mode, where James starts off the album by screaming \\"Say your prayers, little one...\\"  The song features one of the most famous choruses ever sung by Metallica: \\"Exit: light, Enter: night, Take my hand, We're off to Never-ever-land.\\" \\"We're off to Never-ever-land\\" were used later on to end Metallica's \\"King Nothing\\" off the \\"Load\\" album, which came a few years later.  The song features an eerie prayer, followed by the sinister sound of James Hetfield saying \\"Hush little baby, Don't say a word...\\"  Undoubtedly, one of the greatest Metallica songs of all-time. <br /> <br />The second track on the album, \\"Sad but True,\\" is a true kick-ass song.  The in-your-face screaming will really get your blood pumping.  Although it may not be as fast as earlier Metallica songs, it still remains a song that would definitely get your mom screaming at you, unless your mom is a Metallica fan like mine. <br /> <br />After the hardcore \\"Sad but True\\" comes the third song on the album, \\"Holier Than Thou.\\"  One of the least popular songs on the album, \\"Holier Than Thou\\" is stilla song that could get your blood pumping. <br /> <br />The fourth song on the album is another one of Metallica's biggest hits, \\"The Unforgiven.\\" This ballad once again proved that Metallica could be deeper and more emotional than previously thought, and drew a lot of fans because of it.  It gave Metallica a new sound never heard before, and despite the greatness of this song, marked the beginning of a rise in popularity that would lead to the worst Metallica albums ever in later years. <br /> <br />The fifth song on the album, \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" reminds us that Metallica is still a heavy metal band.  This song became another big hit for Metallica, and Metallica continued to enjoy a rise in popularity that they had not experienced in their illustrious career. <br /> <br />The sixth song on the album is a song that was not released by Metallica, but is one of my favorite songs.  \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" has a great sound to it, and is another kick-ass song on this album.  <br /> <br />The seventh song on the album is \\"Through the Never.\\"  Although I do like this song, it's not my favorite song on the album.  This song keeps our blood pumping and puts us in much need of a break after being blasted for the last three songs. <br /> <br />We get that much-needed break on the eighth song of the album.  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" was a ballad that remains one of the softest Metallica songs of all-time, and once again showed people the deeper and softer side of Metallica.  While being a mostly acoustic song, it still was another big hit for the band and demonstrated more than any song on the album that Metallica had went through a change. <br /> <br />After that approximately six-minute break where our heart has slowed, we get right back into kick-ass mode with \\"Of Wolf and Man.\\"  James Hetfield has always been obsessed with wolves, and it shows in the ninth song on the album.  \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" talks about the classic story of a man turning into a werewolf when a full moon is out.  This is another great, hard-rocking song by Metallica. <br /> <br />We then slow it down once again with the tenth song on the album, \\"The God That Failed.\\"  The song starts off with an intro that makes you want to turn your bass all the way up.  Don't let the title fool you:  this is not talking about God failing.  James Hetfield's parents believed that medicine and doctors were useless and that only God could heal a person.  James's mom died at a young age because she would not go to a doctor or take medicine.  The \\"god\\" in the song is the beliefs that James's parents had, and they failed. <br /> <br />The eleventh song on the album is also a good song to crank the bass up on.  \\"My Friend of Misery\\" is another hard-rocking song that talks about a person who is always trying to please everyone and take everything upon himself, therefore making him miserable. <br /> <br />The twelth and final song on the album is \\"The Struggle Within\\" which starts off slow and then works its way up to the fast singing of James Hetfield.  Lars Ulrich's incredible drum-playing is a great end to an album widely regarded as Metallica's best ever.  The album was certainly the best-selling album for Metallica, and will remain a classic for years to come.
B000002J09|5.0|\\"ZOSO\\" along with Led Zeppelin I are two of the strongest albums of all time. Led Zeppelin wrote rock music, mixing heavy metal, hard rock, blues, folk, and rock n' roll all together. \\"ZOSO\\" is where it all came together and blew the roof off the house. <br /> <br />The big numbers on this album are BIG: \\"Black Dog\\" is hard rock at it's most passionate, while \\"Rock and Roll\\" takes a 50's style rock and roll song and kicks it up a few notchs. \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" throws the listener into a mystical world of wizards and warriors and shows Zeppelins ability to use world music in their repetiore. \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is Zeppelin taking a blues number and making it their own with some of the hardest riffs and melodies they ever have made. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is Zeppelins rock opus, complete with lush arrangements and hard rhythms. <br /> <br />I can't tell you enough how great of an album this is. If you love rock, there is no reason to not pick up this album. Get it TODAY!!!!!
B000002H2H|4.0|\\"Ride the Lightning\\" (1984) was Metallica's second album.  The follow-up to Metallica's debut album \\"Kill 'Em All\\" (1983) might be one of Metallica's best albums.  The album features Metallica's trademark of fast riffs and incredible solos, done by a mix of Dave Mustaine and Kirk Hammett, possibly two of the greatest guitarists ever to play a guitar.  Also, who could forget one of the most famous voices in rock, James Hetfield.   <br /> <br />The album starts off with a misleading intro.  The intro sounds more like soft, acoustic rock than the heavy metal we are used to hearing from Metallica.  But don't let this misleading intro to \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" fool you.  The soft sounds of the acoustic guitar quickly turn into the trademark riffs that send chills down your spine.  The softness of the intro quickly turns into the fastest song on the album. <br /> <br />Next, we have the title track \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" which features Dave Mustaine playing lead guitar.  For those who don't follow Metallica, Dave Mustaine was the lead guitarist of Metallica for \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and parts of \\"Ride the Lightning\\" before being kicked out of the band for his reckless actions and alcoholic nature.  He went on to start Megadeth, a successful band, but to this day Mustaine wishes he could have been a part of the Metallica legacy.  \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is a song about a person being executed in an electric chair while begging to be given the right to live.  It is one of the better songs on the album. <br /> <br />The third song on the album is possibly one of Metallica's greatest songs ever, \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\"  This song is so far the slowest song on the album, if you can believe that.  The song is actually a nice break from the incredible intensity of the first two songs.  In my opinion, the second-best song on the album. <br /> <br />That leads us to my favorite song on the album, \\"Fade to Black.\\"  This song was Metallica's slowest and softest song at the time, but still managed to keep a nice rhythm and end with the best solo on the album.  The song was controversial at the time as it was said to \\"glorify\\" suicide.  Although the song is about suicide, it is only about the thoughts that would be going through the head of a person who was considering it.  It does not talk about a person actually acting on their thoughts.  This incredible ballad showed a softer, deeper side of Metallica that had never been seen before, and is a favorite of many Metallica fans. <br /> <br />We now get to the less popular songs on the album, starting with \\"Trapped Under Ice.\\"  This song keeps with the theme of death that we have consistently seen on the album up to this point, looking at the aspect of dying by means of drowning.  Not a bad song, but a song overshadowed by the first four songs of the album. <br /> <br />We then get to the song that is widely regarded as one of the worst Metallica songs ever, \\"Escape.\\"  Once again, this is not an incredibly bad song, but we could definitely do without.  Even James Hetfield has publicly said he hates this song, but the record company felt it should be included on the album. <br /> <br />Next, we come to a fan concert favorite, \\"Creeping Death.\\"  It's fast riffs and incredible solos make this a great performance and a pleasure to watch.  This once again gets your blood pumping after being cooled down by the last two songs on the album. <br /> <br />Finally, we end with one of the greatest instrumental songs ever, \\"The Call of Ktulu.\\"  It's eerie sound tells a story without words about a figure in the world of voodoo, and could give those not familiar with the music an eerie feeling.  This song is certainly much better than Metallica's first instrumental \\"(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth,\\" which is found on \\"Kill 'Em All\\" album, and \\"Orion,\\" found on Metallica's next album, \\"Master of Puppets.\\" <br /> <br />I gave this album four stars.  This album has six incredible songs, but the other two songs are so horriblethey bring the album's rating down from a five to a four.  Nonetheless, this will always be a classic, not only for fans of Metallica, but for fans of metal.
0375704027|5.0|This is the first and only Murakami novel that I've ever read.  While the story does indeed revolve around Watanabe's choice between a dying and living love, I find the greatness of Murakami to be in the way he gets a small cast of otherwise isolated people to link up with each other in unorthodox but effective ways, like atoms sharing electrons to form complex molecules.  The book left me with the sense that honesty is the force that allows the world to unfold as it should.
B00007JMCX|2.0|If you're a huge David Bowie fan then you might like this flick- just to see him (and I mean all of him) in 1976, with great hair, and those magnetic eyes. Other than that, this sci-fi self proclaimed \\"cult classic\\" will bore you to tears like Carson Daly's absent personality. (I swear hes an MTV created robot.) This movie was so choppy and dragged out, with a bummer of an ending, that I briefly hated David Bowie. Briefly.

B00004W52U|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums, period.  Energy simply never gets old, each song has its own energy to it, and you will find yourself singing along to Jesse's unforgettable lyrics and unique raspy voice that makes the band Op Ivy. Every song has so much depth and ingenuity to it that its amazing that many songs are basically just four chords strewn together. But the band works, and sounds great. After listening to this record every other ska album just doesn't sound as good...yes even Rancid ain't got sheet on Op Ivy. ---->[...]
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It is not so surprising to see that among the many accolades for this masterpiece there are many people who just don't get it.  That is okay, different strokes for different folks--people didn't understand Led Zepp and Santana when they first emerged with their boundary-breaking sounds either.  The same applies to Frank Zapp and even the work of Miles Davis. <br /> <br />I don't mean to sound too pompous, but these are the heights that Mars Volta aspires to, and given the vapid state of rock today, Frances the Mute is indeed a breath of fresh air, despite how challenging, frustrating, and disturbing it is. <br /> <br />First of all, one has to understand that Omar and Cedric are tapping into their musical heritage in a manner that most other contemporary musicians just can't comprehend.  These guys have paid dues as members of the seminal punk-emo band At-The-Drive-In and the maturity that they have shown since then is both astounding and inspiring.  This is the sound that the kids today would be creating and consuming if the corporate dictators of MTV and the music industry would let them be. <br /> <br />Cedric and Omar are two Chicanos from El Paso who understand that one should never lose touch with their roots.  \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" is a beautiful piece that transcends quotation and hommage (to Santana, Malo, Fania All-Stars, etc.) and cuts a path of its own in the midst of Latin music's current penetration of the mainstream.  \\"Miranda That Ghost Isn't Holy Anymore\\" has one of the most haunting and touching choruses I've ever heard (\\"and when miranda sang, everyone turned away, used to the noose they obey\\"), matching the eeriness of its ominous opening that sounds like ghosts literally howling at the living.  I'll admit that \\"The Widow\\" is probably the weakest track (hence, the first single--whose choice was this, the band's or the record company's?), but is probably the best power ballad of the new millenium.  \\"Cassandra..\\" is a journey that probably would have been more rewarding had they been able to include the last song that couldn't fit on the CD, the title track \\"Frances the Mute,\\" another trip that features a vocal by Cedric that proves his pipes have inherited the mantle of brilliance one held by Bono.  <br /> <br />I think people can't grasp how much this album reflects how wrong the world is right now--the hooded figures in the album's artwork speak volumes in relation to the sorry state of affairs right now. Sure, the overall mood here is melancholy and despair, but people have to wake up to the fact that we now live in a world of war without reason, genocide, torture, and <br />universal irrationality.  I applaud the Mars Volta for having the balls to maintain their punk sensibilities by messing with the mix and purposely f$%king with the listener's expectations (i.e. the noises, the lapses of cacophony, the low-fi passages).  They show a profound respect for their fans by not patronizing them. <br /> <br />Thank you Omar, Cedric and the excellent musicians who have provided the quintessential catharsis for our times.  The late 60s and early 70s prove that a screwed up society inspires musicians to tap into new channels of inspiration.  The Mars Volta speak from the horror of our times.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Preceding the epic (and fantastically entertaining) \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\"  this album often gets forgotten, but in many ways it's Bowie's best album.  It's quietly experimental and eclectic, with much more sense of humor and warmth than Bowie's more overtly experimental outings with Brian Eno.  More than anything, though, it shows Bowie in fine craftsman form, writing great melodies and hooks and trying his hand at everything from showtunes and cabaret, to acoustic folk rock, to trashy glam.  \\"Changes\\" and \\"Life On Mars?\\" are probably the most famous songs from this collection, but the similar \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" is even better, and the album as a whole is full of lesser-known gems like \\"Song For Bob Dylan\\" (which ends up sounding more like the work of The Band than Bob Dylan) and the glorious Velvet Underground tribute \\"Queen Bitch\\" which finds Bowie out-Reeding even Lou Reed with a perfectly snarky, trashy, frantic delivery and wonderfully decadent lyrics (\\"Now there's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all/And I'm phoning a cab cus my stomach feels small\\").  This is classic Bowie from start to finish and deserves more attention, even though it lacks the androgynous bombast of \\"Ziggy.\\"
B00008O31H|4.0|Don't laugh.Listen to the guitar sound.That's Tony Iommy on \\"Volume 4\\" baby ! Go for it.
B000002KB8|4.0|Black Sabbath is a band that tends to go in and out of fashion as the years pass.  Even the most pretentious indie rocker was bowing before them in the mid-90s, but now they seem to have lost favor with the music snobs these days.  That's a shame, because they were a great, captivating rock band that should never be forgotten and not just because of their influence on the burgeoning metal movement.  Any way you look at Black Sabbath they were a great band and this album is their best. Bluesier and less lumbering than the more famous \\"Paranoid,\\" it also captures the band at their best from a technical standpoint.  With clever rhythms and unforgettable riffs, this album is at once earth shaking and surprisingly fun.  The suite that includes \\"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\\" and \\"N.I.B.\\" is definately the best thing here, but it even the weakest moments (and there are a few; the closing suite goes on for just a bit too long and \\"Wicked World\\" is good but a little slight)are elevated by occult, almost gothic atmoshere, which is delivered here intelligently and in a (comparatively) subtle fashion.  Even if the lyrics are occasionally kind of clumsy, Osbourne's distinctive (if not always pleasing) wail and the general feelings of dread of the unknown make it all believable enough to suck you into Black Sabbath's dark little universe where satanic creatures lurk in the woods and the blues are reinvented in a druggy, heavily distorted haze.
B000067G3C|5.0|It's interesting re-watching this film after 11 years that it still manages to hold up despite a few predictable spots, it still manages to be quite energetic and fun. It's always interesting that Keanu \\"one expression\\" Reeves can act even if other movies suggest something else. <br /> <br />In one of the commentaries, one mentions that there's 2 types of films: premise and character. Meaning that it's either about an event or something happening or it's just a character study. This has a big premise. A bomber wants 3.7 million and he decides to set bombs up on an elevator and if he doesn't get money, there goes the emergency brakes and whoosh, right to the bottom floor. So Keanu basically foils his plan and gets awarded. <br /> <br />Only bomber isn't done and decides to put a bomb on a bus that if it goes under a certain speed it'll blow up. And for a good part of the film it's trying to get this bus to stay above 50 miles an hour with all sorts of obstacles in a way.  <br /> <br />It's funny watching the moments that keeps up the tension because they're so \\"yeah right!\\" that they seem totally implausible but yet they could happen, just probably not all in a row. Keanu boards the bus only to deal with an ex-criminal who causes an accident which causes a scene of unloading someone only then to have to deal with a jump over a 50 feet gap then to deal with a leaking gas pump. All of this one after another but you'd probably wouldn't pay attention to those things cause the movie's so fun. <br /> <br />Like a blockbuster should be it introduced some new pop culture phrases: \\"pop quiz hotshot\\" \\"what do you do, what do you do?\\", showed Keanu was more than Bill and Ted, Jan de Bont was a capable director since this was his first time(however don't forget he did make Speed 2) and it also stars sweetly cute Sandra Bullock. <br /> <br />Pop quiz: you feel like renting an action thriller but you have to deal with a lot of crap and bad films but you see Speed on the shelf andsome chick flick for your date. Thrill the both of you or have you bored as hell? What do you do, what do you do?
B00005V9IL|4.0|\\"The Abyss\\" may not be as popular as \\"Aliens\\", \\"Terminator\\" 1 & 2 or \\"Titanic\\", but it's one of the best films made by James Cameron. The movie is a sci-fi story with groundbreaking special effects, but Cameron carefully constructed characters with a wide range of emotions, and that's the biggest reason why this movie is effective: we care about the characters, even the smallest role in \\"The Abyss\\" is another solid piece in the cast. <br /> <br />Granted, the pace can be slow in some scenes, but eventually the reward is big when the puzzle is solved, because the movie makes you feel inside this particular submarine world. The design of the creatures is very attractive, they really look like creatures built with living water, and this movie dates back from 1989, when the special effects weren't as sophisticated as they are today, so \\"The Abyss\\" is a groundbreaking movie in many technical aspects. <br /> <br />The performances are very solid, of course, the standout is Ed Harris a very underrated actor, but he is always reliable, no matter what role he is playing. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also gives a nice performance in \\"The Abyss\\", at the beginning of the movie she appears to be just an angry woman, but eventually the viewer discovers her multiple sides and emotions. Michael Biehn is solid as the paranoid Navy SEAL Officer, and every member of the cast fits nicely in their roles. <br /> <br />\\"The Abyss\\" is not as frantic as \\"Terminator 2\\" or \\"Aliens\\", but every person that embraces the directing style of Cameron should feel pleased with this movie. A very solid movie with great technical accomplishments and with an interesting plot.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I loved the graphic novel and the trailer reminds me of some the cool comic book style 2D meets 3D special fx and graphics that I love about my favorite tv series, \\"Kung Faux\\". I can't wait to see \\"Sin City\\" in the theater then own it on dvd, so that I can put it in my collection right next to my Kung Faux dvd and be comforted in knowing that I will always have moments of video heaven within my arms reach. Please keep making more films,dvds,and tv shows like this! Props to Frank Miller,Robert Rodriguez,Quentin Tarantino,& Mic Neumann.
B00004T0UT|5.0|This album in my opinion is the greatest Elvis ever made. I have all of these 1969 Memphis sessions on the 1999 2 CD set Suspicious Minds which I also highly recommend. Elvis's 1969 Memphis recordings are the most beautiful and most powerful of them all. I don't have this CD because I have all of these on the Suspicious Minds sedt. This CD is recommended for the casual Elvis fan but if you are like me and want the complete 1969 Memphis sessions I highly recommend the Suspicious Minds CD or the From Nashville To Memphis 60's Masters set. My favorite song of all time from this album is the beautiful Johnny Tillitson composition It Keeps Right On A Hurtin, a beautiful country ballad. Elvis does a lot of fine country versions of songs such as Hank Snow's I'm Moving On, Eddy Arnold's After Loving  You, Bobby Bare's Long Black Limazine, John Hartfords Gentle On My Mind and many more! They are all masterpieces! Buy it!

B00009L1OB|2.0|I'm a great Duran Duran fan, and every one of their albums offers something to the listener. But \\"Seven\\" is simply their worst album, marred by poor songwriting, lumbering beats, and heavy-handed production that drove the music into the ground. <br /> <br />The only reason this album sold was the world was in the midst of Duran mania. It's clear the album was recorded when the band was worn out by the previous tour, and rushing to get back on the road for the next. <br /> <br />The best tracks on the album are the opening track, the undeniably exciting \\"The Reflex,\\" and the second track, the smiling pop of \\"New Moon on Monday.\\"  <br /> <br />As for the rest of the album, I'd skip it. Instead, pick up Rio, Duran Duran (first album), and 2004's excellent \\"Astronaut.\\" <br />
B00008EY63|2.0|I know that a lot of you out there firmly believe that I like to think of myself as a high brow film snob who considers all forms of mainstream action to be beneath him, and actually youd be<br /><br />right.<br /><br />Myself a British pansy, I am a film snob who wouldnt know a good<br /><br />film if it bit him on the butt.<br /><br />but the fact is that I've always had a bit of a soft spot of the old fashioned comic book super hero movie. The film Hellboy was one that instantly grabbed my attention because it had one of the best concepts since a young college geek was first bitten by a radioactive spider. Those all geeks like myself would see<br /><br />anything.<br /><br />It tells the story of a young scientist named Trevor Bruttenholm (pronounced Broom) who leads a group of American GIs to Great Britain in order to stop Rasputin The Mad Monk and a clockwork Nazi zombie, Karl Ruprect Kroenen, from opening up a portal to hell. They succeed in killing Rasputin, again, but not before the portal is opened long enough to let some great evil through. That evil turns out to be a small red demon child with a large, nigh on indestructible, red arm that Bruttenholm adopts as his own. This child is then raised by a secret branch of the government that hides the existence of the supernatural from the public (Think MIB for demons) and who raise him to become the crime fighting super hero Hellboy.<br /><br />Thats about it the acting was average , but then seeing<br /><br />as I am  a geek ill say it was great!!! (laugh at me).<br /><br />The effects were spectacular but it didnt do all of it for the<br /><br />gay critic, but I give it thumbs up
B000067IZ3|1.0|If this bomb doesn't put you  <br />to sleep, you're already dead! <br />With out a doubt, one of the <br />most boring movies ever made!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Oh good lord, this is awful. Is this supposed to be metal? Sadly, I think it is. This album is lame, that's the only way I can put it. And no, I'm not talking about the more mellow stuff on here...I actually kind of liked \\"Circle\\"...no, I'm talking about when they try to be heavy. <br /> <br />Slipknot describes their sound as \\"both brutal and beautiful\\" and a have to laugh out loud. First of all, there is nothing beautiful about this hour-long crap festival. Hell, a saw cutting through a tree trunk sounds more musical than these guitarists! And then...brutal? THIS is supposed to be brutal? These guys wouldn't know brutal if they heard it...you see, brutality is sadly lacking from the nu-metal (mallcore) genre. If you want brutality, listen to black or death metal, a la Behemoth, Burzum, or Immortal (to name a few). Slipknot is about as brutal as an angry six-year-old. <br /> <br />The guitars sound dull and labored, the solos are sloppy, the vocals are banal at best, and the otherwise decent drumming (I respect Joey for his work with Satyricon) is ruined by the \\"custom percussion.\\" There are a couple of songs with catchy melodies, but one gets tired of simple tunes rather quickly and besides, pop music has catchy melodies too but that doesn't make it any good. <br /> <br />All in all, this album is pathetic. I gave it two stars for the ballads and Joey's drumming, but there's nothing on here that's worth paying for. Or downloading, for that matter. Do yourself a favor and ignore this sorry disc. It's not metal, it's not brutal, and it's not beautiful; it's pretentious and lame. The bands that Slipknot is obviously mimicking are infinitely better, so check them out instead. It would recommend starting with Shadows Fall, they're nothing special and extremely overrated but they're better than Slipknot and probably won't frighten you nu-metal kiddies too badly.
B000002JOH|5.0|the first time i heard walk my jaw hit the floor. i thought these guys are amazing. this album is a classic and should be in every metal fans collection. the album is strong the whole way through and if you are thinking of getting this go buy it now you will not regret it. mouth of war is my favorite track.
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now is a great book to help free you from your mind. Our mind is a great tool that can help us achieve whatever we want. But the problem is most people let their mind use them. This book teaches you how to \\"quite your mind\\" by being in the present moment of now and being grateful for the \\"present\\" now is. When the mind is clear, you can begin to tap into the power your mind has and have it work for you. <br /> <br />We are 3 part beings body-mind-spirit and the mind is only one part of it. A great book to get your body to work for you and free you from the limitations and constraints shackled to by your body is The Creator's Manual for Your Body. This book reveals to you all the false beliefs you have happily accepted that make health a struggle and effort. So that not only will your mind be free, but your body as well. <br /> <br />A great book to help you free your spirit are any of the books by St. Germain Press. \\"The I AM Discourses\\" - any of the volumes are the names of their books. <br /> <br />3 great books for your total Body-Mind-Spirit
B000286SCO|5.0|i saw the live in japan show on vhs years ago and i thought it was great. with this two disc set you get to watch the band grow from images and words all the way up through the falling into infinity tour. there are many gems in this set and it is strongly reccomended to any fan of dream theater
B0007O38F8|1.0|It's funny how a person who is only within his second album is already enemies with R.Kelly, Fat Joe, Nas, Ja Rule, and Jadakiss. Now If you thought Eminem made enemies quickly, think again, because 50 Cent is about to take over in that stage. When he claims that the reason why he has \\"beef\\" with these rappers is simply because of their colaboration with Ja Rule, it's rather imature of a person who is suppose to be a role model to the fans that listen to him. What kind of message is, \\"It's okay to hate a person simply because they have some association with someone you are truly enemies with?\\" I have never been a fan of 50 Cent, and \\"In Da Club\\" was the most overexagerated track to have ever been released. I could barely make out what he was saying, and to be honest, could have cared less for what he was saying either. The title of this album is just as arrogant as he is becoming...The Massacre...he's going to destroy all \\"competition.\\" Well 50, sit down because you're not the greatest figure in the rap industry, you're still new to this, and have a lot of growing up and realization to do. The funniest part about this album is how he is trying to maintain this street cred. and be all hardcore, and his first single is \\"Candy Shop,\\" probably the most sell out song to ever come out. It's typical. How many times have we heard the Arabian inspired beat? Truth Hurts has done it, even Jadakiss with \\"U Make Me Wanna.\\" So now who's biting off of who? And, When your own \\"crew mate\\" can't even stay with you for longer then 3 months after their album release, there must be something really wrong with you personally. \\"Disco Inferno\\" yeah, that's street now isn't it? He tries to hold this image, but his music does not obtain to it. He does not deserve all this recognition, and I can not wait for the day when people realize he is not all he is made out to be.
B000001ESF|5.0|i heard this album on tape about ten years ago when my dad said if you want to play drums you should listen to this. enter: neil peart into my life. i thik that this album is perfect and that any musician should own it. it is classic. the things that this band does with three guys is amazing, all in all this album is great and the story is awesome.
B00006AFUR|5.0|My friend was playing them on his computer and it completely rocked. So I went straight to Hastings and bought it. They are EASILY one of the best bands that you've never heard of. I think it's awesome that a good actor like Jared can also make some really impressive music. Most \\"actors turned musicians\\" suck hardcore, but Jared surrounded himself with some seriously talented guys and created one badass CD. 30sec is now one of my favorite bands, up there with Nine Inch Nails and Incubus(pre-crow).
B0000009SI|4.0|FZ is brilliant. enough said. the musicianship on this cd is great and all of the tracks are enjoyable. if you are thinking about zappa this is probably a good place to start. zappa is a brilliant songwriter.
B000063147|5.0|I agree with DeadlyFred. This band is metal, but peole nowadays are too busy creating factions within their own genre. Well, on to business. This CD is heavy and fast. It does contain one melodic slow song, Warmness on the Soul, which is an awesome track. All the songs on here are different from one another and sound like pure genious. The CD never gets boring and has tons of replay value for the listener. They were awesome on the Warp tour and surprised alot of the pansies that were in the crowd. This will be one of the greatest bands of our generation.
B000002GQE|5.0|if you are looking for an essential album by the moody blues or a album that might get you into these guys, here it is. i can literally put this cd on repeat and listen to it all day. this album is a masterpiece and it has most definatly stood the test of time. get this cd now.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Alot of people are dissing this CD saying it sounds more mainstream... I don't know which copy you guys ended up with buy mine sounds just like the same old A7X to me. On to the Review. This entire CD is awesome. The epic \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\" is a brilliant song and I consider it my fav. I know it's divided in 2 parts...but it's one song. I also noticed on this CD that Shadow's voice tends to sound alot like a  younger Hetfield at times. Which is awesome. I considered this band to be the next Metallica...until I heard Trivium's Ascendancy, which is another band all of you should check out if you love metal. Pick this CD up too on the way to getting Trivium ^^!
0316172324|5.0|A quick read, concise and clear, \\"Blink\\" gives us much-needed insight into the preconditioning and hidden clues our minds use to make decisions. Malcolm Gladwell obviously has the gift of rapport, which enables him to distill the essense from the life work of many psychologists and share these nuggets of knowledge with us. For instance, when Gladwell watches John Gottman observe married couples in his laboratory, videotaped interviews can reveal small signs of negative interactions between the spouses, such as fleeting indications of contempt. These signs can predict with great accuracy whether or not a marriage will survive, even though the couple is unaware of the problems they may be facing. Learning to read the hidden emotions that Paul Eckman has learned to identify by observing fleeting facial expressions provides the key to the real thoughts of someone with whom you're interacting. This is particularly important in law enforcement, and Gladwell emphasizes that this skill must be trained into police officers under stressful conditions to prevent such tragedies as the police shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo in the Bronx or the beating of Rodney King. \\"Blink\\" summarizes many areas of important research that bring us all a little closer to our basic interconnectedness.
6304696566|2.0|After reading more reviews about The Searchers I had to watch this movie again to see what I was missing ... and it continues to disappoint. If you are a true fan of the pre-1960's western film style, especially with John Wayne and his typical band of old horse opera cronies [Ward Bond, Patrick Wayne, Ken Curtis & Harry Carey Jr.] then you may really like it. Unfortunately I still found the opening vistas of Monument Valley to be the most exciting part of this movie. The combination of too many sappy/cheesy moments, such as the wedding fight scene between Jeffrey Hunter and Ken Curtis, and actual native Americans only being used in minor, uncredited supporting roles, hurt this movie badly. They took The Searchers way off point, cost the movie its credibility, and seriously reminded me of F-Troop. I really wanted to like The Searchers, and I have tried watching it several times, but each time it peters out about 1/4 of the way into the story and I just can't finish viewing it in one continuous sitting. The cinematography is excellent, the opening scenes are great, but after that you can place The Cowboys or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance in the DVD player and watch better examples of John Wayne's work with fresher, stronger actors like Bruce Dern, Jimmy Stewart, and Lee Marvin. For my money's worth, Shane is still the best western ever made.
B0000DCYVT|1.0|The original American Pie was cute.  A high school version of Animal House.  The sequel was dissappointing and this third installment borders on unbearable.<br /><br />The same cheap humor is rehashed over and over again with little sign of originality. How often can you have Finch pursuing Stiffler's mother? Stiffler is oh so annoying as if all he ever thinks about is crude sex.  The scenes with the dogs humping Jim and Stiffler are repulsive.  You would think this group would have grown up but obviously they have not.<br /><br />I know that I may sound prudish but I appreciate sexual innuendo when it is done with some tact and clever lines.  American Wedding does not come within seven miles of cleverness.  Pass on this and pick something else.  ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!
B0007MVXQG|5.0|It is great to see Priest back in action; however, this is not exactly where PainKiller left off.  The band has evolved since painkiller and so has Rob.  The whole album sounds like a cross between the music from the ripper owens years and vocal styles from the Halford solo albums.  There are instances where, dare I say, it sounds like classic priest.. (I had to throw in a cliche there).  What I like about this album is that KK and Tipton have changed with the times and are making an honest attempt to come up with fresh material that doesn't sound dated (instead of rehashing old stuff like Dance of Death... sorry).  Obviously, you can only solo so much before it all sounds the same.  There  are some Cliche lead fills and solo parts but that is to be expected.  NO BODY CAN WRITE AN ORIGINAL SOLO OR MUSIC IN GOD DAMN 2005.  EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN!!!  There are no fast songs and this album relies more on being heavy than being fast.  THe sound is a crystal sharp distortion and the drums are really sharp and punchy.  Great sound!!  My only complaint is the vocal lines or melody lines or the lack of it.  The vocals are great; flawless performance by GOD Halford.  There are no hook melodies.  THe melodies sound old, flat or linear.  Because there are not too many hook melodies, the songs suffer.  Personally, the music is okay, the vocals lines could be better arranged  in a lot of areas.  What this album lacks is not good riffs but lack of strong song writing.  Maybe this is a way for them to reach out to the kids today.  Overall it is great to listen to.  The cover is definitely goofy as with the album title.  THis album could no way be compared to any of their previous work, with certain exceptions as noted above.  THis is a stand alone album and it is the new priest sound.
B000268QB2|5.0|I'm already a fan of Coldplay and Travis and now I've found Keane and just like the first two, I can't stop listening to them.  Some people say that Keane is a wannabe Travis and Coldplay band, but the point stands that I can't stop listening to them and that is all that matters to me.  Plus, Coldplay has admitted to somewhat mimicking bands such as Radiohead.  It's a common thing with first albums.  First albums aren't always an accurate prediction of what the band will become.  That is unless the first album rocks.  And just like Coldplay and Travis again, this first album rocks.
B000002BQK|5.0|Carey is one of the most tallented vocalists in the business and on this 1997 release \\"Butterfly\\" she shows the world that her first post-divorce album is not one to miss. Honey and Butterfly are great tracks that rightfully were mega super hits, since they highlight her amazing vocals and have a great vibe to them. The booklet is very nice and the front photo of Mariah is very classy. That greenish color goes very well with hair and the little butterfly thing around her stomach is nice. I do have one complaint and that is the size of the font in the booklet. Should one have to have a magnifier to read the lyrics and other information. This is very irritating and does make you wonder who thought about this. Apart from this it is an awesome album that will sound good no matter which decade one listens to it and that is no small feat in itself.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Concept album? Supergroup? Experimental project? It's nearly impossible to put a label on this CD, but it sure is fun to try. <br />      <br />Gorillaz is a joint project of Damon Albarn, lead singer of (Oasis whipping-boys) Blur, and artist Jamie Hewlett, who also created Tank Girl. These two oddballs came up with the idea of a virtual band, more specifically four animated simians who actually \\"perform\\" the music. Joining Hewlett and Albarn (who are Gorillaz Murdoc and 2-D, respectively) are other musical notables such as Japanese sensation Miho Hatori, rapper Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, and ex-Talking Heads Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth. Certainly an eclectic crew there. But what about the music? <br /> <br />Well, its kind of an alterna-hip-hop-techno-slowgroove thing. The breakout single was \\"Clint Eastwood\\", the type of song that clocks in at about 6 minutes, but never gets old. I think I could listen to its booming bass and Albarn's languid vocals all day. There are several other tracks that I really like, a few that are okay, and one or two stinkers. Hey, can't win 'em all.
B000002ULO|5.0|McCartney is a truly amazing vocalist, musician, lyricist and artist.  The book-let is very nice with and the the little comments and tidbits are nice to read.  He shows his genius by playing most of his instruments like Prince and he shows that he is truly a masterfull muisican. Track number two is truly stupendous and it just gets better and better. He needs some advice on the choice of clothes though. He looks like he shopped in a low end store and I know that he is loaded beyond dreams so he should also dress well. This is a very nice post beatles album.
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|More of the same. The car chases - this time in Goa & Moscow feel like the rehashes that they are. This sequel comes across as very unoriginal and what's with that long coat? Doesn't a guy trained to kill & evade capture not know to change his identity once in while to throw people off his trail?  This one was a huge disappointment but still gets 3 stars for all the fireworks. Worth watching once mainly to see how they followed up on the masterful \\"Bourne Identity.\\"
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I must say that I serious reservations to this movie when a friend of ours picked it at the rental place. However, I had no idea that it was a Tom Burton movie then. The acting is very nice and Ewan McGregor is great in his role as is Albert Finney and Danny Danny DeVito. The story is typical Burton with touches of magic and a great storyline. I love the costumes and music is great if sparse. I must say that I was very pleasently surprised by this movie and that I would highly recommend. This is truly a work of art in the finest sense.
B00023B1LC|4.0|Gorgeous scenaries, a car chase scene the likes of which we have not been treated to in movies, international intrigue and a bold attempt at confronting a taboo subject - that of political assassination(s) engineered by the CIA - all these make for a movie that's worth watching again & again, so long as you don't begin to question what happens when the French find all those dead bodies. Matt Damon's acting is excellent. This is a different kind of Hollywood movie that has a certain dose of believability to it perhaps from all those foreign influences. Highly recommended.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I am impressed by very few scripts written in the modern era, but am I surprised by Alan Ball's script for American Beauty.  It's intelligent, wisecracking, filled with rich originality and real people with quirks and shortcomings - without making us feel distaste for them.  In fact, it scuppers the idea of what we defines as really \\"beautiful\\" in suburban, modern consumerism-driven America. Sam Mendes does well with the direction to be almost oblivious, and the emsemble acting is outstanding (particularly Kevin Spacey), but ultimately, its Ball's screenplay which carries the day.  The only thing I can fault here is that Ball's quasi-existentialist statements may feel a little glib at times - but, still, this movie's certainly rich entertainment for all that.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|One of the worst movies i have ever seen!  I saw this movie in theaters, and almost walked out.  If I hadnt had payed for the ticket, I would have.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen and the script doesnt help at all.  Most of the \\"scary\\" parts will just make you laugh, because you do not develop even the slightest connection to any of the characters whatsoever.  The methods of killing are mediocre at best, and, like most horror movies, the intelligence level of the lead characters is very low.  The one redeeming factor of this movie is the ending, which is the only part I enjoyed.  I expeced better.  Thumbs down.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|I am another who considers this film to be perhaps the finest cinematic feature ever produced.  I have a few other contenders in my mind, but \\"Barry Lyndon\\" continues to grow more and more in my affection and incredulity. I have watched it, I don't know how many times.  The DVD brings out it's sharpness, and I love going straight to my favorite scenes when I need an aesthetic pick-me-up. This is Kubrick at his prime, filmed after the scorching he received from the controversy over \\"Clockwork,\\" and after the disappointment he suffered from realizing that his dream of \\"Napoleon\\" would not come to fruition [and oh, what a great loss to all of us it was that he never had the chance to make that movie! One can only imagine how Kubrick would have filled out the character of the Great Provocateur and how that movie would have informed history!]. In \\"Barry Lyndon,\\" the chastened Kubrick comes roaring back from those two disappointments in all his strength and artistic genius--Kubrick the perfectionist doing the butterfly and backstroke in luscious irony.  Yes it's long, yes it's slow--of course it is, it's as slow as the universe, and equally amazing.  Every moment is fraught with the crispness of life moving forward and the irony of human ambition.  I admit, when I first saw it in 1976 in 70mm at the theater, I was dismayed with it's seeming tediousness, but I was 18 then and I am nearing 50 now, and I think I've learned that the eye and the senses have to look and look and look again--and that's what the eye does with this movie, it looks with Kubrick, and listens with Kubrick, and delights with the master in the presence of his masterpiece.  You stare at this movie, and you wait, and in that time spent waiting you find such incredible pleasure in every detail, watching every stroke of genius, every arranged perfection. This movie is simply abundant deliciousness with the accompaniment of Handel and Schubert and Bach and Irish traditional.  O'Neil is as banal and absurd as his character and his adventures are exquisitely outrageous on the most sublime level.  The cinematography and period reconstruction is pure eye candy.  And the musical score is pure eloquence, enrapturing as it is instructive.  Buy the soundtrack (see my other reviews, and get the CD now while you can), press the headphones against your ear, and relive over and over again that eternity in a moment when Redmond first walks out, oh so slowly and deliberately with the languorous texture of violin and piano and cello, to come close to, and then to accost, and to kiss Lady Lyndon.  The whole movie is the finest minuet moving forward and you only need grasp it's hand and pull it to you and move with it in it's rythm.  It is some of the most richly rewarding cinema you will ever experience if you allow it to be what it is--Kubrick the master, at the pinnacle of his craft.
6304696566|5.0|It is hard to explain to the uninitiated why Ford's \\"The Searchers\\" is such a great film. One of its attractions is how Wayne's character is represented as an enigmatic, imperfect hero defined by rage and racism. Ultimately, in the final scenes of the movie, the viewer is forced to confront the possibility that he is no different than the  \\"cruel\\" Comanche he has been hunting throughout the movie. This is Wayne's best work, and one of the best Westerns ever made, alongside Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven.\\" Both films transcend the genre by challenging its simplistic, moral myths about good vs. evil.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|all you \\"hard-core\\" daft punk fans who keep saying that Human after all is not very good are completely crazy! this album is a great example of daft punk's genius. the fact that it's totally different than discovery or homework just shows their diversity and their ability to evolve over time. if they were to put out stuff that all sounded the same it would get boring! their new sound is fresh, yet reminiscent of old-school beats. There are many strong tracks, and the album comes together well as a whole. I know i'm definitely not disappointed in daft punk's newest creation.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Anybody familiar with both Burton and Dick will understand why I referenced them with respect to this movie.  Burton (Beetlejuice and Ed Wood) has a gift for surreal-yet-mundane situations and characters that are somehow endearing but his weakness is his plots...they stink, but we forgive him.  Dick was the master of the reality-within-reality-within-reality story that could by turns uplift, terrify, and haunt, as seen in such film adaptations as Bladerunner, Total Recall, and Minority Report.  Characters and relationships are strong in Dick's work, but his plots too tend to be weak, but his work will always endure despite this.  Kaufman's magic gift is how he works to create a terrific balance between plot and character.  It's so much fun to catch myself rooting for the characters in this story..story..STORY!!  <br />Kaufman and Gondry make it look easy, but if it weren't for Burton and Dick, they wouldn't have anybody to spank.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Few albums can both grab you on the first listen and reward subsequent listens. All too often, a CD will sound good on the first few spins but then wind up gathering dust. (Snow Patrol's \\"Final Straw\\" feels this way, at least for me.) Other times, an album's excellence will only become apparent after a couple listens. (Pavement's \\"Slanted and Enchanted\\" comes to mind.)<br /><br />Arcade Fire's \\"Funeral\\", though, pulls off that all-too-rare trick that is the hallmark of many of the best albums--it sounds great at first, and even greater later on. By the end of the first track, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels), any listener with a pulse will be swept up in its crescendo of energetic vocals and pounding pianos. Neigborhood #2 follows in a similar vein and ends with wonderful imagery, to boot. \\"When daddy comes home, you always start a fight/So the neighbors can dance in the police disco lights,\\" Win Butler sings, and even though you may have never seen it, you can sure imagine it.<br /><br />After its charging opening tracks, the album mellows out a bit, but that's not a bad thing--the band's lyrics come to the fore, highlighted by delicate string arrangements that enhance without overpowering. Then it's on to some uptempo closers, more great songs that will get your foot tapping and your head bobbing on the first listen.<br /><br />Regine Chassagne lends some great French-chanteusse vibes to the album and many of its tracks, but it's Win Butler's vocals that really demand your attention; he has an energy that nicely complements the uptempo arrangements but doesn't overpower slower songs. Plus, his voice is one of those rare \\"good frontman\\" voices--distinctive enough to sound unique, but not so distinctive that it gets annoying. (Think Neil Young instead of Geddy Lee and you'll get my drift.)<br /><br />All in all, it's a great album, the kind of thing you can listen to in the morning to cheer yourself up and get yourself moving even on the dreariest of days. Grand without being grandiose, dramatic without being melodramatic, \\"Funeral\\" is full of energy, and life.ithout being grandiose, dramatic without being melodramatic, \\"Funeral\\" is full of energy, and life.

B00007G207|5.0|Do not believe that this is an some kind extended edition.  That's the way it was released in Europe.   When it came out in the US, it was considered too long for American audiences (it is nearly 3 hours), so they shortened the last hour to 10 minutes. The US version is incomplete: we never find out why Elena disappeared, which is essential to the denouement. <br /> <br />I find it impossible not to cry, every time I see this movie.  It is one of the most beautiful love stories you'll ever find.  Watch in in Italian with English subtitles.  (The dubbed version is not so great) and be careful to get this \\"new\\" version!  <br />
1400032717|1.0|Very trying book, from unengaging protaganist, to repulsive, irresponsible parents, and above all, sophomoric plot.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, who wants to have a mother who deserts her son for her married lover, and a father who skewers a poodle for whatever reason? So, the happy ending is they get their son a dog? I love dogs, and this did not strike me as a good idea.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Mildred pierce is the ultimate single mother movie. it's the type of story that attracts people of almost all ages because it's real and could have happened anytime, anywhere. Mildred is an unsatisfied wife and a devoted mother. Too bad that she lavishes too much of her love on the wrong daughter, the one who'd rather not have to work for a living. Ann Blyth is an excellent Veda. She makes evil seem glamorous. Joan Crawford's Oscar was well deserved. Eve Arden is her usual excellent sarcastic self, Jack Carson is the sleazy salesman. Zachary Scott gave another good performance. Bruce Bennett? No wonder she left him if he was her husband. I really didn't like the ending, but otherwise I could never get tired of Mildred Pierce. There's something to discover about it every time I watch it.
044024157X|5.0|This was the first book by Grisham that I read and it was a great book book for me to get a taste of how good a writer Grisham is.  The story was not full of suspense, but part three was the point where I found the book hard to put down, even if I was becoming too tired to read more for the night.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the story.  Grisham does a great job of building up the plot and in a few cases, just when you think you know what's about to happen, you realize you have been fooled again.  It's not until the very end of the book do you realize what really happened and what the title means.
6305047529|5.0|Danny kaye was a gifted physical comedian and Walter Mitty is one of his best roles.  He dreams because his life is not too exciting. I think lots of people can relate to this. Walter is brave when in his real life he is not. Then he meets Virginia Mayo (a beautiful blonde) who just happens to be his dream girl come alive. The story is universal and makes the viewer laugh 90% of the time. For all ages. Terrific!

0140157352|5.0|This book was recommended reading as part of a class in negotiation at NYU.  I was a bit skeptical at first, as the cover made it look like the kind of popculture books they sell in grocery store check-out lines. I was quickly proven wrong.  I just hope I will be able to apply the lessons learned therein. Up to now I have engaged mostly in what the authors call \\"positional bargaining.\\" I now know the difference between this and \\"prinicipled negotiation,\\" which will hopefully help me get over my Scorpio tendency of stinging anyone who disagrees with me!
B000050X31|4.0|I watched that production for the first time as a Metropolitan Opera Telecast in 1991. I once rented the video a few years after and I have watched that production again twice in the last three years on DVD. Every time I was delighted by this performance. While the scenery is simple, the singers act and sing very well. The glockenspiel is shown playing by itself in one part; furthermore Tamino often holds the flute away from his face when the music indicates he should be playing it. There is a good contrast between the scenes taking place in the light and the scenes taking place in the dark. It is a very lively and musically uplifting performance.
B0007P3582|2.0|This was a pretty bad sophomore effort - you could tell he ran out of s*** to talk about so he resorted to the usual drugs, sex, and guns. Some of the same themes as in GRODT, but sung in a different way.    Many Men - I'm Gonna Die Tonight    In Da Club - Disco Inferno    Magic Stick/P.I.M.P - Candy Shop    The list could really drag on    Those records are all interchangable except they were a lot better the first time around on GRODT. There were a few okay songs -    In my hood    I'm supposed to die tonight    Outta control    Gunz Come Out.    Also piggy bank should barely pass as anykind of diss song - I can't even remember what he said to Jada or Crack.    I can't believe Candy stick or whatever, and disco inferno were his first singles- those tracks are pure garbage made to make pure hits that I wasn't stupid enough to fall for.

B00007KWHO|5.0|There is so much music from YES and \\"Time and a Word\\" is not the album that most are going to purchase first but I simply love the release. Sure, I have all of the others too... but there is something about \\"Time and a Word\\" that always makes me happy when I listen to it. The music is truly progressive and at times flat out flower-power bubbly but the music here is just so well played an arranged. Never will Yes sound more together than on these songs. This release came far before the huge 70's period and the rebirth of 90125 in the 80's. The songs flow so wonderfully here. The album is lost among the Fragile's, Close to the Edge's, but it is such a great attempt at the realization of a concept album. Astral Traveller, Sweet Dreams... Just try this.  The BBC recordings CD is another must have for YES fans.

B00005JNPZ|4.0|Hitch, Alex Hitchins, is known as the \\"date doctor,\\" a consultant that helps men create opportunities to captivate the women they fancy. He doesn't work with pigs or womanizers or downright scummy guys-just the all around nice, sincere ones. That's where Kevin James comes in. James' character, Albert Brennamin has a huge crush on one of his clients who just happens to be a movie star. With Hitch's help Albert's prospects begin to look up, and Hitch finds himself falling for a high-powered New York gossip columnist.  This all boils down to one huge disaster stew and it's absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br />Will Smith is always a joy to watch, but it's really Kevin James that makes this movie. His schlub act is spot-on and highly endearing. The physical comedy in this film, from James and Smith, is another highlight. I found myself cackling uncontrollably, and I don't do that in public if I can help it. <br /> <br />Amidst all the good points, there was a downside. The plot was thinner than one-ply toilet paper at times. As per most \\"date\\" movies there's a formula: <br /> <br />1. Rocky relationship start <br />2. Growing attachment to said enemy <br />3. Romance develops <br />4. Huge, but not quite un-overcomeable, obstacle <br />5. Fight fight fight <br />6. Make up <br /> <br />Hitch is no different. You can see the twists comin' from a mile away, but it doesn't detract from the fun too much. I still cackled...all the way to the end. If you see this movie for no other reason, go just to see Kevin James dance. It was a sight I'm unlikely to forget. <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I first heard Duality on the radio I decided to buy The Sublimal Verses and see if I could get into any of the songs. 1 week later I had the entire CD memorized! I seriously have hear the CD at least 100 times and it gets better with every viewing!  <br /> <br /> <br />The CD starts off with Prelude 3.0, a strange mix full of mysterious noises and wierd little phrases. At first I skipped it after about 2 and a half minites into it. I eventually grew to like it. This song also has a sedimental value as when I went to \\"The Sublimal Verses Tour\\" this is the song that played when Slipknot came out on the stage.  <br /> <br /> <br />Next is \\"The Blister Exists\\". When I first heard the title I thought it was some kind of Medical drama but I have grown to love the heavy screaming and the drumming on this one. Good to listin to when your working out.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Three Nil. Never could really get into this song but don't skip it.  <br /> <br /> <br />DUALITY: The song that inspired me to buy the CD. Good mix of screaming, drumming, and guitars. Don't miss this one! <br /> <br /> <br />Opimum of the People: Good.For some reason Slipknot loves big words that nobody understands. After listining to this CD my vocabulary increased by 26 words. <br /> <br /> <br />Circle: Acostics at it's best. this song actually is kind of religious.  <br /> <br /> <br />Welcome: Heavy and good. Many big words (How typical) <br /> <br /> <br />Vermilion: At first I hated this song for it's slow begining but as it really gets going it's one of the best on the whole CD really.  <br /> <br /> <br />Pulse of The Maggots: WE WON'T DIE!!!! Screaming, banging, and drumming at it's best! <br /> <br /> <br />Before I Forget: Slipknot's big one right now. One minite it's really heavy and then it's almost acoustic. The chorus is the best part. <br /> <br />Vermilion PT.2 Not as good as part one but good. <br /> <br /> <br />The Nameless: Odd mix of screaming and acostics. Good though <br /> <br /> <br />The Virus of life: Wierd techno metal at it's absolute worst! This is the track I usually skip and you should too! <br /> <br /> <br />Danger-Keep Away: Just like the Prelude, wierd but good. <br /> <br /> <br />I had the honor of seeing them live at the Cleveland proformence of \\"The Sublimal Verses Tour\\" and I you love this CD and they haven't come to your town yet buy the (rather expensive) tickets for a night you'll never forget! <br /> <br /> <br />\\"All I got is insane\\" <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001VWP8I|5.0|I got this CD as a gift from a friend who had seen her in Germany.  I'd never even heard of her.  I was AMAZED!  The voice on this woman is INCREDIBLE.  A lot like Taylor Dayne but with her own distinct sound. Her vocals have an emotion to them we aren't hearing with other singers these days.  Her sound seems to wrap around the lyrics beautifully.  She's got a special gift.   <br /> <br />I'm scratching my head because after doing a little research on her I was stunned to find out this isn't her first CD.  This is actually her third and she is considered a HUGE DIVA in Europe.  I've dloaded her other songs from her other CD's and I'm stumped by the lack of interest in her here in the USA. Radio needs to get it together.  This woman can SANG!  Everything we hear on the radio these days is either R&B, Rap, Hip Hop, or skateboard POP.  You'd think her label would PUSH for her success in the USA knowing that we are in desperate need of something new after the poor ratings for the grammys.  It's obvious that it's time to make some changes.. Here's the change and the name for the change is .. ANASTACIA!!.  Perhaps this CD will be the one that finally gets her to the top of the charts here in the USA.   <br /> <br />If I could give this CD 100 stars I would.  Seasons Change, Left Outside Alone, and Time have HIT written all over them.  The whole CD just flows together perfectly.  You just want to play it over and over.  The voice is Funky and powerful.  This is no little girls voice.  This is a woman who knows what she's singing about and knows how to deliver it.   It's the best CD I've heard in a long time.   <br /> <br />So...If you are dying to hear some incredible vocals and are just a little tired of the standard they are pushing at us as of lately I'd suggest you pass on 50 Cent and get Anastacias CD.  You won't be sorry.  She is amazing. <br /> <br />Come on USA radio get it together and let all of America hear this womans voice! It's well past due.

0064440346|5.0|Arnold Lobel strikes storytelling gold every time he picks up a pen, and Owl at Home may be his best book ever.  <br /> <br />The book is divided into five separate stories, each of which feature the somewhat silly, but very lovable Owl, who lives alone in his country house. The pictures are soft and full of atmosphere, often creating a sense of foreboding to be dispelled. The stories themselves are real crackers, generally eschewing a hard moral in favor of playful silliness.  <br /> <br />For example, in one story Owl is saddened at the thought of Winter, rattling around outside in the cold, and so he opens his door to invite Winter in. But Winter proves to be a less-than-stellar houseguest, whirling about the cozy home and freezing Owl's pea-soup supper. In the end, Owl insists that Winter depart, and sits down to wait for his soup to melt by the fire.  <br /> <br />Parents and children will delight in sharing this magical storybook together. The magical whimsy and gentle fun just cannot be beaten. I highly recommend it.  <br />

0380715430|4.0|Tackling the entire English language in a 250 page book is a pretty ambitious task, but then of course, Bryson was just warming up before taking on the history of everything.  And since Bryson is not a professional linguist, you have to wonder if he's really up to it.  And as previous reviewers have pointed up, the book has inaccuracies.    I didn't care.  It's certainly entertaining to read and informative.  Bryson's got most of it right, and he presents an interesting story of how the English language got to where is it today.  Some of it is fascinating.    Bryson comes across as a dinner guest who knows a somewhat less than he thinks he knows, but is clever and witty enough that no one really cares.  It's fun, interesting and informative enough to hear him talk, so I can forgive him if he gets it wrong sometimes.  I'm not a linguist, and you probably aren't one either.
B0000C8AW2|4.0|\\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\", \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", \\"Nashville Skyline\\", \\"Self-Portrait\\", \\"Street Legal\\"... what do these Dylan albums have in common? They've all been brickbatted by some fans and critics as \\"trash\\", \\"unsophisticated\\", \\"sellout\\", or simply met with a \\"What was he thinking?!?!?\\" Truth is, \\"Street Legal\\" carries on the oft-praised and oft-maligned Dylan tradition of reinvention as well as any of the other albums listed above. Dylan does reinvent himself. He's done it for 40 years, and he's still doing it. \\"Street Legal\\" represents just one more of these events in Dylan's repertoire.<br /><br />In 1978 Dylan brought out the big, really big band (\\"Bob and his Large Band\\" would have been a good sub-title presaging Lyle Lovett by a decade or two). Gospel-esque backup singers, saxophones, a BIG production, and long songs with sometimes cryptic almost mythical sounding lyrics about embittered love or abuses of power. Once again, \\"Street Legal\\" sounds unlike anything Dylan recorded before or since. Why did he go in this direction? The theories abound: Dylan wanted to emulate Neil Diamond's stage act; Dylan wanted a cozy career in Las Vegas next to the Rat Pack; Dylan found inspiration from Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band. The real reasons were likely more prosaic. Dylan's \\"Chronicles, Volume 1\\" hints that the 1970s and 1980s were extremely rough times for him musically. The scene just didn't seem to inspire him anymore. So perhaps he was just trying out new things, as he's done his entire career. Whatever the reason, the results made for a very unique Dylan album.<br /><br />\\"Street Legal\\" contains undeniable energy. Not to mention some great songs. \\"Changing of the Guards\\" and \\"Se&ntilde;or(Tales of Yankee Power)\\" belong in the Dylan Hall of Great Songs. Still, the arrangement can at times sound sloppy (the drums sometimes plod along and the backing vocalists go out of synch, etc), and some have complained that Dylan wasn't into this album, or too coked up to notice its flaws. But Dylan, like Neil Young, has always been at his best and most passionate with a warts and all approach to recording and performance. Who could imagine a completely \\"slick\\" Dylan album where every note gets placed perfectly? Part of his legacy is the unprocessed sincerity that comes through in his voice and instrumentation. His earlier \\"great\\" albums (from the 1960s) contained spontaneous moments of laughter, hissing sibilance, microphone pops, missed timing, the occassional fretted note, etc. No one complains about the \\"flaws\\" on those albums. But for some reason critics find similar imperfections on \\"Street Legal\\" unforgivable. Dylan never really wavered from his one or two take philosophy for a reason. And it's part of what makes Dylan's music what it is. And once again, \\"Street Legal\\" showcases this unforgettable side of Dylan. The flaws are more than forgivable considering the energy this album puts out.<br /><br />In some ways the remaster may have redeemed this album. Many early reviews complained about the muddy and incomprehensible sound of the original 1978 release. Muddled sound can destroy any great music. In any case, someone performed some great clean up, because this CD release sounds crisp with well-separated instrumentation. In fact, it sounds incredible.<br /><br />So just ignore the bizarre photo of Dylan on the back cover (the one where he actually looks ready for Vegas stardom). And don't let the road-weary alley-inhabiting unkept Dylan on the cover make you think this album is full of raw acousticly-jaded music. This one's different.

1400043662|5.0|Franz Kafka wrote of freeing the \\"tremendous world\\" inside his head and the fear that it would tear him to pieces if he tried to bury it within himself. For young Kafka Tamura, the protagonist in Haruki Murakami's magnificent new novel, KAFKA ON THE SHORE, the tremendous inner world is not literary but must be freed and explored all the same. In fact, for Kafka Tamura, coming to terms with this world is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br />Fifteen-year-old Kafka runs away from home, not sure of his destination, only certain that he must get away from his father. In the back of his mind is the idea that he may find his long lost mother and sister, even if it means fulfilling the strange prophecy his father cursed him with --- that Kafka would kill his father and then sleep with his mother and sister. Kafka leaves Tokyo with the voice of the \\"boy called Crow\\" in his head telling him that he must now be the strongest 15-year-old in the world. When he finally arrives in Takamatsu, he not only finds a strange and peaceful library to spend his time in but also awakens outdoors one night covered in blood with no memory of what has transpired. He soon learns that his father, back in Tokyo, has been brutally murdered, and soon he takes refuge in the library and with the kind librarians. <br /> <br />As Kafka begins his journey, so does Nakata, an elderly man who, after a violent incident when he was a schoolboy, has lost many memories and the ability to read and write --- but he does have the ability to talk to cats. Nakata flees Tokyo after he kills a bizarre madman named Johnnie Walker, who has been murdering cats in order to create an otherworldly flute. Nakata eventually is joined in his travels by Hoshino, a young truck driver who at once guides Nakata and is guided by him. <br /> <br />If this all sounds strange and complicated, it is. But Murakami's story is also profound and beautiful --- full of philosophy, metaphors, symbols and amazing characters. In a whollyunique style, perhaps best described as Japanese magical realism, Murakami's tale is both hopeful and heartbreaking --- a story of grief, loss and memory. <br /> <br />Soon the police are looking for Kafka to answer questions about his father's death, and Oshima, the wise and mysterious librarian, lets Kafka stay and work in the library. There, Kafka falls in love with the sad and grief-stricken Miss Saeki, a woman old enough to be his mother. He learns of her heartbreak and the song she wrote called \\"Kafka on the Shore,\\" which translates to Kafka Tamura. What is the connection between Miss Saeki and Kafka? If she is his mother, and lover, has his father's dark prophecy come true? <br /> <br />Eventually Kafka must leave the library, and he stays for a while in a cabin in a deep and haunted forest where he finally must confront his loss and the hatred he felt for his father. At the same time, Nakata must close a mystical entrance he has opened to restore the world to the way it is supposed to be. <br /> <br />Throughout their journeys (if indeed the journeys are separate and not in fact the same journey), both Nakata and Kafka are helped by various characters, and each must confront painful and confusing realities in order to complete the nameless mission they seem compelled to undertake. <br /> <br />Without the dark paranoia of Franz Kafka's work, Murakami's novel does share some characteristics with it, such as a horrible father/son relationship, a feeling of a secret and closed other world, and a life full of riddles. KAFKA ON THE SHORE also refers to Hegel and other philosophers, the life and work of Beethoven, the story of Oedipus, and Japanese spirituality. <br /> <br />KAFKA ON THE SHORE is brilliant storytelling, such an original and well-written novel. It is fun and interesting to read, but thoughtful and challenging as well. <br /> <br />Franz Kafka wrote that a book \\"must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us,\\" and Kafka Tamura must destroy the frozensea of memory and loss in order to, quite literally, live the rest of his life. Murakami's novel is successful in so many ways (despite some slowness toward the middle section of the book) and surely must be the type of story Kafka had in mind when he imagined books as axes, destroying the cold parts of our hearts and souls to allow in warmth. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I don't understand why people pan this movie so much. It is, what i consider to be, a great version of a classic work of fiction. Note; not a re-telling. If you are looking for a straight forward \\"Book on Film\\" you won't like this movie. Like a good story? Interesting characters? Cool Sci-fi and effects? This is a winner.

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne, ultra-tough ex-secret agent of 'Bourne Supremacy.'  The story is, you know, not so great as some say, but not so bad either.  In a nutshell, Jason, still haunted by the fragmentary memories of his past, is framed again by someone whose identity is so obvious to us. <br /> <br />[ONE GREAT ADDITION] But despite the film's many plot holes and contrived (and often silly) situations, Matt Damon is in great shape as Jason, the hero or deadly killing machine.  But most remarkable acting comes not from him, but from Joan Allen as Pamela Landy as leader of one botched CIA operation, who doggedly searchs for the truths behind the failure, Jason Bourne and his backgrounds.  Franka Potente, Julia Stiles, and Brian Cox return as the same characters as before, but their characters are not as memorable as Joan Allen's, who is most convincing in otherwise completely fictional world. <br /> <br />[CAMERA WILL SHAKE, RATTLE, ROLL]  But what a hectic actions!  Sadly director Paul Greengrass nearly ruined the otherwise hair-raising actions with his shaky handy camera shots, which made me dizzy while looking at the screen.  Don't get me wrong.  His method might have worked in another field, like a suspence drama with a more social theme.   <br /> <br />In fact, the final car chase is one of the best in recent years, accompanied by a rousing score.  My vote goes to that of 'Ronin' but 'Bourne Supremacy' comes very close to that sphere.  But Paul Greengrass's ducumentary touch camerawork which follows the objects in a too hectic fashion should be called an utterly misguided idea.  Who needs a documentary touch when you see a film based on Robert Ludlum (no offence).  It's 100 % escapism in a good sense.   <br /> <br />Nest time please use a steady camera angle, show the stunts's jobs clearly (and the stunts themselves must be simply great, I imagine), and give us more thrills.  That's what we want in actions, not a documentary touch.  And more Julia Stiles, too.
B00005QDW5|1.0|a best of pink floyd is absolutely the stupidest thing imagineable for the band. anyone who buys this is a pink floyd scrub. their style changes so much from album to album, you can't just mix the songs up. plus the 17 minute version of echoes (normally 23 minutes) made me angry that they would take an amazing song and slice a chunk out. i would definitely recommend this album to someone who doesn't actually appreciate floyd.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson is a man that everyone loves to hate. No one ever sits down and listens to his music. They look at his image and scream \\"poser!\\" And when this album is mentioned to those people they say \\"hes claiming to be the antichrist!! what an idiot!\\" Those types of people usually listen to bands like good charolatte, watch too much MTV, and worship Napoleon Dynomite.  <br />      <br />     First off, this has got to be one of the most creative and dark cds I've ever heard. The great thing about this cd is that it is not only music, it also creates an atmosphere around you as you listen. In irrisponsible hate anthem, it opens up and you think it is live, but manson is really usuing sounds. manson pulls tricks like this throughout the entire album.  <br />      <br />     The entire goal of this cd is not to be goth and claim to be the antichrist. Manson puts all his anger into his role in this album. he plays the role as the antichrist here, but he did it to tell a story..not to sell (it just happened to). he playes the role and tells the story in order to expess his anger and express his point of view, which is what every artist should do with their music.  <br />      <br />     Because manson goes the extra step of crafting a musical work of art, this album soars way above his other albums and pretty much anyone elses music. And yes you have artists like led zepplin who make poetic deep songs...but does led zepplin make an entire album poetic or just individual songs? thats correct. they only do indivdual songs as poetic and atristic. i am not putting led zepplin down at all, however im saying that manson has a different type of poetry than most people have come to expect. <br />      <br />     The people i mentioned earlier put manson down because they do not understand him. If they listened to and understood this album, than they would truly appreciate the greatness of antichrist superstar. this music isnt satanic. marilyn manson is an atheist, not asatanist. this music is misunderstood even by some of his own fans. Not only is this music poetic, but this music is highly addictive. Every song is different and great in its own way.

B0000E6I1J|5.0|A truly riveting performance of a great mix of Harrison's  great songs with huge stars that collaborate wonderfully without ego. Eric Clapton sings a number of Harrison tunes along with \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\" where he played the lead guitar on the original White Album 'All those years ago\\". But the whole album is star studded with Traveling Wilbury's Jeff Lynn and Tom Petty who also perform with the Heart Breakers, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Joe Brown who used to open for the Beatles, the fifth Beatle on \\"Let it Be\\" Billy Preston and many more stars that electrify the concert. In particular, songs from the great \\"All Things must Pass album\\" really shine with the support of all those fantastic guitar players, Jools Holland and the Band and glorious back up singers and that allows you to really appreciate the unique sound of those songs such as \\"Isn't it a Pity\\", \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"All Things Must Pass\\", and \\"Wah Wah\\". The emotion is heart felt in the great play but also more poignant when Ringo states that he and George wrote the song \\"Photograph \\" together that made him a big hit and as he said, the meaning is now changed. When he sings \\"Every time I see your face it reminds me of the place we used to go, but all I have is a photograph..\\"  it is beautiful but almost gives you a chill particularly on the DVD. Joe Brown, who used to open for the Beatles years ago is masterful on \\"Here Comes the Son\\" and \\"That's the Way it Goes\\". An amazing collection that includes Jeff Lynn and Tom Petty collaborating on a song that brought the Wilbury's together under Harrison, 'Handle with Care\\". Of course Eric Clapton on \\"If I needed someone\\" makes it  sound beautiful along with his collaborations with Paul McCartney on \\"Something\\" and \\"While my guitar\\". All through the concert, George's young son plays guitar and sings backing vocals. Shankar's India sound is very pleasant but is packaged on a separate disc so if you are not into that, Disc 2 has all of the pure Harrison songs. Joe Brown closes with a wonderful sweet song on a ukulele called \\" I'll see you in my dreams\\". Appropriate for the sentiment and the fact that Harrison loved the ukulele and on trips he always packed two as his son said, \\"just in case someone else wanted to play too\\".songs.

This is NOT like you bought the same album twice. <br /> <br />  Two more comments: <br /> <br />- Yes, you can hear the public in the background (and foreground, mind you), but that is part of the magic of live concerts.  The Beatles had same screaming when live, and nobody complained about it. C'mon, people! <br /> <br />- \\"Missing\\" is actually the LAST track.

B000089CJI|5.0|Recently, my older sister has adopted an I-pod Mini and in turn has given me her CD/MP3 player. To put it simply, all my time spent on that player has been on Give Up.<BR>   Before you raise an eyebrow, I have to say that in NO ONE'S mind ( not even someone who is foreign to electronica or indie ) there is doubt that Tambarello and Gibbard's collaboration has failed whatsoever in Give Up. Each song contains bits of pieces of some everyday noise ( clinking of a cereal bowl in Sleeping In, subway screeches in Natural Anthem ) and layers upon layers of beats, tunes, and uplifting voices. If you listen very closely, you can set apart the hundred layers in one song ( even counted once...past 5 layers at the least ) and even pick up the soft vocals of the women who sang for Give Up, as well ( found in The District Sleeps Alone Tonight's mid-instrumental is a repeating of &quot;hello&quot;, or is it &quot;alone?&quot;, that disturbs one for a moment ).<BR>   In conclusion, amazing vocals and addictive beats and lines keeps Give Up in heavy rotation in my second-hand CD player. Only absolute nit-picks will be _slightly_ disappointed ( &quot;iffy&quot; lyrics? I disagree! ). Get it or...um...don't.. and miss out. ^_^

B00005A46T|4.0|i remember when i first bought iowa and was fascinated by the sounds flooding my ears. i had heard the song left behind on the tv and loved it. then i didnt listen to it for a while as i discovered harder music. i just picked up slipknots iowa this morning and plugged it in and it still stands up pretty good. <br />i still say slipknot's genre of music is debatable. at some points they do show signs of death metal, but they dont really fit the profile of a death metal band, so i guess thats what gets them. they wear masks, appeal to popular music taste, and all their lyrics are kind of whiny. <br />but to the music. its hard, its angry, and its violent. you could say its brutal, but that might be an over statement. i think slipknot is a band that comes along that you either love or hate. me? i love them. i think their pretty good. i dont rank them with my other bands out of sweden and finland (checkout bands from these parts for awesome metal) but they still hold up pretty well. <br />maybe im just an idiot who still listens to slipknot every once in a while, maybe i just like their lyrics (come on, get passed the violence and take a look at whats behind it) and maybe i just like that dirty and dark feeling i get when i listen to them. who knows? who cares? i dont. i just listen to music that i like. and i like slipknot. <br />i recommend this cd to anyone who wants to get into metal, because this one will definately prepare you for whats next (lets face it, someone might be scared off if they all of a sudden pop in a cannibal corpse album right off the bat. start off small with slipknot, hell, years ago i listened to korn). so its not bad music, but its not great. ill just leave it at that.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I read the novel, Cold Mountain, some time ago, and thought it somewhat plodding, too much detail.  I watched the DVD with some trepidation, figuring that it would involve much of the same.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Jude Law as Inman, Nicole Kidman as Ada, and Renee' Zellwager as Ruby are magnificent.      The movie is breathtaking visually.  The screenplay follows history, most notably our Civil War's Battle of the Crater and its aftermath.    This is one of my top 5 anti-war movies.  It is up there with films like Castle Keep and A Midnight Clear.      I have an interest in Civil War history.  I appreciate that we are starting to see works in print and in film that move us away from our romantic notions of that terrible war.      This is a movie for history lovers and film buffs alike.
B00004CWO8|1.0|Oh my goodness, I was so glad I did not buy this!! I have always been enchanted by Swan lake and have seen the \\"original\\" ballet.  I was moved to search out this version because of the movie \\"Billy Elliot\\".  At the end of that movie we catch a glimpse of the adult Billy, played by the lead swan, Cooper. I was almost tempted to buy the DVD sight unseen based on the reviews, but decided at the last minute to rent it first. I was so bored, it was unbelievable.  I am pretty open minded, but i thought this was really cheesy. The choreography most of the time was bad, and I found myself fast forwarding through to see some actual dancing, not filler.  The story did not grip me and the music was awful.  What makes Swan Lake so hauntingly memorable, is the music's correlation with the dancing.  With Bourne's version, I felt that the music was almost wasted.  At times when it was cresting, the Prince was sulking in the dark.  Anyway, judge for yourself, but I caution...do as I did...rent from Netflix first before you buy!

The original release is typical American pablum that can't deal with the reality of life. In the directors cut we see thast Alfredo is not the nice guy portrayed in the original and that he is  a more svengali-like character.<br /><br />We also find that Toto has nieces and nephews that live with his mother so it dispells the image of a spinster sister living with an abandoned mother. Toto has a real family. His nephew wants to follow in his uncles footsteps. In terms of closure, how could Toto not have known that he lived in Giancaldo?
B000002J1O|4.0|All Rock groups have contributed just a little something to the overall field. This early Genesis album contains the finest sounding, brilliant and mood-evoking examples of what Genesis were really all about, throughout their career - Rock music with a distinctive touch of class. It does not eventually grow tiresome to hear (as Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\" for example); the originality of \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" never wears off. <br /> <br />The 9-minute plus \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is the standout classic of this Lp, it can be viewed as their most definitive track ever. The band played this particular gem live in concert for 20 years thereafter. \\"Firth of Fifth\\" is serious, classy, and moving. Moreover, it contains an absolutely lovely instrumental break in the middle, the likes of which cannot be had by any other rock group at any other time.   <br /> <br />\\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" (opening track), and, the spacey-jazz instrumental workout comprising the better portion of the closing track, \\"the Cinema Show\\" are other Genesis hallmarks captured on this Lp. However, the non-Genesis fan will have to be tolerant of (or ignore) certain bits of corny silliness which drives a couple of other songs on this album. Peter Gabriel's vain attempts at humour and wit have never been appreciated by this listener....and I am a longtime Genesis fan. <br /> <br />I'm reluctant to rate this as Genesis very best album; many of their later albums came across a little stronger. But I will state with confidence that this album contains their finest, best recorded moments of musical genius and class - and that these moments were not recaptured on any other Genesis album, period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00008FBDF|3.0|Having been betrayed by his government a couple of times too often, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) needed a better motive to leap back into action for \\"Rambo III.\\" This is provided when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) goes off to Afghanistan to help the Mujahedeen rebels fight the Soviet invaders only to be captured by Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Rambo, who had refused to go with Trautman because he is in Thailand becoming a Buddhist, now heads for Afghanistan on an unauthorized rescue mission.<br /><br />\\"Rambo III\\" has the formula down, which is a way of saying the plot is totally predictable and an excuse for a whole lot of explosions. Rambo is the most buffed up Buddhist the world has ever seen and I have a minor theory that he has the whole Sampson thing going with his hair getting longer in each movie. This 1988 film was not only the most expensive film ever made when it was released (a whopping $63 million in those pre-\\"Titanic\\" days), but made it into the \\"Guiness Book of World Records\\" as the most violent film ever made with a grand total of 221 acts of violence and over 108 deaths (it must be the former number that is important because a whole lot of nukes go off at the end of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and the entire planet exploded at the end of \\"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\\").<br /><br />Once again, the political dimensions of a \\"Rambo\\" film came into play, with the series shifting to Afghanistan, which was being called the Soviet Union's Vietnam, a metaphor that actually turned out to be more than wishful thinking. True, the Mujahedeen of yesterday became the Taliban down the road, but I still remember when the American public applauded the idea that the Shah of Iran had been deposed and replaced by the Ayatollah Khomeni. But in 1988 \\"Rambo III\\" was considered an exercise in freedom fighting and the Soviet Union was still the Evil Empire.<br /><br />The obvious analog to \\"Rambo III\\" is \\"Rocky IV,\\" in which Stallone continues to explore American-Soviet relationships. However, today \\"Rambo III\\" has been stripped of its politics and reduced to a non-stop action film. If there was some creativity to go along with the violence, as in the forest sequence in the original \\"First Blood,\\" then this film would be able to rise about the level of cartoon violence, but that is not the case.erican-Soviet relationships.

0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi struck me deeply for its wonderful story telling, unique structure, and mysterious and animated characters.  Namely the teenage protagonist Pi and his most mysterious 'bunkmate' the tiger Richard Parker. Certainly an odd pair! But if the story was purely about these two it would not have been the great parable it is.   <br /> <br />The author claims the book will help one believe in God. A surefire way of getting blasted by the literary critics, what audacity! One cannot help but be skeptical, but Martel's challenge is quickly forgotten by the reader by the power of the storytelling. And the storytelling is good.  If you miss the tiger in the first part, well read on. He comes and the pages turn rapidly, begging the question what was this ridiculous author challenge in the preface...well when the book finishes with a twist and all you know is up in the air, ask that question again.  What a discussion! And this is the ultimate beauty of the book, its life outside itself...great for book clubs or for a fun discussion with friends.  read and enjoy!
B0000JD24W|4.0|The most important thing to keep in mind when watching \\"First Blood\\" is not that this 1982 film was Slyvester Stallone's second most successful series after the Rocky films, but that at that point in pop culture history the Vietnam vet had essentially replaced the Nazi as the default villain in a lot of movies and television shows. The idea was that you took somebody with military training and set them off because (a) they did drugs in Nam, (b) were exposed to Agent Orange, (c) went crazy under the pressure, (d) were rejected by their government and the American people when they got home, or (e) any combination of the above. In that light, \\"First Blood\\" was one of the few films to present a Vietnam vet as a hero. John Rambo was moody and mentally unstable, in a trained killing machine sort of way, but he had a sense of honor and only struck back when pushed too far.<br /><br />The rule of thumb is that a movie succeeds more on the villain than the hero, and that holds true in this case, with Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, who does not take a liking to a the moody, shaggy haired, Rambo when he wanders through town. Teasle take Rambo into custody and tries to show him who is boss, but has a deputy sergeant (Jack Starrett) who takes things to far. Rambo snaps, easily escapes from the police station, and the massive manhunt hunt is on. The only problem is that Teasle and all of his men are no match for an unarmed Rambo, who quickly finds a way to arm himself. Teasle has some understanding of how his men are culpable in what is going on, but stubbornly insists that the rule of law should still apply, even when Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives right behind the National Guard to explain how big of a mistake the locals have made.<br /><br />The main problem with this film is that there were sequels, which buried the strengths of the original under big budget gloss (a charge that can be leveled against the Rocky series as well). Beyond that the main complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action. As such, the politics become an excuse for the violence, which is one of those things that would be ironic on so many levels. Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT). The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions. Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo.<br /><br />The message of \\"First Blood\\" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood. Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  \\"First Blood\\" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film. Originally, Rambo was killed at the end, but audiences were upset by that so the ending was changed and Stallone was able to milk two sequels out of the character.n complain would be that once events have been put into play and we all acknowledge that Rambo has been done wrong, the politics of the situation gives way to the action.

Then, at the end, when the movie becomes political again, it seems rather uncomfortably forced and Rambo's articulation of the very real plight of a lot of Vietnam vets becomes exceedingly forced (actually, at the end of this film, after being moody and silent for most of the film, Rambo talks a LOT). The best of the action sequences is when Teasle and his cops (including a relatively young David Caruso), try to track down Rambo in the woods, mainly because it relies more on stealth and intelligence than big guns and bigger explosions. Against a Green Beret these boys have no chance and when Rambo offers Teasle one last chance to let it go, and when the Sheriff refuses, all of our sympathies go to Rambo. <br /> <br />The message of \\"First Blood\\" might be forced, but it is hard to turn in a stern indictment of the film on that basis given what was happening with Vietnam vets in Hollywood. Even in this heavy-handed effort you have to admit there was an attempt at a noble motive.  \\"First Blood\\" changed the action genre as one of the first movies to feature a brief set-up and then pretty much non-stop action for the rest of the film. Originally, Rambo was killed at the end, but audiences were upset by that so the ending was changed and Stallone was able to milk two sequels out of the character.
0596007124|5.0|I have to admit: I was skeptical, at first. I stumbled on a Head First book a year or two ago, flipped through the pages, and put it back on the shelf: it seemed too simplistic for me. <br /> <br />A few weeks ago I was browsing computer books at a local Borders and stumbled on a lineup of several \\"Head First\\" titles. \\"If O'Reilly keeps publishing this stuff, someone must be buying it\\", I thought. I picked up one of them, started reading... I could not put the book down: it is rare when a computer book is so much fun and yet so informative and mature! <br /> <br />This book possess the magic of making you to learn without you really noticing it. Yeah, I know, \\"No pain, no gain.\\" Well, somehow the authors manage to keep you engaged, even with such an abstract material. What I am trying to say is that you don't feel like you need to concentrate on the reading because all the action keeps you focused. In each chapter the authors in a quite unimposing and subtle manner introduce a problem, so you almost don't see it coming. Most importantly, you don't feel that you are studying, but still, you are learning! <br /> <br />Authors by the means of visualization and conversations of quite a few characters -- the Master and the Student, the Guru and the Developer, and others -- make you learn the material almost \\"by the way\\". Why? I think because these characters represent familiar voices in your head that sound surprised, sarcastic, annoyed, excited, and frustrated when you are trying to digest new material. They force you to look at the problems and patterns in many different ways, and this is the essence of internalizing. The questions and answers are flying right in front of you, and they are neither boring nor trivial, so you are not falling asleep. Pictures make it even more real, and plenty of coded examples add necessary precision. Most importantly, using this style of writing the authors increase internalization of somewhat complex and abstract material much faster than others that I am familiar with. <br /> <br />The \\"Head First: Design Patterns\\" book covers the familiar GOF patterns, but unlike many of the patterns books, it does not have a separate condensed patterns catalog. The patterns appear as natural solutions to natural problems. What's remarkable is that they seem just one of the courses in this feast of object-oriented thinking. Indeed, this book talks about the wisdom of object-oriented design as about the design patterns themselves. This feels natural: the patterns do represent some of the best practices in the object-oriented design. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have is about the Appendix: the authors cramped in almost as many design patterns in its 20 pages as they did in the preceding 600. I understand that to cover the rest of the patterns could take another book and another year, but I'd rather wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />I believe that both experienced and novice readers will benefit from this enjoyable and engaging book, but you definitely will be more perceptive to the wisdom of this writing if you have matured through developing, maintaining, and extending of object-oriented systems. All in all, I love this book and can't wait to start reading another \\"Head First\\" pearl.
B00008F24W|4.0|John Wayne did not make a sequel. Even in the John Ford Calvary Trilogy he plays three different characters. Gary Cooper did not make a sequel and neither did Clark Gable. Of course, they had the advantage of living before the Age of Inevitable Sequels. I bring this up only because while I realize Sylvester Stallone would have a lot less money without all the sequels that he made, but I was simply wondering if he would have had a better reputation? \\"Rocky II\\" gave us a happier ending than \\"Rocky,\\" but did that not miss the point of the original? \\"Rocky III\\" was a slick thrill ride compared to \\"Rocky,\\" but did it have more heart?<br /><br />Those rhetorical queries lead us to today's object lesson, \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II,\\" the 1985 sequel to Stallone's \\"First Blood\\" (Part I). The original had the virtue of exploiting the plight of Vietnam vets in a way that was at least sympathetic in contrast to the onslaught of movies and television shows that insisted on making American troops back from Vietnam the replacement for all those aging Nazis as the bad guys. There were some pretty good action sequences as Rambo took on the local cops (especially the one in the forest), and then Stallone got to break his character's stoic silence and launch into a rant about how badly our troops were treated by the government and their fellow citizens when they returned. Then three years later we got \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II.\\"<br /><br />The title alone tells you that the emphasis is on the character, which we can acknowledge without going off the deep end on how the name has five letters and begins with a \\"R.\\" The problem, and where the sequel fails compared to the original, is that the script has to find somebody stupid enough to make the mistakes that the hick sheriff did in the original and his sadistic deputy did the first time around. The set up is that Colonel Samuel Troutman (Richard Crenna) gets John Rambo (Stallone) out of prison for a black op to bring back POW's still being held in Vietnam by a sadistic prison camp commandant (William Ghent) and a Russian officer (Steven Berkoff). Rambo is teamed up with Co Bao (Julia Nickson), a former Vietnames freedom fighter, who manages to touch our hero's heart, every during all the excitement. Of course Rambo wants to get the POWs out of the prison camp, but he ends up being betrayed by the guy running the operation (Charles Napier) and his henchman (Martin Kove) as once again American foreign policy rears its ugly head. This means that Rambo is going to have to accomplish his mission regardless of what real echelons clowns might want.<br /><br />Obviously the situation here is contrived, but it is the rare sequel that does not try to stick to the original proven formula as much as possible. The problems are that it is hard to believe that these people would go out of their way to bring a living killing machine as a loose cannon on a secret mission like this and that the film finds its relevance in keeping alive the idea that the Vietcong have been keeping American prisoners ever since the war ended. \\"Rambo: First Blood Part II\\" served as a rallying point for those who believed that to be the case, which I find being tantamount to adding insult to injury. If you accept the premise of the plot then the film has a certain power, but I cannot but consider the whole thing to be just too manipulative and exploitative.still being held in Vietnam by a sadistic prison camp commandant (William Ghent) and a Russian officer (Steven Berkoff).

1400034779|4.0|I read this book in a day, partly because it is a short book and mostly because the writing was charming and engaging.  The instantly charismatic heroine detective tells the fun and interesting stories of the mysteries she is called on to investigate and solve in her own unique way - all the while revealing bits of the culture, relationships and problems of her native land.   <br /> <br />The author, through the heroine, gives the rich history and description of her African country and her life and family experiences, some that make you laugh, and some that make you really feel for the characters, but most of all to shape Precious Ramostwe and alert us to why she makes the decisions she does and pursue her own way of life.  I enjoyed the unique taste of African culture and recommend it.
B0006399FS|5.0|It does annoy me when people slag off an album such as this after seemingly only one listen or two at most. Be patient, and you will find this to be one of the most enjoyable U2 albums out there. People didn't like their previous effort of \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" because they found it \\"boring\\" or \\"too mainstream\\". You obviously haven't paid any attention to it, read the lyrics or given it a few listens. <br /> <br />This album is in my view one of the best of 2004. I am not a U2 fan, the only albums of theirs that I own are this one and \\"All that you can't leave behind\\". Most of the songs on here are of a very high quality - \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\" (both #1 UK singles by the way), \\"City of blinding lights\\", \\"All because of you\\" and \\"Yahweh\\".  <br /> <br />Musically, the album is sound, as it is lyrically. I have the UK version which has twelve tracks, the extra one being \\"Fast Cars\\", a very hispanic sounding song, containing the lyrics from where this album's title originated. <br /> <br />Overall, a decent effort from a band whose other albums I will for sure be getting. <br /> <br />PS To all of you who think Bono is dumb for singing 1, 2, 3, 14 in Spanish at the beginning of Vertigo a warning. Don't underestimate these guys, they are cleverer than you. If it indeed was a mistake, someone would have noticed before the album went out - the fourteen stands for their fourteenth album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I've been following kanye west for roughly 3 years.  I told all of my friends about him.  But his early work really blew me away but i was afraid that \\"the college dropout\\" would disappoint.  Believe me it doesnt. Its by far one of the hottest albums that ive picked up in a long time.  There are no songs on this album that u can't like, i can listen to this album for track one to the end and i dont have to skip.  You need to pick this up.  Now all i can do is wait for \\"Late Registration\\" his next record, so look out.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Horrible, horrible, stupid, boring, odd, lacking sense and creativity, intelligence, plot, reason, good acting, and most of all Foster! No wonder she disagreed to such a film. It's a joke my friends. It was merely violence combined with absurd ideas and stupidity. It isnt even in the same LEAGUE as LAMBS. It probably had Foster laughing that they would even have the nerve to expect a talented actreess like her to part take in such a movie. She takes her acting career seriously, and only plays roles that she as a person connects with. And a plot in a movie doesn't hurt! Red Dragon was good, only because it reflected alot of similarities with silence of the lambs. I hate it when there is such a great and unforgettable movie like LAMBS, and then comes a new film, claiming to be the third of the trilogy, but they bite off more then they can chew. Their confidence exceeded their ability as well as their underestimating LAMBS fans. Not many LAMBS fans, (who actually knew all the info about how they created such a realistic and modern suspense/thriller), would enjoy hannibal even a little. Like me.  Lambs was caviar, hannibal was cheese wizz.
B00000I07R|5.0|Their 1992 album KEEP THE FAITH is the most favorite Bon Jovi material I have ever encountered. It may not so as catchy as megahit SLIPPERLY WHEN WET. This album is so serious and sincere and DRY COUNTRY, over 9 minute dynamic opus is the proof of it with aggressive guitar solo interlude somewhat close to that of NEXT 100 YEARS in CRUSH album. I BELIEVE is so thrilling opening which makes my expectation for the album soar and the rest do not betray us. Commercial climax comes when you hear IN THESE ARMS and BED OF ROSES. But what a waste if you just listen to these two tracks because the other heavier and country rock flavored materials heal our souls. FEAR is a bit of Duran Duran flavored power pop stuff.<br /><br />Recommended for true rock lovers.
0671027573|4.0|A bad book doesn't quite meet your expectations.  A great book exceeds your best expectations. A good book is one that meets your expectations.  MR. PERFECT was good for me.  If you're looking for a genuine mystery, suspense-thriller, then MR. PERFECT will not fully satisfy you.  If you're looking for a sweet romance, then you'll find MR. PERFECT a little dark.<br /><br />Jaine Bright(misspelling of `Janine' on her birth certificate)  is one of four friends who, while releasing the frustrations of being women in a male-dominated workplace, decides to create a List of traits that one would find in the perfect man.  While the list starts off with relatively reasonable requirements like `faithfulness,' the List also jokingly includes a not-so-tame requirement for above-average length of male...equipment.  When the List accidentally finds its way into the writers of the informal company newsletter, the Ladies of the List find themselves thrust into the spotlight and gaining the attention of the nation...and MR. PERFECT's very disturbed villain.<br /><br />Detective Sam Donovan, Jaine's rugged and challenging neighbor soon becomes more than the focus of her love/hate attraction, but also her protector and friend as the danger escalates.<br /><br />First, Howard's idea for the villain was a respectable one.  However, the execution of the antagonist's story seemed more like an in-depth sketch or framework for a story that could have been incredible, if it were fully developed.  Here and there, the antagonist talked to himself in the mirror, and though these parts were good, they were not enough to make the thriller part of the book feel complete.<br /><br />A big problem with the book for me was that MR. PERFECT's villain just was not...present enough.  For me, the part about a thriller psychopath that makes it feel real and complete is the view inside his head-that is the unraveling of his twisted psyche.  This wasn't done effectively, in my opinion.  Howard opened with a childhood scene that left it up to the reader to imagine what made MR. PERFECT's antagonist so bad.  Then there was basically nothing else said to help develop him other than his bathroom mirror soliloquies.  More flashbacks, more dialogue and detailed description of the scenes in which the bad guy did his dastardly deeds would have added to the book.  The last couple of chapters had Donovan visiting some key people and getting some questions answered about the villain, and I really felt like it came out of order.  Profilers, while not being able to give those kind of specifics, should have been verbalizing probable descriptions of the killer and likely explanations for his behavior.  I would have liked to see:  (1) some detailed profiling discussions; (2) more of what actually happened to his victims; and also (3) more of the story from his point of view (which I understand could have been tricky).  The development of the antagonist, in short, left something to be desired.<br /><br />And second, while the women of MR. PERFECT and their issues were very realistic and interesting, they drew away from the traditional lightness of most romance/suspense novels, I think.  Infidelity is an issue.  And the fact that a lot of the secondary characters did not get a clearly happy ending was quite a surprise.  It wasn't that Howard did such a good job of creating a connection to any of them, but I still did not expect these characters' conclusions to be so grim.<br /><br />Finally, MR. PERFECT gets four stars for the unique character of Jaine, who is both smart and funny.  Most fascinatingly, Jaine is curiously vulnerable and tough at the same time.  She is a truly 3-dimensional character who manages to do what I think real women do everyday:  be strong without being a man.  And Jaine's relationship with Sam will make you laugh out loud as much as their love scenes will make you sweat.<br /><br />Only as Good as Your Expectations Allow.t up to the reader to imagine what made MR.

B00003CXAT|5.0|Lets face it, Congo and Sphere just both bombed one after the other, but Jurrasic Park sure showed what you can do with a great author's story when you combine it with a great director. Point taken that the movie does not follow the book, but I think it made it appear to people in another way of what might happen if someone of Crichton's level remade his story. <br /> <br />Jurrasic Park is the story of a man named John Hammond, well in his senior years, who is a billionaire that decides to open a park on an island off the coast of Costa Rica. There is one difference with his park, or should I say, there is a big difference with his park. <br /> <br />His park has full grown disonasuars, from herbivores to carnivores, any type you can name of, and some you might did not know even exist. To show that his park is safe, Hammond decides to invite several guests to his park for a special tour. They include two palenantologists, a mathematician, a lawyer from the company Hammond owns name InGen, and Hammonds own grandchildren. <br /> <br />Sam Neil plays Alan Grant, the head hancho in my opinion, who is obsessed with dinosaurs and doesn't really know what to think of the park. Laura Dern plays Ellie Sattler, the second paleantologist, who thinks that the park isn't a good idea. And then you have the best character in the movie, again my opinion, Jeff Goldblum, whos plays Ian Malcom, who hates the idea of bringing the dinosaurs back to life. <br /> <br />The park tour goes smoothly, if not for some sick triceratops and some no shows at some exhibits, but when a storm comes, and a park employee decides to cash in on the embryos with the Dino's DNA, thats when the movie gets really interesting. <br /> <br />The Dinosaurs are some of the best special effects you will ever see, I guarantee it, even if you hate the plot you have to respect the power the dinos are shown in. A lot a mayhem, and a especially scary scene when the T-Rex gets out makes this a super chiller.  <br /> <br />But the good part of the movie are when the Velocoraptors get out, now they are the truly nasty son's of b*tches. And the Dinosaur that has a fin on his neck is trully creepy. [I know it sounds funny, but when you see it spit acid maybe you wouldn't want to meet it face to face afterall.] <br /> <br />Luckily all the annoying people get killed; So if you think someone should just shut up when he or she talks don't worry, they probably will be silenced for good. Although I did like Samuel L Jackson's character in it, but why kill him off, he was cool. [Sorry if I ruined that part to those who haven't seen it] <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie, it truly is a classic, and if Spielburg directed, you know you will get your money's worth, no matter what happens in it. Also look for the incredible special effects, both terrifying and aw-inspiring, add all those things up and you have yourself a great movie.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Man, I've heard some AWESOME Heavy Metal bands in my day, but only a very select few I would even dare to compare to Metallica. The rise of Lamb of God was not just a step, but a giant leap in the New Wave Of American Heavy Metal. It's bands like Chimaira, Killswitch Engage, In Flames, Soulfly, and Lamb of God that got me to LOVE the metal of today. The best of the past has met the fresh talent of the new. THANK YOU LAMB OF GOD! You'd make Metallica proud.

His guitar mood is similar, too similar to the past, so I can't see it as a new direction in Vai's opera. It's rather a stop or an exit from the majestic road he has tracked. I hope he starts soon with a new form of music.

B000003TA4|1.0|Something tells me that Nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments.  Everybody thinks it was Korn, but it was really Nirvana who were the true founders of this \\"nu metal\\" teenage angst garbage.  You can blame Nirvana for all those annoying \\"mallcore\\" bands like Korn, Nickelback, and Linkin Park who have dominated the rock charts since the 1990s.  Almost everything bad about today's music started with Nirvana--monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. <br /> <br />Do you Nirvana fans really believe all the hype about Nirvana \\"killing off hair metal\\" and \\"saving rock n roll\\"?  Nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things.  Nirvana were not about music.  They were about conformity and nothing more.  Just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable, immature, whiney suburban teenagers from their money.  They were the Backstreet Boys with guitars, basically.  The Linkin Park of '88-'94.  I blame Nirvana for everything bad that's happened to music in the last decade.
6305181810|4.0|One more legal thriller, you will say. Yes and no. Yes, because it is a thriller in the courtroom with a judge and lawyers and cases, victims and culprits, a jury and all of it. But it is more than that. It is the dilemma of a young lawyer who is confronted to an impossible choice: he is getting involved with his clients, emotionally involved and that is not good. You can't be the lawyer of the woman you love. You can't be the lawyer of a young man who is dying of leukemia and for whom you feel too much compassion. But that problem is secondary in that film, though it explains the end, the very final scene. This film is essential because it deals with three cases that are absolutely typical in our society. The first case is an old woman who has an important inheritance and she does not want to give it to her own son and his wife because they hate her and they only want her money. That's about what we do with our senior citizens, and what they do with themselves if they still have that much control of their future. Then let the lawyer write the will. Then you have a young married woman who is systematically beaten up by her husband and she does not dare to get a divorce because she is afraid. Then the lawyer is the only recourse to convince her she has to put an end to that situation. Then there is the central case, that of the young man dying of leukemia because his insurance company denied the claim. In that case, and that film is not quite young, we have all the arguments we have been able to hear against any kind of public management of health insurance coverage. That case was representative of the debate that had been going on for decades, since the war, since the new bill of rights of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. Public health is a national asset and the nation through its representatives is entitled to manage it for everyone to have access to the best health coverage possible. Along that line the film is extremely emotional, even passionate and the arguments are no longer important when you are dealing with the pictures of a dying young man, of a beaten young woman, of an old hated woman. But the film is effective and calls for a response from the audience. It is that direct address to the audience's feelings and emotions, other than fear, fright and dread, or horror, terror and phobia, or violence, brutality and fury, that make the film interesting and probably lasting.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDare no longer important when you are dealing with the pictures of a dying young man, of a beaten young woman, of an old hated woman.

B00006M183|1.0|it is interesting reading the review talking about how Pearl Jam doesnt chase supermodels,etc.When as soon as the grunge 'sell out' police faded, both Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell <br />traded brains for looks and youth (models that they quickly settled down with).And Pearl Jam are clearly a band that wants to make money,choosing to play arenas instead of clubs.Choosing to cash in on old hits with one compilation after another.Not signing with an indie label after Epic dropped them.But the false integrity that some people throw at Pearl Jam is neither here or there. <br /> <br />I paid for Riot Act because I liked Im Mine.I also was a big fan of them in the early 90's.But the album was a waist of money.The problem is not that its a political album.Afterall,11 years before on the 11x platinum Ten,Eddie wailed as characters fell victim to pappa Bush's policies and social indiference.But in Riot Act,Eddie Vedder sounds like a rich rock star trying to relate to  the \\"have nots\\" but no longer has anything to say.The Bush attacks are so unconvincing,self conscious and self serious they are laughable.Bushleaguer has the worst lyrics of a \\"political\\" song I ever heard (the chorus-\\"I remember when you sang that song about today,now its tomorow and everything has changed\\".What?) <br /> <br />but thous lyrics are better then Eddie Vedder repeating lyrics from past albums (\\"there aint gonna be a middle anymore\\") <br />or repeating the old Beatles line \\"all you need is love\\" over and over like its actually a deep thought instead of a oldies pop lyric.Pure shmaltz.   <br /> <br />I think the great reviewer rating for this awful album is almost laughable.I cant imagine a non-die hard picking this album up and thinking the bored,reheated music and unoriginal,uninspired lyrics are all that great.Or Eddie Vedder's limp,weak vocals.The album sunk in the charts from bad word of mouth(after a strong debut).Riot Act doesnt get a 5 rating from all thous people who waisted hard earned money on this lifeless self-parody. <br /> <br />I called this review \\"Teenage Angst Has Paid Of Well Now We Are Bored and Old\\"(the old Kurt Cobain line)because it describes Riot Act perfectly. <br />
067101756X|3.0|...Corso ( now the late , I believe,) could have  used some help organize his ideas. Something about the reading clearly shows why Corso was a military man and not a writer. That said it is revealing and quite disappointing to see the distinctly hostile and naive agenda the US military has with regards to the extraterrestrials and not the other way around as Corso asserts without basis. A highly advanced and old civilization of extraterrestrial humans visiting this earth for arguably hundreds of thousands of years, whose crafts have been accidentally ( or otherwise) acquired and reversed engineered by the comparatively infantile earth human are unlikely to view us as \\"the enemy\\"  <br /> <br />Corso and colleagues show the ugliness of true military thinking when ( in the chapter: \\"Hostile Intentions and The Cold War\\") he states without showing proof of knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt nor evidence that the evasiveness of the UFO craft and their pilots to US military interception indicated hostility (can you blame them for running off )not to mention that retrieved Roswell craft revealed technology that indicated that nuclear installation and humans in general were under observation meant that beyond doubt they considered us as the \\" blind and helpless enemy \\" There is a lack of depth in the paradigm that views an unarmed individual that runs away when threatened with a gun as an enemy when it has been established that all that individual was doing was observing. <br /> <br />Again this stuff is very revealing. More has been said in far greater articulation about the subject and I urge all interested to read authors such as Steve Greer on the subject. It is sad that the phenomenon is being addressed through the John Wayne-one-track-minded military and not anthropologists. I have no doubt that the story is true ( those who don't believe please wake up and educate yourselves: the infancy of Homo sapiens is over.) It's sad that the US military has this attitude thatpeople from another world whose culture and advancements we only have had a glimpse at gauging through reverse engineering of a few retrieved exploratory crafts now have the big headedness to challenge them militarily.  <br /> <br />I suspect ET warfare would kick our butts literally back into the stone age. To my knowledge the USA is for all intents and purposes the only country at present that takes a hostile stance toward the phenomenon and is really what the \\"weaponization of space\\" is all about when one cuts through the bull -- see works by Dr. Steven Greer.
B000669GAI|2.0|funny how bands rarely release Greatest Hits albums when they are on their creative and popular peak.Usually they release Greatest Hits albums when its over(Stone Temple Pilots,Creed,Korn,etc). <br /> <br />I would put this below the Nirvana,Soundgarden and Alice in Chains best of's.The problem with Pearl Jam is that because they once were the biggest and most mainstream of the Seattle-Grunge bands,you simply get tired of hearing their radio hits,while some of the lesser known singles are not worth hearing. <br /> <br />
B00070DK5K|4.0|In December of 1974, David Live became the first David Bowie LP I owned. I was a junior in high school and I listened to it nonstop for weeks. I eventually bought all Bowie's LPs and have been a huge fan for over 30 years now. This reissue of David Live, expanded,  is wonderful to me on many different levels. However, it does not hold a candle to \\"Stage\\" or the often bootlegged 1976 concert from King Biscuit. I like it a lot, but will be the first to admit it is severely flawed. <br /> <br />With that said, the high points of this release are that we finally get \\"Panic in Detroit\\" which was previously available as the B side on the \\"Rock N\\" Roll with Me\\" single which went nowhere upon its release. David Sanborn, Earl Slick and Mike Garson are the most prominent members of the band in this outing, and their work is great, indeed. Bowie, however, is in pretty thin voice. This tour found Bowie in the midst of a terrible cocaine period, and his vocals here can't hold a candle to subsequent live recordings. Compare his vocals here with those on Stage, recorded four years later, or the Reality tour DVD from 2004,  and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />Still, it's an enjoyable record, and this remaster is very well done, and a bargain at that. If you are just getting into Bowie, however, I highly recommend Stage over this set.
B00006690G|4.0|EMINEM/THE EMINEM SHOW <br /> <br />1. Curtain (skit)-1.5- Is there a point to this intro? <br /> <br />2. White America- 3.5- It's good, nice classic Eminem start. <br /> <br />3. Business-2.5- For rookie Eminem fans, this one will bite, hardcore Eminem fans, it might bite or not. <br /> <br />4. Cleaning Out My Closet-5- It's great, not the best vocal effort (Chorus), but the song and the lyrics have great feeling, and Eminem does well. <br /> <br />5. Square Dance-1- I don't understand this song, I still don't. <br /> <br />6. The Kiss-4.5- Without a doubt the best skit I've ever heard on an album, they say the F word a little too much, but a good start to the next track. <br /> <br />7. Soldier-5- I like this, had such a great feeling, going through several subjects in 4 minutes. It keeps a steady pace, some words you might have to go over more then once to understand, but Eminem does great effort. <br /> <br />8. Say Goodbye To Hollywood-4.5- The only thing I find funny about this song, is its title and yet a couple months later, he has his own movie. Great song though, a little trite lyrics caught in the center but good. <br /> <br />9. Drips-2.5- Not much I can say, 50/50, its fine for what it is, but its nothing that is genius. <br /> <br />10. Without Me-3- Moves way too fast, and some lyrics absolutely make no sense. Nice fun song though, some might stand it. <br /> <br />11. Paul-3- Could have been classic but its not. Moves slow <br /> <br />12. Sing For The Moment-3.5- It's good, again some trite lyrics to keep the song going, but its fine, it works. <br /> <br />13. Superman-4.5- Good song, underage children must stay away from this one, or any parent for that matter, but this song has a good beat. <br /> <br />14. Hailie's Song-5- I only like this song, because it shows that Eminem has a big heart and loves his daughter, the title alone shows who he really is. <br /> <br />15. Steve Berman-1- Skit, I'll end it there <br /> <br />16. When The Music Stops-4- Nice work on this song, they may have tried too hard on a few spots, but it is good anyways. <br /> <br />17. Say What You Say-3- Fine, but again, not classic. <br /> <br />18. Till I Collapse-3- Again, not classic but standable. <br /> <br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy-5- Great, funny, and just an enjoyable last song to a very mixed up album, it has feeling, and the song is worth hearing. <br /> <br />20. Curtains Close-3- Better then Curtains from the first track, it is funny. <br />
B0002EXH40|5.0|A lot of people who write reviews on here, like to put their metal before their bands.  Dont get me wrong, i am a pure metalhead, but just because this album isnt as \\"thrashy, speedy, or dark\\" as megadeth's previous releases, doesnt mean it isnt essential.  The opening track, Reckoning Day - holy sh*t, a very good opening song that has a classic megadeth theme.  As for it being remastered and remixed, dont worry.  You cant tell a big difference like with Ozzy's remasters.
B0002858YS|2.0|I really enjoyed the first 30 seconds of the first video I saw of the Killers.  Then I listened to the lyrics. First of all I have heard this song already several times.  Secondly,  lyrics don't have to be great poetry, but when they manage to be both dumb and needlessly pretentious.... <br /> <br />Having now tried to give the whole album a fair trial, I must pass judgement - they are sad, pompous boys, who like to dress up in other people's music.  Lack of originality wouldn't be the end of the world, since the melodies are generally pretty strong, but the lyrics!  The lyrics are SO BAD I have trouble sitting through an entire verse (although I gave them two stars - I have to save a one star rating for things like Gwen Stefani's album).  I wish the singer wouldn't try to pronounce his words like a Brit, either.  Urgh.  <br /> <br />Yeah, I really hate this band. <br /> <br />
B0000CDL93|4.0|In 1969, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison brought noted New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw to trial for conspiracy to murder President John F. Kennedy. To date, this is the only trial of any individual in reference to the Kennedy assasination.  This controversial 1991 film follows Garrison's investigation into the Kennedy assasination from the day of Kennedy's death to the conclusion of the trial--and it has prompted almost as much controversy as the assasination itself.<br /><br />How much of this film are we to take as fact and how much of it are we take as fiction?  Critics have noted that as a historian, Stone is a great filmmaker, and with JFK Stone creates a vision so extreme that even some conspiracy theorists have denounced it as completely impossible.  But that may actually be part of the film's point: that we live in a society that typically subverts the truth, a world in which facts are hard to come by and in which speculation runs wild.<br /><br />However you wish to take the film, there's no denying that it is exceptionally well done.  Much of its power rests on visuals.  JFK is presented on different film stocks with various grains and color qualities, and these scenes--some of them lasting only seconds--are combined like pieces of an jigsaw puzzle to create a slowly emerging picture of American politics at its worst. The script, largely based on Garrison's book ON THE TRAIL OF THE ASSASINS, works in much the same fashion, shifting rapidly from scene to scene and back and forth in time. In combination, cinematography and script have a cumulative power that is most impressive, and Williams' haunting score adds greatly to the effect.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is easily one of the best I've ever seen. Kevin Costner is not, perhaps, ideally cast as Jim Garrison--but he plays in an extremely low-key manner completely devoid of any \\"star\\" trappings, and thus throws focus on the myriad of characters who swirl through the story. Gary Oldman is uncanny as Lee Harvey Oswald. His performance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.<br /><br />But perhaps the most memorable are the host of actors who appear in unlikely roles and who aquit themselves exceptionally well. Joe Pesci gives a typically aggressive performance in the strange role of a right-wing paramilitary homosexual, Kevin Bacon is completely unexpected and flawless as a hard-bitten gay prostitute, and Tommy Lee Jones is impressive as the influential Clay Shaw. Other memorable performers include Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Sally Kirkland, and Donald Sutherland--and in a wicked twist of irony Jim Garrison himself appears as Justice Earl Warren.<br /><br />The package includes a number of extras, including an often interesting director's commentary, an interview with famous conspiracy theorist Prouty, and a documentary on certain intriguing records recently declassified by Congress as a direct result of this film's impact. Then there is the film itself, which includes several previously cut scenes and which is extremely well transferred to DVD.<br /><br />Historians and theorists will probably wrangle over the JFK assasination for decades, perhaps centuries to come. But whether you buy into Oliver Stone's scenario in whole, in part, or not at all, film is both extremely well-done and provocative to the max. If you want to stir conversation, this will do it. Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerance is such that you're often unsure if you watching Oldman or news footage of Oswald, and Brian Doyle-Murray achieves a similar effect with the smaller role of Jack Ruby.

B000067DNC|5.0|I make it a Point every friday night to be in fron tof my TV to watch STARGATE SG-1.  Being the GREATEST SERIES ON TELEVISION.  It was origanally done for SHOTIME, who in my option was stupid for letting it go, then picked up by SCI/FI channel.  I honestly think that SHOTIMES stupidity has help the show because they would have givin it 2-3 seasons then killed it because they have no vision(IMO).  Thankfully SCI/FI grabed it and ran with it with 8 seasons todate and a suposed 9th and 10th season coming,  i will be spending a lot of money on these box sets.  I buy them as they appear on AMAZON.  BUY IT ITS GREAT!!!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|When's the last time we've seen a good, original horror film (other than The Ring)?  Still trying to think?  So am I.  At first, when the previews of Saw were hitting television, the movie looked to me like the kind of movie that really doesn't go anywhere, and has no actual plot, but boy was I wrong!  After reading review after review after review on message boards and websites of how good this movie was, I found myself at Suncoast paying for the DVD before I had even seen it, and let me tell you, my instincts did not fail me!  Saw was fantastic!  The twists, the plot itself, the setting, the suspense, everything seemed to have been mapped out perfectly.  Not to mention the film's few grisly moments which take it back to good old raw horror.  I notice a lot of directors out there say they tried to go back to good old school fun, but they never pull it off.  That wasn't the case here.  They kept the movie contemporary, but still managed to also keep it moving at a relatively easy pace, so you're able to keep up with what's going on while the suspence builds up on you.  That was a great credit on the director's part.  The only downside is the subpar acting.  However, you'll find yourself overlooking that in a hurry.  Saw is one of the best damn horror movies I have seen in a very long time.  Any true horror fan should enjoy it!

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I absolutely love this music!  It is tons of fun as well as sweet and romantic.  David Foster has a nack for filling the world musically with what it is missing. (mostly graceful talent)  I am glad somebody can see the value in bringing back the art of being a gentleman.  At least Buble, Botti and Groban(Foster finds) seem to understand this.  I do not care what others say about him copying Sinatra or whatever their complaint is.  Sinatra was great and there will never be another, but it is nice to have modern day talent that has the qualities of gentleness, ease, sweetness and smoothness once again.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is just a love story with zombies gettin in teh way of one man and his Tv.... i meen girlfriend.  I bought this movie not expecting to much.  To my suprise it was funny and the zombies where done well.  There is little actual gore in the film, but it is still a good show. funny and a good alround flick, 4stars
B000002MIF|5.0|Definitely a worthy Smiths record...the BBC session really capture the essence of the full band like other reviewers have said.  Andy and Mike really are shown on the BBC recordings instead of being drowned out like on the studio records.  The sound of the songs from the first record are even better than they were on \\"the Smiths\\" because of the \\"raw\\" sound without the production of the studio albums. I'm tempted to buy \\"Rank\\" cause of it.   <br /> <br />I won't say not to buy the first album although...most of the songs from S/T appear on here with better versions.  I was just blown away by the new sound though.  I thought it was a good feeling. <br /> <br />My only complaint is the repeated appearances of \\"Heaven Knows\\", \\"Girl Afriad\\", \\"Tonight\\",etc.  These already appeared on Louder Than Bombs.   These is songs are really awesome though.   But the big redeemers are the two songs...\\"Handsome Devil\\" which is a complete rocker and the amazing and under-rated \\"Accept Yourself\\".  These two tracks alone are almost worth the price of the CD.
B0002858YS|3.0|Synthesizers were set up to sound like other instruments - and when you try to sue them for that purpose, they (nearly) always sound lame.  Ironically enough, when you try to get everything else to sound like a synthesizer, it works pretty well.  This album is a n example of that.  It's really good - \\"Natalie\\" -especially.  My only gripe is they released the worst song on here as the first single, and that could turn a lot of people off of it.  But it's good.
0783226845|5.0|Different movie...quite an unexpected, albeit analogous role for Pacino.  He's a master, no doubt, but what brought me to tears wasn't the 'near death scene' at his suicide attempt, but his stirring speech before the disciplinary committee.  THIS type of speeches make history!  All the other stuff may or may not happen--the facts would vary, of course, but the strength of the movie are the underlying principles that make life worth living.  Not being melodramatic, just a tad bit jealous that a person put them into words so well, and that another person internalized them so masterfully as to make them sound...infallible...despite, or against all else. <br /> <br />GREAT show.  Not the action flicks I'm used to, but nonetheless satisfying on a deeper philosophical level.  A definite recommend!
B0006UYOJM|5.0|This album has been around for a long time.  What makes this one different? <br />It's the sound quality.  Steve Hoffman of DCC fame has continued his legacy of audiophile quality remastering. <br />It's like you've never really heard this lp before.  It's that well done.  The sound quality will blow you away.
B00005JNNL|2.0|What a terrible year for the disabled!  Especially after a T.V. movie of the week type dishonest mediocrity like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" cleaned up at the oscars.  Before it was Planned Parenthood showing up at the oscars for an equally shoddy and purely politically self-serving \\"Cider House Rules.\\"  I was almost expecting the Hemlock Society at this years awards. <br />I suppose the irony that the script never would have come to be if someone had killed him like he wanted requires too much insight and intelligence?!  While people are certainly entitled to have views opposing to mine, the incredibly biased term \\"death with dignity'\\" all too much bullies and preempts  \\"discussion.\\"  (However what is dignified about putting a bag over someone's head or starving and dehydrating them to death is beyond me!  Or even the repellant and feeble minded cowardice involved in refusing the kind of suicide prevention counseling support we are ethically obliged to offer the healthy and able bodied.) <br />It is sad that cinema seems to have no more artistic expression to offer; only nazi era politicized propaganda.
B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden's &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; was one of the three classic grunge CD's released in 1991. (others being Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot;)  This CD is definitely much closer in sound to &quot;Ten&quot; but that really isn't saying much because Soundgarden has a very unique sound.  &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; is a classic grunge CD and is really what someone would and should picture grunge to sound like.  &quot;Nevermind&quot; is easily more of a punk record whereas &quot;Ten&quot; had a classic rock feel to it.  &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; is a tuff listen for someone trying to get into grunge since it is loud and very raw.  There are no radio-friendly songs on here; just in-your-face grunge.  Chris Cornell's voice is on top form here; it's just simply never sounded better in his career.  He seems more mellowed out in &quot;Superunknown&quot; and is just uninspired in his new band Audioslave.  Meanwhile, the song &quot;Outshined&quot; in my opinion may just be the greatest grunge song of all time.  Better than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit, better than &quot;Black&quot;, just absolute perfection.  But then again, so is the rest of the CD.
B00008PW2D|5.0|For all those reviews that poo-poohed season 5 - YOU GUYS ARE WACK AND ON CRACK! <br /> <br />After season 4, the girls had been through so much that we hardly recognized them any more.  What season 5 does is bring them back to their season 1 and 2 comedy.  Season 5 is very funny and reflective.   <br /> <br />Yeah it's only 8 shows, but let's get real, it's a nice break for true fans.  The show is so addicting that it's hard to just sit and watch one show.  Before you know it, it's 3 hours later and you have one more disc to watch.  Season 5 gives you that break before the emotionally packed season 6! <br /> <br />I bought this season used here on Amazon - it was worth it.  Rememeber to check and see if it's the original packaging.  SOme people make copies and sell them that way.   <br /> <br />GET IT, IT'S WORTH IT! <br /> <br />Ed Martinez
B000021YQV|5.0|Being only 15 years old, I haven't had much time to grow an amazing intellectual viewpoint on music. But being somewhat musically inclined made me write this review, picking out some songs to explain their meaning: <br /> <br />1. Prison Song (5/5): A song inspired by the imprisonment of one of their own members on counts of drug possession (I think it was Shavo), this song talks mainly about how America is so caught up with the 'war on drugs' that they fill up the prisons with all these useless reasons. The song itself is fun to hear, from the propaganda-like message they spread to the mimicry of cocaine dealers. <br /> <br />2. Needles (4/5): This is also about drugs. (It makes sense if you keep this in mind and listen to it. The 'tapeworm' is actually the addiction that the person suffers from. There's also the 'needle' there too.) This song is great, showing off Serj's range of vocalization. <br /> <br />3. Chop Suey! (5/5): The infamous song that made many MTV groupies believe System of a Down is 'pop' (they really are quite ignorant. And a side note: this song was believed to have been called 'Suicide,' but was changed to lessen the somewhat intense title. [Get it? Chop Suey-cide!]) The song hints about a problem one person is going through, attempting to hide this problem and telling lies to get around the truth, to the eventual suicide. May also have some Armenian roots in it, if you research it enough. <br /> <br />7. Bounce (3/5): This song can get old very fast, but it's fun the first few listen-throughs. This song is about an orgy. Not molestation, not the joy of sharing a pogo-stick (which, in the context I just put in, isn't exactly a pogo-stick, but something much more... mature.) I mean, think of the lyrics. \\"I went out on a date, with a girl a bit late.\\" That might make you think of a molestation, but it goes on as \\"She had so many friends (gliding through many hands).\\" \\"I brought my pogo stick, just to show her a trick...\\" Meaning the multiple partners in this... activity. <br /> <br />9. ATWA (2/5): I don't really like this song. Not saying it's bad, just saying it's a personal thing that I don't get. ATWA stands for AIR, TREES, WATER, ANIMAL, and is indeed about the mind of the 'serial killer' Charles Manson. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity (5/5): I love this song. At first, listening to it, I didn't really understand its meaning. But as I drove through a ghost town (meaning deserted, not haunted) heading towards a friends' place, I realized how deep this song is. It's really cool hearing this in the backround and looking around deserted areas, making you imagine the poison of the city life that once was there. <br /> <br />14. Aerials (3/5) & Hidden Track (5/5): Aerials is an OK song. I don't truly understand it, but it's great to listen to. The best part of it, however, is how it leads onto the hidden track, one that is one of the best SOAD songs I've listened to. Lyricless, it features what may be an Armenian-style music, with the chanting, the wind instrument, and the beating of the drums. It shows how the members of System of a Down still hold onto their culture's roots.
0393325172|2.0|Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian. Not recommended.<br /><br />Master and Commander is the first in a series of Jack Aubrey/Stephen Maturin novels, this one set in the early 1800s. After meeting Dr. Maturin at a concert by annoying him, Aubrey learns he has been promoted to master and commander (with honorary title of captain) of His Majesty's sloop Sophie. How Aubrey earned this promotion is unclear, as his womanising ways seems to have irritated his commandant and everyone else, although women seem to have played a role in obtaining it.<br /><br />There are several problems with Master and Commander. The first is O'Brian's fixation on his knowledge of sailing and sailing terminology. At one point, he spends pages having a crew member explaining the rigging in painstaking-and painful-detail to Dr. Maturin. There is little purpose to this, as most laymen will find it difficult and tedious to follow, and a knowledgeable person will want to skip it altogether. It adds nothing but volume to the book and proof that O'Brian did his research.<br /><br />O'Brian provides no historical context for the story. England is at war with France and Spain, but even Bonaparte is rarely mentioned. The characters reference naval actions like the battle of the Nile, but these incidents have meaning only to the characters since the reader is never privy to the context or greater strategy.<br /><br />While Aubrey, Dr. Maturin, James Dillon, and the master are interesting characters, most of the rest of the crew is intentionally faceless. The men in key positions, like the bosun, are rarely referred to by name. Even Marshall is known primarily as \\"the master,\\" making the attempt to give him a personality by alluding to him as an apprehensive pederast futile.<br /><br />There is neither much story nor much action here. It takes the first quarter of the novel for Sophie to leave port for the first time under Aubrey's command. The novel's big battle, during which Sophie miraculously defeats a bigger, better-manned ship, is so hurried and poorly recounted that there is no tension or suspense about how the encounter will play out or end. The victory evokes no sense of exhilaration in the reader, so the ensuing letdown (no promotions, no cruise) loses its emotional impact.<br /><br />Even the most intriguing aspect of the novel, the relationships between Aubrey and Dillon, Dillon and Dr. Maturin, and Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, are poorly drawn, partially because the point of view is inconsistent. As a clinician and researcher, Dr. Maturin is the relatively objective observer and link between Aubrey and Dillon. He knows Dillon's secrets (as well as his own) and the thoughtless bias behind Aubrey's anti-Papist rants, but is reduced to expressing his thoughts and feelings of affection, frustration and disgust mainly to his journal, as though he were documenting an illness.<br /><br />Master and Commander has tremendous potential, but O'Brian doesn't have the literary skills or ability to craft a great read. His prose is ordinary at best, and history, drama, suspense, plot, and even characterisation are given short shrift. For more compelling naval adventures set during the same period, read the Horatio Hornblower series, which is much better conceived and written and which is far more evocative.<br /><br />Note: The colours of the movie tie-in edition cover are pastel blue and yellow-a very odd choice, given the subject matter and target audience.<br /><br />Diane L.

B0000TB01Y|4.0|The recording of \\"Wicked\\" is highly enjoyable in spite of a mostly unexceptional score.  Clearly the strength of the album lies in the vocal performances of Kristin Chenoweth and, in particular, Idina Menzel.  Menzel, who carries the bulk of the best numbers, is a total powerhouse here. Her voice is incredibly exciting, whether she's going for quiet poignancy (\\"I'm Not That Girl\\") or thunderous thrills (\\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"No Good Deed\\").  Her voice really has an edge that sets her apart from a lot of Broadway singers. She never seems to be trying too hard or straining for emotion-- she's just effortlessly talented. Chenoweth is also talented and a total joy to listen to, but unfortunately doesn't have enough to do on this album.  She's great with what she has, though.   <br /> <br />It's a huge benefit that the leading ladies are so good, because Stephen Schwartz's score is really uneven.  For each \\"Defying Gravity\\" or \\"No Good Deed,\\" you also get second-rate songs like \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and \\"What is This Feeling?\\" that just feel shoddy.  A lot of the score has a a pop sound that, while easily digestible, is also a bit corny (even my favorite song, \\"Defying Gravity\\" is a power ballad at heart). Still, I'll admit that after repeat listening, even the lesser songs have gotten easier to take, especially when Menzel and Chenoweth are singing. They make this album worth coming back to, and over time, I'm surprised at how much I've listened to it. The vocals are too good to make \\"Wicked\\" a true guilty pleasure, but it comes pretty close.

B0000025DV|5.0|Amazon.com's review, in which one is advised to eschew the power cello riffs and go with a greatest hits album, must have been written by someone whose only experience with music is with mp3's.  This album is greater than the sum of its parts -- but you have to listen to it in its entirety (and, of course, in order).  It's an experience not to be missed.

B00005JKG9|5.0|David Mamet's Pulitzer-winning play has been transferred to the screen in a deliberately, \\"rainy night noir\\", 1950es style, ala \\"12 Angry Men\\": almost all the action takes place either in the office or in a bar across the street. <br />The story is simple and almost secondary: a group of real estate salesmen in a seedy office get told in no uncertain terms to shape up, sales-wise, or ship out. Desperation, crime, and infighting ensue. <br />What makes this film a masterpiece is: language and acting. <br />Mamet's flood of talk, filled with blistering profanity, odd rhythms, and harsh humor, is a dream for an actor, and the cast in GGH is one of the best ever.  <br /> <br />When Alec Baldwin, sent from the corporate office to \\"motivate\\" the weary troops, starts his 15-minute monologue to them, you are just blown off your seat. His hate-filled, arrogant, belittling verbal whipping is simply one of the most amazing scenes in film. (Baldwin to Ed Harris's Moss: 'You see this watch? This watch costs more than your car.') You get the idea. <br /> <br />Spacey as the cold office manager, Pacino as slick top-seller Roma, Harris as the angry lout, and Arkin as the befuddled ner-do-well all turn in magnificent work that intermeshes beautifully. However, in a career of some amazing films, Jack Lemmon, as has-been top dog Shelley 'The Machine' Levine who is now broke, delivers what I think is the performance of his life. <br /> <br />Lemmon's mannerisms fit Shelley to a tee: an older, desperate man at the mercy of something he can't sell, and with a daughter in the hospital, he is at the end of his rope. His scenes are at times almost unbearable to watch: his pleading with a cold, cynical Williamson (Spacey), his being put out in the rain by a prospect who doesn't want to buy. You are seeing a man going down, and Lemmon hits every nuance just right. <br /> <br />So then, a fairly stage-bound story about human failure and what we do to each other. It should, by that description,be dull and depressing.It is in fact mesmerizing from the first scene, and it is a film you will never forget. <br /> <br />Get the 10th Anniversary set, to get the widescreen version. Technical quality of the transfer is superb.

I understand the love and the bond but, I just don't like the sneakiness.  Good book, nice warm touchy feely, and I do read it to my son.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|I watched this movie and I have also seen \\"Thunderball\\", of which this is a remake and I must say I prefer this one by far. <br /> <br />- Maximilian Largo is much better in this one than in \\"Thunderball\\", he actually looks like a real criminal mastermind rather than an Austin Powers caricature <br />- The chicks are at least as good, especially Bond's beautiful and dangerous lady opponent <br />- It doesn't feature the lenghty and boring underwater scenes + the disturbing shrill screaching and painful sound effects of Thunderball <br />- The technical equipment is more up-to-date and believable than in Thunderball, I actually liked the video game that gives you electric shocks, great idea <br />- The locations are beautiful, not half of the time filmed in semi-darkness where you can hardly see anything, as is the case in Thunderball <br />- Fast paced action and plenty of humour, especially in the first half of the film <br /> <br />The only real point of criticism I have is that the end is too drawn out and the actors appear a bit unmotivated towards the end. All in all a great Bond movie and I must say, my favourite of all the Connery Bonds. I know this is sure to be an unpopular opinion here, but the 1960s Bonds all appear either technically flawed, everything has a movie set plastic look, or they are ordinary spy movies without the typical Bond extras.

I hate to say that about only one of their albums. If you havent listened to tool ever before than this is the one i reccomend you start with. If you have listened to tool before but arent familiar with this album than this is only another must get from them.

B00064MW6A|3.0|\\"Catwoman\\", starring Halle Berry, is one of those movies that has an undeserved reputation for being one of the worst films ever. While it certainly has its problems and could've easily been called something else so it wouldn't look like it was trying to make money off a popular comic book character while changing everything about said character besides the instantly recognizable alias, it really isn't as bad as its reputation claims. At least that is my humble opinion. <br /> <br />\\"Catwoman\\" tells the story of Patience Phillips, a graphics designer in a boring dead end job for the Hedare co-operation, a beauty products company. Her obvious talents are wasted and un-appreciated and she is treated awfully by her stone heart boss. It is only when Patience is murdered and is brought back to life by a magical Egyptian Mao cat that she starts to fight back, righting wrongs and standing up for herself. Guided by the mysterious Ophelia Powers, Patience becomes Catwoman and begins her quest for justice, at the same time dealing with cop boyfriend Tom Lone who is busy hunting down Catwoman. <br /> <br />There are two main problems with \\"Catwoman\\". One is the direction. The camera angles are all over the place, never staying still for a moment. The director, Pitof, acts like a child trying to show off what they can do and it is irritating and distracting. I believe that with normal direction this movie would be far more enjoyable but here the angles chop and change so much it can literally make one feel dizzy, and it is IMPOSSIBLE to tell what is going on in the action sequences. Also colours that are clearly supposed to be bright and vibrant look washed out and pale, especially during one scene at a fairground. The editing is poor; too, it looks as though the film was majorly hacked into what is apparently the final cut that appears on this DVD.  <br /> <br />The second problem is the script. I won't deny that this movie is badly written. The script comes across as very amateur like with many cringe-worthy pieces of dialogue and silly cat related puns. It feels like it was written with little effort or care and it's sad because, with a good script I feel this could've been a much better movie even with the changes made to it's title heroine. I just find it hard to believe that THIS was the best the could come up with. <br /> <br />Yet, thank fully, it still managed to entertain me. I liked it enough to buy the DVD and I don't regret my purchase. The cast help to make the film enjoyable. Halle Berry is fine as Patience Phillips and I feel her \\"worst actress\\" Razzie award was undeserved. She is confident and comfortable, clearly having a lot of fun with the role and is a joy to watch. Benjamin Bratt is good enough as the standard love interest and has nice chemistry with Berry. Sharon Stone could've been great as Laurel Hedare but was let down by a poor script - her character makes for a lame villain and I never felt any real sense of danger from her. Lambert Wilson isn't much better as George Hedare but I did find myself hating him so I guess he did an okay job. The most annoying member of the cast is Alex Borstein, who's character Sally is given far too much screen time, and dialogue that is clearly supposed to be funny but isn't. Luckily Frances Conroy as Ophelia Powers puts in a great performance and helps to save what could've been an over-all bad cast. <br /> <br />My over-all thoughts on \\"Catwoman\\" is that it is an enjoyable movie. I do like the Batman comic books, I'm not a fanatic but I collect issues that interest me and I am a big fan of the Selina Kyle character as she is shown in Batman Returns but I went into this movie with an open mind and found that I was able to appreciate the effort. It's a fun, cute movie where you don't have to think too much. Perfect for watching with a big bowl of popcorn and a group of friends. I recommend it. <br />
B0001BKAEY|3.0|If you've watched the First Maxtrix then you thought it was pretty cool and the most orignal thing you've seen since Anime was ever created. If you've seen the Maxtrix: Reloaded, then you'd think it like any other II sequel; lots of action, not plot at all, and had more meaningless dialouge than before (Take Terminator III). That said Matrix Revolutions loses sight of what made the \\"first\\" maxtrix great and turns out to be just another End of the world by the hands of Machines movie with the maxtrix and all its charactes slapped into it. The movie begins where it had left off, Neo is trapped between the Maxtrix and the real world and the his friends have to go and rescue him but they have to get past the Merovingian and his lackys to do this. Once they do all hell breaks loose and the machines invade Zion. The \\"long awaited fight\\" between Neo and Smith is a blanant rip off of Dragon Ball Z and is so CGI animated you will find youself skipping to a good part, but there are none (bullet time isn't cool anymore). All in all the two brothers of this \\"trillogy\\" killed what people loved about the Maxtrix and waited too long to make sequels. The characters are out of character and Carie Ann moss is so old she looks manish, Keanu Reeves has a receeding hair line, and Larunance Fishburne has gained weight. The best thing for you do is skip this movie and stick to the first Maxtrix. Its not very good. [a 3 out of 5]
B00007KWHG|5.0|From September of 1962 to February of 1964, no group was bigger than Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. With their fine harmonies and good looks, they were certainly the American equivelant of The Beatles, and even after The Beatles overpowered them, they still managed to crank out hit after hit, even scoring two huge smashes in the mid 1970s'.<br /><br />\\"The Very Best Of Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons\\" collects 20 of the groups biggest hits, including \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\", \\"Sherry\\", \\"Rag Doll\\", \\"Dawn (Go Away)\\", \\"Let's Hang On\\" and \\"December 1963 (Oh What A Night)\\". All of these songs have been remstered the finest possible sound that can be achieved in today's modern world. Just listen to how fresh and vibrant Frankie Valli's world - renowned falsetto sounds. I mean, you can't believe some of this stuff is 40 years old.<br /><br />There are a few songs that I wish were included that would elevate this from an ordinary 5 - star album to perfection. For starters, they left one top 10 hit, 1967's \\"Tell It To The Rain\\", which at one point was my all time favorite Four Seasons song (currently it's \\"Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)). Also, there are a few covers of other people's songs (\\"Stay\\", \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\", Bob Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice\\" (recorded under the name the Wonder Who)) that I would have loved to be kept. And last but not least, the 1967 top 20 hit \\"Beggin'\\" could've been included.<br /><br />Other than thse minor omissions, this is an excellent cd. The booklet features a great essay by Pat Sierchio as well as numerous photos and information on each track (writers, release dates, albums, chart positions). Truly a great collection.
B000056H24|3.0|George Stevens has produced a sumptuous, heroic life of Christ for the big screen, but he takes too many liberties with Jesus' words, inserting statements like \\"salvation comes by faith alone\\" into His mouth.  Of course Christ never said any such thing.  In fact the only place in Scripture where the words \\"faith alone\\" occur is in James 2 and there only to *reject* the notion that man is saved by faith alone.  Viewers seeking a more faithful depiction of the life of Christ are better off with \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\".<br /><br />Side bar:  The then-unknown Max Van Sydow plays a short-haired, pencil-thin-mustached Jesus.  Festoon him with a beret, and he'd look like a saxophonist in a jazz quintet.  The first thing my nine-year-old said during the opening scene was \\"Whoa! He's got real-l-l-ly short hair!\\"<br /><br />Side bar 2: And why does Jesus never smile in this movie?  I can't recall seeing so much as a grin in a single frame.
0060920432|5.0|Both in terms of structure and content, this book scores very high. It is very well organized, lucid & full of interesting anecdotes. It does not get into unnecessary academic details about psychology, though it explains every aspect of each experience in thorough detail.<br /><br />The topic itself is quite complex & inherently interesting & the skilful handling of the subject means that at no point the reader is bogged down by details she does not understand. The author gives a detailed breakdown of the characteristics of the optimal experience going on to elaborate on how such an experience can be lived in our relationships, work, leisure & the like.<br /><br />The author does point out that this is not meant to be a self help book; however, my feeling is that it could, most definitely, be used as one because given the detailed explanations of each aspect of the optimal experience & various anecdotal examples, there remains only a matter of personalization in terms of which actions or activities for each one of us individually would lead to this optimal experience. There are odd flashes of humour; though, I feel, these could have been more frequent.<br /><br />All in all, to borrow from sensationalist terminology, this one is unputdownable.<br /><br />S!

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Before you read my review, know that the individual from ontario who gave this movie 2 stars probably has never even seen the movie, and of course, has not seen the directors cut. This is a movie which will leave you questioning what it is you just saw. You'll want to watch again as soon as its over. The Directors cut also fills in many of the holes left by the original, as well as change the feel of nearly ever character, Frank being the most important. He is no longer the 'satanic bunny' but rather a messenger from God. So in short, watch this movie, and be blown away!
B00006D295|5.0|Well, here you have it, people. The greatest cult phenomenon of all time, a film that will shock you and surprise you, a film you will never forget as long as you live - \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\".<br /><br />When this silver screen classic was released in 1975 after being performed onstage in London and New York, it was a big flop. However, the film slowly gained popularity when some local New York movie theaters started showing it at mdinight, and the reaction was wild. Audiences brought their own props, they came to the theaters dressed as their favorite characters, and even made up their own dialogue for the film and shout it at the screen.<br /><br />Now, 30 years later, you can experience this timeless filmon dvd. Digitally remastered by the good people at Fox, you can now experience it all over again. Some people may call this film tacky and even offensive, but don't judge a book by its cover until you look athese features:<br /><br />See! The huge stars in this film before they were famous. Susan Sarandon (as Janet), Barry Bostwick (as Brad), Meatloaf (as Eddie) and, of course, Tim Curry (as transvestite Dr. Frank - N -Furter) lead the pack of a talented bunch of actors in this inspired combination of comedy, musical and science - fiction.<br /><br />Hear! The classic songs that are mong the best in musical history. Get ready to do dance \\"Time Warp\\", bop to Meatloaf's \\"Hot Patootie\\" and be \\"touch - a, touch - a, touched\\" by the sweet romantacism of \\"Dammit! Janet\\".<br /><br />And last but not least, gawk at the outrageous taboos that were still unheard of in movies from 1975, including homosexuality, lesbianism, tranvestism, nudity, violence and sex. Best not to watch it with kids under 12.<br /><br />This dvd also comes with intriguing special features. You can watch the film in two different versions, the U.S. and U.K. version (the U.K. version has an alternate ending), audio commentary by cast members Richard O'Brien (who wrote the play) and Patricia Quinn (who played Magenta, the sister of O'Brien's sinister Riff Raff). You can also watch the film with the audience participation. It's as if you were in the theater! PLus, there's much more.<br /><br />Basically, what I'm saying is to pick up this dvd.

B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is by far my favorite Blink 182 CD. It features memorable songs such as \\"Dumpweed\\", \\"Don't Leave Me\\", \\"Dysentery Gary\\" and the powerful \\"Adam's Song\\". The topics of the songs are things that you will relate to at different times in your life. At one point in time a song on this CD may make you cry, while at other times it will be just another Blink 182 song. Songs on many of Blink's CDs are like that. Songs by The Offspring tend to be the same way. Is this CD better than Dude Ranch? Well, really it is a toss up. Personally I think that Enema of The State is a little bit better, but Dude Ranch still kicks ass. I strongly reccomend picking this one up. It is better than their more recent releases (the new self-titled one and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket). It is such a shame that they broke up. Also consider buying a copy of Dude Ranch along with Enema of The State.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, tells the story of a young child named Ender Wiggin, a young boy who is sent to Battle School (where boys are taught the basics of being a space commander) at the age of six.  In the novel, Earth is united against a race of mysterious aliens called Buggers who invaded our solar system 50 years prior.  Though Ender's Game has the makings of a science fiction story, it is science fiction for people who don't like science fiction.  The heart of the book lies not in lasers or aliens, but in the development of Ender Wiggin and his crew, and ultimately raises the question of how much humanity is worth sacrificing towards victory, and is it the government or the individual who should make that choice.  I feel that Card effectively conveys these themes and found it very compelling work. <br /> <br />The focus of Ender's Game is the emotional development of Ender.  Throughout the book, Ender is given challenges of ever-increasing difficulty, and then reflects upon what he had to do to overcome them..  For example, in a computer training game, he needed to bypass a giant.  After dying numerous times, he accidentally kills it.  Though he \\"should\\" feel excited about this development, he becomes depressed, thinking, \\"he hadn't meant to kill the giant.  This was supposed to be a game.  Not a choice between his own grisly death and an even worse murder.\\"  After this event, the image of the dead giant haunts Ender both in and out of the game, reminding him of his guilt.  Though this was just a game, the reader is forced to ponder what Ender would do if finds himself in the position of Commander and is forced to kill in reality. <br /> <br />The second theme raised in Ender's Game is that of choices.  It explores whether the government should exploit individuals for the common good, or should that choice be left up to the individual.  In Ender's Game, the government takes the first view.  It feels that nearly any repression of rights is acceptablefor the common good.  For example, when Ender leaves for Battle School, he wants to say goodbye to Valentine through the new cameras documenting the flight.  However, \\"he didn't know that [saying goodbye to Valentine] would be censored out of the tape if he did, for the boys soaring out to Battle School were all supposed to be heroes.\\"  The government doesn't end there.  Once Ender gets to Battle School, the instructors use nearly everything in their disposal to make Ender's life a living Hell, all in the name of preparing him for battle.  They push him harder and harder until he snaps, \\"Ender laughed.  It was funny.  The adults taking all this so seriously, and the children playing along, playing along, believing it too until suddenly the adults went too far, tried too hard, and the children could see through their game.\\"   <br /> <br />Despite Ender's Game's qualities, it does have two failings I feel should be brought up.  The first is that it falls victim the classic clich that the heroes always prosper.  No matter what challenge Ender faces, no matter what the odds, it always seems that he will be victorious.  By the end of the book, this theme is so recurring that it becomes distracting.  However, even this clich isn't entirely trite.  At the beginning of the book, Major Graff says to Ender, \\"Maybe you'll break down under the pressure, maybe it'll ruin your life, maybe you'll hate me for coming to your house today.\\"  This question haunts the reader throughout the rest of the novel.  Though Ender may succeed at the challenges he is faced with, the nature of the book forces the reader to wonder if he is succeeding at his own life, or is it being ruined by the pressure his training exerts on him.  The second failing is the execution of Peter and Valentine's side-story.  Though Peter and Valentine are effective characters in the book, their involvement is Earth politics were distracting from the novel as a whole, and would be more effective in a separate book. <br /> <br />Altogether, Ender's Game is an incredibly effective piece of writing that explores sacrifice and government control.  Though it is not flawless, its failings can be overlooked in light of its success as a science fiction novel that doesn't feel like one.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a book about what will come when one is pressed to their limits for too long.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|TMV's first full-length album was the highlight of my musical diet last year. It was a surprising fusion of rock, jazz, and seemingly random improvisational sections - the latter of which is exactly the sort of thing I can't stomach.<br /><br />The reason it worked for me is simply this - if you placed your trust in TMV and went along for the ride, they would invariably come back down to Earth and barrel into the rest of the song as if they had never left. Aurally it left the feeling that 'Comatorium's sonic assault was something to be experienced in waves, thus preventing the monotony of most aggressive rock music. Thematically, these shifts fit very well with the story of a man seeking self destruction, and served to hold the album together as a single statement.<br /><br />'Frances's story is ostensibly that of a man looking for his mother, pieced together from entries in a found diary. You'd expect an album based on such a story to be pretty disjointed, uneven affair. You'd be right. The album's twelve tracks together make up five \\"songs\\". The first four are very concise - well, concise for TMV anyway. The ebb and flow that made 'Comatorium' such a compelling listen is here in full force. 'L'Via L'Viaquez' stands out with its easy effortless segues from thunderous funk rock to a languid salsa-inflected dirge. 'Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore', by comparison, is a sparsely populated eerie soundscape that conveys perfectly the song's intended themes of sorrow, despair, and paranoia. There's even an easy single, the rigidly pop-formatted 'The Widow', whose brevity is its only real downfall.<br /><br />There are a few uneven moments in this area of the album - call them experiments that don't work, like 'The Widow's two minute coda of mindless beeping that doesn't go anywhere - but that's to be expected with an adventurous group such as TMV. And in the end, such moments pass quickly as you move on to the next killer track.<br /><br />But then there's thatfinal \\"song\\" - a 30 minute free for all called 'Cassandra Geminni', in which the band goes so far afield they forget where they're going. It's listenable, but - unlike the rest of the album - not comprehensible. At least, not in this format. As a live opus, or its own EP, 'Cassandra' may well prove to have a life of its own. But as a final track to the album it's simply too much, too big, too epic, too absorbed with itself to fit in with the rest of the group, all to the song's (and the album's) detriment. In the end, the sheer size and breadth of the final cut dwarfs the coherent unit formed by the first half of the disc, breaking the spell and leaving me feeling like I've been ditched in the outer rings to hitch my own way back.<br /><br />As with 'Comatorium', your enjoyment of 'Frances the Mute' will depend entirely on your ability to trust that The Mars Volta will take you on a long journey and get you back in one piece. This time around, however, I found it to be a tougher sell.
B00004WKII|5.0|Wildly inventive, exotic, and raw are the closest words I can find to explain this monumental box set. This is one of the best compilations of Hendrix that I have come across. It is not something you can just listen to, but rather something you must experience for yourself. <br />      Although some songs such as Crosstown Traffic are found missing from this spectacular line-up, it includes several stunning versions of such classics as Little Wing, Red House, Voodoo Chile, and some less familiar songs for the folks who are looking to experience Hendrix for the first time; in particular Catfish Blues, Earth Blues, and Country Blues and who can forgett Jimi's infamous Star Spangled Banner which is the only way to properly rock out to our national anthem. <br />      From inexperienced curiosity to die-hard fanatic, this box set will open up a veritable cornucopia of unreleased recordings and songs to free your mind of rigid structures that music is often comprised of. Smashing blues, R&B, straight rock, and even a little bit of country together into this fantastic array of artistic talent satiates even the most scrutinizing critic's appetite for pure, unbridled talent.
B000002KBD|5.0|Van was \\"perfect\\" on this album...song writing, voice, arrangements...all perfect.  Happy and fun times were abounding and Van captured the moments.  There are \\"whistleable\\" tunes juxtaposed to tender balladlike songs that are compiled nicely.  An easy choice, \\"Street Choir\\" is one of my favorite all time albums  that I would want with me if I were stranded on an island.  Listen to it over and over!  I love it so much I named my only son, \\"Van\\"!
B00005JLEX|4.0|Back in the summer of 1990 a little show aired during the summer entitled THE SEINFELD CHRONICLES. For a summer filler show, it did alright in the ratings and was eventually picked up for a full half season. Eventually the name was shorten to simply SEINFELD and thus began one of the funniest and most inventive comedies of the last quarter of the twentieth-century. The elite and the ignorant alike refer to SEINFELD as being the first television show about nothing. Well, SEINFELD really is about something--it's about everyday life. In some ways, because of how personal Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld made the series, it is in some ways one of the most realistic comedies about life every produced.  The show was and always will be pure genius.<br /><br />Volume 1 off the SEINFELD series offers the 1st and 2nd season of the show.  Including the pilot episode, the 1st season only included 5 episodes. However, even in a few of these early episodes, the genius of the show can be seen. In \\"The Stake Out\\" George makes the first reference to his dream of being an architect and in \\"The Robbery\\" Kramer makes his first big impression when he leaves Jerry's apartment door open while Jerry is on a trip and is robbed.<br /><br />The 2nd season includes 13 episodes--a full half-season. In \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" Jerry, George, and Elaine spend thirty minutes waiting for a table at a Chinese Restaurant (this is the show the coined the series as being a show \\"about nothing\\"). In \\"The Phone Message\\" George begins to truly blossom as he leaves a series of nasty phone messages on his new girlfriend's machine because she hasn't returned his calls, only to discover that she has been out of town. In \\"The Statue\\" Kramer truly comes into his own as he steals back a statue that a cleaning guy stole from his apartment.  In \\"The Revenge\\" George is fired for the first time and decides to take revenge on his former employer, while Jerry & Kramer plan to get revenge on the laundry guy for stealing some money.  The volume is closed out by \\"The Deal\\"--an episode that was originally intended to be the final show in the series.<br /><br />The DVDs include a plethora of extras. Each disc includes 1 or 2 audio commentaries. These are entitled Yada, Yada, Yada. Unfortunately, I found most of these commentaries rather boring. They don't provide any real new information or insight about the series and really serve as filler and not much more.<br /><br />Each episode can be played with a feature called Notes About Nothing. This is kind of like a pop-up video feature that pops up various information about the episode throughout he viewing. There's a ton of info there, but at times it's hard to keep up and is almost too much.<br /><br />About half of all the episodes feature Inside Looks. These are a series of interviews with the cast & crew about a particular episode. I enjoyed these the most of all the extras because they are short and informative.<br /><br />Other extras include a special introductions to \\"The Stake Out\\" and \\"The Stranded\\", deleted scenes, special Stand-Up material, bloopers, photo galleries, NBC promos & trailers, a few selected spots from \\"The Tonight Show\\", and a documentary entitled \\"How It Began.\\"  Outside of the Inside Looks, I found the documentary and \\"The Tonight Show\\" segments to be the best extra features in this set.<br /><br />Volume 1 of SEINFELD might not be the best episodes of the series, but it is where & how the show began. A great item for any SEINFELD fan or anyone else who wants to see the origins of some classic modern tv.ing some money.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Alright, i never really listened to Green Day before and I only knew like one of their songs, which i didnt even know was their song till i looked it up. Then when i was on my friends website i was listening to the backround music, which was Boulevard of Broken dreams, one of the songs on American Idiot. I really liked it so i decided to find out what it was becaus ei had never heard it before, so i did and downloaded it. then about a week later i saw the American Idiot music video on my other friends site, and loved it. so i went out and bought the album. and now, im completely OBSESSED with it. its the only CD ive listened to, where all the songs are good and i dont skip over a track because i dont like it. this CD also gave me the idea to listen to their older albums like \\"dookie\\" and \\"warning\\" and i like alot of songs on there too. so if you havent bought this album yet, BUY IT!!!
0064407667|5.0|Don't believe a thing Lemony Snicket says - the only way these books of woe will have you crying is if you laugh really, really hard. <br /> <br />Lemony Snicket has a fresh, unique, and hilarious writing style. He speaks very plainly, explaining things along the way with his signature phrase, \\"a word which here means\\". Always he reminds his readers that they do not have to read these awful books that will only bring nights of wailing and weeping, although he has sworn to record them. Sometimes Snicket is deliciously non-sequitur - \\"...you would run much slower if you were dragging something behind you, like a knapsack or a sheriff\\". And each book is morbidly dedicated to a so far unknown woman named Beatrice. \\"Beatrice - Darling, dearest, dead.\\" <br /> <br />Although the books are sold as children's books (or perhaps because of it), I would recommend these books to adults who are secure enough in their maturity to read them. Some of the humor might actually be hard for young children to understand unless they are great cynics already. <br /> <br />The basic plot of the story is this: three siblings - Violet, Claus, and Sunny Baudelaire - lose their parents in a fire. They are sent off to live with their \\"uncle\\", Count Olaf. Olaf is a horrible, detestable man who will do anything, however evil and dishonorable, to get his hands on the fortune that the Baudelaires will inherit as soon as Violet is of age. The Baudelaires find themselves in frustratingly hopeless and distressing situations, mostly because of the (oh, so aggravating!) thickheadedness of the adults around them. So using their special skills, Violet, Claus, and Sunny try and find solutions themselves - by inventing, researching, and biting things, respectively. They wriggle out of immediate danger, but there is never exactly a happy ending - instead, one that is relieved but forebodes more calamity. <br /> <br />The plot seems very repetitive through the fourth book - the Baudelaires live with various guardians and end up in equally desperate situations with Olaf on their tail. But don't be discouraged! By the fifth book, a larger picture begins to show. A whole mystery opens up - the VFD. What caused the fire which in which the Baudelaires' parents perished? Why are do all their guardians have so much in common? I won't give anything away, but the mystery builds through the rest of the books. The reader picks up little clues and tries to piece things together. The final two books have not been written yet, so don't expect a complete answer soon. <br /> <br />There are eleven books, but they are relatively small and quick reads. When you get through them, read The Unauthorized Autobiography. Snicket himself is an obscure sort of character in his books - he hasn't participated in any action yet, but it seems that he may have to soon. The Authobiography gives loads of tantalizing information (or just more questions) about the VFD. <br /> <br />In summary, The Series of Unfortunate Events is a hilarious, well-written action-and-mystery story, and just as suitable for brave adults as for children.
B000007MVU|4.0|Ringo and Harry (Nilsson) did it long before Rod Stewart's \\"Great American Songbook\\" collection.  A great song is just that!  It lives and thrives as it passes from generation to generation.  Call it tradition, call it historic, I call it pure fun even with the archaic electronics which adds to the album's \\"dated\\" quality.  My mother, God bless her curly permed head, turned me on to some great music!  (She would buy the records after I would whine about 'needing' to hear something/anything)  This record was easy to get her to buy because of the song selections.  It certainly remains a \\"Sentimental Journey\\".  It was and is a moment in time...the Beatles were passing into the future, Ringo took a look back before moving forward.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|Well I was hooked from the first note on this energetic and talented composition. From my perspective Mars Volta is the second coming of 'Yes', with the Buena Vista Social Club actively trying to break into the line up. Then, half way through Frances the Mute, it seems Pink Floyd takes over (sounding a lot like Meddle - Echoes) backed up by John Coltrane.   My one piece of advice to the band would be, when it comes to special effects, less is more. But Frances the Mute is definitely one of the more interesting CDs you will hear this year or any year. So for less than then $10.00, buy it!
0156027321|5.0|This book was a wonderful read. It has deep themes, and Martel's storytelling prose makes the story believable. I truly enjoyed this work, partly because it provokes me to think deeply, and partly because the wording is so fluid. Recommended!
B000001FI7|5.0|Dummy is a ground-breaking album that influenced alot of bands. They are one of the best bands that came out of the '90s together with fellow-triphoppers Massive Attack and (surprise, surprise) Radiohead. How many bands can build up a legendary name with only 2 albums (+ a live-album)? Not many indeed..  Every Triphop-fanatic should own this, it's one of the essential trip-hop albums.   Besides the well-known excellent singles 'Numb', 'Sour Times' and 'Glory Box' (wich are all 3 nearly perfect) this CD contains many others high-lights. The opener 'Mysterons' is smooth and relaxing, while the heavy bass of 'Strangers' gives me shivers in my spine. The mellow, and ever beautiful 'Roads', the favourite of many fans, always works with me. Many fans would want it to have been a single, but being not a single makes it even more special in my opinion. 'Pedestal' is another one of my favourites, and so very underrated. This track chills you the most, it's so damn relaxing. The quite agressive, and quite up-beat 'Wandering Star' is another high-light. 'Biscuit', 'It's A Fire' and 'It Could Be Sweet' are the lesser tracks (Biscuit being the better one between those 3) and can't reache the perfect level of the CD, but good nonetheless. Highly recommended!
B000063DFQ|5.0|for some reason, I never really acknowledge iron maiden as a cornerstone of metal, but with any close listen you realize iron maiden play metal like its the only thing they were put on earth to do, and you can tell they have so much fun doing it... its very inspiring. aside from powerslave this is probably my favorite maiden album... there isnt really a weak spot on here, and this is were some of their best melodic leads came into play.  <br /> <br />this was the first iron maiden album where other band members besides steve harris put their input into the songwriting, and it totally pays off. there is honestly not any filler on here, which is more than I could say for somewhere in time, or dance of death even though they have great songs...  <br /> <br />this album just kicks so much ass, its a blast to listen to, but there is also real emotion coursing through piece of minds viens, there are some solos that will bring you to tears and force your hands into permanent metal devil horns! I dont know about that, but I can say with a clear concious that they never matched the lead melodies on this album... everything is top notch. <br /> <br />this makes a great intro to iron maiden, or just a really bad assed addition to any cd collection. I cant say enough good things about this album.
0385510454|2.0|Several of our most readable authors are not working very hard any more.  I would mention DeMille, Grisham, and Harris (he of the abominable HANNIBAL) as three of them.  It would seem they have contracts to fill, and fill them they do, but the quality of the work deteriorates with each try.  Grisham relies on his tried-and-true technique of having his characters do the same things except in different locations over and over again.  It's not too exciting but it does manage to stretch this short story to book length. <br />

B000002TQV|5.0|This is good old Radiohead playing good old rock. The Bends is not as complex as Ok Computer, not as experimental as Kid A/Amnesiac and not as balanced as Hail To The Thief, but it sure is beautiful, musically and lyrically. Although I prefer their newer stuff (excluding HTTT), this didn't fail to impress me.   'Planet Telex' starts the album with a nice soundscape before it actually starts, a nice start for the album. 'The Bends' and 'Just' are the most exiting tracks on the album, an energy-explosion. But for the most part you get extremely beautiful songs: 'High & Dry' (my personal favourite and one of Radiohead's best songs), the all familiar 'Street Spirit (Fade Out)' wich didn't lose anything of it's beauty after all those years and being overplayed, 'Fake Plastic Trees' (one of Radiohead's most emotional tracks). Some lesser known equally beautiful tracks are 'Nice Dream' and 'BulleT Proof..I Wish I Was' with their only problem being a bit forgettable. 'Black Star' and 'Sulk' are again great. The only weaker spot on the album is 'Bones' but it doesn't ruin the CD at all, it's just a little bit forgettable. Beginning Radiohead-fans should start here or with OK Computer..
0312330529|5.0|I grew up in Bombay in the 80s and 90s and now live in Australia.  This book took me back to my youth in Bombay.  I can see how an Australian would have felt about Bombay in those times. <br /> <br />This is an epic thriller- one of the best books I have ever read, reminded me of Papillion and O'Calcutta.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I was shocked to read the negative reviews. Then again, I probably shouldn't be. Ask an old person what their life was all about, and they will likely share in some of Kane's heartache - the struggle to find intimacy and purpose and happiness. The negative reviews likely reflect either a dislike of the cinematic medium or the banal shallowness of popular culture, an intemperance for thought and sobriety. I suspect that those who don't like the movie have shut down the ability to reflect meaningfully on life or are too young to appreciate it... Older people generally know better - everyone has a Rosebud...
B00008S2VG|2.0|And who cares if madonna isn't getting played on the radio any more. She's unfortunately kind of old looking. But at least she's trying. Gotta give her credit for that. <br /> <br />Everything seems to come so easily for Britney Spears...every song she puts out is a radio smash...and that's not fair.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Everyone that had even a little musical taste recommended me this album, saying this is Radiohead's best release. I didn't believe it at first,because what I heard from the album didn't impress me. So I bought their others first, starting with Amnesiac. After a while, when I had bought every album of Radiohead (excluding Pablo Huney) I bought Ok Computer. It didn't feel like I hit gold after the first listen. Yeah, it was better than I suspected, but nothing amazing.  <br />I listened to it frequently, and one by one, the tracks started to grow on me. I still don't feel like it's Radiohead's best album, but it truhly is a masterpiece.  <br />While some songs don't really do it for me ('Airbag' is a fine song, but nothing really amazing; the 2 last songs seem to lose my attention), others are truhly amazing: 'Let Down' always makes me crying, truhly beautiful; 'Electioneering' is a great straight-forward-rock-song that could have easily been standing on The Bends; 'Climbing On The Wall' is one of the best songs Radiohead ever made, it's down-beat, dark and moody and that's how I like 'm the most and 'No Surprises' is very familiar to Let Down (at least I think so). The fan's favourites 'Paranoid Android' and 'Karma Police' are not less amazing, but I don't consider them the very best of Radiohead (well, maybe Paranoid is but Karma Police is a bit overrated). Overall my 3rd favourite Radiohead-album, after Amnesiac and Kid A.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty<br /><br />A movie so compelling, so empowering , so inspiring that I could hardly believe what I saw. Just finished giving it my second watch.<br /><br />My first watch made this the best movie I had seen till that date.My second watch taught me there are two types of emotions attached to tears. I cried out of the third though.<br /><br />Thomas Newman's famous Plastic Bag Theme that plays its current of absolute enigmatic melody througout the film only adds to the overburdening significance of What I saw in this film.There are six main characters in this film. There are scenes when my brain waved an invisible white flag to what it saw.<br /><br />Chris Cooper (Ricky's dad) has done many movies before. I quite enjoyed the absolute rigidity of his character. Kevin Spacey is just so befitting in this ordinary man's role of his that I would think twice before doubting his contribution to the whole plot.<br /><br />The numer of times in this film that I felt this overwhelmed recreated feeling of absolute bliss is quite absurd.<br /><br />Its alarming how absolutely flawless and perfect this movie stands.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />If you have not seen this film , I don't believe your wasting your time reading this review of mine. I'm just a small chain to the process.There are some movies I feel that have impacting climaxes and some with solid concluding 20 mins.For American Beauty, the last two hours of the movie were the best.<br /><br />I bow my head in salute to the makers of this movie.American Beauty is not a movie.Its the most soul binding 120 mins ever displayed on screen.The movie pushes itself into a genre beyond our lives. Yet Within.

I visited Ireland many years ago, and this brought me \\"home.\\" If you enjoy beautiful music, take this to heart...do yourself a favor and buy both. The video adds so much...not only beautiful voices but beautiful ladies as well. Enjoy!

B000007WNN|5.0|First off, I have to say I 'grew up' on this album. I heard it first when I was still an impressionable teen and like a fine wine, it has aged well over time. Although I have always given props to The Cult in whatever incarnation they went through, this album, through and through, is just great. It's one of the most exciting, albeit mindless, rock albums you're likely to come across. You won't find any thought provoking lyrics or anything but Billy Duffy just drives it and Ian Astbury has never given more attitude to his vocals. If this is the only Cult album you bless your ears with, then turn on, turn up and enjoy.

B000002I8D|5.0|A strong blend of artsy experimentation (without being highbrow), sublime R&B pop, and smooth ballads makes Phil Collins' 1981 album Face Value a unique and cohesive musical experience.<br /><br />Phil Collins got his start behind the drum kit of the progressive rock band Genesis.  In 1975 lead singer Peter Gabriel left the band for a solo career and eventually Collins got the front man gig.  From that time on Collins grew as a singer and gifted composer.<br /><br />As a song writer Collins has a great talent for expressing his inner emotions quite clearly and without unnecessary flourishes- and Face Value more than any other project he did (either solo or with Genesis) seems to express a very personal statement with a wide spectrum of subjects and musical styles.<br /><br />Mixing between ballads and rhythmic anthems Collins shows all the sides of the man- his loves, fears, frustrations and joys.  With the ballads he has sometimes walked a pretty thin line between syrupy sentiment and deep tenderness; later in his career he totally surrendered to the syrupy side.  But on Face Value songs like This Must Be Love and If Leaving Me Is Easy show a genuine and mature emotion that shows a gutsy honesty. (In my opinion personal ballads like these are very hard to express because it usually comes off as phony sentimentality, emotionally manipulative or sappy and shallow.)<br /><br />Then you have the more gritty songs like the atmospheric In The Air Tonight (which still sounds fresh to me even though I've heard it hundreds of times) and The Roof is Leaking \\"trilogy\\" that starts with an eerie isolated sound and culminates in a joyous horn and rhythm experience.  Also I Missed Again is a great pop song.  His cover of The Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows seems a bit of an odd choice for him, but he pulls it off quite nicely and sums the tune and the album up with a distant sounding Somewhere Over The Rainbow; very fitting.<br /><br />Overall I think Face Value is one of those great records that came out when there was an extremely high level of creativity going on around the music biz so in the history books it doesn't necessarily shout out for recognition.  Phil Collins and Genesis were one of the most popular bands in the world at that time and Face Value showed why.  Although today it appears a bit pass&eacute; for some to admit that they like Phil Collins one can't deny his amazing talent or the contributions he made through his music.f those great records that came out when there was an extremely high level of creativity going on around the music biz so in the history books it doesn't necessarily shout out for recognition.

B0001Z2RUK|5.0|I think this is a great CD. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it. This album is a nice change from most modern pop/rock bands since this band is minus a guitar player. The band has a more delicate pop/rock sound with only vocals, drums, and a piano. The sound of the piano in \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" is enchanting. Not only is their music pleasing, but the lyrics in their songs are heartfelt and catchy. The vocals of leader singer Tom Chaplin are captivating. He is able to hit a wide range of keys, even the high ones like in \\"She Has No Time\\".  <br /> <br />As for sounding similar to the band Coldplay, I believe Keane has their own unique sound. But, if you enjoy bands like Coldplay, Radiohead, and Oasis, then I would recommend this CD.
0811826848|4.0|I do not believe it is necessary for me to go into all the detail that prior commentators have gone into. Let me just sum it up: This book is a must read for any Beatles fan. After all, it is about the Beatles, by the Beatles.  Well written and full of previously unreleased photos and copies of memorobilia such as letters, posters, etc. However, there are two criticisms that I have: <br /> <br />   First, the book's format leaves much to be desired. It is physically huge and heavy and not comfortable to handle. The print is very tiny and there is much printed language superimposed on photographs, letters, etc.  I would have loved to sit down with this book to knock it off in two or three reading sessions, but alas, that is impossible, because the book is so physically uncomfortable to handle and an eyestrain to read. <br /> <br />   Secondly, while the content itself is admirable, I believe someone who is not already a Beatles fan and who is not already somewhat knowledgeable about the Beatles (and there may be 4 or 5 people on the planet who fit that category) this book may not be a good introduction to the greatest band in history.  I would suggest first reading the Hunter Davies biography of a similar biography before tackling this massive Anthology.
B00008IAMD|4.0|The \\"First Time Ever I\\" heard Johnny Cash was on the radio in the mid 1960's singing the funny yet catching country song \\"A Man Named Sue\\" which everyone sang along.<br /><br />The \\"First Time Ever I\\" heard Johnny Cash sang a movie track, I was shocked by the non-metered poetry. My father said \\"Johnny Cash is known to tell a story rather than sing in rhyme.\\" Years later through Classical music I learned that one was allowed to do such a thing.<br /><br />The \\"First Time Ever I\\" ever bought a Johnny Cash CD was \\"Johnny Cash's Greatest Hits Volume I\\" because I collect music to match with my slide shows & don't play this type of CDs for normal listening pleasure.<br /><br />The \\"First Time Ever I\\" heard Johnny Cash sang \\"Hurt\\" was at work a few years ago. All day long my business environment is a battle ground between Rap & Mex-Tex. All of a sudden a deep worn out voice sang about spiritual depravity & hope that I was blown away. \\"Who is singing?\\" I asked a fellow worker who also doesn't listen to Rap or Mex-Tex. \\"That's Johnny Cash singing a song by Nine Inch Nails\\" came the reply. That sure makes a strange combo.<br /><br />The \\"First Time Ever I\\" saw Johnny Cash sing \\"Hurt\\" as a music video was in between two PBS shows on TV. Normally PBS always shows this station break about southern California during the top of the hour because they have so few commercials. Why this one day PBS played a music video during that time I have no idea, but I was hooked...I had to get Johnny Cash's last  CD \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" with the DVD short \\"Hurt\\". The references to a \\"You can't take it with you\\" type of philosophy with the death of his wife & Jesus on the cross was most moving.<br /><br />The \\"First Time Ever I\\" heard Johnny Cash sing \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" was on this CD & was pleasantly surprised on how well it could be sang from a male perspective. When the song came out in the 1970's by Roberta Flack, the radio stations over played it & I was into progressive rock. The song didn't move me as it does now. Years later the song was one of the few I liked from my wife's CD \\"Celine Dion - All the Way...A Decade of Song\\".<br /><br />Therefore \\"Hurt\\" & \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" made me see Johnny Cash as an understated musical genius because he can be so successful at experimentation. The rest of the CD \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" has its ups & downs, but this review is written from a person that normally doesn't listen to Country music. The highlights are \\"The Man Comes Around\\" which is Country but though Johnny Cash's skill & spiritual background reveals the last days with a tang. Paul Simon's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is done with a deep heart felt passion that makes for a welcome addition. John Lennon / Paul McCartney's \\"In My Life\\" is very upfront & clear which showcases Johnny Cash's timber. Ross Parker / Hugh Charles's jazzy \\"We'll Meet Again\\" makes for a great ending that one wonders if Johnny Cash could have made it as a Jazz singer.<br /><br />There are some songs that may hold a surprise like Martin Gore's \\"Personal Jesus\\" that Johnny Cash  twists around to the positive & Sting's \\"I Hung My Head\\" which sounds very Country. The balance of the CD has some Country classics that are done with great skill while others repeat the same words or rhythm.<br /><br />If you are not a Country music fan but have respect for an American icon that takes chances, this CD will not let you down. Because I liked this CD DVD combination so well, I am going to check out a few other of Johnny Cash`s \\"American\\" series.<br /><br />Johnny if your listening, I hope \\"We'll Meet Again\\".as it does now.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is a testament to the fact that American rock 'n' roll was better than British rock 'n' roll. Obviously, any album with 118 songs is bound to have a little filler, but when viewed as a collective whole, the lesser songs work well along with the best songs on this album. This is further proof they don't make Rock 'n' Roll like they used to (in fact they really don't make Rock 'n' Roll too much anymore). Starting off with \\"I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night\\" (possibly the greatest Psyche rock song ever), up to \\"Blues Theme\\", this is a essential collection. The collection actually contains diverse artists (contrary to some beleifs), including the Sonics, 13th Floor Elevators, Captain Beefheart, the Monks, and Kim Fowley. Definatly essential for anyone with even a passing interest in rock 'n' roll, particulary the rock 'n' roll of the 60s. Definatly an important chapter in the music of that time period.
B000002UWP|5.0|One of the pop greats that always tends to be overlooked, JOYRIDE well deserves to be counted amongst the best albums ever released.  Showcasing pop (Joyride and The Big L) and ballads (Fading like a Flower) at their best, the album is Roxette at their pinnicle.  There are some classics here that will never be - Knockin' On Every Door; Things Will Never Be The Same.  This album is for anyone who loved pop before its subsequent destruction by girl power, boy bands and pathetic reality television rejects.  A real gem.  If Per's recent songwriting (Opportunity Nox; Har Kommer Alla Kaenslorna) and Marie's fantastic voice (The Change) are anything to go by, Roxette is a pheonix waiting to rise from the ashes.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Saw this not long after the failure that was Van Helsing, so any movie seems good after that. But I've seen this movie several times by now, and it always holds my interest. Looks good, plenty of action, only a few small areas where the story lags, but overall a fun movie you can rewatch again and again when you need an adrenaline injection and something otherworldly and fun. Vampire and werewolves and fancy fighting and Matrix-styled clothing, everyone too good looking for reality, and so on. Yeah, just fun stuff. I was surpised by how much the movie relied on story and plot - usually these sorts of movies find story and plot secondary. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this one. Well, a good sequel.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|There's a cliche that anyone who likes this film must either be an anti-intellectual conservative/military type, or a homosexual.  Unless I'm a rare exception or something, that cliched stereotype just isn't true, as I fit into neither of those categories.  In actuality I'm a 40 year old guy with very liberal political views, and very definitely straight as an arrow. <br /> <br />Saying I like this movie is easy.  Defining exactly why I like this movie isn't quite as easy, however.  Part of it is admittedly some 80's nostalgia, although that doesn't explain why I enjoyed the film back in the 80's when it first came out.  I *was* actually in the Navy Reserves in the 1980's, although I joined well before the film came out (1983). <br /> <br />Another aspect of this film I enjoy is the gorgeous cinematography and camera work -- truly candy for the eyes, those gorgeous San Diego sunsets and such.  I also liked the relationships in the film and honestly, until it was pointed out by others, I never even suspected there was anything homoerotic about it.  The thought never crossed my mind.  I'm still not quite sure I believe this accusation. <br /> <br />Anyway, ultimately it doesn't matter that much why a person likes a movie.  If you like a film, watch it... if not, don't.  This one is definitely in my top 25 alltime favorites.  It has become a permanent part of pop culture, and actually helped to define the 1980's as a decade.  For that reason alone, it should be seen at least once.  If you end up not liking it, just pop in a different flick next time... no big deal.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Let me start by saying that Counterparts is my favorite modern Rush album. It tends to be over-shadowed by other fan favorites such as \\"Roll the Bones\\" and \\"Signals\\", but is definately one of the best post-Moving Picture albums. One guy actually thought \\"Presto\\" was better! Then he let slip that Presto was the first Rush album he ever heard. Gee, how old are you? I can pretty much predict the age of someone by them stating what their favotite Rush album is.<br /><br />There are definitely two (maybe three) camps of Rush fans. You've got the ones who grew up on \\"2112\\" and knew \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" when it was NEW. Then there are the rock radio fans who were brought in by Moving Pictures. Now you have the whole post-Moving pictures era, and it can be divided into sections also.<br /><br />I saw the Counterparts tour with Candlebox opening the show. It was great. I was a little dissappointed with the crowd that night, cause none of them seem to know the Counterparts material? I had the cd for weeks before the show. Anyway, I also had a laugh when the guy from work that I went with was \\"bored\\" during Xanadu because he had never heard the song! (NOT a Rush Fan)<br /><br />As for the comment that the remastered version is night and day compared to the original release: Give me a break! I have been listening to and recording music for over 25 years and I'll admit the music was a little \\"crisper\\", but that's all. All of Rush's early catalog, from 1974 to 1991's Roll the Bones was in need of remastering. But anything recorded/produced from 1993 or 1994 usuaully sounds fine, has good output and decent bottom-end. I purchased the remaster just as a comparison and literally could not tell any difference between the two.<br /><br />If your favorite Rush albums tend to come from the Mid-Era Progressive Phase of the late 70's to early 80's, you will probably like this.  It sits well with people whose favorite Rush albums are Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves or Moving Pictures.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I thought I'd be a bit more fair than some other reviewers who aren't happy about what Lucas did to these movies.      I have a friend who recently bought this trilogy (watched only once) from another friend for three per movie (grand total of nine dollars).  Now, I don't think my friend got an unfair price, although I feel it's a bit on the high side to be paying for butchered classics.    If I were to buy this trilogy, six dollars (two per movie) sounds more reasonable to me.  Despite the fact that Lucas destroyed a legacy and toyed with the childhood dreams of many of us, if he decides to drop the price to six bucks for the whole thing I'll consider buying it.    After all, DVD's can make attractive drink coasters.
B00008A7QK|5.0|T. Rex was, more than anything, a singles band.  Unfortunately, there isn't a perfect singles collection.  They all seem to lean to heavily on the hippie days or ignore them completely.  As it stands, Electric Warrior is the best place to start if you want to get into T. Rex.  It has three of their biggest hits, \\"Jeepster,\\" \\"Cosmic Dancer,\\" and the immediately recognizable \\"Bang A Gong,\\" and it is probably the only T Rex album where the album cuts match the hits in terms of quality.  Starting with \\"Mambo Sun,\\" this is a perfect collection of slinky, sleezy glam.  The artwsork and album title are a little misleading.  This doesn't even resemble heavy rock.  Instead it's a highly sensual, easy going pop/rock album, probably T. Rex's smoothest and downright coolest.  Marc Bolan's sublimely silly lyrics are perfect, sexed-up pulp poetry and the lack of heavy guitars makes the albums' hip shaking grooves shine beautifully from start to finish.  If you're interested in high quality glam rock besides David Bowie or you're just looking for an almost impossibly fun rock/pop album, you need T. Rex, and \\"Electric Warrior\\" is the best place to start.
B0007OY2MG|4.0|I think very highly of this series. The cast is great and the writing is spectacular. Season three is not an exception. But I would like to share one general issue with the show. The dialogue is what makes the series. It never fails to be witty, intelligent, and full of obscure references. The banter is quick, like players on a ping pong table. My issue is this....no one actually speaks this way. I don't know a single soul, let alone two people, who are capable of interchanges like this. The series often borders on being overwritten, even if the writing is what makes it great. I understand that there is artistic license taken here and I am willing to suspend my disbelief for such a great show. I just wanted to share my one reservation.
B000001GRZ|5.0|This is my favorite version of the Bach Cello Suites. Fournier plays with such exquisite passion, it churns my heart achingly. Fournier plays the suites essentially Baroque, more earthy than ethereal, and I can't help but feel the resonance in my being, when I listen to Fournier's rendition, is a confirmation that this is how Bach wrote his Cello Suites.
B0006Z2KXE|3.0|The liner notes for \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" describes it as a sophisticated romantic comedy.  Automatically my hackles go up and say \\"Oh, No! Chick Flick!\\"  To the film's credit, it is uniformly well acted.  Though Jimmy Stewart received the Oscar for his work here I thought the best performance here was delivered by Ruth Hussey as Elizabeth Embree, Stewart's no-nonsense photographer.  The script is intelligently written.  That said, the film at 1 hour, 52 minutes drags.  There's not enough substance here to warrant that length.  Translated from a stage play and it shows.  The film suffers from staginess and director George Cukor didn't seem able to open the film up from it's origins.  Not a complete waste of time but not the classic that it's been billed as.
B00000FC5H|5.0|As a kid born years after they were topping charts its awsome to discover them. <br /> <br />1 problem is \\"Love's Holiday\\" isn't on the CD. Thats 1 of my favorites.
B0007G89G4|5.0|If you're reading this review, chances are you've already seen the movie and are a big fan. The amazon editor made one HUGE mistake when saying that this is the SAME disc as the 2000 Special Edition release. The biggest difference is that this disc has been remastered in glorious 5.1 Dolby digital sound, a big ommission from the previous release. Any home theater enthusiast will agree, especially with a movie like this,(the train scene, the mailbox baseball scene, the music, etc.), the sound is almost as important as the images on the screen. <br /> <br />Thank you Columbis Pictures for re-re-releasing this treasure! And we get the soundtrack CD AND a collector's 32 page book...what more could we ask for?? A movie this good should have received this kind of treatment the first time around, but I guess it's true what they say...third time's the charm!
B000063UR1|5.0|I love Hard Science Fiction, I hate soft SF (like StarWars and other fantastic rubbish), but this movie was a different thing. I saw this movie when I was teenager, and I just can say that it's on my personal TOP5 movies of my life,  those movies that enter deep and changes something inside. Dont watch it if you look for HSF, dont miss it if you have a bit of feelings.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Once again, Mike Nichols shows us just how clever he is. I don't agree that this is his best film in years - let's not forget Primary Colors, Birdcage, and the heavenly brilliant Angels in America (ignore Wolf and What Planet Are You From), but it certainly is a return to his roots, and definitely his most serious and straightforward film in many years, probably since Carnal Knowledge. It shares, in fact, many of the themes and qualities of Carnal Knowledge (as well as other early classics like the Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf) - Like that film, its scale is very small in place and very large in time, following a small group of characters over long time gaps; likewise, we only catch glimpses of their lives, and get most of the information on important events from the characters themselves. Like Carnal Knowledge, Closer focuses on inter-relations between the four main characters, betrayal, mistrust and insincerity. Closer is bleaker, though. It's probably the bleakest thing Nichols had done. It's a downer that doesn't seem extremely special and original as you watch it, but it sticks with you. After all, that's an important mark of a good film. <br /> <br />As for the acting, now: despite my patriotic support of Natalie Portman (her being originally from Israel) and my undying love for her ever since I saw her as a child in Leon, she didn't really impress me in Closer. She tries to be sexy and mysterious, but she's still just a sweet girl, and she doesn't truly convince. Julia Roberts had always gotten on my nerves, and Closer is no exception. The male actors are the ones who really outdo themselves here; Jude Law and Clive Owen are both fantastic, obnoxious and pathetic at the same time as only a real man can be. You despise them and you pity them and you understand them. You are them. These are two great young actors who have a bright future ahead of them. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough, Mike Nichols never did write his own texts. All of his filmswere written by other people, and like Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf and Angels in America, Closer is also an adapted play. Yet he has a fascinating way of making the texts his own. The dialogues in Closer are well-written, no doubt; but just like in his previous films, it's his brilliant dialogue directing with which Nichols leaves his distinct mark and which makes it convincing, amusing and unnerving all at once. Nichols may not have a vision like Kubrick, Coppola or Scorsese, but he does what he does the best anyone could. <br /> <br />Closer is not an essential, and it's not one of the best films of the year. It's well worth a watch though, especially if you're a Mike Nichols fan or if you enjoy human relations melodramas. Not great, but very good.
B00003CXFV|5.0|There still ARE people like Erin Brockovich who care about others in this world, and who are willing to put themselves on the line to try to make a difference, and if you aren't inspired & warmed (& entertained) by this tale, you must be comatose. <br /> <br />   I know what I'm talking about because I once went on a similar crusade with the legal system to try to help some teenagers I didn't initially know from Adam, and I got all the flack, mistrust, etc. that Erin got.  When I saw this movie, everything rang true - that's how it really happens in life. <br /> <br />   Our whole family watched this DVD together (we have daughters in junior high & high school) and despite the language and \\"R\\" rating, I think it was excellent for them to get such a realistic look at the world's problems & such a positive message about the impact we as individuals can have when we take a stand on something.

B0007O38F8|2.0|first of all to make things clear, i dont hate on 50 or g-unit. I simply dislike weak albums that get described as being classics. 50's GRODT was undeniably one of the better rap albums to come out in recent years. Game's Documentary was equally as good if not better. but as for 50's new release the Massacre, it is honestly one of the biggest disappointments as far as rap is concerned. Even the ppl at aftermath and g-unit know what an average cd this is. All these beefs and controversy that has &quot;all of a sudden arisen&quot; nothing but a big publicity stunt to sell records. Lets get serious.. why would 50 and game beef just days before the Massacre was to be released and then aruptly end their beef and hold a press conference days after the release. And whats this garbage about 50 gettin at kiss, fat joe, shyne and nas. U gotta be kiddin me. 50 knows his album is garbage and he needs something to get it hyped up. I dont understand why ppl are callin piggybank a good diss track(if u can even call it that)He mentions each of his &quot;enemies&quot; in one-liners. The rest of his song has nothing to do with them. The Massacre is full of club/dance songs where 50 comes out singing. Isnt that what he dissed Ja for doing? This album is more pop then most of Ja's cds. I thinks this is the begginning of the end for 50 and g-unit. PS. check out Jadakiss'(checkmate) and Fat Joe's(My Fo-Fo) response to piggybank.. both are fire! they absolutly slay 50. Hopefully Nas(50 is nowhere near his level) and Shyne(when he gets out of jail) respond as well.. at least dl this album before you go throw your money away. If your lookin for some  good rap albums, check out Game's Documentary, Fabolous' Real Talk or Nas' Streets Diciple. 2Pac's Loyal To The Game is worth buying as well
B00008S2VG|3.0|Given Madonna's recent tumble from the charts, it's pretty easy to point fingers at her 2003 release - hailed as her worst and worst-selling record to date. <br /> <br />Mind you, it's not her best work, but certainly one of her more intriguing releases.. Like Erotica, American Life suffered from a production that had perhaps already run its course in Madonna's chameleon-like music career. A muted reaction to her risky Mirwais collaboration \\"Die Another Day\\" signaled that it was time for Madonna to, yes, reinvent herself once again. Nevertheless, Madonna plunged forward with the Mirwais-penned album and single - with mixed results. <br /> <br />The title track (and first single) are instantly uncomfortable, complete with a stiff (but apparently ironic) rap that seems terribly out of place. The lyrics, which see Madonna shining a relatively bleak light on her past guises, are perhaps the song's only strength. Unfortunately, this is where the idea falters; because messages are rarely carriers of songs.  <br /> <br />Things improve on the next three tracks. Hollywood is a sexy, slick, summery groove that follows in the same lyrical vein of American Life, yet succeeds where that song didn't - fusing a message and a groove together to create the ultimate pop song. Serving as one of the album's ONLY hit singles, its rejection from US radio was the album's nail in the coffin. <br /> <br />Next, vocoder and snipped guitars give fuel to the final installment in the \\"Fame Sucks\\" trilogy - aptly titled I'm So Stupid. The song is loud and silly, but packs a newfound Madonna punch that serves as a highlight in a warbled mess of frigidness. Perhaps a venture into this experimental but decidedly unique and refreshing style could have given American Life the \\"oomph\\" it lacked. <br /> <br />Love Profusion is a gorgeous, candy-coated pop tune that could have done big things had it not came so late (and so carelessly) in the album's single releases. Nobody Knows Me follows, Nothing Fails, and Intervention follow...three songs that vary in strength but succeed equally in sounding like rehashed ideas. You can't help listening to X-Static Process and wondering how it would have sounded had the song gotten dance treatment, and Mother and Father is basically ruined by it's geeky rap.  <br /> <br />Die Another Day is the album's centerpiece. A furious, choppy beat wraps itself around Madonna's warped vocals, sounding insantly danceable, current, exciting, and original all at once. The album ends strongly with Easy Ride, a Monte Pittman collaboration that sounds slightly like a balladic take on the previous track. <br /> <br />While not a poor record by any means, it takes some time to get used to. Gone is the quirkyness of Music, the textures of Ray Of Light, the passion of Like A Prayer, and the carelessness of her debut. American Life only succeeds in showing the world a frigid and pretentious side of Madonna; and while it is a valid reinvention from her past ventures into the carefree (Music) and the romantic (Bedtime Stories, True Blue), its one that we hope doesn't last too long.
0062502182|5.0|I read this book when I was at a crossroad in my life. Unsure of which way to go. I followed the advice given by the alchemist and took a little risk. I've never been happier.
1401300901|5.0|What a great read!  I couldn't put it down and this book had me sobbing and laughing out loud!  My husband is reading the book now because I told him how great it was (which was obvious to him cause he saw me laughing/crying/laughing while I was reading it).  He really likes it so far and I've seen him crying twice.  So the reviewer who wondered if men would like this book - I think some would.   <br /> <br />This book helps you appreciate your loved ones - spouse, friends, family - and life in general.  I recommend it highly and hope they do make the movie!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|If you enjoy good music, this movie is for you. There have been alot of scathing comments about casting Ralph \\"The Karate Kid \\" Macchio\\" as the main hero of this movie, but it is still none the less brilliant. Most definatly a movie ahead of it's time, the whole musical score of this movie is amazing. From the classical guitar rifts to the Delta Blues, and the rocking performance by Steve Vai, this movie is a class for Music Appreciation all by itself!!!! The story line is brilliant as well. There is just enough fact mixed with fiction to make one want to dig deeper into what really happened to Robert Johnson. I highly recommend this movie. There are many things to love about this one, so even if you don't like one aspect of it, the music alone can carry this movie into being one of your favorites.
B0001MDPVS|5.0|This is a really good album, I'm happy to have bought it! The only problem is the edits, and it makes me dizzy and frustrated listening to it, but you get used to it after a while.  But the point is about the music, which is really awesome!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I bought this dvd set and you could enjoy this WHILE watching it- but this is no original. when the end of the world comes, the originals will be released, the democrats will regain congress, and seinfeld and friends will be mentioned on the seventh I love the 90s series on vh1. Until then if you want the original DESPERATELY invest in a laserdisc transfer and dvd copying technology. But would you rather resort to crime when lucas will obviously release the originals (dont believe him- the originals have to be released, its an economic fact). Plus, I AM IN NO POSSIBLE WAY RELATED OR EMPLOYED BY LUCAS, NOR LUCAS HIMSELF.
038533348X|4.0|The best book on anthropology ever.  Easily his best book (and sadly, he knows that)
0743454529|4.0|This is the first book I have read  by Jodi Picoult and even though it's not perfect, I couldn't put it down. It's very well written and researched, and has a fascinating premise. The characters are well-drawn and, while you may not like them all (I had a hard time with Sara, the mother, who is somewhat heartless), they are mostly believable. Anna, the main character is a little too glib for a 13 year old, but I liked her, sympathized with her and rooted for her.<br /><br />One problem I have is Ms. Picoult's propensity for secrets. She maintains a mystery about the attorney's dog throughout most of the novel, a device that is less intriguing than it is annoying. And when you find out what that's all about you realize that it only serves to facilitate a surprise ending which, in my humble opinion, doesn't work. In fact, I hated the ending; too many coincidences, too contrived.<br /><br />However, there's much to like about this novel. It's well done and a riveting read.
0440419514|5.0|As a Harry Potter fan awaiting the next book, someone recommended this series to me and was pleasantly surprised.  These books are certainly NOT for religious people, espescially the third book.  They're also not for young children but should be read by teens and adults instead.  It's too hard for many kids to fully understand the deep plot, and there are some adult situations.  The reason the books are so controversial is because, in the books, their God is an evil being that they are in a war against.  This doesn't become clear until the third, possibly the second book.  I just take it that it's a different God than our own, in an alternate reality and it in no way makes me a God-hater or a religion-hater.  It's simply an alternate reality \\"what-if\\" tale-don't let it change your own beliefs.  The writer is also very liberal and anti-religion, which may offend people.  If you are religious and you prefer to stay away from them, that's fine.  I respect your beliefs.  Open-minded teens and adults without strong religious leanings will enjoy it the most.

B000006TRV|5.0|..when they got home at night their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives...<br /><br />Yeah- this album is great. Quite possible the best album ever made. It is the third bestselling album of all time in the United States, behind only Michael Jackson's Thriller, (reviewer has to leave momentarily so he can PUKE), which is blasphemy in this reviewers book, and The Eagles Greatest Hits. That album by the Eagles is great, but better then The Wall? I don't think so. I guess the Eagles album just had a broader appeal; in some circles it crossed over into the Country charts.<br /><br />I had this album since it first came out. I was but a youngster in High School at the time. There were many of times when I'd come home from a party and slip on the headphones with this cassette in the player. This is a timeless album, as all great art is. [...]<br /><br />The bottom line is, this is an ESSENTIAL album, which should be in every discriminating audiophile's collection, right next to Led Zeppelin IV, Nevermind, Ten, and Blizzard of Oz.
B000066NW0|5.0|ok ok if u wanted to get this cd so bad then listen to the first 3 song samplers and if u hear them and like them then u will love the full length song  my favorite ones were songs 1 2 3 i didnt care much for all the other songs i mean they are still good i just LOVE songs 1 2 3 because its a good beat and i love her voice its so cool like compilcated is like the bomb i think its the best song otta the whole entire cd so if you want a good cd u should get this cd cause its like...AWESOME...and i prefer to get this cd then her secong cd because its not as good as the first 1 but thats my opinion some other fans of avril might like secong cd better but this cd has more better beat then the secong one but if u are an avril fan then go and get both cds cause they are both great cds.

B000002U9W|5.0|As you may know, Piper at the gates of dawn is the most trippy The Floyd ever got, Mainly because Syd Barret was leading the group. This album is definetly 2nd most trippy, and im sure lots of people agree with me.  <br /> <br />1.Atom Heart Mother-10/10  When I first popped in the album and saw the 1st track was 23 minutes long, I thought oh man...this is gunna be long and boring.I was wrong! This track is amazing. Almost as good as echoes. A Masterpeice!!! <br /> <br />2.If-8/10 Probably the worst song on the album, but don't get me wrong! This track is great. I just would have expected more out of Roger Waters.  <br /> <br />3.Summer 68'-10/10 WooooW! I never knew Richard Wright could write such an amazing song! Very trippy, I just wish Richard would've wrote more lyrics for the floyd, it would have added some more color to the band. <br /> <br />4.Fat Old Sun-10/10 The BEST song on the album. Possibly even the greatest floyd song ever, well...one of thier best. David Gilmour can write amazing lyrics, which is what he proved in this song. The solo is mind blowing, fits perfect with his soft vocals and acoustic. <br /> <br />5.Alans Psychedelic Breakfast-9/10 Cool! Once again...TRIPPY! The piano and psychedelic sounds blend perfectly together. Marmalaid! Marmalaid! Marmalaid! Marmalaid! Marmalaid! ;-) <br /> <br />So in Conclusion, this album rocks! Almost as trippy as pipers! I would recommend anyone who owns this album to listen to it on a hot summer day. It fits perfectly with the atmosphere.
B0006U4UAU|5.0|<br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />As co-founder of New York's painfully hip label DFA, James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem specializes in fusing dance groove and punk attack. DFA's trademark sound made waves in 2002 with the Rapture's jagged \\"House of Jealous Lovers,\\" which Murphy co-produced. Next came the first LCD single, \\"Losing My Edge,\\" the hilarious lament of an aging hipster who feels eclipsed by youngsters with even more esoteric reference points. <br /> <br />Included here on a bonus CD that gathers three early singles, \\"Losing\\" sets the template for much of this debut full-length. Several of the best tunes are inspired by Murphy's love-hate relationship with music: his struggle between wanting to be cool and feeling the impulse is loathsome, between his attachment to rock's heritage and his urge to rip it up and start again. Out of these clashing emotions emerges a prime contender for Best Album of 2005. <br /> <br />Murphy weaves together sounds from the last 25 years of dance music, with a slant towards early-'80s mutant disco - spiky Gang of Four guitar, punkily funky bass - and recent house and hip-hop. \\"Too Much Love,\\" a brilliantly eerie song about overdoing the party potions, pivots around a grating synth that whimpers like a burned-out brain, while \\"Thrills\\" rides an utterly contemporary groove inspired by Missy Elliott's \\"Get Ur Freak   <br />
B000001EL7|4.0|I liked this album from the time I first heard it in the 2nd grade.Still gives me the same feeling as it did way back then.We need more bands like Kiss!!
B0007GAEW6|4.0|<br />In 1998, just as At the Drive-In singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez were quitting their day jobs in El Paso, Texas, the Yes song \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" showed up in a trailer for Vincent Gallo's film Buffalo 66. And oddly, all its early-'70s excesses sounded legit: the long-division time signatures, the octopus drum parts, all the grandiose hallmarks of progressive rock. It reminded you that speed, technique, precision and composition can still bite the nervous system, can give you the shove and shock that says listen to me now.  <br /> <br />Punk tried to wipe away all that: After the Ramones, the rock underground shunned the clinician, the fiddly-widdly music student; he became a pariah figure, derisively nicknamed \\"muso.\\" But speed and structure have been part of Western music for a lot longer than ripped T-shirts. The punk reaction against rock suites was a general reaction against hippies. And prog rockers - obsessive, detail-oriented - were hippie misfits. In the past few years, prog has streamed back into rock, from the metal of Dillinger Escape Plan and System of a Down to Radiohead's electronic symphonies to the dozens of varied jam bands that fill the fields of Bonnaroo every summer.  <br /> <br />Mars Volta say they don't want you to think about Yes, or prog rock, when you hear Frances the Mute. But moments of Rush and Yes and ELO are all up in this second album's strident, pompous drama, and in Bixler-Zavala's high, vibrato-filled voice. (It is not at all in Rodriguez-Lopez's guitar playing, which breaks into ringing, atonal lines.) The band, overall, is into speed and exactitude and impact, and this is a visceral, powerful muso's record, a nerve-jangling explosion in a drum clinic.  <br />  <br />
B00005JMK0|4.0|Exactly, this movie has to be put on dvd. It just may show some people that comedy and computers can exist.... That is possible. Seriously, this movie will make the movie goer in most of us feel sorry for the computer. And the music is great.
0446343129|5.0|This is one of my favorite books because it was the turning point in my life. I read the book and have never eaten sugar or refined carbohydrates since, almost 10 years ago. <br /> <br />This book will help give you the motivation to stop eating sugar. Because as we all know sugar is not good for us. But how much so is greatly unknown to most. This book helps you understand the True and Full impact sugar has had on our world. Yes this books points out how sugar has actually impacted and changed world history in a \\"negative\\" way. You will never think of sugar as just something that \\"isn't good for you\\" again.  <br /> <br />If you want to be healthy, this book makes it painfully clear how detrimental and counterproductive sugar and refined carbohydrates are. Another great book to compliment this and crack your health code is The Creator's Manual for Your Body. Sugar Blues shows you what not to eat. This book shows you what to think and do to free yourself from the limitations and constraints shackled to you by your body for life. Two Great Books.
B00008CQS0|2.0|Didn't anyone else notice in the film that Yann Tiersen has used the exact track from Amelie entitled \\"La Valse d'amelie (piano version)\\" for the scene in Goodbye, Lenin when they are driving through the countryside after the mother has cofessed the truth about how the father left?? it's the exact same track! <br /> <br />Why has Tiersen stolen from his own music? Did he really have so little time/energy/creativity?? <br /> <br />Besides this fact, his music is usually beautiful.
0783219695|5.0|HAVING SEEN THE FILM THEATRICALLY 3 TIMES UPON IT'S INITIAL RELEASE, I WAS FLOORED THIS MORNING WHEN I SAW THE FULL PAGE AD IN THE SUNDAY NY TIMES, THAT 'APOLLO 13'WAS FINALLY GOING TO BE GIVEN THE DELUXE TREATMENT ON DVD THAT IT SO LOVINGLY DESERVES. WHAT ASTOUNDED ME EVEN MORE ABOUT THIS REMARKEABLE RELEASE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FILM, AND DOCUMENTARIES, DISC 2 IS TO BE PRESENTED IN THE AWESOME IMAX VERSION AND IN GLORIOUS DTS SOUND! AND THE PRICE IS A STEAL. THANK YOU, UNIVERSAL, FOR GIVING US A CLASSIC IN A PRESENTATION SO WELL DESERVED. A GREAT FILM, JUST GOT GREATER.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Since nobody has submitted a review since 2002, I suppose I should keep this simple for the poor soul who had the misfortune to read it... the album is very deep (as my title implies). I commend P!nk and Linda Perry for making an outstanding record. Good job, ladies!!
B00005JG6Q|5.0|It's tempting to say that there are two kinds of animation - the ones before and the ones after Akira. It's probably better to say that there are two kinds of viewers: the ones who have and the ones who haven't seen it. Even now, more than 15 years after its original release, it still has incredible impact.<br /><br />All of the pieces are good. The architectural backgrounds are spectacular, and frame the action well. The characters are all well-drawn; the children and some of the adults escape the standardized look of so many anime. The story moves fast, from scenes of gang war and urban burn-out, to underground laboratories, outer space, and a chilling nursery. The battles are well-staged and varied, and the many scenes of destruction are drawn with passion.<br /><br />The good pieces come together in a story that is much more than its parts. Even the little things, like the strange cultists off on the side, support the movie well.<br /><br />Lots of other animated moves have come and gone since Akira first came out, and good riddance to most of them. Akira has stood up well in the years since it came out, and still looks good in comparison to newer movies.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0000CAQ27|3.0|... to say the least. Linda Perry is absent from this album... a fatal mistake made by P!nk. The record is not as personal as her last and the rock edge doesn't work for this particular artist. Maybe next time...
B00007KQA3|5.0|This version of Orwell's world captures all that made the book so memorable. The translation from the book's verbal form to the movie's visual one succeeds at every level.<br /><br />The city is still deep in the rubble of some past war. Its population is ant-like, dark uniform figures scurrying across a landscape too big for them, shaped by totalitarian forces that are also too big for them. Everywhere, every day, voices blare. Every place, even homes are subject to video surveillance. Everywhere, except the the slums of the lower classes. Those are the places for prostitution, grey-market exchanges, and guilty trysts.<br /><br />Winston, the central character, is willingly seduced by Julia. In a world trying to stamp out the family and even the body's innate pleasures, this is the worst of crimes. No wonder, when Julia first strips off her uniform coverall, that she seems to undress as an act of defiance, even aggression. They are drawn to each other, and try to figure out what affection means. It is incredibly sad - Julia, in an antique print dress, with inept lipstick and makeup, trying to reconstruct what romance might have been.<br /><br />The couple is captured. There is no trial, no interrogation. There is no execution - the crime of being human is too severe to punish with mere death. Instead, Winston's mind is crushed under torture, and he is remade as a loyal citizen.<br /><br />The fact that this movie was released in the acutal year 1984 is certainly no accident. It's a bleak vision, and was all too believable when Orwell first wrote it. It's still believable today, even though the literal 1984 has come and gone.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0006284JQ|5.0|like her or hate her, Britney has rocked the music biz for the past 6 years, and (yes I know) has done so by showing a lot of skin. The music is good, and that's all that matters. If you don't like her, you shouldn't waste your precious time on a cause you find unworthy.... it seems as though you're contradicting yourself by putting in so much effort to such a simple thing as an online review. Anyway, this is my \\"two cents worth\\". Perceive it as you may....
B000001Y16|5.0|Yeah all I heard from the critics was this was a bad album. This one should be called Me Against the World and Thug Life part 2. The reason I compare it to those albums is because it goes really deep like the classic Me Against the world and it takes the Ghetto lifestyles of Thug Life more then it does on All Eyez on me.Considering almost every Tupac album is either flawless are just about it is just evidence of his sucess. <br />The First song is not one I really like.\\"Hail Mary\\" is a alltime rap classic.The Next standout I feel is the song \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" after that he goes in to Gangsta rap or personal rap. The Gangsta on \\"Life as a Outlaw\\" and \\"Just like daddy\\" and finally \\"Me and my Girlfriend\\" which him as a gun just like Nas song I gave them power from 1996 also.\\"Against all odds\\" is a very personal song as is \\"Krazy\\". The best song off the album maybe the political rap of \\"White man's world\\" where 2Pac does get it right. One of the many highlites from Tupac Shakur who along with KRS-One and Nas and few others was always consistent. This album gets 10 across the board.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I wasn't prepared for this movie. Johnny Depp's movies haven't always grabbed me, though I loved Pirates, Ed Wood, and Edward Scissorhands. <br /> <br />The annual showings on TV of Mary Martin's \\"Peter Pan\\" were a special occasion at my house (well, apartment).  I always insisted that Dad leave my bedroom window open in case Peter Pan happend to come by. <br /> <br />Facts are fudged in the movie. Get over it. <br /> <br />The real-life boy on whom Peter was based apparently had a very sad and tragic life. <br /> <br />That said, bring lots of kleenex.  If the orphans don't get to you, the last scene will have you wailing.  You will believe that a theatre-full of adults will cry their hearts out because they really do believe. <br />
B0006ZE7G2|1.0|If you've already bought \\"The Wall\\" on dvd, this is just a re-packaged version, it has no additional features or footage.
B0001XAPY2|2.0|I consider all of Miyazaki's films to be masterpieces except this one. First of all, the movie is set in Italy and nobody speaks with an Italian accent. The southern accent from the American is REALLY bad too! The animation is brilliant like in all of Miyazaki's films but I had trouble with the main character, Porco. In all of Miyazaki's other films you really feel drawn to the main character and want to see them succeed. But Porco is so...bleh. He shows so little emotion. It's really hard to like him at all. He has this curse that turned him into a pig but he doesn't even seem to care. So why should I care if he turns back into a human or not? And then there's the ending. It doesn't resolve anything. It's like the movie just ends halfway through the story. It wraps up with a voice over telling what happens next. What's up what that? That sucks! I was very disappointed with this film.
B00005M91K|4.0|This documentary is really worth it! <br /> <br />It summarizes thousands of words in 104 minutes. It makes you think deeply about our everyday life. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with Koyaanisqatsi, this follows the same idea. It is not a narrated documentary. <br /> <br />One problem is that it neglects the western world. Which is ridiculous considering the film's subject. <br /> <br />The music was amazing and overall, really worth it.
B00006879E|3.0|If their video is anything to go by (their audio is not), the bunch use old-style analog keys - moog or pipe-organ even. This gives them depth. They write... er, passable little songs with britpop as obvious target. Same way that The Monkeys once did with Beatle tunes. However, one has to admit the band is up against heavy competiotion in The Datsuns, The Plimsouls, to say nothing about Oasis. Many-many garage bands (in your own vicinity!) outplay and outwrite (and out-everything!) this one, from the word go. After heavy MTV and virtually all FM stations' rotation exposure experience - you will be hard pressed to confirm you enjoy the album's hit-single number. It's a seat-smeared gum stuck on your trousers unreachably - you dismiss it by way of acceptance. Are you not?
B000002UAU|5.0|I say could because other beatles albums are also contenders ie Revolver/Abbey Road. I truly don't believe any non-beatles album can be considered for this title and imo Sgt Pepper has those other two just beat. It's a psychadelic classic and the one that drove the talented Brian Wilson to give up the ghost as no one could top Pepper. It really is THAT good! Musically it's a mixture of music hall(the wonderful When Im 64)psychadelic(Lucy,Kite)indian(within you)& surreal pop(getting better). Topped off by arguably the greatest beatles recording(and thus the greatest song by anyone in the 60s)A Day In The Life,kind of like looking at everyday english life through psychadelic glasses. Plus you have the glorious pop of songs like lovely rita and fixing a hole. Buy and listen to truly the best album yet made(and unlikely to be bettered!)
0425098478|4.0|Ever wanted to read those managerial books out there but had been put off by the the thick textbooks and theories? Look no further with \\"The One Minute Manager\\" series of books. Written in simple layman style in the form of a story, each book presents different management concepts. The first book in the series starts off by introducing us to the two types of managerial styles that we know: The task oriented and the people oriented. To get results, the effective manager has to have the correct balance of the two. This can be achieved through 3 one minute secrets: One Minute Goals, One Minute Reprimands and One Minute Praisings. Ponder on the One Minute teachings and you realise how true and simple they are. Of course, as with all things, theory and applications are two different matters altogether. You will still need lots of practice to apply what is taught here. After all, you can't really become a One Minute Manager overnight right?  <br /> <br />Recommendations: A must read for all managers out there, especially 'senior management' who often think highly of themselves and their results. :) The concepts would also be useful for parents who need to 'manage' their children better. For fast readers, don't really need to buy the book though as it can be easily digested in less than an hour.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|... and fortunately, unlike Evita 1996, the moviescript DOES allow the characters to speak a little bit. It is quite apparent however that its virtues are theatrical and not cinematic and the style is borrowed from the excellent Moulin Rouge 2001.<br /><br />However, The Phantom of the Opera contains wonderful ORIGINAL music and libretto, as Moulin Rouge didn`t.<br /><br />What remains a letdown is that the Lloyd Webber`s phantom is not diabolique enough. It all ends rather corny, over the top and overlong. Examples are the abduction of Christine by a HORSE in the Paris sewers and Raoul belting out his despair, tied by the Phantom in the finale.<br /><br />There are compensations however in the sets, music and performances, but Lloyd Webber should have given the screen adaptation a moore bloody treament on the gore side hehehe.<br /><br />Why I am attacking Mr Webber? Well, it is QUITE apparant that the director`s hand has been tied here and that the 2004 movie production is Mr Lloyd Webber`s vision of his brainchild on the screen.<br /><br />Sad to say, I much more prefer the Claude Rains/Susanna Foster/Nelson Eddy version, made by Universal in 1943. Now THAT`s a P H A N T O M  for u:-)
B000002IZ4|5.0|OK, 'Core' debut album by STP is great in many ways, but this one is even better, simply because STP sound more, sort of personable and original on this one. Core was no rip-off, no, but it was just slightly \\"too\\" similar to the other bands of the time. Purple has also more range and is more \\"daring\\", and better guitar work, you can just sense the great musicianship and passion from track to track, this album was the real diamond for Stone Temple Pilots, if you're more into 90's rock in general, perhaps \\"Core\\" is an album a bit easier to get into, but once you get into \\"Purple\\", you'll love it. STP is perhaps the best 90's band there was, I like most of the other bands (Soundgarden, PJ, Nirvana, AIC..), but it's just that STP managed to \\"reinvent\\" themselves album to album, but yet having their own style and sense in everything. If we go to the members, singer Scott Weiland, has a great voice and a great talent to use it, there's undeniable charm and presence in his voice and great lyrics, being mysterious in his texts, but not to the point that it's annoying, and you don't have to wonder if the lyrics have a point or just fancy words. Dean Deleo, has slightly improved here since \\"Core\\", not that he wasn't great then, but \\"Purple\\" just offers more range and especially solos, which were a slight lack on \\"Core\\". Bassists are very underrated in general, and I can't really tell if a bassist is great or poor, but Robert Deleo has great basslines! Eric Kretz obviously knows his job too... This is the best album STP gave out! If you haven't still gotten into STP, and you're a rock fan, don't hesitate, get this one, and their other releases too! See, STP were perhaps annoyingly much shadowed by Nirvana or Pearl Jam, and because of that, some (dumb) people might actually think that STP was just one of those grunge rip off bands coming out in the mid to late 90's (Creed, Godsmack, Seven Mary Three), no, no, no! STP was one of the original bands! There are no filler songs on the album, every track is perfect! and the songs don't get too similar or repetitive! But if I got to say a few standouts: \\"Interstate Love Song\\" \\"Lounge Fly\\" \\"Still Remains\\" \\"Kitchenware & Candybars\\" & \\"Big Empty\\". <br />LISTEN & ENJOY! <br /> <br />
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|OK -- there is a lot missing.  But it's all explained in the booklet that comes with the set.  Geldof never wanted any of it taped, and the DVD had to be pieced together from what could be gathered from that historic day.  Most of the Philadelphia stuff was not saved, and we have MTV to thank for not cleaning house too often.  Virtually all of the Philadelphia footage was gathered from boxes and boxes of un-cataloged MTV tapes that still contained commercials and in-house graphics.<br /><br />But still, some performances of that day are lost forever.  Many due to technical glitches.  But what is left is astounding.  Close to 10 hours of live footage between Wembley and JFK, plus extras that make this DVD a steal at 10 times the price.  Knowing that the artists involved in this project freely and immediately granted permission for the DVD to be made, without any compensation, only makes it sweeter.  The proceeds of the sale of the DVD go into the Band Aid Trust which continues to work in famine relief.
B00000272N|4.0|AIC debuted nicely with \\"Facelift\\" giving them a name and a little bit of fame. But it's easy to say they're not even close to what the follow-up \\"Dirt\\" offered. Facelift is entertaining indeed, but perhaps what makes it less great (in lack of better terms) is that it isn't too original or fresh, I would still categorize this into the same type of rock GNR or Motley Crue does/did (I know, very bad comparisons) but I mean, the songs are more of this \\"stadion-type-sing-alongs\\" if not counting \\"Bleed The Freak\\" or \\"Real Thing\\", these are songs only giving a hint of what was coming later. This is a good album, and there's no denying the power of \\"Man In The Box\\", the hit, it's great, but I'm just saying that everyone should agree this is more \\"schlock rock\\" and has nothing to do with the revolutionary break of grunge/alternative, which they later joined with \\"Dirt\\" and defined themselves greatly. So, the thing is that \\"Facelift\\" was nothing innovative or fresh, but yet great at what it was, typical 80's style hard rock, with only a few more \\"grunge\\" songs, you know? If AIC wouldn't have created the masterpiece \\"Dirt\\" they wouldn't have become anything, just saying that Staley and Cantrell, are heroes now, true talents they were, but it would be weird saying that on basis of \\"Facelift\\". Definitely worth to listen to though, but it does give me that feeling of already old and dusty rock, the thing with their later albums is that they're kinda timeless and they still sound fresh...GIVE IT A TRY
B00008S2VG|4.0|The best way to sum up \\"American Life\\" is that it is Madonna mid-identity transformation...Usually, a Madonna album comes with a brand new bag of tricks...That is what we have come to expect from this extraordinarily talented performer. In this case, the tricks from her Music album are polished up and perfected - Mad scientist tamed,fun and games shunned, static electronics and dry acoustics to the max. Unfortunately, the songs are not strong enough to withstand Mirwais' obsession with stripping things down. Madonna sounds exposed, and she doesn't sound too happy about it.  <br /> <br />If it hadn't been for Madonna's very public withdrawal of her promo video for the title track (See accusations of cowardice etc.), her incessant reluctant public appearances putting down fame and everything else the rest of us wanted and still want for ourselves and from her, as well as her newly embraced role as 1st grade kabbalah instructor, people wouldn't have been so harsh in judgment. However this is about music, and so we should focus exclusively on this: <br /> <br />The title track was a dreadful choice for a first single. Like Music and Die Another Day, when you listen to it enough, you discover more and more pleasure in how it is put together. However, to the casual listener, it sounded like a drill in your head, and the self-indulgent lyrics were laughable. Like most of this album lyrically speaking, the words are way too simple. While great pop music is rarely MENSA-inspired, there are limits. Madonna obviously spent too much time conversing with her kids while writing this album. She sounds like she is caught up in some kind of adolescent existentialism.  <br /> <br />The true gems are Hollywood, which breezes along with the best of Madonna's classic anthems, Love Profusion, which could have been a great early single, and Mother and Father, the latest insight into Madonna's family struggles delivered in gorgeous voice with a killer dub beat. There are perhaps another three tracks worthy of being included on a Madonna album here(Easy Ride, Nobody Knows Me and Intervention), but the rest is easily forgotten, and should be. On the whole, the album didn't deserve to be trashed the way it was, and it should have sold because it is Madonna, and she is infinitely more interesting than anyone else on the charts, even after twenty-two years of hit-making. That said, I think she has gone back to the drawing board as a result of the obvious complacency that left this album just a little short of that magic ingredient that makes a Madonna album special. Can't wait for her next effort though...I am certain she won't disappoint...
B0000027RL|4.0|I'm a fan of this Pearl Jam album, and this is defintely their best album. Vs., the follow up is also good, but after that they've sucked badly, and all that sh*t with \\"we're too popular\\" (??), you know all that rebellious stuff..kind of took my respect from the newer PJ, but \\"Ten\\" is something great. I think the only reason they started making, yes, worse music after VS. is because they felt they had success and fame (and money..)so that they didn't obviously care about anymore big sales (still have all hardcore fans buying their stuff, no matter how sh*tty it is..)and that musically they were simply out of ideas, how to make great music as on \\"Ten\\" without sounding too similar (would've been hard..)so, they decided to try to not make music they used to, and that's where they failed to still sound great, they were great with this one and Vs..but nowadays..damn...just a couple of good tracks here and there...This is where Stone Temple Pilots DID NOT fail!, in reinventing themselves but yet sounding great. Well, anyway..There are 5 great tracks on the album: \\"Once\\" \\"Alive\\" \\"Even Flow\\" \\"Black\\" & \\"Jeremy\\", those are undenyable classics! but the rest is plain mediocre. \\"Why Go\\" & \\"Garden\\" sound somewhat nice, but nothing spectacular, songs like 'Oceans' & 'Deep' give a feeling of fillers, only to make 11 tracks, and not settling for a five track EP, you know? This album is good only because of the hits, but it's true that none of the songs really suck, so...Alive and Jeremy are the best songs, very dramatic themes however, but they just give a special feeling inside of me when I listen to them, just awesome tracks! Well, all in all a plain good album, but without 'Alive' and 'Jeremy' this wouldn't be anything! Get this album if you haven't got it, but don't expect anything that spectacular...
B000053V7Q|5.0|Before we go any further, I have to ask you whitch Elvis do YOU like? The fifties Elvis, the '68 black suit Elvis or Aloha-Elvis? If you like the Aloha-Elvis, and you haven't seen That's The Way It Is-Elvis, you are in for an explosion of joy when you see this film! The other two groups can throw away one star from the rating above. This means this isn't the best Elvis-experience for you, but you shouldn't miss it anyhow..  <br /> <br />This documentary is better than 'Aloha', it's better than 'The 68' Comeback Show', it's better than 'Elvis On Tour'and definetly better than Elvis In Concert! It's the best you can get of Elvis if you want to see and listen at the same time. I think objectively the period between 1968-73 is creme-de-la-creme. But 1970 is the peak for me. New costume, new songs to sing, not only 'Suspicious Minds' and 'In The Ghetto', but also songs from other artists, like 'You've Lost That Loving Feeling', 'Just Pretend' and so on. His voice is here mature, he's extremely good looking and he shows great humor and spontaneyity. Denis Sanders did a very good job showing the way Elvis and his crew worked with new songs on rehearsals. You go from tears to chills down your spine, and that is to me a sign of quality! If this means I'm gay when I thought I was straight, I don't have no problems with that. I cry like a baby listening to Elvis-songs anytime! <br /> <br />The sound isn't at it's best though if you compare to the new deluxe-version of Aloha From Hawaii or the '68 comeback show. But it's good enough. It doesn't bother me.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is: There are three DVD-films with Elvis you must have in your music-collection, 'The '68 comeback', 'Aloha' and 'That's The Way It Is'. The divine three, but the greatest of them all... Well, I think I don't have to repeat it!
B00005JLEJ|5.0|I have both the zone 3 and the Criterion versions. I am not going to comment on the story. This version of the movie definitely has superior picture and sound quality. The color is excellent. It also has 20 minutes of additional scenes. However, the introductory text describing the political state which comes right after the film title was cut. Although it does not take away the enjoyment of the movie but I am a little bit puzzled; the LD version, which I also own retained the text. The introductory text explained why these warlords are fighting each other. The Criterion version of the movie, I suspect, contains the same scenes as the zone 2 DVD version available for quite some time. No sure if the zone 2 version has introductory text.
B000059XYA|5.0|I think that this Superman is even better than the first, as three renegades from Superman's planet Krypton, are unwittingly released by Superman and fly down to the planet Earth, where they wreak havoc and aim to take the world over.<br /><br />Superman (Christopher Reeve) must fight for truth, justice and the American way...but alas he has given up his powers for love of the mortal woman, Lois Lane (Margo Kidder).

006019250X|5.0|When reading 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho, one is immediately caught up in an atmosphere filled with dreams, symbols, and adventure. Similar to Vicky Davis' 'The Baron Son,' this delightful tale combines ancient mysticism with fantasy as Coelho urges people to follow their dreams in order to find pure contentment and personal achievement. <br /> <br />The novel tells the tale of Santiago, a boy who ventures to discover his true self, while searching for a hidden treasure near Egypt's pyramids. By the tale's end, he discovers that the treasure was the actual journey, the discoveries he made along the way, and the wisdom he gained as a result. Coelho skillfully combines words of wisdom and philosophy in very simple language, which makes it particularly readable.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I just rented this movie because of all of the hype about the religious themes in it. I don't know too much about other religions than my own. I am Methodist. With the cheat sheet we got it all does look like it's telling a larger story about the meaning of love. I didn't like some of the camara techniques and some of the numbers were kind of unsophisticated but this movie has me thinking. It has me thinking a lot. We loved it in the end.

B00000K3CM|5.0|This movie is much of the same story line of the first one, except is is 10x as good. It starts off with the family running around packing for there vacation to a tropical place. At the family's Christmas concert Buzz (Kevin's brother) pisses Kevin off during his solo. They both create a scene and end up explaining the family many apologies. Kevin talks back and is sent ot his brothers room (the one who pisses the bed) to sleep.<br />The next morning the family gets up late and are rushing to the airport. Keving trails behind and gets on another plane. Kevin arrives in New York and reliazes that he had took the wrong plane. he is thrilled, however his family is not. <br />The first thing that Kevin does is all the stuff that his parents won't let him do. He checks into a hotel, using his dads Visa. He then goes shopping at a toy store, with his dad's money. Kevin soon finds out that the wet bandants are in new York and that they are after him. This sends him on a chase.<br />This movie is a great movie and a fun movie which you can watch time and time again. It displays a perfect image of the Christmas craze we go through each year. I'd 100% recommend this movie.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|A phenominal new album since Pain killer!! <br />We have been waiting nearly 15 years <br />for a new full length album by the  <br />metal gods!!! <br /> <br />A must own for every fan!!!!
B0007O38F8|1.0|50's done it again! He's created an incredible buzz for himself and sold an ungodly amount of records without showing any real skills! I want to thank all the mindless consumers for buying this bulls*** and other bulls*** like it-you're helping destroy hiphop!    Don't get it twisted-this album is not 'Get Rich Or Die Trying'...at least I could stomach GRODT for the most part...'The Massacre' is a collection of radio friendly dribble separating spots of played out gangster s***...50's not breaking any new ground here...the only track worth mention is \\"A Baltimore Love Thing\\", an extended personification of heroin...this is disappointing in itself because it outshines all the other tracks and shows what 50 can create when he puts forth an effort...the beats are top notch ('Ryder Musik' and 'Ski Mask Way' are bananas) but that means nothing when 50 lazily jumps on them with uninspired, basic rhymes...I don't know about you, but I just can't buy into the gutter s*** 50 is talking about when he lives in an 18 bedroom mansion...don't you think it's time to do something a little different...there is no growth here for 50...because of this he'll never be on the same level as Jay and Nas regardless of how many records he sells...I hope those plaques are worth it Curtis-you could've been a lot more
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Enter the epic world of Mars Volta's \\"Frances the Mute\\" and you might find you'll never leave. From chaotic time signatures to soft lullabies, this album does it all.    On the first listen, one might say, \\"Woah.\\"    This would be a perfectly valid reaction to something of this magnitude. The Mars Volta have created an album that surpasses all others in terms of musicianship, playability, and power. Sprawling operatic music spans across 10+ minute songs which easily rival some of the classic epics from bands such as, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin.    The music is only complemented further by the almost effeminate vocals of Cedric Bixler-Zavala. Cedric's sense of emotion brings every track to life and creates wonderful imagery with his story-telling lyrical style.    From harsh electrifying crusades to brooding emotive movements, 'Frances the Mute' is a journey unlike any other. It will raise the bar for your musical palette and most assuredly become one that all others are judged by.    -Tim Cox
0671027387|2.0|The intrigue itself is OK. But, but it has a feeling of being written by a high school science freak, everything beyond science and the action itself is just that - pathetic. Among other things the author has no idea how adults talk and how they behave under pressure.<br /><br />Among other pearls of wisdom, one may learn from this book that the brightest Harvard graduate specializing in political science has no idea about campaign finance law, that an intelligence officer knows no means of conveying sensitive information over open line, that the limit on soft money is $2000, that the Secret Service does not guard presidential candidates, that any secure room could be penetrated through a broom closet in the toilet etc.<br /><br />And on top on all of that we have an evil Republican Senator from Delaware (of all places) fighting a good well-liked Democrat, however, the help from the extraterrestrial life (and no less than that) is the only hope for this well-liked Democrat to be re-elected.<br /><br />The ending is simply super-pathetic.
0061091480|5.0|It is well known that humans cannot mature emotionally unless one takes the initiative to look into oneself. It is easier to point the finger away from us.    When  we have a flu, we take some steps to address it. We may rest for a whole day, then decide to take some medication, and then, if necessary, see a doctor. In other words (1) We are good at sensing that we have a physical problem (2) We know that we need to do something about the problem (3) We first attempt to solve the physical problem ourselves (4) If that fails or if incapable or ignorant of the problem, we don't hesitate to seek outside help (e.g. doctor).    It is ironic that at the emotional level, we may even not reach the first step, i.e. recognize that there is an emotional weakness!  However, if a physical adult recognizes that he/she is an emotional child (i.e. suffering from things such as anger, guilt, lack of assertiveness, etc.) and needs help, Dr. Dyer is a gift to that person.    Dr. Dyer does a superb job of:    (1) Helping us understand the problem ('erroneous zone').  (2) Offering concrete steps to work at the problem in our daily life.    His presentation style is worthy of note - His way of driving home a point by using metaphors and a touch of sarcasm makes it very easy for the reader to assimilate the subject matter.    As with any book on personal development, reading the book is only the starting point. One has to put in effort. As John Bradshaw says, \\"It will work if you will work.\\" Pick the top 2 or 3 erroneous zones, chip away at it, and discover yourself blossoming.    \\"Your erroneous zones\\" is a book as well as a timeless reference manual.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a thought provoking story about a world where color and emotions have been removed because feelings can cause pain. As the young people come of age they are assigned to their occupations.  Jonas is apprenticed to the Giver, a man who holds the memories of the world as it really was with all the color, joys and sorrows of life. He passes these memories and sights on to Jonas.  Jonas's first experience with color is an amazing piece of writing.  Jonas comes to understand the truth about his society.  Old people, sick people and non thriving babies are \\"terminated.\\" As his horror and outrage grow, he decides to save the life of a baby slated for \\"termination.\\" Their breathless escape leads up to a final unforgettable image.<br /><br />Readers who want more \\"closure\\" can read Lowery's other books about this world: Gathering Blue, 2000 and Messenger, 2004.<br /><br />News stories seem to be right out of The Giver these days. Novels provide an safe avenue for family discussions about important issues.<br /><br />At some point in high school students will read George Orwell's 1984. The Giver is an introduction to the concept of a dystopia. I am so glad my children had an opportunity to read Lowery's book before grappling with 1984.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Everyonce in a while there comes along a movie that just seems to capture someone's attention with the suspense, the action, the acting, and the drama so well that they don't know what's going to happen next nor do they want someone to spoil it who's already seen it.  <br /> <br />Collateral is the perfect example of that type of movie. Both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise share chemistry together so well you'd might think they have been doing dozens of movies together.  <br /> <br />I haven't seen too many Cruise movies; just Top Gun and the Mission Impossble series, and I thought Jamie Fox couldn't get on the same level as he did in Ray, but this movie was awesome to watch and see what both men could do. <br /> <br />Jamie Fox stars as a cab driver named Max; a man who has the cleanest cab in Los Angeles. The first few minutes show how Fox can carry a regular cab scene with ease, and proves it when he shows his character's background who wants to open a limo driving business. [Don't worry, he actually is serious in the movie] <br /> <br />Max picks up a man named Vincent; played by Cruise, who gives him three hundred dollars up front to make five stops, \\"To visit some friends\\" It basically is a typical scene, till Max gets a rather nasty shock on his first stop [I wont give what it was away, but it is rather surprising] <br /> <br />To make a long story short, Cruise is a hit man on his way to five different people. His protrayal of Vincent is astonishingly cold, cool, and cruel. He will kill anyone who gets in his way and he informs Max that in order to save those people, \\"Don't attract anyone who doesn't need to die's attention.\\" Seems easier said than done with what Max has to go through. <br /> <br />The camera angles are unique and styllized but the lighting is probably the only thing that I have a problem with. The whole plot takes place at night save a few minutes at the beginning and the end, showing when the plot begins and end.  <br /> <br />And there is a scene near the end when vincent is chasing another victim where it is really hard to see. But besides those small minor details this is one pretty good movie with great camera angles. <br /> <br />To sum everything up I would definately reccomend this movie to those who want to see a styllized action flick with the most regular good vs. evil plot you might see. The action is great, the suspense is nail biting, the acting is off the charts, and the ending is powerful to say the least.
0380778556|5.0|I didn't notice for a long while that the main character in this book goes nameless for it's entirety. It dawned on me one day as I was trying to relate the story to a friend and kept stumbling over pronouns. I love the fact that DuMaurier at some points refers to her as having \\"such a lovely christian name\\" but then of course never reveals it. The story is really one of the best she ever wrote. The brilliance of keeping her protagonist nameless through out, makes the presence of the long dead Rebecca even more sinister. And of course Mrs. Danvers is one of the best villainesses to ever be put to ink. A classic must read.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This is a very touching movie. It's so lovely. Here you see that you can make a movie without an action or love scene. The actors Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore (Peter) are brilliant. The story is VERY good and VERY sad. <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is simply amazing.  Both the miniseries and the book.  (I recommend you buy them both.)  In fact, the only complaint I have about either is that they left me begging for more!  (I gladly would have watched twice as many episodes of the miniseries, if they'd made them.)  I've read the book repeatedly, and watched the whole dvd series at least a dozen times.  (The series is definitely better in surround sound, by the way.)  The film quality is terrific, and feels very realistic.  Especially in some of the more harrowing parts (shelling, or the assault on a Kraut position in Episode 2).  Sometimes it has a \\"gritty\\" look to it.  But this only enhances the action.  It's also almost impossible to put down or turn off.  (I've yet to be able to watch just one episode at a time.  It usually ends up being three or four at a minimum.)  Many of the other reviews provide you with all the detail you could ask for.  So I'll leave it at this: BUY THIS DVD and BUY THE BOOK!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban produces, arguably, the purest vocals since those late 80s Folgers commercials.  The first time I heard \\"You Raise Me Up\\", I had to pull off the freeway!  I was bawling uncontrollably!  Embarrassingly, there was a lot of traffic on the 405 at the time, and drivers kept staring. <br /> <br />The other songs, especially the ones in Latin or Korean or whatever that is, are beautiful.  After Track 13, I waited for a bonus track.  No such luck.  It wasn't advertised, but you never know. <br /> <br />If this doesn't convince you to buy Closer, I don't know what will!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Nerd or Teenager finding life?<br /><br />I have given this movie five stars even though the movie doesn't really have a plot.  I think that is really what the point was.  Jon Heder played Napoleon Dynamite just right.  Napoleon is one of those nerdy guys that you went to school with that just didn't know how to connect with anyone.  He came from a really strange family that includes his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) who thinks that he should have been given a better chance in playing football in high school and his 32 year old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who liked to spend all of his time in chat rooms on-line.<br /><br />When we first see Napoleon he is a total loner with no one to talk to, play with, or hang out with.  He hooked up with Pedro (Efren Ramirez) on Pedro's first day of school when the principal asked him to show Pedro where to find his locker.  Teaming up with Pedro gave Napoleon someone to identify with and talk to, although neither one did much talking.  He helped Pedro with running for class president.  Some of the funny parts are due to Pedro's running for president and how they managed to help each other out with some of their \\"skills.\\"<br /><br />Pedro and Napoleon help each other out when it comes to courting the ladies.  Neither Napoleon nor Pedro knows the best way to go about it and both fall flat.  Both guys like gals that are way out of their league, but that doesn't stop them from trying.  Things take a little turn when Pedro ends up with Deb (Tina Majorino) as a date to the prom.  It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out that Napoleon and Deb are interested in each other.  In the mean time Napoleon's Uncle Rico and brother Kip are busy with lives of their own.  All of them fall into situations that should keep you laughing.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is that it is something that the whole family can watch.  You don't need to worry about language or nudity.  I could easily watch this movie again.

0440241413|1.0|I was searching for something lighthearted and I had avoided this book forever. I should have listened to that oh so wise inner voice. The main character was so superficial and irresponsible that I felt no pity for her self serving ways. She was not a person I would have liked to know. I actually got so frustrated reading it that I threw it back on the shelf. But I was bored so I plowed through it. It made me truly appreciate the better writers of this genre. I can not fathom for the life of me what others saw in this book.
B00004VXF2|1.0|It was Lou's f-you to RCA records. Nothing more, nothing less. I read these reviews and feel like I do when at an art show and see works that a 2 year old baby could create, then listen to pretentious snobs debate the merit of it. We are talking about Lou Reed here, the creator of some of the most impassioned music of the rock era. He wouldn't do this to anyone except an enemy, which is exactly what this is. Don't try to read anything more into it, because it's pure fantasy. The jokes on everyone who doesn't get it!
1573225517|4.0|I tend to read books from the female perspective but I like Hornby's insights on the English male perspective. As a musicholic who is married to a bigger musicholic I could relate, Having been in many independent record stores he was dead on with the descriptions of the characters and their obsessions with record buying and lists of favorites. Again he creates an interesting character study. Much better than the movie.

0312319517|3.0|\\"Avenger\\" is the kind of book where the author worked very hard to create a story where the hero and the bad guys play out a long and complicated confrontation. When the author finally typed \\"THE END\\" he/she sat back and thought, \\"The readers will love this! They'll laud the hero for being so ingenious and forceful, and they'll laud me for having written this masterpiece!\\" <br /> <br />In reality, after reading \\"THE END\\" most readers will put down the book and think, \\"Too contrived! The plot is too contrived and the confrontation too unlikely. The chances of everything happening the way the author describes it are nil!\\" <br /> <br />Examples of the contrivedness (is there such a word?) of the story in \\"Avenger\\": <br /> <br />- The bad guy is in 2001 a high-powered international arms dealer who flies around in his own private business jet, yet in 1995 he was the militia leader of a ragtag group of 10 drunken thugs. <br /> <br />- The bad guy has a supposedly high-security fortress-like hideout, except that he prefers to have 1500 \\"residents\\", most of whom are forced laborers who do farming, including food processing and running a butchery, implying to me a security nightmare. <br /> <br />- This high-security fortress-like hideout is protected in various ways, but something as simple as motion detectors or IR sensors are not used. <br /> <br />- The good guy is a 51-year-old Vietnam veteran who just happens to have previously befriended two people who have the very special talents he now needs to help him in his confrontation with the bad guy. <br /> <br />As well as being too contrived the story is too slow. The entire first half of the book is mainly just background information for the story. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I think that some of the background information is the most interesting part of the book. I was especially fascinated by the descriptions of the \\"Tunnel Rats\\" in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War and by the explanations of the breakdown of ex-Yugoslavia and the various wars there. <br /> <br />One rather interesting twist in the story is the date on which the story ends: Sept. 10, 2001. It's not really significant to the story, but it does make you think about the stakes involved. <br /> <br />In conclusion I'll just echo what many of the other reviewers have said: Not one of Frederick Forsyth's best, but still fairly readable. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen
0060594888|5.0|Most peoples' bookshelves are weighed down with self-help books.  Some teach you how to lose weight.  Others refocus your financial development.  Still others help you with relationships.  Yet others look at better habits.  And others propound moral principles to guide you.  What most of these books have in common is that they are usually superseded by a new and better book . . . soon after being published.  How can you hope to keep up?  Well, you couldn't . . . until now.<br /><br />Jack Canfield and Janet Switzer have created something different in the self-help literature -- a compendium of the principles that have stood the test of time.  I didn't find a single source of ideas that I like (except those that are only grounded in my religious beliefs) that wasn't included here somewhere.<br /><br />The book is organized in several sections to make these references easier to follow:  The Fundamental of Success (which includes principles like Take 100% Responsibility for Your Life, Be Clear Why You're Here, Decide What You Want, Believe It's Possible, Believe in Yourself, Unleash the Power of Goal-Setting, Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway, Be Willing to Pay the Price, Reject Rejection, Use Feedback to Your Advantage, Commit to Constant and Never-Ending Improvement, Practice Persistence, and Exceed Expectations); Transform Yourself for Success (which includes principles like Drop Out of the \\"Ain't It Awful\\" Club . . . and Surround Yourself with Successful People, Acknowledge Your Positive Past, Face What Isn't Working, Transform Your Inner Critic into an Inner Coach, Stay Motivated with the Masters, and Fuel Your Success with Passion and Enthusiasm); Build Your Success Team; Creative Successful Relationships; Success and Money; and Success Starts Now.<br /><br />The authors also provide many free tools to help you succeed.<br /><br />If the strength of this approach is that you cover the waterfront of sound principles, the weakness is that the coverage is pretty thin in places.  That will be the gripe of many people against this book.  But unless it was to be 2,000 pages long, that weakness is unavoidable.  The suggested reading and other references in the back, however, are more than adequate to lead someone to deeper resources where they are needed.<br /><br />I only noticed one unmitigated weakness in the book:  a preference for evolutionary change and improvement rather than encouraging readers to develop breakthrough skills as well.<br /><br />To give you a sense of how valuable I found this book, I persuaded the dean of the university where I teach to let me launch a new course for self-improvement based on The Success Principles as the text.  This one book will replace what many students are now acquiring through taking as many as six other courses.  I see that as an important step forward for their educations . . . and yours, too, if you read and apply this book as I have been doing since I read it.  I've seen immediate results . . . and believe that you will, too!<br /><br />If you are a writer, you will also enjoy the many places in the book where Mr. Canfield shares lessons from his remarkable success with developing the series, Chicken Soup for the Soul.<br /><br />If you have already read much of the success literature, you probably think this book isn't for you.  I beg to differ.  Seeing so many good ideas in one book will help you weld together good habits and actions in even more constructive ways.n places.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|I recently saw the Celtic Women concert on PBS and was absolutely amazed. As a massive Sarah Brightman fan, I was thrilled to see \\"Nella Fantasia\\" performed in the concert. I used the lyrics from this beautiful song as my senior quote when I graduated from high school. This CD will not appeal to the masses of teens and 20 somethings who would rather listen to a hip-hop bass line and perverted lyrics, this is real talent singing really great classic songs. The voices are angelic and the songs are etherial. By far one of the greatest performances I've seen since Brightman's Harem tour last year. 5 stars, brilliant and I'd love to see more.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|The Way Up is in many ways a retrospective of Metheny's bright career as a jazz guitarist, composer, and bandleader.  The piece begins with Metheny playing quiet fingerstyle on his newly acquired baritone guitar, which he used exclusively on his 2003 solo CD, One Quiet Night, which won the guitarist a Grammy in the \\"new age\\" category.  Likewise, both both in form and content, the CD offers easy comparisons to the 20-or-so minute Metheny/Mays collaboration As Falls Witchita So Falls Withita Falls, from the 1970s.  Similarly, the Brazilian influenced material in the piece speaks to late 1980s Metheny--Still Life (Talking), for example--and there are even passages that, in melodic and improvisational content as well as in guitar tone, allude to Metheny's debut CD, the \\"power trio\\" outing Bright Size Life.<br /><br />But an over-riding reference in the music is to the music of minimalist composer Steve Reich, a point which Metheny and Mays overtly acknowledge in the liner notes.  Here again, this influence alludes to another path of Metheny's career, given that Reich composed an extended piece for Metheny, \\"Electric Counterpoint.\\"  Interestingly, \\"The Way Up\\" is Metheny's first CD with Nonesuch, also the label of the less-popular and less-marketable Reich, so the more cynical minded might suggest the whole \\"inspiration\\" as a marketing ploy.  But regardless of the inspiration, I kept wondering, given that the Reich references are so obvious, consisting of repeating rhythmic patterns that have become the composer's trademark, whether the Metheny/Mays lawyers met with the Reich lawyers at some point before the CD was released . . . .<br /><br />But having said all that, the Reich references are some of the brightest points of the CD, bringing the minimalist's palette into bright new contexts that shed new light on the musical styles of both sets composers.

B000002UAX|5.0|Reading through these reviews, I've come to realize that I've been completely misguided. Apparently good looks dictate whether or not you have talent. Who would've thunk it? <br /> <br />Despite the bad reviews from people who can barely know what groundbreaking is, much less appreciate good and groundbreaking music when they hear it, some of the reviews do have merit. While this album is one of, if not the greatest album of all time, it definitely has its misses. If it weren't for these misses, it would unquestionably be the greatest album ever made.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|South Park creators Parker and Stone have outdone themselves with this puppet show inspired in it's appearance by the wonderful Gerry Anderson \\"Supermarionation\\" TV show from the 1960's, Thunderbirds (available on DVD if you've never seen it). However, beyond the puppets and model aircraft, this show is nothing like a Gerry Anderson kids' show. The humor ranges from making fun of poor quality movies and bad acting to slamming extreme political views on both the right and left, and does a great job throughout the entire range.<br /><br />The only flaws in this film seem to come in the same area that is a problem in some episodes of South Park, which is that there is no self-restraint at all and some jokes are just crude or gross without being particularly clever or funny. However, those few scenes that left me and the rest of the audience cringing or silent were far outweighed by the ones where we laughed very loudly and for quite some time. Examples of some great moments are:<br /><br />-A whole song devoted to how bad the film Pearl Harbor was, how it missed the significance of that tragic event, and what a mediocre actor is Ben Affleck.<br /><br />- The awkardness of the puppets. Gerry Anderson used to go to great lengths to hide how funny it looked when the puppets walked, but Parker and Stone closely show you just how awkward the puppets are when walking and doing other human activities (e.g., having sex), to great comic effect.<br /><br />- Team America is eager to do good, but they \\"break\\" a lot of stuff doing it, often doing more damage than the bad guys they are chasing.<br /><br />- The song during the closing credits. It's hilarious, so be sure to stay through the credits and keep your ears open.<br /><br />In spite of its flaws, this is one of the sharpest comedies to come along in a while. The DVD version is loaded with extra features including \\"making of\\" documentaries about the process used for creating and animating the puppets. Go Team!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was given this CD by my brother.  Before that, I had maybe heard a part of the tunes on the radio.  When I played the CD for the first time, I was mesmerized. What a voice and what a way of performing.  Both my son and I played the CD more than once a day for several months.  I can't say that I have done that for a piece of music since Elvis. <br /> <br />A truly great performer!
6305041156|5.0|This is a cinematic masterpiece and just goes to show that a good story (adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear) is far superior to special effects (not that the effects are bad or anything).  Anyone iterested in Japanese samurai culture will love this.  Anyone who just loves good film will also enjoy it. I have loaned this to people who thought they had no interest and they raved about it. Highly recommended.
B0000640SA|5.0|I remember not liking this film that much after viewing it in the movie theatre, but that was because I didn't completely understand it. (I also was only about 12 years old). Unfortunately, when it was released on DVD I completely forgot about it, but I luckily chose to purcahse it a few days ago and am glad that I own it. I now appreciate it so much more. Memento, the innovative and intelligent thriller from Christopher Nolan was certainly one of the best films of 2001 and is one of my personal favorites.  Nolan is a gifted director and adapts a  screenplay based on a fascinatingly original short story written by his brother, Johnathan Nolan.         Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man seeking vengeance after his wife is raped and murdered.  Unfortunately, after the incident, he can't remember anything and is unable to create new memories.  The film is very unique for many reasons: great performances all around (especially from Joe Pantoliano as Teddy who just about steals the show from Pearce, also Carrie-Anne Moss who proves that she's more than just a pretty face and action star as Trinity from \\"The Matrix\\" and turns in a superb performance as Natalie.        The film is also told in reverse, and starts from the end.  This is not exactly a typical, mainstream film and is probably not for everyone.  Nolan is definetly a talented director, his more conventional follow-up \\"Insomnia,\\" (2002) was also great.    This is a film you will think about for awhile, it's not an easy film and it might take some time to figure it out.  It's essentially a puzzle.  This film easily rewards repeated viewings.  Memento, is a film-noir classic.  Nolan is moving  into different territory though with his next film, the highly anticipated \\"Batman Begins.\\"  That should most definetly be promising.  I own the regular edition of this film, which is fairly weak, so I suggest purchasing the delux, 2-disc edition. Overall, in my opinion, this is a film which is worth owning, but if you haven't seen it, definetly rent it.       Memento is rated R for Violence, Language and Some Drug Content.  The film features very little violence, mainly some gunplay, (some of which is bloody), a few punches here and there and quite a bit of profanity.  If you didn't like this film, it's probably because you didn't fully understand it, so I suggest seeing it again to fully grasp it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove is full of characters as big as all outdoors, and none are bigger than Robert Duvall's Augustus MacRae and Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call.<br /><br />Gus and Woodrow have been together for decades and their dynamic together is almost like an old married couple.  Gus is still young at heart and full of vinegar, with a sharp eye for the ladies.  It's not hard to imagine why women young and old keep a special place in their hearts for Gus in this story.  Woodrow, by contrast, is all business, with no desire for women nor \\"foolishness\\".<br /><br />They're tending a small corral just this side of the Rio Grande when their old riding partner Jake Spoon, played by Robert Urich rides up.  Jake tells Gus and Woodrow that Montana is a cattleman's paradise, and Woodrow gets a far-off look in his eyes as he dreams of one last adventure with his old friends, driving a herd of cows to Montana.  Gus can't be left behind by Woodrow, so to everyone's amusement Gus joins Woodrow's partnership.<br /><br />Along the way to Montana they meet bandits and snakes and indians and we hear about Gus' old love Clara, who's up in Nebraska.  Clara is played by Angelica Huston, and when we finally meet her in the second act we can see why even an old ladies man like Gus still carries a torch for her.<br /><br />Secondary roles are filled out by Chris Cooper, Danny Glover, Ricky Schroder, Diane Lane, Barry Corbin, Steve Buscemi, and others - and they make Larry McMurtry's world come alive.<br /><br />The first two thirds of this made-for-tv-miniseries is as good as any Western ever made.  The final act is a little dreary, especially considering the good times you enjoy with Gus and company leading up to the ending, but it's a fairly logical story conclusion, and I can't knock my overall rating down from 5 stars.
0811729117|3.0|There is no doubt Otto Carius was gutsy. He was also a good tanker. More outstanding than this, is his contempt for the US and his hypocrisy in condemning the Americans for things he praised his own countrymen for. Although he was a good tactician in the tank, Carius strangely believed that since the Germans had better armor that the US should not have depended on superior artillery and aircraft that hunted German tanks with the same impunity his tanks hunted defenseless infantry soldiers. My, how the hunters like Carius became the prey.<br /><br />Carius also hypocritically complained that the Generals were betrayers of the German people for possessing pistols in the presence of the Nazi leaders but too cowardly to use them, while he himself had a 30 minute private chat with Himmler while he possessed his sidearm unchecked and even made intimate friends with this Nazi war criminal as though he was a war hero. He is very forthright with his ridiculous criticism of Americans, who were within weeks of winning the war and both sides knowing it, not rushing his 128mm assault weapon when he opened fire with them from a defensive position.<br /><br />Unlike the Germans, the Americans and British had a value on each soldier and used discretion with their lesser armor. With this patience that Germany did not possess and could not afford, they managed to decimate the superior armor and air forces of Germany with devastating and demoralizing airpower and precise artillery. Carious himself, hid like a coward from the mere \\"possibility\\" of American fighters overhead by staying deeper and deeper into the Ruhr pocket praying any aircraft didn't see him. Carius claims his own fellow tankers were afraid to fire their superior armor weapons at the weaker American armor in fear of giving their position away to the prowling fighters in the area. This book shows how \\"effeminate\\" or \\"sissified\\" ALL armor was in comparison to lightweight and thin pieces of aluminum flying above. It is ironic how terrified of fighters the German tankers were. I was also ironic how he spewed his disdain for the American infantry and armor because they didn't dove in fox holes when he opened up on them in ambushes. He expected them to be foolish (which he calls brave) like the Russians ordering by a 180 pound man run at his 80 ton tank, while all of this time he is describing his contempt, he \\"hid\\" his 80 ton assault gun from the tiny 2 ton fighter aircraft that could possibly somewhere in the area.<br /><br />In Carius' often stated stupidity of his contempt, that the Americans should have been more \\"aggressive\\" is missing the basic knowledge of WWII of his opponent, of their D-Day invasions of duping the Germans into thinking the attack would happen in France not to mention the battle at Bastogne where a single American infantry group ill equipped both in ammo and winter clothing, held the might of 7 full panzer divisions at bay for a 10 days until Patton and 3rd Army could arrive to destroy them. Otto could use a little history lesson on the shameful slaughter of the mighty German tank general Rommel where he fled British and American forces who were \\"green\\" at tank warfare.<br /><br />His narrow-minded comments aside, the book is very interesting. If you like tanks and good tank tactics. This book is a good read. If you like war dominance, get a book by fighter aces like Francis S. Gabreski (P-47) or Chuck Yeager (P-51) and find out what kept tankers like Carius awake wishing they had joined another branch of the army. P-47's alone are credited with having destroyed over 8000 German tanks alone.is ironic how terrified of fighters the German tankers were.

B00079018K|1.0|This CD sounds great in the store but what they don't tell you online that is that this CD comes loaded with new software called Mediamax that doesn't allow consumers to transfer or burn songs off of the CD. What about the consumers that prefer to have their musical library stored on a single digital player like an ipod? The CD offers no way to convert songs to an ACC format. It would have at least been nice for BMG to have warned consumers online about this feature. I feel bad for Kasabian being that this is their debut album and all.
0385510454|1.0|I bought the hard cover book as I was expecting to read a good story.  There are a lot of interesting descriptions of Bologna, Italy and that I enjoyed.  BUT,the ending was stupid! There are several loose ends in the story and when I read the last page I thought there must be more, there HAD to be more, but there wasn't. I was really ticked off and I felt as though I had been cheated. Did he write this for a movie screenplay and the screenwriter will fill in the blanks? I agree with the reviewer that said several of our bestselling authors have been writing mediocre novels in recent years.

If your new to DaftPunk pick up \\"Homework\\" or \\"Discovery\\" first, then give this record a chance.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Ok...that was lame. I apologize. I really liked this movie. I won't repeat all the comments already posted, but this film reminded me of a cross between \\"Seven\\" and Vincenzo Natali's \\"Cube\\" (if you haven't seen Cube, I recommend that as well. But avoid the sequel and recent prequel!) <br />The ending is just twisted enough to surprise, but not so out of left field, it leaves you wondering what you missed!
B0006284JQ|5.0|Ok I'm tired of everyone dissing Britney. Like others have said before, if you don't like her music, simply don't buy it or listen to it. This album has some really good songs. I also admit that I didn't like Britney much at first. Her first album was a bit bland and then her music got better with each new album she made.  <br /> <br />My perogative may not be the best cover ever made, but I do have to say it's a lot better than Jessica Simpson's cover of Berlin's \\"Take my breath away.\\" My perogative didn't catch my attention at first, but as I listend to it, I liked it more.  <br /> <br />Toxic is one if not my favorite track on the whole album. The beat is different from other Britney songs and it's a great tune to dance to. Other favorites of mine are \\"i'm a slave 4u\\" which has a sexy urban beat, Boys, Overprotected, Do Somethin'- which always makes me dance and the beautiful love ballad \\"eveytime, which to me is also one of Britney's best. Let's not forget \\"I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, another classic. <br /> <br />Overall, buy this album if you're a Britney Fan, if not then why do you even bother to listen to her and diss her?
B0007N1AI6|5.0|After a Fight or Two, and not to mention some Demolition along the way, Rob Halford has returned to Judas Priest with \\"Angel of Retribution\\", and upon listening to the first track alone, it sounds as if he never left.  Opening track \\"Judas is Rising\\" isn't just the beginning of the band going back to their roots, it's a declaration: pulse pounding real metal fueled by powerful guitar riffs, double bass drums, and the classic Halford scream.  No cursing, no overly cheesy lyrics, just the balls to the wall classic sound that made Judas Priest one of the most revered bands in the genre.  \\"Deal With the Devil\\" and lead single \\"Revolution\\" are solid more mainstream aimed tracks, but \\"Demonizer\\", \\"Wheels of Fire\\", and the closing \\"Lochness\\" are superb tracks that are a more than welcome return to form for the band.  With Halford back in the fold, it is clear that Priest has once again found their heart: something they didn't have with Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens (no disrespect to him though, he's an excellent vocalist, but without Halford's songwriting the band suffered), and \\"Angel of Retribution\\" is without a doubt the best metal album of the year so far.  The bonus DVD included here features reunion tour footage, and though this edition of the album may be more pricy than the DualDisc, this is definitely the better buy.  Hail hail, Judas Priest is back.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I'm not going to diss britney but this album is not her best. Some tracks are good like 'dont go knocking on my door, oops..., stronger (the best song0. I think this album lacked more of Britney's realism. Overall it's ok to listen to for a while but it gets boring really fast.
1401301010|5.0|This book wasn't absolutely thrilling but Anthony and his co-writer deserve 5 stars for telling the unvarnished gritty unapologetic truth. Celebrities and especially rock stars seem to have nine lives when it comes to their blood sucking addictions; I guess it takes longer to hit rock bottom when you are still finding a way to millions of dolllars. Drug dealers don't work on credit... <br />   When he's a kid he's pure charm and I can see how easily he finds damsels who are still energetic enough to be the perfect young and nubile co-dependant. As time goes on the girlfriends become a litttle less naive amd more opportunistic , until the last \\"soul mate \\" turns out to be a bigger junkie than Anthony himself.This dangerous combination helps to create a combustible relapse for both of them. Still, there is something very animated likeable and sincere about this guy,I hope that sobriety and wisdom will color the second half of his life.
B00000IL26|5.0|If you have to read this review, you're not (yet?) a serious jazz fan.  Jazz experts know, this is one of the best jazz albums ever, every track a masterpiece from one the genre's true giants.  Morgan's \\"Sidewinder\\" is recognizable to even those who aren't familiar with jazz.  If you're curious about jazz, here's a no-brainer, pick up \\"Sidewinder\\" and \\"Cornbread,\\" and if these are the only two jazz albums you ever own, you're still going to have a pretty good jazz collection.
B0006J28BO|4.0|The Cat Returns is a cute and charming animated feature that's on a different leaque than other big budget Hollywood animated films such as Shrek and Shark Tales. It's style is pleasing to viewers who wants a more sketchy look rather than realism that's done by advanced technology. Afterall, it's intended to target children audiences, and if you are a child at heart, or if you are a cat lover like myself, than it's still worth-while to see it for fun. My Baby was quite hyper when he heard the sounds of many cats during my viewing of this film!<br /><br />It really is a simple story about a girl(Haru) who saved a prince cat from getting ran over on the street, and the Cat King wanted to repay her by offering a marriage proposal to the prince. She thought it was a joke, and ignored the cats, because she's human. She eventually seeked the help of a great big white cat(Muta), the Crow, and the Baron to fight against the forceful kingdom. She was magically transformed into a half human cat by the power of King Cat at the Palace, and she tried to escaped before it was too late for her to return to her true human form. Will the Prince return to the Palace on time to intervent the Cat King from this disastrous nightmare and help Haru return to her homeland?<br /><br />The film is reasonably enjoyable, but it lacked intensity in it's story. Nonetheless, it's less than 80 mins, and it's finished before you know it.
B000000LZV|5.0|If one were to pick the Minutemen's top album this would be it. In other words, it is their \\"Nevermind\\", as it's their most pop-oriented and listener friendly major release, not to say that their other albums aren't amazing as well. <br />  The Minutemen were named that because, well, most of their songs fall short of the two minute barrier, but for this style of music, having songs go over that mark would be, well, too much and overbearing. 'Double Nickels' is a fusion of punk, pop, funk, rock, and country all in one, all the while accompanied by D. Boon's melodic and cool voice. At times the tempo is slow, other times fast paced, but always fitting the song. Transitions on some songs in tempo could be worked on as other reviewers have mentioned, but that shouldn't detract from the album at all. This album, containing an astonishing 42 tracks, has everything from soft ballads (\\"History Lesson Part II\\") to blazing punk anthems (such as the well known 'Jackass' them \\"Corona\\"), all the way to the funk-filled diddlies (\\"Anxious Mofo\\").  <br />  Even though a lot of the lyrics are political, some tongue-in-cheek, D. Boon does a great job of conveying the emotion of the lyrics AND the music into the listeners minds, topped off by the fact that the music is catchy, and it is the perfect formula for and incredible album that will have you listening again and again. This is punk at it's FINEST in the eighties, but as well is free-form and not bound by the usual standard punk cliches and sounds.  <br />   If you are looking for an album that's full of passion and emotion packed into a 42 song swirl of indie rock, this is your ticket there, courtesy of D. Boon.
0060730552|3.0|I think that this book was alright it was a little confusing at times because i didn't understand words of  some of the equipment that was used. I rated this book 3 stars because it got boring and i wanted to stop reading. The end was the best part when he finally survived. I picked to read this book because it is kind of amzmaing how it is about a true person going though torture just to survive and come out with his life.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I really enjoyed The Mars Volta's last album, \\"De-loused in the Comatorium,\\" and I'm a big fan of the old school prog rock (70's Genesis, Yes, King Crimson, ELP, etc), but I'm quite disappointed in their latest effort, \\"Frances the Mute.\\"  I do prefer long songs and epic, \\"concept\\" albums, and I like artists who explore and do different things, but it seems to me that TMV is trying way too hard to be progressive, being odd just for the sake of being odd, because no one else is like that anymore.  I've listened to the album many times since I bought it, but I just keep getting bored in numerous places.  I like to think that I'm fairly tolerant - being a fan of extreme types of metal and noise bands - and while there really is no \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" way to music, this album just doesn't feel right to me.  It feels forced.    That said, much of this album sounds just like early King Crimson, but with better production and a slight Latin feel in certain places.  The guys in TMV insist they are not prog and don't want to be categorized...sorry to burst the bubble, guys, but this is prog rock, plain and simple.  A lot has been done before, from KC to Pink Floyd to Yes.  There's a lot of \\"improvised\\" sections, viz. strange background noise / keyboards for minutes at a time, which detract from the album more than add to it, in my opinion.  Around ten minutes of the album is devoted to this soft, esoteric noise, placed in 2+ minute chunks at the end of tracks.  I wouldn't mind if it fit in (like the 2 minute \\"noise\\" break during \\"Cicatriz ESP\\", from their previous album), but a lot of it doesn't.  I guess I just don't \\"get it.\\"  It feels like they added that stuff in just the make the CD 70+ minutes long.    But regardless, for those well-versed in prog rock lore, there's not much new territory covered here - at least not compared to \\"De-loused.\\"    On the positive side, Omar's guitar playing is creative and top-notch, the lyrics are still obscure and over-metaphorical (someeven in Spanish) and the drummer really earns his paycheck.    The last \\"song\\" on the CD, \\"Cassandra Gemini,\\" is the best by far, and at 30+ minutes, comes close to vindicating the purchase of the CD.  However, I'm constantly annoyed at bands who split up a song into multiple tracks on a CD but list it as one \\"song\\" on the insert.  Please decide.  It is either 1 song or 8 short songs that run together.  The only reason to split it up is to provide a single for radio play.  And it doesn't help that \\"Cassandra Gemini\\" has 5 parts, according to the insert, yet it is split into 8 tracks.  Annoying.  But the \\"song\\" is still pretty awesome.    I have also noticed many reviewers calling this album a \\"masterpiece.\\"  I have a very difficult time calling it that.  Just because you have a 30 minute song doesn't mean the album is a masterpiece.  Justifying long passages of noise or whatnot by saying the band is \\"challenging\\" the listener is a lazy and pretentious excuse.  Anyone can put 2 minutes of street noise in a song and call it music.  I can tap a pencil against a desk for 2 minutes, put it on a CD and when people say they don't understand it, I can shrug it off with, \\"Well, I guess you're just not enlightened enough, but it makes sense to me, and it is music.\\"  I think true masterpieces are albums which challenge the listener by experimenting within the bounds of structured music (even improvised music has an underlying structure) and by twisting with our concept of it.  TMV does this on occasion throughout \\"Frances the Mute,\\" but as a whole album, they do not, in my opinion.  If you start adding in whatever \\"sounds\\" you want, viz. street noise, birds chirping, etc, then the word \\"music\\" ceases to have definition, and music itself becomes nothing but a bunch of sound that has no meaning.  You have to draw the line somewhere.    Anyways, end rant.  Bottom line is, if you like prog rock, you'll probably like this.  I would recommend their previous album, \\"De-loused in theComatorium,\\" over this, though.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|The movie looked awesome, too bad I couldn't understand any of it because it wasn't in ENGLISH!!  The DVD case makes it look like a bootleg anyways, there's hardly anything to it.  The subtitles are horrible, you can't even understand what's going on half the time, it's like they were written by a third grader or something.  Beautiful movie though, wish I could understand Japanese because it looked really impressive.
0553582445|5.0|For those of you that loved The Farseer trilogy and are worried that the second trilogy starring FitzChivalry will blunder into the same trap that many authors blunder into - going to the well too often and writing a sub-par story........Fear not. <br /> <br />This book is simply fantastic from the opening page to the back cover. I loved the first trilogy and I think this book is the most interesting of any starring Fitz. Highly reccommended
B00079FUI6|5.0|I LOVED SEX AND THE CITY AND I WAS VERY DISAPPONTED WHEN IT WAS OVER.  DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES IS A GREAT AND AWESOME REPLACEMENT FOR THIS SHOW AND EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THIS WILL ATTRACT A BIGGER AUDIENCE.  IT IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV NOW.....THUMBS UP FOR THE WRITER........
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|I didn't think I'd like this movie very much since I had seen the original (Japanese version) much earlier and loved it so much.  I don't think I'm being unfair in my assessment of this remake, despite my prejudice.  The cast is worthy of much better, and the dance scenes, though brief, were not bad, but the overall reason I give this only 3 stars is because the main theme of the original \\"Shall We Dance\\" was that the man hides his lessons from his wife because in Japan public dancing is considered obscene or shameful; that's not the case in America and I don't feel they really gave a good excuse why Richard Gere would hide his lessons from Susan Sarandon - thereby negating the reason for the movie - other than trying to cash in on a Japanese success.  I gave one extra star to the overall rating for the dialogue between Susan Sarandon's character and the detective when she describes what marriage meant to her.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've been following a few threads about Moulin Rouge for a few weeks. I saw the movie and I can't say I found it religious. But I did find it very spiritual. It does teach lessons about love being stronger than death and how life always moves on. And it did seem very much eastern in a way. The maharaja is suppossed to be Indian I believe. What I liked most is how good the movie was in showing the power of true love. This is a classic already in my book.
B0007O38F8|5.0|First of all let me say that people who give this album below 4 stars did'nt listen to the album,hate 50 cent(Jadakiss,Fat Joe,Nas diss. Did I mention Game) or just don't know what good music is. <br />I must admit that when I listened to this album at first I was'nt that impressed because I just scanned through the tracks but on really listening the songs again I realized that its another \\"50 classic\\". <br />My favourite songs are - I'm Supposed To Die Tonight,Piggy Bank,Ski Mask Way,Baltimore Love Thing,Ryder Music,My Toy Soilder,Position Of Power,Build You Up,God Gave Me Style,I Don't Need Em,Just A Lil Bit. <br />I didn't really like In My Hood cause of how he changed his voice(Never really listined to it though,always skiped it,so maybee its also a great song). <br />Hopefully you haters out there will listen the album and stop frontin,you'll just be letting another great album pass you by.
B000669GAI|5.0|By and large the best possible compilation of songs by the most enduring band of the grunge scene, \\"Rearview Mirror\\" encapsulates the meteoric rise and steadfast production of perhaps the most influential acts of the '90's, Pearl Jam (yes, I went there--sorry Nirvana purists.  While many Pearl Jam enthusiasts might bemoan this collection (\\"oh, not 'Jeremy' again!\\" they wail), the truth is that the gems included on this album are exactly that--the greatest \\"hits,\\" the radio songs that put this phenomenal band on the map. No doubt, some truly great songs are left off--songs that act as a barrier between the \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" chanting fratboy fan and the head-nodding, \\"I know better,\\" grunge-clad appreciator.  Radio overplay and popularity should not detract from the brilliance of songs such as \\"Alive\\" and \\"Evenflow;\\" sure radio played the hell out of them, and yes, even if we don't want to, we know the songs by heart.  But \\"Rearview Mirror\\" is not designed to unearth long-lost songs; that was \\"Lost Dogs.\\"  Instead, this album acts to introduce a new era of fans to a band that has been lost in the watered-down, overly pop corporate scene currently called the \\"music industry,\\" while at the same time taking even the oldest Pearl Jam fan back to a time when Starbucks had not taken over, George Bush Jr. was running the Texas Rangers into the ground (as opposed to, say, the United States of America), and the brilliance and passion of music seemed endless.  That, to me, is more than sufficient.
0060575816|5.0|I just finished Sabriel the other day(March 19, 2005). At the end, be4 i read the epilogue, i wanted to scream and a part of me wanted to cry. The end is very emotional. The plot: other reviewers have stated that the plot is sluggish. Well, yes in some parts which happens in most every book there is. There is always gonna be slow parts to books where there is no action and not much is happeding. The charcter developing is great. I felt like i acually knew Sabriel. Garth Nix knows how to create suspense. The conversations between Mogget and Touchstone that reveal that there is more to both of than meets the eye, i wanted to no what was going on between the two. I loved the Old Kingdom and i hope Lirael and Abhorsen are as good. If i like them, then 1 more Garth Nix series will be added to my collection(The Seventh Tower series are great, u should read them) I need to start reading the Keys to the Kingdom which is also by Garth Nix.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, i love his movies and think they are so well done. This movie however is less violent than the first, and i thank him for that, because the first movies violence was to explicit, bloody, and just over the top gore with very little plot, i thought it could have been better, so i was dreading to watch this movie in fear it would be the same thing. However, it turned out to be much different, and is just a wonderful action/thriller rich in surprise, dark humor, and action sequences that will blow your mind!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|You have to look at this album with an open mind.  I heard some bad things about this album, but I approached it with a very open mind free of any expectations.  I'd say I came away from my first listen quite satisfied and definitely wanting more.  This album is NOT Homework and it is definitely NOT Discovery, so get that out of your head before you even buy the album (and please do, it is worth buying this one).  It is, however, better than a lot of the stuff that's being put out these days. <br /> <br />Not too many people were impressed with Discovery when it first came out, which I never really understood.  It seems to be a continuing trend to dislike Daft Punk's latest work and Human After All seems to be no different, but while I don't believe this album is as good as Discovery or Homework... it is different and change is good.  Just goes to show Daft Punk are still pioneering what little is left to pioneer in dance music.  Don't expect the Discovery sound, don't expect the Homework sound... expect Human After All. <br /> <br />Human After All - A good track for the intro.  It seems pretty repetitive, but it is very infectious and quite unique sounding with a brilliant blending of the trademark vocoder vocals and the guitar. <br /> <br />Primetime of Your Life - A fairly short track, but a really really good one.  I believe its main purpose is to build up to Robot Rock... which it does quite nicely.  It starts off very psychadelic and then moves into a gradually quickening beat which eventually becomes too fast to comprehend before it comes out and introduces us all to Robot Rock. <br /> <br />Robot Rock - The 'featured track' of the album is so infectious and, well, rockin... you'll have it stuck in your head for days.  Definitely an enjoyable track.  It has a guitar 'lead' loop that never really seems to get old with backing drums that fit perfectly.  Vocoderized vocals again here that blend in with the guitar.. sounds incredibly cool in its effect. <br /> <br />Steam Machine - Awesome.  Strikes me as a fairly dark and groovin track but I'm not even sure how to describe this one.  You have to hear it. <br /> <br />Make Love - This albums version of Something About Us, I would say.  Features an interesting blend of guitar plucks, piano, and drum kit... but the vocals are more background ambience than anything.  Really nice track. <br /> <br />The Brainwasher - Really an insane track from the very beginning.  I'd definitely say this is in the same vein as Superheroes, but as with Make Love, it is similar but very much in its own unique way.  This one will make your head spin, very intoxicating. <br /> <br />On/Off - Nothing really to say, just a segue into Television Rules the Nation.  Different voices, different languages, channel changing, then the TV turns off. <br /> <br />Television Rules the Nation - This is the hardest track for me to get into on the album.  It's pretty simplistic in the beginning, featuring an alternating 4/4 house beat of bass and deep punchy snare.  A heavy guitar-synth sound comes in with some vocoder vocals, but I'd have to say it doesn't really add much to the track.  The drop comes around 2:40, but doesn't accomplish anything really.  The track may grow on me, but this is my initial take on it.  Least favorite track on the album. <br /> <br />Technologic - From the beginning the track resembles a mixture of several tracks off Homework.  As it progresses it begins to take on its own form.  Track grows on you quick.  It's not too complex really, I'd say the beauty of this track is in its simplicity really. <br /> <br />Emotion - Daft Punk always has (well at least on their past 2 albums) closed their albums with brilliance (Alive and Too Long being among my favorite Daft Punk songs).  Emotion gets off to a fairly slow start for its 7 minute frame.  It's definitely one of those somber endings to the album.  This one will likely grow on you faster than Television Rules the Nation will, but at first listen it's not too remarkable.  Features an effected vocal throughout the track that only says \\"emotion,\\" which at times does sound very cool.  The track may just chug along too slow for its own good, but I'd have to say that I like it. <br /> <br />Five Stars because in the end, this really is a brilliant album and a great addition to the Daft Punk collection.  If you've ever heard any of Daft Punk's DJ mix sets or have seen them live then you know how varied their own musical taste is.  This album only expands upon what they can do as composers and producers of original music.  I can't stress this enough, you have to look at this album with open eyes and listen with open ears.  In three years I will probably still be playing this as much as I play Discovery and Homework now.  Don't let the hype fool you, Human After All is a good album - a very Daft Punk record.
0312330855|5.0|If you ever wanted to be a vet... \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" will either inspire, or send you running off to be a lawyer. Heartwarming, funny, sad and highly educational, James Herriot's debut biography (he wrote five in all) give readers the whole messy, glorious picture of being a 1940s country veterinarian.<br /><br />The book opens (after a brief chapter taking place several months later) with James arriving in Yorkshire, to be the assistant to the eccentric but kindly Siegfried Farnon (yes, that is his name). He becomes accustomed to Siegfried, Siegfried's mischievous younger brother Tristan (yes, that is his name), and the gruff, kindly farmers who eke out a living in the Yorkshire Dales.<br /><br />Among the oddballs James encounters: Pampered pooches, savage pigs who chase Tristan around the farm, a nightmarishly strict secretary who drives Siegfried up the wall, James's brakeless car, cows running on three cylinders, a sadistic vet who makes James wear a rubber bodysuit, and an elderly, immensely wealthy widow who adopts a pig. And through this, James falls in love with the beautiful Helen Alderson and worms his way into the trust of the farmers.<br /><br />James Herriot (real name, James Wight) was truly a one-of-a-kind man. He let readers into his head throughout the book, where the cows kick him across the yard, farmers often treat him as an interloper or a nuisance, and his boss gives contradicting orders from one day to the next. But he never loses his drive or his love of animals. Okay, he hates some animals, but only as individuals.<br /><br />He even lets the readers see him at his worst, when he's humiliated by some recalcitrant livestock, and one horrible scene where he and his date show up drunk and mud-smeared in front of the girl he adores. (Not to mention when Tristan got him to use very feminine-smelling bath salts) But don't think that all of these stories are funny or romantic -- quite a few are aggravating or outright sad. James didn't soften the blows at all.<br /><br />There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia. For example, what is a torsion? Herriot tells you early on, when he documents his nerve-wracking first case. But more than that, his love of animals is infectious -- it's easy to come out of this with a new appreciation for ordinary dogs, cows, cats, and so on.<br /><br />The people around James are just as fantastic: Siegfried, his weird but genial boss who can kick Tristan out of the house and forget about it overnight; Tristan, the mischievous anti-scholar who usually manages to keep out of trouble; and Helen, who seems a little too saintly at times (which isn't surprising, since James married her).<br /><br />It's sweet, sad, funny, romantic, dramatic, and full of the blood and sweat of vet work. \\"All Creatures Great And Small\\" is a truly unique and heartwarming biography.ames didn't soften the blows at all.  <br /> <br />There are a lot of details about surgery and animal care that will nauseate the squeamish, but at least you'll learn a lot of medical trivia.

038542471X|4.0|This is a great action book.  It involves an 11-year-old kid who finds himself in the middle of a mob war.  He witnesses a suicide where he finds out the information to what the mob needs.  They're after him making sure he doesn't say a word and he has a lawyer who protects him from everything.
B000001GQT|2.0|I have heard many performances of Also Sprach over the years and this '74 Karajan has never impressed me as anything other than a superficial audio demo to test system dynamic range. As a performance the homogenised cushion of string tone that became such a fetish of Karajan serves to rob the music of most inner textural detail rendering a lifeless and flat musical result. Recently I closely compared the two Reiner/Chicago recordings to see how much difference there was, and included Karajan's 1959 Vienna Phil. as well as this recording for comparison. There was not the slightest doubt that the '74 Deutsche version came last. Karajan's earlier Decca recording is markedly superior - so much more of Strauss' orchestration can be heard, giving the music far greater power and vibrancy. Reiner's '54 (stereo) version is slightly better than the later '62, which is on a par with the VPO Karajan - but this '74 BPO is not in the running. Karl Bhm recorded a better version with the same orchestra, not to mention others that also outclass this DG Karajan.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is beyond genius - as most of the reviews for it seem to agree. Though I could easily just go on, I am writing this because there is rather a lot of confusion over the tracklist for this album. <br /> <br />There are five songs - <br /> <br />1. Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus - 13:08  <br />2. The Widow - 5:57 <br />3. L'Via L'Viaquez - 12:27 <br />4. Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore - 13:09 <br />5. Cassandra Geminni - 32:32  <br /> <br />The final song, Cassandra Geminni, has been split into eight parts because of difficulties the band had with their label, Universal (no pretentious, prog-rock reason, it's standard label-getting-in-the-way stuff). Miranda, That Ghost... is only one track, track 4. Ignore what Realplayer or iTunes tells you, this is the correct track list.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I first saw this film, when it arrived at public theatre's. I almost went to a free viewing with friends but never got around to it. The first time I saw it, was by myself, and I thought it was an intelligent film, (not for people who don't pay attention when they watch a movie) I heard many criticisms about this film, and how it was so difficult to figure out? In actuality, it was very easy to figure out, if you just paid attention. The second time I watched this film was also in theatre's and I was on a date. When the movie ended, my date turned to me and said SO DAVID GALE DID KILL HIS FRIEND AFTER ALL. That made me so mad. He completely and utterly missed the point of the entire film. How stupid can you be. The ending revealed all your questions. David never killed his collegue. She was terminally ill, and the three of them, including david which the last tape that he sent to bitzy at the end clearly showed) they all conspired to set up david, to show that the system is flawed and the death penalty executed an innocent man. Their careers were dedicated to the anti death penalty issue, and they had a difficult time getting their points across when they were alive, so dying for what they believed in is what they all decided to do. Except for the cowboy. She killed herself, because she was dying anyway, and she felt it important to die demonstrating the flaws in the system. They proved it was very easy to set up a person who was innocent, and very easy for the system to make a mistake by executing an innocent person. It's as simple as that. One critic called this film MORALLY BANKRUPT. But he obviously wasnt paying attention to what the movie was really about. The compassion of human beings being given the death penalty, and to preserve life, even when a person has been convicted. The fact that they are still human beings. That's not morality? That is how the anti death penalty activists felt. The movie was depressing, but I'm a huge fan of kevin Spacey, and I wasmoved by his compassionate character. He is a very talented actor.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|After reading some positive press info about Behemoth in a magazine I decided to give this album a try. Now this is my first Behemoth cd and after hearing this one I will definitely look into their older cds as well. Everything blends together so well on here that it is simply amazing. The instruments sound great alongside with the fantastic vocals and every song is great too. I have heard some people complain about the vocals sounding a little artificial but they sound just fine to me. Anyways, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deathmetal cd than this is one so go get this ASAP!
B00068IOWC|3.0|Well, what can I say? It's not U2's best, they are still my favourite band, but this album didn't help at all with that. This is one of those albums that major fans will want to forget in the future. <br /> <br />Vertigo is at most a mediocre song, it's fun to listen for the first 2 or so times, but then you notice that Bono can't really say \\"four\\" in spanish, and that kinda takes the fun away.
0670033375|4.0|Collapse takes on the incredibly complex subject of why certain human societies have perished in the past and extracts lessons we can apply to our current globalized society.  Diamond analyzes extinct societies by applying a set of five criteria (natural climate change, human exploitation of resources, allies, enemies, and the society's response when faced with collapse).  These societies don't include Rome, Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, the Soviet Union, etc. - after all, descendents of these societies are still around.  The peoples that Diamond discusses have by and large disappeared because they overextended themselves beyond the resources available to them.    Diamond then examines four modern societies - China, Australia, Rwanda, and Haiti - which face dire environmental challenges and their prospects for overcoming them.  It may not be for everyone, but I like the way he provides a lot of numbers and statistics to quantify the impact of modern societies on our resources.  The information he uses is similar to that found in Guns, Germs, and Steel (a book I enjoyed immensely), but Collapse is less of a history and more of a reality check - as our global society aspires to First World living standards, we must realize that we're going to push the limits of our planet's resources sooner than we think.  This book is a great starting point for discussions on how to cope with this dilemma.
B000001ZS3|5.0|So begins Jean Michel Jarre's long circular path that, at the time of this writing, will end with Aero.  This path has been illuminated with motifs running from clocks and time-stasis, to seasons and revolutions, from deep space to deep oceans, to advances in stereo and 5.1 surround technologies.<br /><br />And what better place to begin than with the motif that is most required for human life, the one-third essence of water, and a tiny fraction of our atmosphere: oxygen.  Jarre's first solo album is an aural presentation of burning stars, atmosphere formation, light refraction and the colors thereof, density of air, life, and finally proof of life: wind.  To feel the wind blowing on one's face...an image represented by the intro and outro to Oxygene 6.<br /><br />Jarre has said that the surprising success of Oxygene was due to its dissociation with similar electronic works released in the 70s.  Rather than focus on short loops and patterns, he expanded his ideas (somewhat deviantly) from the classical form, resulting in a technique that ebbs and flows, morphs and variates.  Ever true to the electronic limits of his time, Jarre cannot simply remove all blips and beeps, but embodies these textures with the grace of a divinely-inspired man (he has said so himself!).<br /><br />Oxygene presents these incorporated motifs of colliding atoms and fleeting particles over smooth, glass-like melodic themes.  The effect is profound: like drifting.<br /><br />And while Jarre has never been happy with current technologies, feeling limited by stereo in that the listener can never be fully immersed into his soundscapes, his audience can hardly complain.  His music has allowed us to delve into worlds we've only dreamed of, unrealized until now.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|CUBE was pretty darn good.  CUBE 2 was a lesser movie, but was faithful enough to the premise and allowed us a peek outside the cube at who or what might have been pulling the strings.<br /><br />CUBE ZERO offers us more outside-the-cube looks, but in a very unsatisfying way.  And the character Jax, a disfigured middle-manager type who runs roughshod over the technicians monitoring and (in some case) manipulating activity in the cube, is played WAY too broadly and looks too damn silly to be effective.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of CUBE 2 but I liked what the ending hinted at:  a large corporate and military entity with unethical evil on their minds.  CUBE ZERO tries to have some degree of ominousness to it, but it just doesn't play out well enough.<br /><br />If this is the direction the series is heading, they should stop now.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Where Jarre spent only three months mixing his Oxygene album, Equinoxe required an estimated seven months.  I believe I can safely say that the effort was well worth the trouble.  I have recently re-discovered this album, only to listen to it more frequently than the Oxygene album.  The latter, while groundbreaking at the time, is a splendid atmospheric saunter.  Equinoxe, on the other hand, is a symphonic dance, one where Jarre has found his niche and continues to expand on his ideas of Earth-inspired melodies.<br /><br />Every track has something to offer.  Jarre's current modus operandi is based on the two equinoxes: vernal (spring), which occurs on March 21, and autumnal on September 23.  Jarre will revisit these months 25 years later with his Sessions 2000 release, on which two tracks are titled March 23 and September 14.  (Jarre's influences do not escape him: two other tracks on Sessions are titled for the months of the solstices.)<br /><br />The idea of the equinox is vaster than that of, say, oxygen.  Where his first album played on the sounds of wind, air, light, and space, an equinox occurs when the sun is aligned with the equator.  The Earth will be immersed in light for 12 hours during the day, and submerged in darkness for 12 hours at night, equilibrium of life.  Spring announces new life, and re-growth; autumn is the preparation for survival, or the expectation of death.<br /><br />Jarre carefully avoids references to death, but doesn't hesitate to utilize the idea of life.  Weather is ubiquitous in nature, inevitable even on uninhabited planets.  Jarre incorporates these themes into his music, the most recognizable being the thunderstorm on Equinoxe 8.  The prelude in this track will soon become a famous concert favorite: L'Orchestre sous la pluie (Band in the Rain), performed to great effect on a Barrel organ.<br /><br />Blatant on Equinoxe 6, Jarre reverts to a more old-fashioned electronica approach to the music, almost taking a step back from his previous album.  In so doing, there is a familiarity invoked from the haunting Deserted Palace album.  The track is still a step forward, but makes a grateful nod to the history of electronica.  Still, note that Equinoxe 6 is almost a slow motion foreshadowing of Magnetic Fields 1.<br /><br />By this time, Jarre has polished the idea of a concept album, keeping a similar theme, or a certain key or tempo, through all the tracks.  The leitmotif is an undercurrent of a dark musical passage.  He also blends the tracks together, ultimately creating a 40-minute rhapsody.  What he brings from Oxygene is the familiar swooshing of oceanic air, and a more refined bubbling effect.  Those high-pitched time-compressed tones -- like crystalline leaves on aspens in the breeze -- are formally standardized in this album, becoming a trademark that can be heard in nearly all his albums henceforth.here is a familiarity invoked from the haunting Deserted Palace album.

B00008MNYS|5.0|How Robbie isn't the biggest star in America is a real shame. <br />For a point of reference let me just say I hate \\"pop\\" music.  <br />I have never been a fan of it and probably never will be, but Robbie Williams is SO good he cannot be ignored. People in America, do yourself a favor and get this album. There isn't a bad song on here, as a matter of fact I haven't heard a bad song he's recorded. From top to bottom this album starts out great and just keeps getting better. My wife made fun of me when I got hooked on Robbie and has since become a devoted fan herself. Also do yourself a favor and get his live DVD's (What We Did Last Summer -Knebworth; The Robbie Williams Show and Robbie Live at Albert Hall) you will quickly be hooked on this fantastic performer.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Do you remember when you first picked up Homework? I put it in my car stereo, and frankly didn't quite know what to think. What was all the hype about?? (I asked myself). Well that little creeper warmed it's way into my heart and my booty, eventually becoming one of my all time favorites. I remember partys where certain tracks (you know which) brought the house DOWN. It was like a bomb hit. Although I just bought Human After All, let's try and understand that everyone's favorite house/techno outfit is human. Let's all us old-schoolers (and not you playa haters) give this one a chance. I think it will need more than 1 or 2 listens, but you may find yourself utterly surprised.
B00005JLR8|4.0|At our house we see about 50 movies a month and this one is well above average. I doubt the angst of family catharsis is the trait that will give this film the greatest lasting value, although the emphasis on emotional storyline is not to be discounted.<br /><br />What will make this film memorable 10 years from now, in my opinion, are the performacnces of the two daughters, Christy and Ariel, played by real life sisters Sara and Emma Bolger, respectively. In particular, Christy's performance transcends all other in this lovely little film about an immigrant family coming to a new land and finding a way over its own tragedy -- the death of a son and brother.<br /><br />Christy's work is more than good acting; it is magical. She regularly performs magic both in the character and in the story, magic that transcends an AIDS patient into a loving neighbor and magic that helps her dad overcome his own emotional demons. Christy gets a lot of help in the movie from good lines in the script, exceptional lighting, and wonderful direction.<br /><br />Together with her younger sister's charm and infectious joy, they transform the residents of their \\"junkie building\\" into a nice group of neighbors that might be just like your own. These girls regularly breathe life and sustenance into matierial that might otherwise seem wayward, depressing and, frankly, dull.<br /><br />So all praise to these girls, who made this little film into something pretty mighty that told a remarkable tale of broken hearts, challenges and torment and turned it into something magical.
0380002930|5.0|Many have described and debated this incredible novel, but I am here to tell you one thing and one thing only. This book is incomparable and will haunt you lovingly for the rest of your life.
B000002JSV|5.0|This album ROCKS!!!!From the opening notes of Rock'n'Roll Damnation to the final notes of Kicked in the Teeth,this album is the best.This is Acording to the Young brothers,there favorite album.Strange,though  that it is so underrated.If you're looking for a hardcore AC/DC album THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!
B000063UR2|4.0|I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least twenty times so I can't tell you how excited I was to get the directores cut. But I was completly disapointed, the extra dialoge was ridiculous and the original music is way to dramatic it didn't fit the movie at all. Even the extra scenes didn't fit with the rest of the story it made it drag on so long that I didn't even finish watching it. If you have never seen this movie watch the theatrical version first, you will definatly see why the directores cut was disliked.
B000002JSZ|5.0|WOW!,if you like AC/DC you'll love this album!This is one of those albums that is in that raw rock state.This was releaced in 1983 after the back to back scuces of BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK.This is a great album from RISING POWER to the frantic album closer BRAIN SHAKE.Thease are songs you con boogi to,some of AC/DC's best.And the soloes,oh the soloes are aswem,and on songs like DEEP IN THE HOLE Angus sounds like he's ripping his strings out!All around,a mighty fine rock album!!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|...but do not expect Discovery! Whereas Discovery is a song-y soundtrack to a space opera, Human After All is a dark, cold groove machine. The darkly humorous fun is there to be had but it`s better if you come with an open mind and few expectations.  <br /> <br />A terrific album that I`ll be listening to for a long time!
B000002JS0|5.0|I am a fan of the Bon Scott ara,and to me , this is a good Bon album.My favorite song in ITS A LONG WAY TO THE TOP because Bon plays a part along with Angus,on get ready for this, the bagpipes.The pipes sound suprisingly good playing with the guitars.This album also features one of my favourite songs,THE JACK.The rest of the album is also good,featuring songs like HIGH VOLTAGE,T.N.T,and LIVE WIRE.A good rock album!!
B0006SSOHC|1.0|Wow, movies today are getting more repulsive and disgusting by the minute. No wonder we have so much teenage violence. This movie goes way too far as far as blood and gore goes. I mean, we dont need to watch some guy sawing his leg off and getting shot in the head. Directors are just trying anything they can to get a rise out of people these days, its pathetic. Save your money.
B00025ETIW|2.0|Before you buy this album, go and buy MCR's first album, \\"I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love\\". Listen to it, compare it. Their first album is true and raw, this album, is a complete sell-out fake. MCR completely sold out to get rich, there is no intensity in this album, it's all cinematics. MCR's \\"single\\" I'm Not Okay (I promise), is without a doubt the worst song they have ever written, there is no intensity, it sounds like something you would find on some teenage boy-band. My advice, borrow the cd, listen to the tracks, give it back, and buy their first cd. Listen to something that has feeling, I recommend Drowning Lessons. Nothing from this sell-out.
B000002B1M|5.0|Nas' 2nd album, \\"It Was Written\\" is a nice, smooth album.  He is very intelligent and that is totally apparent in his contemplative rhyming style.  The beats are really tight too.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is now one of my top 5 favorite films of all time.  I was completely drawn into it. What a magnificent, intelligent, emotional, raw, and wild experience, especially for those who are into cosmic theory, quantum physics, chaos theory, parallel universes, etc.  Kinda had the same idea of \\"Sliding Doors\\" but much more raw and better.<br /><br />The end of Director's Cut had me in tears and the only other movie I ever cried at was American Beauty (and I am a girl, I am supposed to cry at movies, LOL.)  Absolutely an amazing story.  Too bad it was not mainstream enough to get more attention.  Kutcher was a wonderful actor, I had no idea he could be that good, and Amy Smart pulled off all her different personas astoundingly.  Two thumbs up!!!
B0000029GA|5.0|I don't mean to sound like everyone else, but what can I say, the album is on hit!!  He has smooth, funky beats paired with very well-executed rhyming.  \\"The World Is Yours\\" is the best becuase the beats are really sweet; he creates that classic older school jazzy New York style beat with the twist of the turntable.  The other songs are on the same level of greatness!

B00005JMYI|5.0|This was one of the best funny movies I have seen in a long time, right up there with some of the classics of comedy.<br /><br />(by classics, so you know where I'm coming from, I mean Marx Bros, early Woody Allen, Yahoo Serious' \\"Young Einstein\\", Frank Zappa's \\"200 Motels\\", ...)<br /><br />Great writing, great performances including lots of improvisation, great directing, great casting, all around top notch.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|ANY band that has lasted 30+ years will have some good albums and some weak ones.  Dance of Death is not bad; it is just a very, very, VERY weak effort.  All the songs are weak and slow.  And the album (which I have listened to over and over again) never really picks up.. before you know it, you have reached the last song. <br /> <br />It is really a disappointment.  \\"Brand New World\\" was just okay.  Dance of Death is filled with slow songs that are incredibly forgettable.  There is nothing powerful or special about it.  It's not that Dance of Death is a BAD album; it is just very weak.  There is nothing really interesting other than the last track Journeyman with its different acoustic vibe.   <br /> <br />Being a fan of Iron Maiden since the \\"Killers\\" album I always await a new Maiden album with great anticipation.  It is great to see this amazing band still making records and touring.  But Dance of Death is a very weak effort.  But don't take my word for it.  Listen to it yourself and judge.. <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|dude mcr freakin rules. they are my favorite band. i like them alot times alot. my favorite track is prolly give em hell kid. you should buy it if ur into emo
B00004T8RK|5.0|I can't believe its approaching 5 years since this album came out and I don't know whats changed in those five years but this album now sounds phenomenal.  To get this in perspective I'm a massive Pearl Jam fan with over 50hrs of PJ recordings in my collection.  When Binaural was released I remember thinking that it was dissapointing, the return to the softer side after the edginess of Yield in particular not endearing it on first listen.  Over the last 5 years I've listened to the studio mix of this album maybe 4 or 5 times, listening to the songs mostly through various live recordings, but for some reason today I decided to throw on the original.   <br />This album sounds so lush its unbelievable, I'm not sure if its the influence of Tchad , if its just the fact that Jeffs bass is so tight on this album or if its the arrival of Matt that makes the difference.   <br />Maybe I've just got older, maybe its the nice Sony earbuds I'm using nowdays .... but something has clicked and made this one of the best albums in my collection.  If you don't have it - buy it ! If you do have it listen to it on some decent headphones ;) <br />
B0007DAZW8|2.0|four years in the making, 9 tracks (\\"On/Off\\" doesn't count) and... well, this is just not very good at all.  what the hell happened?  there are two tracks i enjoy: \\"steam machine\\" and \\"technologic\\" - and even that is an almost carbon copy of \\"faster, stronger...\\" from the last album.  every track is nothing but a loop idea repeated for six minutes.  \\"robot rock\\" practically made me puke.  i'm so bummed out.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It gets funnier every time you watch it. <br /> <br />People either love it or hate it.   I LOVE IT.   The characters are so complete and watching them just makes me break out laughing.   Watch it!
B000003TAW|5.0|Hands down, this album is THE best of my generation! <br /> <br />When I was 13 I bought the cd to see what all the hype was about, thinking i would enjoy a couple of songs on it... 11 years later and it is still my #1 favorite album, and EVERY song on it is a masterpiece. Perhaps I only love it so much because each track takes me back to a different pivotal time in my adolescence, but, judging by the other reviews, it's genius is more complicated than that. This album covers a gamut of styles and emotions, but manages to stay consistent throughout, encapsulating a multi-faceted picture of life. From cute, poppy sounds (Buddy Holly, Holiday) to modern blues-ish-rock (In The Garage, Say It Ain't So); from seemingly light-hearted lyrics (Sweater Song), to the gut-wrenchingly painful (The World Has Turned) it flows with the same ups & downs of life.  <br />I am not eloquent, and I am defiantly not a music expert or fanatic, so I will say it as best as I can:  <br />Buy this cd and you will not regret it!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is not only done by the Wonderful Miyazaki but it is a breath taking adventure through Japan. Once you turn it on, you can't stop watching it, you are addicted until the very end, which leaves you breathless.
B000002MFE|5.0|Gosh ! I've been listening to this CD over and over again <br />since 199-whatever. <br />I started listening it somewhat 4 times a day when I was first introduced to this masterpiece. <br />Sure, the radio always play Layla over and over what causes me to kinda of get sick sometimes, but I cannot help listening it all way  to the end, no matter how fed up I am. <br />And once in a little while here I am caught with it in the player again. <br />Simply put: extreme blues, soulful, thoughtful... it's an addiction. Get it right away and get hooked.
0316168815|4.0|This story of a little girl who is murdered by a neighbor is different than anything I've read before. Everytime I see on the news a story of a missing little girl I think of this book and hope the little girl is not in the same place as Susie Salmon and watching it all from her grave.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I can't waste my time typing anything about this garbage. Don't buy it.
B000089RVX|3.0|I give Evanescence credit, but they are a little too much like bands such as Lacuna Coil, who are nearly a decade older. Evanescence is good though, they are not as good as Lacuna Coil, when it comes to creative tunes, Comalies from Lacuna Coil i think tops this one. Even though Fallen is a nice album, it's good for a debut, songs like Going Under and Everybody's Fool are really well done. I didn't really like singles like Bring Me To Life and My Immortal, in fact if i were to rate the songs i'd give them a 50 out of 100, because they i didn't think they were as good as people described them. Amy Lee is a good singer but i don't think she'd make a good solo artist, because she seems to be a one note type of singer, where she is comfortable at one note and sticks to that, i'm a singer myself and i know what that is like. I think one of the songs i really liked out of this album was Tourniquet, it almost sounds like a more mellowed out version of Unspoken from Lacuna Coil, but i fell in love with the Strings at the end, that was a good addition. Overall, not original but it does keep this style alive and i wish Evanescence the best of luck in their future.
B00008EY65|1.0|Do not buy this unless you've seen it and like it. Save your money.
B0002S947K|3.0|People love this CD.  And I've been trying to figure out just why just like I've been trying to figure out the Joss Stone and Madeleine Peyroux attractions or the Norah Jones phenomenon for that matter.  And I think it's the voice thing.  They all have warm, attractive voices.  Even though the songwriting isn't generally good on any of the CDs that have come out from these people, it's the mood and emotion conveyed by the voice that carries the day.<br /><br />Ray LaMontagne is not yet a good songwriter.  The lyrics are cliche.  The melodies are highly derivative of 70s songwriters.  But he does have a powerful, emotionally charged voice.  Sometimes a voice alone is enough to make a performer have impact.  Van Morrison, who also isn't a particularly good songwriter, is like that.  Norah Jones also.  Performers like these could sing Happy Birthday or Mary Had a Little Lamb and people would stop and listen.<br /><br />I'm of an age where I need more than just the emotion in a voice to make me want to keep a CD and play it again and again.  I need solid songwriting, either originals from the singer or cover material.  I'm not finding that here so off to Amazon used for resale it goes.  But there was a time when a voice alone was enough.  All you have to do is look at the Van Morrison and Otis Redding CDs in my collection - both of whom tended to the cliche in their writing - to know that.<br /><br />If you like the pleasant, nostalgia influenced sounds of Norah Jones, Joss Stone, and Madeleine Peyroux - all of whom are AAA radio staples right now - you'll probably like this CD.  If you like something more adventurous to feed both your mind and your soul, this CD isn't for you.
B0007DAZW8|1.0|It's too bad that the french band gives us such an album. I've found \\"discovery\\" very good. But this one is nothing but some beats that goes round and round with no beginning and no end. An advice...don't buy it.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|With their past albums, Daft Punk have been true innovators of Dance/Electronic music style and production techniques, with their super-compressed House swells and amazing electro/human hybrid effects.  In fact, \\"One More Time\\", with it's amazing vocodered and ultra pitch-corrected vocal lines, was recorded before Cher's \\"Believe\\" even hit the clubs and brought that sound to the masses.    On this album though, it sounds like they tried to go more for the \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" style of track (electro rock/breaks), but with really repetitive and not at all innovative results.  It just feels like their studio and song writing talents went completely out the window on this album.  Over the past couple of years, Thomas Bangalter (one-half of Daft Punk) has put out some decent French House records on the Crydamour label.  And, considering that a year ago at this time when the \\"Call On Me\\" White labels first started popping up, all the DJ's thought it was a Thomas Bangaltar track, it was just even more confirmation that the Daft guys have set the bar really high for expectations.    Unfortunately, they just didn't deliver.  Stylistically, the album is very monotonous - a couple of tracks to switch it up, but overall, just more rehashes of \\"Robot Rock\\" (a so-so track to begin with).  Even the song structures are completely lacking - not much forward movement, build-ups, etc.  Just LOTS of repetitive loops.  Over and over - not much change throughout most of the tracks.    The songs aren't *bad*, per se - they just sound like rough drafts of what they could potentially be.  There are certainly some hooks, but no development.  \\"Make Love\\" is a nice track along the lines of \\"Viridis Quo\\", and \\"Brainwasher\\" is a nice break from the rest here, but again, a rehash (or should I say hybrid) of \\"Rollin' & Scratchin\\" and \\"Outrun\\", a Bangalter track from years ago originally on vinyl, then on the Irreversible soundtrack.  Even the super-speedy cut up vocals on \\"technologic\\"have been done before by Keoki.  In other words, we've heard all these songs before.    These guys have been amazing in the past, with ground breaking studio production techniques, and I sure hope they'll put out some amazing stuff in the future, but the 9 songs on this album earn it the title \\"Rough Draft Punk\\".
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson in this popular book (note:  in some countries, it is published under the name \\"Down Under\\") explores Australia, from the  resort beaches of Queensland to cosmopolitan Sydney to the treeless Nullarbor Plain to the distant city of Perth near the Indian Ocean coast.  While he looks seriously at Australia's problems, he makes it a delight.      On a recent trip to Oz, I made a point of having this book with me (it was commonly for sale at airport bookstands down there) and comparing what I saw with what he wrote.  Not only was it all accurate, but there seemed to be some response to his writings (the radio-based School of the Air for distance learning in Alice Springs, which Bryson noted had almost no Aboriginal students due to lack of \\"responsible\\" parents, made a point of telling tourists that Aboriginals generally lived in groups on the huge stations, and the Territory government would send them a nurse and teacher, leaving the School with no role)      But there's no doubt Bryson captured the spirit of Australia.  He captures the general politeness of the Australians--and also their occaisonal surliness, especially when a rule (however misguided) is involved.  He captures the beauty of the countryside, and also the beauty of the manmade habitations, such as the lovely city of Adelaide or the spectacular views of Sydney Harbor.      Bryson's view on Australian history is deadly accurate, from the First Fleet (those who disembarked from it seemed to survive in spite of themselves) to the slaughter of Aboriginals to Federation, which brought together a group of disparate colonies which had insisted on having their own individual train gauges!--to Harold Holt, the Prime Minister who went swimming one day near Melbourne and was never seen again.      While in Australia, I saw posters for Qantas for \\"the Spirit of Australia\\"--lines of white-uniformed kids.  This book has done a far better job of distilling that spirit.    Highly recommended.
B00005QK39|3.0|Oh my god. Fish? More like Fishy Gabriel. Why didn't they just name themselves Genesis 2? Honestly this isn't bad music but it's not original in any way shape or form, and is significantly less interesting and hard sitting then Genesis's Gabriel material. Not to mention Fish's lyrics can't hold up to Peter Gabriel's, but that goes without saying. Plus, whoever the keyboard player is, he really needs to take lessons from Tony Banks on how to play synths, as insane as that might seem to be. His keyboard tones are TEN TIMES cheesier than Tony's often get: plus, tony you know, invented the style this stooge is playing, so at least that takes some mind power.<br /><br />Some solo's almost seem to fly right off of Genesis albums into your face. The keyboard style is 100% tony banks, the accoustic guitar triplets, the simpler bass parts all michael rutherford trademarks, the highly emotional soaring lead guitar all steve hackett... honestly, what Genesis was doing at the time was much more interesting and original than this, no matter what prog purists think. Avoid unless you wish Peter Gabriel stayed in Genesis into the 80's and they made music like this.
0596009208|5.0|This is a wonderful book for learning Java.  It's quirky, graphically oriented style makes it readable and brings you the information from several different angles.  It uses the latest ideas in learning (coupling information with play) to cement the concepts in reader's mind.<br /><br />The use of graphics is excellent.  For example, a disussion of objects might include an Animal class that is extended to a dog, cat, and hippo class.  Most books would discuss this analogy textually.  This book has a family tree of the objects with photographs of each kind of animal.  The picture brings home the idea.<br /><br />The book's other strength is that it talks about objects first.  In the old days (80's, 90's) we mostly learned languages by learning how to write statements in the language.  The helloworld program is an example of this kind of teaching.  Objects were considered an advanced topic.<br /><br />In a strongly object-oriented language like Java, it makes more sense to learn about objects first, as the basic unit of programming, and build from there.<br /><br />The book is not a reference book, and if you are looking for how to use a specific class or do a specific task you'd be better off with a different book.  But, if you are just getting started with Java, this is a great start!
0790742780|4.0|After watching \\"Downfall\\" my friend and I decided it was only appropriate to see \\"Falling Down\\".  It has been 10 years since I have seen the film but yet it still is a very effective film.  Feeling like a film out of the 1970's with \\"in your face cinematography\\" we know from the very first scene this film is going to be making a statement.  However, while many say this film is a social commentary on the average white man's place in society and \\"white mans rage\\" I am inclined to believe that this film is more of a commentary of the extremities of society and how interaction between social groups is nearly impossible.   The film is effective on many levels even though it does have a very dated feel.  It is interesting and yet fun to watch and even though the geeky middle-aged protagonist (or antagonist) is clearly \\"off his rocker\\" you can't help pitying him often. The film pulls few punches as it portrays several different social groups.  While the film certainly isn't really believable it is very well done and Michael Douglas does a bang-up job as Bill a.k.a. \\"D-Fens\\". <br /> <br /> Starting out in one of the many class-leveling experiences of modern society, morning rush-hour traffic, the film shows how quickly everyone reacts wildly when a person steps out of line.  Dfens, sick of the insanity of the morning, leaves his automobile as it stand on the highway and takes a walk.  Soon in need of change he enters a Korean immigrant's convenience store.  The store's proprietor, though he should be happy to be in America, is less than obliging and sells his wares at exorbitant prices to the dismay of D-Fens.  Taking matters into his own hands, D-Fens lowers the prices of the stuff in the store while assaulting the Korean. He leaves with a cut down baseball bat, a coke and the store in ruins.  Taking his troubles elsewhere, D-fens enters gang infested territory where he stops to read the help wanted pages of the paper and fix his shoe.  He is then visited by some Mexican American Gangsters who attempt to mug D-fens. Though things go badly for them as he beat them with the bat he took from the Korean.  At this point he picks up a butterfly knife that one of the gangsters drops.  <br /> <br />The Gangsters, who were beat up by D-Fens, regroup and with an arsenal of assault weapons hop into their car looking for D-Fens who sticks out like a sore thumb in the minority filled streets.  When they see him they shoot up the streets killing several innocents though completely missing D-Fens.  In their shooting spree the gangsters also get into a terrible car accident and while losing live, D-Fens finds them grabs their guns and shoots one of them in the leg.  Eventually he also kills a Neo-Nazi militant interrupts a game of Golf and watches an elitist rich man die of a heart attack, and interrupts a caretaker's families' barbeque in behind his boss' mansion.  All the while the police, who remain aloof to D-Fen's wife and mother, close in on this man who continually is crossing societal boundaries. <br /> <br />In the end, D-Fens is shot by a police man who seemingly spent most of his career behind a desk and who is also working his last day before retirement.  At this point, honestly surprised, D-fens questions \\"I'm the bad guy\\", as he explains how the system has ruined his life.  This film portrays American society not as a melting pot, but a salad bowl.  We are all living in the same region but are so very different and so extremely isolated from each other.  While this film doesn't attempt to dissolve out differences it does seem to suggest that we are all by our divisions not able to act outside of our sub-group without grave repercussions.  This is an interesting idea and the film ends leaving the viewer with many questions to ponder.  D-Fens is not a hero but his actions make us question the comfort we seek in our lives and how little we know of the other groups that live in our area.   I recommend this film to teens and above and thinkit should be watch casually yet with serious intent.  <br /> <br />-- Ted Murena       <br />    <br />
B00004RF9I|5.0|The two most important movies of the late 20th century, most satirical and ultimately most prescient of the world we curerently find ourselves in are this movie, \\"Network\\", and Terry Gilliam's - (Monty Python's) security-crazed bureaucratic nightmare \\"Brazil\\". I thought both were funny when they came out. Imagine my surprise when it happened.<br /><br />Network:<br /><br />America, the world, taken over by multi-national corporations who couldn't care less about America or American workers.<br /><br />Sibyl the Soothsayer, phoney egomanical new star psychics on TV every day, talking drivel!<br /><br />Networks full of phoney rigged, contrived \\"Reality\\" TV shows to manipulate the viewers. Networks willing to air anything, any thrash at all, terrorist killing shows, in order to try to get higher ratings.<br /><br />A world where less than 6% of the populus read books and only 16% of the population read newspapers. The rest just plug their heads into the idiot box every night.<br /><br />A suicidal, lunatic, visionary newsman who is ultimatly more principled and makes more sense than any of the \\"sane\\" people at the Network.<br /><br />Deeply cynical, and sad.

B0006GAOBI|2.0|I have to think that this Director's Cut was made in response to some people's inability to grasp the numerous subtleties of the original cut, instead of actually being director Richard Kelly's original vision. While I appreciate some of the new and extended scenes, mostly those including Drew Barrymore as the only teacher in Middlesex who actually knows what's going on in the real world, and those showing the relationship between Donnie and his parents, the rest of the added material is completely superfluous and overshadows the mystery and intrigue of the original cut. The new digital effects, including the horrible superimposing of pages of \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\", are worthless and add nothing to the plot. I remember after watching the original movie how blown away I was by this film, but that did not mean I understood every aspect of it. It made me want to study the film more and even try to find \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\", which was included on the bonus features of the original DVD. While I do not regret buying the Director's Cut for a couple of the new scenes, I would urge those of you who have never seen \\"Donnie Darko\\" to watch the original cut, as it is a far superior movie.

B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie!  The feeling, the excitement, the passion, the whole thing makes me want more!  I almost can't watch it too often because I don't want to make it just a movie, but keep the newness and thrill alive when I do watch it!  <br />Although I bought it and within 2 weeks had watched it 3 times! <br />This movie instills feelings inside of you that make you think about the road to come with your spouse or significant other, it makes you appreciate what you have and bond throughout cuddling together in it. <br />Yes, the Titanic was a great movie with a love story that was awesome.  But of course no one liked the jerk she was destined to end up with.  <br />I like the realness of having two good guys in this movie, because often that happens, there isn't a good and an evil choice, it is where your heart leads you! <br />Definitely BUY this movie!  All of the women and MEN I know that have watched it have cried!  Wonderful movie!!! <br />
068987474X|2.0|I didn't learn a thing about \\"understanding guys\\" from this book. It is lacking in the area of communication and teaching how to get past the facads. This book portrays men in a single category, the kind that are unavailable and dishonest game players to begin with. I agree with a reviewer below, not every guy is the same, and not every woman is the same either. I was more disappointed in this book than I thought I would be. It's over hyped and doesn't deliver.  <br />
B000062YAZ|1.0|What the hell is this crap???  I am a true metalhead, i love my metal (Judas Priest, Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth, Ozzy, Black Label Society)  I use to go into metal chat rooms and forums and crap and everyone would say how kick @$$ and great slayer is.  The only thing Slayer does great is write songs with the same guitar riff.  The lyrics, wow...my 6 year old christian cousin could write better darker lyrics than these guys.  Every song sounds the exact same, all they do is change the lame @$$ lyrics.  There is absolutely no singing and no effort put into these guys' music.  Slayer scars the face of metal.
B00008MLSH|2.0|Okay, so this is the diva-in-training that's supposed to bring glamour back to opera?  Yes, she is beautiful.  Shame those hands had to scrub floors; hope she makes it on the cover of Vogue someday.  However, she is not the Great New Hope for opera.  That voice is not suited for bel canto, or Mozart.  She sounds like a new Barbara Frittoli to me.  Frittoli, with a dash of Fleming. She has that taffy-pull to her voice, like Fleming, without the heavy portamento and sighing and all those other awful Fleming tricks.  The basic color of the voice is interesting, rather dark-hued, but the technique is not quite there, despite the studio producers' best attempts to turbo-charge her high notes.<br /><br />Sorry, guys, but for romantic French and Italian bel canto reperatoire, I am sticking with Natalie Dessay!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|From the first hints of marching in the intro to the last tap of the high-hat in Ruled by Secrecy, I am completely absorbed, transported... there is a theme here: the world is gonna end, but in Matt Bellamy's own words \\"You could say the first song is kinda saying that yeah, the end is coming, whatever, but the rest of the album, all the other songs on the album are kinda saying, well what do you do at that moment do you know what I mean? What are you gonna do eh?\\" <br />As per the title of this review, I had every track downloaded - after I heard the stand out \\"Time is Running Out\\", with it's finger-clicking, thy-slapping catchiness, I then got \\"Sing for Absolution\\" - a song that is haunting at first, then peaks to Muse's trademark epic Himalyaya-esque heights before descending back to Earth... The strumming of the bass signaling \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Butterflies & Hurricanes\\" grabbed my attention, for \\"Hysteria\\", it was because of its indulgence and decadence with Matt wailing \\"...I want you now, I want you now... I feel my heart implode, and I'm breaking out, escaping now, feeling my faith erode\\" - Matt has a knack for expressing feelings that I never could, (and FYI to the guy who was complaining about the distorted vocals - don't you think that if they REALLY wanted to, they could've made those vocals crystal clear? the effect's lost on you, the point was to emphasise desperation) ... \\"Butterflies & Hurricanes\\" - my personal favourite, the piano solo stopped me in my tracks, it's a song about hope and provoking change (I don't know why, but when I hear this song, I picture soldiers preparing to fly on a mission)... but the track that took me to the checkout was \\"Apocalypse Please\\" - there's something in the drums and Matt's vocals when he sings \\"and pull us throooough ah....\\" - that makes me feel like I'm floating - I had to have that album - I can look at the cover and be like one of those floating shadows... <br />I have followed Muse since their Showbiz days, andthis is a  departure from their previous material in places - the most notable differences are things like vocals (a number of tracks feature distorted vocals) and juxtaposing classically inspired (\\"Blackout\\" and \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\" - both in 3/3, with RBS you're waltzing to a song about a guy destroying everything around him because he's lost control) tracks with much heavier, contemporary tracks like \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"TSP\\" and then there's \\"Endlessly\\", which is nothing like anything they've done before, it sounds like a dance remix, but one with substance, no cringe. <br />When I introduce friends to Muse, I like to start with Absolution, as it can be slightly more mainstream and easier to take in initially than Origin of Symmetry and Showbiz... (which btw are both brilliant in their own right as well) I am intrigued (and insanely jealous as a musician) by Matt Bellamy's musical genius - his vocals, his piano playing, his guitar playing, his lyrics, his arrangements... I am constantly in awe; he IS the Swiss army knife of music! (Not to take anything away from Chris or Dom though, the bass and the drums are every bit as important - they're the dot in the i and the \\"-\\" in the t -> they complete Muse's sound.) <br />Again personally... I don't think Thom Yorke sounds like Matt much at all... as far as I'm concerned from this whole R-word debacle, I count myself lucky for not hearing a drop (well maybe a couple of songs...) of Radiohead before hearing Muse. Muse is the novel, Radiohead is the Movie, if you know what I mean... <br />If you haven't heard Absolution yet, you have been deprived of something special - don't take my word for it, get yourself a copy and make up your own mind! <br />
0140306013|5.0|I first read this book many years ago, and hundreds of books later it is still, without equal. It is absolutely my favourite book of all time. Nothing could be more beautifully written or as moving without being sentimental. It is exquisite, a wonderful story, as near to perfect as a novel can be. If you haven't read it, drop everything, including whatever you are currently reading, and read this book.
B00002522A|5.0|This album is Dark Tranquillity's finest moment, and quite possibly the best album of the entire melodic death genre. It is a masterpiece, a neo-classical symphony of chaos.  <br /> <br />Mikael Stanne's vocals are the best in the business - his growls are so expressive. Throughout 'The Gallery', his vocals are slightly higher, more raspy screams, than the booming growls of other DT albums, portraying pure anguish and pain. This mood is enhanced by the bleak, existential lyrics. Virtually all the songs on this album are unpredictable and free-form, with guitarists Sundin and Johansson playing off each other with the dexterity of jazz musicians. Yet this experimentation is not so extreme as to reduce the effectiveness of the songs - each song has a particularly character and emotion which is maintained even through the most unexpected stylistic turns. 'Punish My Heaven' is a searing opener, rabid and ferocious, whilst in contrast, the second track 'Silence, And the Firmament Withdrew' is a slower, symphonic piece. 'Lethe' would be best described as a death-ballad and is one of the most tortured pieces of music I have ever heard. 'The Dividing Line' begins with a heavy groove, before going pedal to the metal for the last two minutes. My favourite track, though, would have to be the insanely chaotic 'One Brooding Warning'. Can't wait for the new album 'Character' - it promises to be as good as anything DT has ever done.
078061755X|3.0|Brilliantly performed, emotionally appealing to the max...it's important to remember that the plotline in this film is, to be tactful, heavily fictionalized. If enjoyment alone were a just measure, I'd give it five stars, but available facts indicate that it is not just heavily fictionalized but exceedingly unfair to some individuals in David Helfgott's original family circle.  His dad, Peter Helfgott, is characterized as a prim and prissy monster who uses the Holocaust to justify all the tyranny he exercises in his grim and nasty little household. However, this scenario does not seem to have been literally true at any time, and bipolar illness such as Helfgott seems to have suffered does not require the undermining effect of an abusive parent, just an unfortunate heredity. Only logic of a specially American and sentimental kind demands a monstrous parent as the cause of this effect. <br /> <br />I'm sorry to say I swallowed the plot whole the first time I saw it. It's that effective and affecting, but feels manipulative after garnering a few of the facts...I don't particularly enjoy enjoying something that perpetrates vicious calumny against a real individual who seems to have done nothing to deserve it. Shine does have absolutely brilliant imagery, such as the shots of Geoffrey Rush as David Helfgott in the unbounded joy of full manic flight, jumping on a trampoline, and fine acting...Lynn Redgrave's Gillian casting David's astrological chart on her PC and deciding to marry him, which decision can be seen in the slight arching of her brow before she slips off the big diamond ring she's recently accepted from another man.  If the director could have operated on the premise that David's illness was tragic and his talent was great, and that Gillian's love for him was idiosyncratic and absolute WITHOUT adding a pseudo-Dickensian villain to the mix, Shine would be in the same luminous category as A Beautiful Mind.
B000002KO1|5.0|This album contains songs about people from Cleveland and London wearing leather, insulting each other and engaging in extremely heavy petting.  It is truly astonishingly fantastic.   <br /> <br /> The whole album is a tight as a diamond. James Honeyman Scott riffs like a tommy gun, without flash or wankery, on every song. If you don't own the album, my goodness, you could operating under the notion that you are somehow cool. But chances are pretty slim that you are. So, buy it. You can't afford not to.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I truly believe these guys live up to all the hype. This album has no fillers, every song is very catchy... but put together ehh and it gets a little tiring. This is all really good stuff. I'd like to see what their second album is like.. they've set the bar pretty high for themselves.
0131177052|5.0|Almost every code base I've worked in previously, whether fifteen years old or just a few weeks, fell into the category of legacy code for exactly the reason mentioned in this book. There were no unit-level tests. Without the presence of tests, design had gone to pieces once the architects were no longer looking (if any architects had ever existed!). Without tests' presence, the code had no need to be easily isolated and changed - so it wasn't. This book provides a set of steps to clean up that sort of legacy code in as safe a way as possible, always moving towards a system that is a joy and productive to code in.<br /><br />Additionally, this book codifies good design patterns and ways to think about new code during code reviews. Even \\"green field\\" developments can benefit from reading this book and ensuring that early-on work is being done to ensure that it never starts the downward legacy spiral. I would encourage developers starting from scratch to ensure they're following the patterns in this book any time that a bad piece of code sneaks in to keep it from spreading - we have on my team, and it's done wonders for our quality level, productivity, and morale.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to have seen improved is that there's a an assumption that the code is all in one place - there are no external, uncontrollable sources who build on this code, there are no versioning requirements (i.e. API stability for N years), etc. While I'm sure the majority of this book's audience doesn't have to deal with it, for those who do, noting what constitutes a breaking change and what doesn't (particularly to ensure that each chapter has at least one that isn't) would've really helped for those of us who have to build platforms.
0446677450|5.0|This book taught me a lot. A lot more than most books in this genre. It's written by a man that obviously knows what he's talking about, his own life shows it! I don't understand why anyone would give this book a negative review. Big deal if he talks about a cash game, that doesn't take away from the wisdom in the book. It's easy to read, and gives wonderful suggestions!
0393035158|5.0|What is a fundamentalist, evangelical, pentecostal preacher doing reading this book?  Rethinking his faith, that's what.  I have been (secretly) reading books on faith & reason for several years now, this book by Sam Harris has been the best I've read to date.  Questions and concerns of mine were better articulated and better answered by Mr. Harris than other books on the subject.  A word of warning from a member (soon to be former member) of the religious right:  Don't read this book if you're not ready to question your faith and \\"faith\\" in general.  After reading Sam's book, I now realize that suspending reason in favor of religion is not a benign practice, it propagates a belief system that hurts everyone.  We would all be better off if religion could be suspended, not reason!
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Sometimes it rushed through the plot.  Especially in the beginning and the somewhat confusing end.  Readers of the book will recognize that.  That is one of the reasons I gave it 4 instead of 5.   <br /> <br />Yeah, you'd think the new Dumbledore actor would have seen the other movies and tried to keep consistency.  He was way to energetic and talked too fast.  However the scenery in this movie is SO beautiful and showed a more expansive view of Hogwarts and the adjoining grounds.  The plot was QUITE interesting with twists and turns.  Daniel's acting stays the same.  Some of his scenes where he is supposed to be angry are kind of unconvincing as well.  His facial expressions and eyes don't show the emotions he is feeling at times.  <br /> <br />If you didn't read the book, you might be confused a bit toward the end.  As all of the movies, you can't put every part of the book into the flick, still the movie does well.  Special effects, and keeping the same actors (as well as they could) are a few of the great qualities that the series has. <br /> <br />Otherwise it is a KILLER movie bound to be one of your favorites in your Harry Potter dvd library.  Be sure to read the books, or at lease listen to them on tape.  Buy this dvd.  Harry Potter fans won't regret it!
B0000508U6|4.0|This is a great album to listen to on a snowy Sunday morning. You can really hear the emotion of the song in Chris Martin's voice. My only complaint is why Parachutes is only a 46 seconds.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|There is no reason to write a real review for this movie.  All I know is this movie rocks the house and it was easily one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I laughed so hard I was too tired to laugh anymore!  I laughed so hard I was crying and couldn't breathe!  You all know you're going to buy it, because why wouldn't you buy a movie starring action puppets?!  This movie rocks!
B0007DAZW8|4.0|No, just different. It isn't as good as Homework and Discovery, but for hardcore fans and hopefully for mainstream this is good enough to keep us going for a while. I reckon this album is going to sound awesome live. I can't wait til they tour Australia.
068484267X|2.0|At the beginning of this book, I would have given it 5 stars but as I read on all it talked about was his sex life, his interffering           ( masturbating) with his self and him commiting adultry his first night in america, even though he was so outraged that his mother had done the same with laman and he slapped her for it.   All he spoke of was helping his family but instead he stole money from a dead woman and came to america. He could have stayed and worked and helped his poor toothless mother and his brothers but he came here and we never find out what happened to his mother, nor his brothers.   If this kind of trash wins the pulitzer prize , then ill never read another pulitzer prize winning book ever again.   I was disgusted by the book at the end . Im gald I only paid 99 cents for it. but hate I helped to support such a mans life style.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I first heard Led Zeppelin in the early 70's...\\"Led Zeppelin 2\\"...and have owned or do own most of their studio albums and collections...so I know their music well ! I've NEVER however actually seen the band live other than an occasional clip here and there...so I was thrilled when this DVD set was released.While watching it my jaw dropped. I knew this band was amazing and unique...but I didn't realize how much until I sat down and enjoyed this set on my big screen and home theater system !<br /><br />It spans from early in their career through the bands 1979 performance at Knebworth. I was especially in awe seeing Jimmy Page doing amazing things with his guitar...and actually being able to watch how incredible John Bonham was on drums for an extended period of time. Of course the quiet John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards (whom you CAN see in this footage)...kept the whole thing steady...and lets not forget the vocal power and charisma of Robert Plant.<br /><br />It's very fun to see this band evolve from the improvisation and rawness of their early years through the Knebworth segment...which to me...is the most polished performance on this set...especially \\"Kashmir\\" with John Paul Jones doing some sensational keyboard work.By then we're seeing a very tight...mature band that's played 11 years together ! Myself...and some friends planned to see Led Zeppelin in Philadelphia...but unfortunately...John Bonham died before we could. This is still a great way to enjoy this legendary band...get it in your shopping cart now...and enjoy !
B00025ETIW|1.0|Even the supposed \\"best song\\" on this album, I'm Not Okay puts me to sleep. One star though since zero stars is not an option and because You know what they do to guys like us in Prison has a great beginning, but no use buying the album for just that one song, just get it off iTunes.
B00005JNQQ|4.0|I really thought this movie was gonna be a cheezy kids movie so I was not expecting much. But I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.  There are a lot of metaphors and sexual jokes that younger children won't get, but teens and adults will laugh at.  So it balances the humor for all ages.  The whole robot world and how they interact and live was really unique, the writers of the movie had very good imaginations.  It's a visually stunning film and I think all the right actors were chosen, Jay Leno plays a trash can.. haha.  Me and my friend laughed throughout the movie and I will probably purchase the dvd when it is released.  Overall a good film for all ages, sure there have been better (Toy Story), but it's worth checking out.
B0000025RI|5.0|i dnt care what people say about mj if he is guilt he should go prison or be killed but if he is inocent people should jus 'leave him alone' and let his music speak for its self because i dnt care what ppl say or try 2 deny it but mj is probly the best singer/entertainer evr and no matter who you are everyone likes at least one of his songs and nobody cant not like his dancing its amazin. hes known as the king of pop but its more like the king of pop,rock,RnB and soul because there is no one as good or as versatile as MICHAEL JACKSON...... <br />
B00000J2SR|4.0|Good album, but I hoped for 10 good songs. But there actually are 8 songs on this album. You might think: That's not true! But when you have listened the album twice, you will always skipp track 5 and track 9(Anybody there and snowman). Those two songs are instrumental, listenable, but a bit boring. So that's why you actually have 8 songs on this disc. Those songs are good. There are some good rockers on this album and some beautiful ballads. But, I would like to make a adaptation by 'Fire Dance'. 'Fire Dance' is a great song, but you almost can't hear that there is a guitar playing, except for the guitar solo. In the couplets you hear more keyboards then guitar, you can hear the guitar very soft, I would like the song more if the guitar-play was louder. As you can here by 'Drinking with tha devil', that's a song were you can here the guitar loud. For the rest the album is good. The guitar solo's are good and Joe Lynn Turner sings very good. It's a pitty that rainbow didn't went on with Joe Lynn Turner. The singer on the next studio-album ('stranger in us all') is Doogie White, he can sing good, but not as good as Joe Lynn Turner. I think that 'Stranger in us All' would have been even better if Joe Lynn Turner would sing on that album(cause it is a good album). But about this album again: Pretty good and highly recommended, but I'll remind you again, there are only 8 real songs on this album. But it is surely well worth the money!
B000000OMB|5.0|In 1982 progressive rock couldn't be less popular.Newer rock styles based in punk were in vogue and alot of the prog rockers of the previous decade had gone the way of the dinasaur-<br /><br />literally.That's why members of three of the most popular prog rock bands came together to form Asia and to make their music work,they chose to blend big arena rock sounds with pure pop melodies and hooks.The result is one of the best first sides any VINYL LP ever had with the first four songs-\\"Heat Of The Moment\\",<br /><br />\\"Only Time Will Tell\\" (both huge hits),\\"Soul Survivor\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\" all add up as a perfect example of what style Asia were trying to achieve,and for better or worse paved the way for very similar 'hair metal'-type bands to come.<br /><br />  Although as the next part indicates Asia will never be mistaken for heavy metal-most of the songs there showcase the<br /><br />more bombastic side of progressive rock-lack of melody and often<br /><br />overplaying.But on \\"Here Comes The Feeling\\" the band are back to pop perfect again as on the first songs.Often written off by critics as being too commercial 'Asia' actually ends up sounding fairly enjoyable in certain sections and,of course Steve Howes wailing guitars,bloated as they can be do convey the point well.
B00070DK5K|5.0|This was the \\"Diamond Dogs\\" tour despite the 'thin white duke' cover. I admit that the quality of the sound used to be not perfect, but this has all been remastered to a clean and crisp sound! Bowie sings his classics and what you hear is NOT what you see. Fortunate enough to have been there, I cannot tell anyone how fantastic the sound, light, the crowd and the showmanship was in that tiny theatre. Although \\"Stage\\" is a great companion piece for this \\"Live\\" set, I prefer this concert song list. The additons of \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Panic In Detroit\\" are wonderful!  (Bowie did the former while sitting in a chair-crane above the audience - seeming to float).
B000002J29|5.0|Released in Nov. 1977 at the height of the punk craze, Seconds Out is one of the last great progressive rock albums of the 70's and in my opinion one of the very best of those classic double-live albums of the era.  Just as prog as a whole was beginning it's demise, Genesis themselves would soon become a pop band.  This was Steve Hackett's last recording with Genesis and his departure would portend a far more radical shift in Genesis' sound than that of Peter Gabriel a few years earlier.  Fortunately, Hackett went out on a high note as he turns in some terrific performances here, and all on that most un-prog of guitars, the Les Paul.<br /><br />Phil Collins had moved to center stage and was replaced on drums first by Bill Bruford, then Chester Thompson, though he still joined in some two-drummer stuff on some crowd-pleasing instrumental segments. (Interested parties should check out Thompson's previous work with Zappa and the Mothers!)<br /><br />Collins had clearly grown into his lead role and turns in one heckuva performance.  Anyone thinking of Su-Su-Sudio and snickering should immediately put on \\"Supper's Ready\\" from this CD.  Back when I was a prog-obsessed teenager, my friends and I would argue passionately about who did \\"Supper's Ready\\" better, Collins or Gabriel.  My pick was and is Gabriel, but mainly because he was first.  The fact that it's even debateable says a lot about Collins' performance throughout this CD.<br /><br />Mike Rutherford and Chester Thompson were a solid and underrated rhythm section, one of the most solid and underrated of their time.  The Bruford tour is represented by a jaw-droppingly good version of \\"The Cinema Show.\\"<br /><br />All in all, I've loved Seconds Out since I bought it as a new album as a kid.  I love it even more in the cleaned-up remaster.  One of the best live records ever and a personal 5-star CD.
B0007IO0JW|4.0|This is probably the best Daft Punk album. Homework and Discovery were good, but Discovery was a little cheesy and Homework was repetitive as hell. This album combines the two, with a bigger focus on guitars (think Aerodynamic). I'll do a track by track breakdown: <br /> <br />1) title track - catchy, with a cool guitar melody and electronic vocal melody. One of the best tracks. 9/10.  <br />2) the prime time of your life - interesting! slower then most daft punk stuff, and it takes awhile to get going, but it's catchy and the noisiness is interesting. The end is like an acid rock freakout, too. 7/10. <br />3) robot rock - the most rock oriented song on human after all (hence the title). A catchy hard rock riff over a neat little synth melody. RO-BOT RAWK! It's mostly built off a sample, which loses brownie points with me, but it's catchy and the most accessible song on here. 8/10 <br />4) steam machine - it's cool. the breathing noises and gritty acid synth give it an industrial-ish feel. It's a little repetitive, but most of these songs were made for club use (or at least that's how it sounds) so it's excusable. 7/10 <br />5) make love - eh. nice little melody, but boring and extremely repetitive, worst track on here. Sounds like something you'd hear on the Weather Channel. 4/10. <br />6) the brainwasher - awesome! I would love to hear this in a club or something. Gritty acid synths and pounding techno beats make this one of the best tracks here. It's repetitive (like all the tracks here) but the buildup at the end makes it work. \\"I AM THE BRAIIIINWASHER!\\" <br />7) on off - just some random speech samples for 19 seconds. stupid. <br />8) television rules the nation - another guitar (or distorted acid synth) led track. One of the coolest drum beats on here, too. It's about a minute too long, but oh well. 8/10 <br />9) technologic - the vocal here should be annoying, but in the context of the song, it's funny and catchy. Less repetitive then most of the album. The vocal-synth thing is awesome. 9/10 <br />10) emotion - a very nice relaxing song. It works better then Make Love because the melody is uplifting and pretty instead of boring and stagnant. 9/10 <br /> <br />
B00005JNTV|5.0|This movie is a stunning piece of work, if it doesn't win any kind of Academy Award for at least special effects, then there's something wrong with the world. <br /> <br />The cast is perfect with the slight exception of Alba, who while does a good job of acting, doesn't live up to Nancy in all her black and white glory, if you get what I mean. She seems slightly out of place. <br /> <br />Bruce Willis owns this movie, Hartigan is one character who you will feel for, especially with the emotionally gut wrenching scene at the end.  <br /> <br />I don't want to give too much of the story away, but whether you're a comic freak or a moviephile, go out and see this one opening day. For once, both sides won't be disappointed.
B000654YS8|3.0|I have a VHS entitled \\"Dire Straits - The Videos\\", released by Warner Reprise Videos in 1992. <br /> <br />This DVD appears to be the exact same collection of videos released under the guise of a new product.  That would explain the lack of features that one would normally associate with a DVD -- it's a direct port of the VHS.   <br /> <br />There are still 3 good reasons to get this DVD: 1)It's better quality and will last longer than VHS, 2) The VHS is probably very hard to get a hold of, and 3) It's Dire Straits. <br /> <br />A five-star collection of videos, but it loses a couple stars for trying to trick us and for the stripped-down features and presentation (when compared to other DVDs in the genre).
6301661737|4.0|By using real historic characters like the renowned Takeda Shingen, Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, Kurosawa proves once more that life is usually more dramatic than fantasy, as he recounts the substitution of Shingen with a double during the \\"golden-age\\" of Japan's civil wars in 16th century. The characters are very well presented, there are some fine scenes in this colored film like that of Shingen's double galloping in front of the Takeda army during an inspection, under the eyes of the enemies' spies, or that of the sad field of battle of Nagashino where the Takeda clan was finally destroyed, but Kurosawa has streched the film a little bit longer than necessary, putting more than enough combat scenes in it. Although technically sound, I think it can not compare in freshness and powerful images with his older works \\"The Throne of Blood\\" or \\"Seven Samurai\\".

B00000IJPU|4.0|This was the CD that got me into Iron Maiden. My first introduction to them was through Fear of the Dark, which, despite one or two good songs, turned me off on the band all together.<br /><br />However, upon listening through this CD and gaining a genuine appreciation for the band, I've started collecting their other great albums and have discovered how great this band truly is.<br /><br />No single CD is going capture every great song from a prolific band such as 'Maiden. Some of my favorites, such as \\"Flight of the Icarus\\" and \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" are two of the glaring omissions. However, for those who want to sample the band, this a great start. If you're like me, you'll end up wanting more. But that's a good thing.
B000023X9W|5.0|I hold thos album in very high regard.  It's a very beautiful acoustic album with a real range of sounds (country, celtic, folky, softer rock).   <br /> <br />I like it better than Harvest Moon. It really has a nice gentle mood and some excellent guitar/lyrics.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|All I can say is, this is a jaw dropping movie. special effects, actings, everything was spectacular. this not one of those boring silence movies and I'm sure everyone will watch it till its end. I had it unremastered on one of my boxed sets \\"50 movie horror classics\\" and I enjoyed that version but thanks to kino, this version is totally different.<br /><br />I suggest it to everyone and I think 20 doolars for such a movie and brilliant DVD is nothing.
B00000HYXB|1.0|I'd heard songs off this CD before, so I knew I had to have it. Unfortunately, when I ordered it and finally got around to trying to listen to it, I discovered I had a serious problem. The CD would NOT play in any of my devices--my CD-ROM, my Xbox, or my MP3 Walkman. None of them would even detect that there was a CD in the drive. <br /> <br />I did some research, and found that this is one of many audio CDs that are now being \\"copy-protected\\" with a protection method that renders them unreadable in many legitimate devices. I returned the CD at once as defective, and requested that Amazon put a consumer notice on audio CDs using this protection method. <br /> <br />I would like to support this band, but I will not support a company using copy protection that prevents me from playing the CD I paid for in whatever device I like.
B0001KL5DA|4.0|How come the First Season pack has Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround and Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono while THIS pack only has Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround???????????????<br /><br />Warner Home Video is truly taking a crap on their fans and costumers!!!!!<br /><br />I fear what the the third season pack will lack...
B000002LEE|5.0|I've listened to lots of bands before Jane's like old metallica, some led zeppelin, RATM, AIC, TOOL, etc.  And if it wasn't for JANE'S I probably would have never picked up the electric guitar.  The music created by Jane's is HOLY to me.  There will be no band out there that matches the calibur of Jane's Addiction.  Perry Farrell's vocals over Dave's guitar playing and Eric's bass, plus the tribal drumming from Steve Perkins, was powerful enough to make an impact on my life.  Their trippy music made me feel like i needed to pick up that fine instrument called the \\"guitar\\" and continue their legacy of making \\"true and creative\\" music.  I hate the crap that's on the radio these days such as Evanescence, Sum41, LinkinPark, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, Hoobastank...etc.  These bands dont even have \\"1 Percent\\" of the musical creativity of Jane's.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, Jane's Addiction f$kin rocks.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush cemented their reputation with \\"Moving Pictures\\".  The album is famous, mostly for its big single \\"Tom Sawyer\\", but is really a great record, start to finish.  I really see the album has having two different sides-- the AOR material, \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Limelight\\", and \\"Red Barchetta\\" (while not released as singles, the latter is similar in feel), and the experimental side-- the furious rhythm exercise \\"YYZ\\", the extended suite \\"The Camera Eye\\", the haunting \\"Witch Hunt\\" and the reggae of \\"Vital Signs\\".    \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" were the two AOR staples, there's not much to say about them that isn't already known, the former has a bit of an odd feel to it and isn't an obvious single, with its bizarre synth parts, esoteric lyrics, and rolling rhythms, it somehow hit big.  \\"Limelight\\" is a much more commercial slice, not one I care for personally, but a reasonably strong song.  More interesting and of similar form is \\"Red Barchetta\\", with its brilliant futuristic car chase lyrics (and if I'm not mistaken, the end of an era-- I don't believe there were any other distopian future lyrics on any Rush songs), with a great, rolling rhythm, churning verses, and hot choruses, its I think the best of the more single-oriented songs on the record.  \\"Witch Hunt\\", lyrically interests me, but musically never did much for me, a decent tune however.    Also brilliant in the record-- the morse code rhythms of \\"YYZ\\", a concert staple well loved by fans and likely the most exciting instrumental Rush ever did, the reggae experiment (and largely successful at that) of \\"Vital Signs\\" and the absolutely stunning suite, \\"The Camera Eye\\".  Another last for Rush, this is the last album to feature a suite, \\"The Camera Eye\\" shows a band fully in control of themselves-- its ten minutes plus because there's that much to say, there is no indulgence on this one.  It may be the pinnacle of the form the band ever did.    The album is superb-- it has many things that the predecessors had-- great musicianship, clever songs and lyrics, and like the last album, a self-assured nature that allowed the band to rise to a peak.  It may not be the best they ever did, but it certainly is the most consistent.  Highly recommended.
B0002IU988|3.0|Ok honestly, Alter Bridge is really great and everything, but I still love Creed more. I'm glad at least some people from Creed are together again, but I don't really connect with these songs like I did with Creed. I was hoping for it to be more like the original band and was disappointed to hear they weren't. Scott Stapp was the best part of the band in my opinion and without him it just doesn't work as well for me.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|The voice is back! The Ripper years weren't bad, but Rob is, was and forever shall be the true voice of Judas Priest and it's great to have him back. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fine piece of work, with the best song being the first, \\"Judas Rising.\\" The next several sound like they could have come from late era Halford albums like Ram it Down or Painkiller -- tight, heavy anthemic pieces that make you want to scream along as you drive a little over the speed limit. <br /> <br />\\"Angel,\\" \\"Eulogy\\" and \\"Lochness\\" are definite departures for the band, with \\"Angel\\" being the best of the three. I found the tone and music of \\"Lochness\\" appealing, but the lyrics are, sadly, pretty silly and the rhymes seem forced. <br /> <br />I found the DVD annoying. The package promises videos, but what you get are bits of recorded performances that are interrupted to go back to interviews. The interviews are interesting, but I would have liked to see the entire videos uninterrupted. <br /> <br />Priest fans will be happy with this disc. It's definitely worth owning.
0143034901|5.0|This is the kind of book that grips you almost immediately.  Once you start this book you will not be able to put it down.  It has all the elements of a great story:  mystery, love, sex, scandal, friendship, revenge - you name it, it's in this book.  Don't pass it up!
B000001ESF|4.0|The first truly great Rush album, \\"2112\\" shows a band at the height of their power.  All the pieces were finally coming together-- the three members of the band, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, were all masters of their instruments, and having spent their first three albums perfecting both a metal sound and beginning to expand their ambitions, they were ready to produce something of real magnitude-- the title track, \\"2112\\".  A side-long suite that is the obvious heir to \\"Fly By Night\\"'s \\"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\\" and \\"Caress of Steel\\"'s title track and \\"The Necromancer\\", Rush finally constructed an extended piece that holds together well, coherently remains focused, and most importantly, actually *feels* like a suite. <br /> <br />Opening with an instrumental \\"Overture\\" built largely around a simple riff a featuring some monsterous lead guitar work, a brief interlude (and Lee's relaxed intonation of \\"and the meek shall inherit the earth\\") breaks forth into the second movement, the justifiably famous \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\".  The band, having totally mastered the metal genre, produces a stunning 2:12 explosive piece.  But as it reaches the end of the second verse/chorus pair, a quiet classical guitar lick bleeds into something really unique.  In the story, a man in the future has found a guitar, and the sounds of Lifeson \\"experimenting\\" until a riff is found takes hold.  Musically, its interesting to hear the band surrender their usual sound and feeling for a (relatively) simple, clean, straightforward riff.  The fourth movement, \\"Presentation\\", intersperses this riff and style with the metal style developed on \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\"-- a conflict as it were, between the protagonist and the ruling body.  Whereas at this point the Rush suites have tended to drift, the band remains focused by changing direction, a darkened melancholy, never before a sound experimented with by the band, takes hold in the next two movements, culminating in some really passionatesinging and guitar playing courtesy of Lee and Lifeson respectively.  The suite wraps up with a pseudo-reprise of the first first two movements, culminating with a voiceover that enforces the feeling of despair and hopelessness. <br /> <br />The point-- the band manages to show a vision for a dark future, manages a science fiction message, but manages it without dribbling into meaninglessness-- distopian visions, particularly when displayed in music, tend to come off as clinical-- after all, there's not a whole lot close to heart to sing about, but Rush makes it work. <br /> <br />The second side is all songs, and actually are quite a bit weaker than you'd hope-- \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\", \\"The Twilight Zone\\", and \\"Lessons\\" are largely in the form of material on \\"Fly By Night\\" and \\"Caress of Steel\\", but don't hold much interest.  \\"Something For Nothing\\" is a bit better, similar in message (though more optimistic) to the \\"2112\\" suite, its a great rocker, albiet retreading old territory.  But the gem on the side is \\"Tears\\", a quiet ballad, Lee's voice full of anguish and loss, and the first prominent keyboards on a Rush record.  Its brilliant, one of the best moments in the band's recorded history and often widely overlooked in favor of the \\"2112\\" suite and the rock oriented pieces. <br /> <br />The album has its flaws, the second side is a bit inconsistent, but its great material.  Recommended.
B00000DFSK|3.0|Man, this album bugs me. Not that the songs aren't great (they are) and not because there are some understandable omissions (great bands are never able to fit all the deserving songs on a single disc). This album gets under my skin because they completely ignore the October record.<br /><br />When U2 were building their US fan base in the early 80's, MTV played the heck out of Gloria; it was a great song. The whole October album is pretty darned good and to pretend it never existed is baffling. When you remember that this collection was originally released as a double CD with a second disc of B-sides, it just adds insult to injury.
1400032717|5.0|This was a great book - funny, clever, a complete joy to read. This book is a mystery that becomes an even bigger mystery. I was surprised to learn that this book is a young adult book, since I had seen it in the adult book section at the local Borders, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it nonetheless. It also made me think that autistic people do not think all that entirely different from \\"normal\\" people. (I couldn't tell you what the other faces mean either...) You get a different and amusing perspective on life from the eyes of the main character, a fifteen year old boy living with his father in a kind of surburban hell, on a quest to solve a mystery, or two, even going as far as addressing the biggest mystery of all, the universe.    Two big thumbs up on this one.
B000001ES9|2.0|I think in many ways the album artwork says most of what you need to know about the album-- the big curvy letters spelling out \\"RUSH\\" exploding from the background, its really quite a straightforward '70s rock vibe on the cover, which makes sense, since thats what it is in the album. <br /> <br />The album is maligned by some, in many ways unfairly, given what the future held for the band.  By others, its revered beyond expectations, simply because of what those letters on the front cover spell out-- Rush tends to draw near worship from their fans.  The truth is really somewhere in between. <br /> <br />Making this album unique among Rush records is that joining bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson is drummer John Rutsey-- Neil Peart would not arrive until after Rutsey's exit.  The sound on the record, likely in part to a lack of Peart's presence is very raw blues-based metal-- in fact, while much of it is quite good, its really not extraordinary, there's dozens of albums by contemporaries that can compare in terms of material.  Mind you, these three guys are superb musicians, and the level of virtuosity that would come out in a few years shows on here. <br /> <br />Also missing without Peart however is a strong lyric writer.  Lee and Lifeson try their best, but this is not what either of them excel at, and the lyrics generally never get above the level of \\"hey baby its a quarter to eight and I feel I'm in the mood\\".  This really does cause several pieces (the just quoted \\"In the Mood\\", but also \\"Need Some Love\\", \\"Take a Friend\\", \\"What You're Doing\\") to really lose in quality. <br /> <br />Having stated all that, there is some great material on here-- \\"Finding My Way\\" is a compulsive rocker, \\"Here Again\\" is a great bluesy metal ballad with a killer ringing in your face bass sound, \\"Before And After\\" has some interesting ideas, and for my criticism of \\"In the Mood\\", its actually a pretty good song-- I suspect this is a bias on MY part for knowing what is coming.  And then there's \\"Working Man\\", honestly I never really got this song, but its pretty well regarded by Rush fans and the band evidentally since they play it quite a bit. <br /> <br />Its not great, but its an ok record, and definitely a sign of things to come.  A bad place to start with the band (\\"2112\\" or \\"Moving Pictures\\" would probably be the place), but not a bad record.
B000001EAQ|3.0|This is not my favorite U2 album by a country mile (although it is not the bottom of the heap, I reserve that special circle of rock and roll hell for Zooropa).<br /><br />However, there is one masterpiece here that is not only one of the best songs U2 ever wrote but in my humble opinion, one of the best songs anybody recorded in the 1990's: Staring at the Sun, a gem shining brightly amid the dross.
0060005424|5.0|Next to Sabriel is Lirael, the second best book I have ever read. Sabriel is an impossible book to top, so Lirael is still a fantastic book. In fact, it is such a great book, and delves deeply into the Old Kingdom. Read it, and don't put it down.
B000001ESJ|3.0|After four albums of being essentially a heavy metal band, Rush begins a new phase in their career.  Gone are the dominance of loud guitars and screamed lead vocals (they're still there, mind you, just not as many), instead we get something else, melodic invention, the first heavy use of synthesizers on a Rush album, and some great material.    Really, its the way the band has been headed since Neil Peart joined, but this album must have come as quite a shock in its time, opening with classical guitar and percussion, even as \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" moves into its riffs, its a much more open sound, much cleaner, much less noise, and Lee's taken his voice down a notch and sings in a more comfortable tone.  The results are stunning, capped off by a blazing solo from Lifeson.    The album moves into the extended work, \\"Xanadu\\"-- lacking the titled sections that previous long-form pieces have had, it nonetheless succeeds as much if not moreso than any of them.  Opening with delicate percussion and muted guitars, eventually awakening into a triumphant piece, \\"Xanadu\\" shows just how far the band has come over the years.  The composition is almost sparse-- not a note is wasted, and it works in ways none of their earlier suites, including \\"2112\\" did.  This is followed by ecstatic slow-fast ballad \\"Closer to the Heart\\", a live favorite and just all around superb song.    Unfortunately, that's about it for this album, \\"Cinderella Man\\" is pretty lifeless (although with a cute reprise of a \\"2112\\" theme) and \\"Madrigal\\" is totally unmemorable.  The album's closer, \\"Cygnus X-1\\" does somewhat better, but invariably comparisons to \\"Xanadu\\" are made.  It doesn't hold together as well, being more in the form of the long songs from the last couple albums-- nonetheless the synchronized playing on the opening (particularly Lee's killer bass tone) and the power of the final movement make this a worthwhile listen.    Overall, a mixed effort, worth having certainly for the first half of it.

Among his many awards are the Pulitzer Prize for \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" the National Medal of Science, the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, and a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.<br /><br />In his earlier work, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" Diamond extolled the rise of nations and explained his researched-based reasons for their success. His new book, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,\\" is something of a reverse sequel, exploring why extinct societies have failed.<br /><br />Diamond examines now defunct nations applying five criteria: natural climate change, human exploitation of resources, allies, enemies, and the society's response when faced with collapse. \\"Collapsed\\" is both meticulously researched and creatively written, weaving together analysis and narrative into a template that explains one view of societal collapse.<br /><br />Some see in \\"Collapse\\" politically correctness combined with a fatalistic attitude. Yet, his subtitle and his exposition both point to thoughtful reflection and potential correction. If, indeed, we can learn from history, then \\"Collapse\\" suggests that we start the dialogue. Though his thesis fails to convince his critics, his research and writing never fails to prompt discussion.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

0060528737|5.0|This book is by far the best book I have ever read, and most likely the best book I will read. I am just surprised that it hasn't had that much publicity. It is like a hidden treasure, buried deep in the YA section of the bookstore. Read it, don't miss out.
B000001ESN|4.0|The blazing, famous guitar riff that begins \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" lets you know you're in for something entirely different with this record, and  indeed on this album, Rush shakes off the last vestiges of their metal youth and fully flowers into maturity.<br /><br />Maturity in rock tends to mean going the way of \\"adult contemporary\\", but its the wrong way to think of this album-- its only with a calm assuredness that comes with experience in any field could such a bold statement be made, while it is the next step in the evolution of the band, they've pretty much abandoned their old song-- gone are the screamed vocals, the thunderous distorted guitar, instead a fully integrated synthesizer sound and expressive vocal takes hold.  Not to say mind you that there isn't some incredible power trio work on here-- these guys have not forgotten how to play!<br /><br />The opening two tracks were the singles from the album, \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", with its great intro, killer verses, totally self-assured vocal from Geddy Lee, reggae bridge, and monster guitar solo from Alex Lifeson was and should have been a hit.  \\"Freewill\\" is a bit different, more riff-based, structure based, also a good song, but not quite reaching the heights of the opener.  What follows, however, may have been quite unexpected, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\"-- calm, patient, building tension.  Synth washed, with some great subtle drums, and really made possible in this more subtle manner because of Lee's confident vocal delivery.  Its really amazing listening to this album against the older ones to see just how much he's matured over the first several years of Rush's career.  \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is also the first signpost in the next direction the band would take, where synthesizers and keyboards become as important as guitars to the band's music.<br /><br />The album does kind of drift a bit after \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", neither \\"Entre Nous\\" or \\"Different Strings\\" are terribly memorable (the former does have a really heartfelt vocal delivery of sweet lyrics by drummer Neil Peart, but really isn't much to note).  In many ways, these, like the three that proceed them, are Rush feeling out the future.<br /><br />\\"Natural Science\\" is a bit different, and over the previous couple tracks, a bit better--  as close to a return to the older sound as this album gets, it churns and boils and overflows, and like the epics one earlier albums, does have sections, but like the rest of this album, it has that confidence of delivery that prevents them from getting too self-indulgent.<br /><br />\\"Permanant Waves\\" is by a band that's been there, done that, and kept moving, only without a doubt they've hit their stride now, there's precious little thats not superb here.rtfelt vocal delivery of sweet lyrics by drummer Neil Peart, but really isn't much to note).

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's \\"Blow Up\\" is a definitive critique of the 1960s...much like \\"Easy Rider\\", \\"Pierrot Le Fou\\" & \\"Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas\\". Like most of Antonioni films, the first time you see \\"Blow Up\\" you might find it intriguing but a little boring. The second time, you'll find it simply intriguing. By the third and fourth viewing, you'll be completely hooked and savor the careful pacing and Antonioni's masterful command of detail. Every frame, every image, every sparse word spoken is filled with nuance. Ultimately, I feel \\"Blow Up\\" is foreshadowing the Love Generation's failure to inspire long-lasting change in the world; while they got high, government conspiracies were transpiring: Pepper Land shadowed by the grassy knoll.   <br /> <br />The DVD image is good, the sound decent and as I stated above, the film gets better with repeat viewing...so it's definitely worth buying. With the exception of the campy trailers, the extras are lacking. The commentary by Peter Brunette is especially horrible. How this guy was able to write a book about Antonioni confounds me. The man is such a PC wanker, constantly saying how loathsome the protagonist is (played wonderfully by David Hemmings). As in most writing, the protagonist was an extension of Antonioni; so if Mr. Brunette dislikes such a character, it's a good chance he wouldn't like Antonioni much. And why is Hemmings's character so loathsome? Because he's a talented professional who doesn't have time for imperfection and niceties? Because he's curt with vacuous fashion models? Give me a break. Perhaps Mr. Brunette should write for Ms and leave film criticism to people who aren't so easily offended. It's not like the man had any useful insights; he hardly has anything to say about the film (there's plenty of silence in the commentary) that doesn't get past the obvious. There are numerous scenes that scream for interpretation in which he doesn't offer any whatsoever. It gets quite vexing after awhile...that'swhy I shut off the commentary after a point. <br /> <br />It's best to let the movie speak for itself.
B00002RAOU|4.0|The first scene is classic Mario Bava...Director Bava, wants us to think there is a plot here to follow-- trouble is, there is no plot.... A countess is murdered along with her murderer...(still with me)...And others start to die in ugly ways. <br />The scene with the octopus clinging to a rotting dead corpse's face is freaky beyond freaky...in all cinema. Can you say \\"Alien\\"? <br />There is no one murderer in this movie...Everyone in this film is a murderer. <br />In this flick, everybody dies...Everyone kills everyone else over greed and materialism-- This seems to be Bava's take on humanity... <br />In the final scene-- children murder their parents and skip down to the water's edge without a second thought. <br />Conclusion: Dated but, face it, Mario Bava is a lost genius.
0385510454|4.0|This book has high tech, spy satellites, international intrigue, a lawyer who practices little law and a good chase.<br /><br />While the main character learns the history of northern Italy, savors the food and learns the language, not a lot happens.  Who am I to hold a tax-deductible trip to Italy against a successful author?<br /><br />While it will not be remembered as one of Grisham's best, it is an enjoyable read.  It deserves 4 stars.
B000002TWN|5.0|There is something delectable different about this album, it has a lot of the usual style and slickness of r+b but somehow transcends the mainstream with its special feel.<br /><br /> The difference being more than the usual nod at past influences, there is a lovely reincarnated feel of the 60's about it and though it has echoes of early Stevie Wonder, it stands out also as sassy and sexy 90's album from a unique and experimental artist.
B000001E7L|5.0|Back in 1993 the Cranberries emerged from their multiplatinum success, Everybody Else is Doing It, So Why Can't We? The clever Irish foursome was not about to stop. In 1994 the group released this album, No Need to Argue and it proved that they were here to stay. <br /> <br />On No Need to Argue the Cranberries take more of a punch than on their previous album. More politically charged songs and they start to get in touch with their rockside. But that doesn't mean Dolores doesn't use her electric voice for a few beautiful ballads.  <br /> <br />STANDOUT TRACKS: Ode to my Family, The Icicle Melts, Zombie, Ridculous Thoughts, Daffodil Lament and Yeat's Grave <br /> <br />
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I can only believe that Daft Punk would be pleased to see the type of back and forth going on here.  I bought Homework in '97 after hearing Around the World once.  Bought Discovery the day it came out, the same with Human After All.  However, in terms of form, I'd have to say this release is most comparable to their live release, Alive 1997.  The raw samples and dirty repetition are similar to the style employed within that 45 minute set.  This makes me wonder, with the title \\"Human After All\\", are Daft Punk ready to appear in the flesh before human audiences, wielding an impressive new arsenal of edgy sounds to be arranged live?  I can only hope.   <br /> <br />As an album, this release thrives thematically, and stylistically.  Naysayers today will begin to come around in the next year or so.  Many areas of dance music, especially house, are taking a turn to the more rocked-out sound.   <br /> <br />I hope to hear some rad remixes from this album echoing off the walls of dance clubs in the near future.  I think the simplicity of these songs would lend itself nicely to the task of remixing.  Guess we'll have to wait and see, although I'm itching to get my groove on to \\"Technologic\\".
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I watched this movie once, several months ago. I'm writing this review more about the impact the film left on me over time, rather than an immediate impression. <br /> <br />Several reviewers call this a racist movie that belittles Japanese. I disagree. This movie isn't about Japan or about the Japanese people. It is about two Americans who are lost in a place where nothing is familiar so they are forced to confront their own problems and loneliness because there is nothing else for them to do. This story had to be made in a foreign place, and it could have been Tokyo, or it could have been Bombay, Bangkok or Madrid. But I understand the choice of Japan. The location needed to be where few speak English and where the culture is unfamiliar to the characters and most of the audience. If you put these two characters in a hotel in New York or Chicago they wouldn't have come together. They are so unalike that they had to be in a place where merely being American and lonely was enough to bring them together.  <br /> <br />This is a story about two people in a foreign place who are in no position to cope with their unfamiliar environs. That has less to do with who or where they are than the stages of life they are in. Bob is entering a classic mid-life crisis where his career is declining and he's losing touch with his family. Charlotte is young and newly married and is coming to grips with her new identity as the wife of a photographer who has little time or attention to give her and seems to have lost interest in her. They are struggling to find their own identities in times of transition. That's hard enough to do in comfortable, familiar surroundings, but transporting them to this crowded city of strange voices, smells, sounds and bright lights just amplifies their loneliness. <br /> <br />Put these two characters in a US city and they'll find refuge in a bar, a movie theater,a book store, a museum, a ballgame or whatever. But put them in Tokyo and they are lost. They are not in a position to learn or appreciate the new and rich culture that surrounds them. They are looking for distraction and comfort but instead they find themselves feeling lost and out of place. <br /> <br />So Coppola's treatment of Japanese characters isn't racist or demeaning. It is just a plot device used to emphasise how Charlotte and Bob are feeling. <br /> <br />I found the story and characters very moving. It is deliberately paced slowly and is shot and scored to give it a dreamlike quality. It is a story of an unlikely friendship in an unfamiliar place, yet the story is so direct and human that it feels familiar. <br /> <br />This movie isn't everyone's cup of tea. Action film fans should look elsewhere, as should fans of slapstick comedy. This subtle film needs to be given space to seep into your pores and transport you. The impatient and inattentive need not apply.
B00009L1TA|1.0|This is absolutely the worst military movie I have ever seen!  Jackson's character is over the top and his \\"Rangers\\" are pathetic.  The writers, producers and director were completely clueless from begining to end.   <br /> <br />Look, if you want to make a political statement about women in the military then do it.  But you better make sure that the rest of the flick has some sort of credibility!  These guys are supposed to be Special Forces but then they are called \\"Rangers\\" too.  Well, which is it?  Rangers are NOT S.F. my dears. Some were also wearing non-combatant unit patches. To make matters worse these guys are wearing a RAINBOW of beret colors.  <br /> <br />S.F./Ranger/Typist: \\"Ooh, I think I'll wear my maroon hat to fight today!\\"   <br /> <br />And WHY are they wearing them in the JUNGLE!  Is that a poncho liner that Jackson is wearing like some sort of cape?!!  In the JUNGLE!?  With a Sweater!!!?  The Library of Freaking Congress could not hold a list that could detail all the blunders in this movie!   <br /> <br />As a member of Special Forces I was truly insulted that the producers of this film didn't have enough respect for my job OR THEIRS to do even the teeniest weensiest bit of research that takes to make even a forgivably bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Love Tyler
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an amazing film, one of the best that I have seen. Not only is it captivating, it has great musical and dance numbers. It teaches an important lesson that it is better to love and to lose than never have loved at all. It's pretty much a love it or hate it movie and I am proud to say that I love it, love it, love it!
B000059H98|5.0|It may be some time since this film hit the theaters, and I have always heard positive references to the movie by my friends 'in the know'  .... Hands down if you enjoy comics this is probabvly the BEST ever depiction of a comic book character ..... It makes Spiderman, Batman et al seem very very weak indeed ...  <br /> <br /> <br />Now do not expect the glitz and glamour of mainstreamers but this is one highy easy going, entertaining and just a plain fun movie .. It will be a cult favorite long after the others are collecting dust on the shelves ....
B000687M48|5.0|I bought this CD because I had a gift certificate, and it well exceeded my virtually absent expectations. A lot of people said it was basically Fallen live, but I find that it's much more. My favourite tracks are Missing, Breathe No More and the cover Thoughtless, which aren't on any other Evanescence records I believe. Also, new life is brought to Bring Me to Life (a pun? excellent), which I was getting pretty sick of from constant airplay. Going Under on this album is much better than on Fallen, I find. Overall, the live performance is amazing and I would recommend buying this over Fallen because of the seamless vocals, the added tracks, and the emotion a life performance brings. Go on.. aren't you out buying it yet??
0393035158|5.0|Can we face up to the existential fact that we don't know everything?  That we may never know? Accept uncertainty? Yet not give up and work with what we do know and can prove? Not seek refuge in some codified dogmas of the past on someone's say so? Teach our children to face up to life as is, without filling them with comforting and/or murderous fantasies? Not delude us into some kind of escapism on the name of religion or otherwise? As far as we can tell, this one life is all we have. Face it. And it is up to each of us to make it worthwhile for ourselves and others. It takes lot of courage, but so be it. May be now is the time start the dialogue.    About the book.  The author has been accused of atheistic fundamentalism, and being the very thing he tries to criticize. A dogmatic approach to life's unknown questions, a level of certainty that borders on intolerance towards people with differing opinions, a blind faith in reason and dialogue to rectify all the cotemporary ills of the society.  As the author himself accepts, he is too radical for an average person to be comfortable with. May be so. I for one, think the message is on the mark though the delivery may leave some reeling.    What is his message?     1. Faith is nothing but beliefs about the world we live in not supported by evidence but accepted as dogma. As beliefs, faith brings forward actions (including that of a religious suicide bomber, or actions of totalitarian regimes inspired by secular dogmas such as Nazism, fascism). In the present day, religious literalism of outdated dogmas encourages such ill-conceived actions and hence need to be addressed instead of only looking for causes such as socio, economic, political reasons. Anybody who knows history would not doubt there is an element of truth in this.     2. Also faith is a conversation stopper since it closes ones mind to any form of evidence or persuasion. In modern society where dialogue is the tool that is increasingly relied up on to resolve differences in opinion, faith is a monkey wrench. This aspect of faith is pushing societies toward brink of destruction (especially in this day and age where the \\"power of one\\", a single fanatic with right weapon can effectively shut the conversation of many.) Even the most faithful can not fail to see the logic in this.    This book is NOT ABOUT ONE RELIGION OR THE OTHER. It is about blind faith on dogmas and it consequent lack of open mindedness. There is no reason to get all worked up about it but mull over the implications for an increasingly integrated yet sectarian global society.    As others have said before,     The foundation of all morality is to have done, once and for all, with lying; to give up pretending to believe that for which there is no evidence, and repeating unintelligible propositions about things beyond the possibilities of knowledge.     -- Thomas Henry Huxley     This book is highly moral.    Because they know not the forces of nature, and in order that they may have comrades in their ignorance, they suffer not that others should search out anything, and would have us believe like rustics and ask no reason...But we ask in all things a reason must be sought.   -- William of Conches     This book begs for little more reason and lot less God.    Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.  -- Charles Mackay    In my opinion, a hopeless cause. But this book is a good beginning.    Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider.  Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.   -- Francis Bacon     This book deserves to be read with diligence and attention.

Moore delivers a kick ass mystery wrapped in his wondrous imagination.  Even though I'm just discovering the world of graphic novels, man am I glad I did.  I'm almost sorry I started with the Big Three-- Watchmen, From Hell and Gaiman's Sandman--  because...it just can't get any better can it?!
B00005JKNC|5.0|I read the reviews of this film and I am amazed at how far down the road of cynicism we have gone in so many ways.  And who gives a rapper's curse that \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" was written in 1962.  I can always find faults in most films that makes this one less than trivial.  This kind of reviewing is for petty people.   <br /> <br />No - I will tell you, I am college educated, been around the world and had all my ideals shattered at one time or another.  But this film had my wife and I in tears of joy and sorrow.  This film takes us back to some very needed basics with a classic set up.  It starts off almost as if it was another Carey comedy, but soon turns into something else.  You are too hardened to care that a guy gets stuck on a bridge, in a rain storm?  You don't care that he goes over?  Have you ever met someone who can't recall their past?  It's very sad.  Hey, that black man alone in the film is representative of possibly scores of similar situations that existed back then. (A lot like the black woman my uncle took in and saved from a miserable slow death on the street as a destitute old woman.  He founded a home for homeless recoverng alcholics in the early '60s based on that gesture.  What a cornball he was!)   <br /> <br />If this film cannot move you, you are likely hopelessly lost in a post modern anarchy of the heart, needing another cinematic action/shock fix to keep you interested in life.  The scene of Carey's character facing up to the devils in the place of civil servants is supreme, even if it is merely an update.  Only a great actor could play that as well as Carey did, right down to the shakey hand and fearfull eyes.  And Jim Carey deserves some recognition as an actor.   <br /> <br />We happen to know Ferndale, California, where this film was made and visited just as the set was closing.  Mr. Carey left a swath of love and friendship in his wake.  What a supreme guy.  Someday, I hope he gets to shake off his stereotype and gets a part that will win him the recognition he deserves.  This film is but one blow against his concrete prison.
0743454537|5.0|What follows is a post I wrote to several people.   <br />I liked My Sister's Keeper a lot and felt Jodi did a fine job of examining family dynamics and the frustration of sibling rivalry when another is ill and has all the attention.  Pure novel, but as many of Picoult's novels do, examined current or past issues which seem to be off limits for many contemporary authors. I admire Picoult for not only setting limits, but for stretching them.  Good book.  Second Glance explores deplorable eugenics experiments, and The Pact, teen suicide. Picoult is fearless and intrepid. <br />Sometimes her books aren't the tightest lace on the shoe, but they are always fresh and thought provoking, well researched, summoning readers to understanding and enjoyment regarding difficult subject matter.  Picoult is in a class by herself. <br /> <br />Roe
B0006M4SO6|2.0|Yikes! I've listened to and loved Pat Metheny Group music for years, but I can barely listen to this album.  The music is tedious and uninivting.  Despite the absence of a lead singer, PMG still often has a melody or lyric.  Most of this latest music is devoid of such themes.  For me, TWU is mostly an album of musical stuntmanship.  I regret even more going to the concert, but that is a different story.  While many people think this album is great, I am unloading mine on the second hand market.  It's an album for musical archivists.  Ugh!!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Jude Law (JL), Natalie Portman (NP), Clive Owen (CO) and Julia Roberts (JR) star in this exploration of relationships. But this is anything but a mushy movie.  <br /> <br />Jude Law plays this \\"obsessed with truth\\" man, who is unable to keep a relationship, breaking in and out of relationships. Clive Owen plays a dermatologist who meets Julia Roberts through a prank by Jude Law. That prank scene is one, graphic interlude in cyberspace and must be the first mainstream movie that addresses this aspect of modern lives.  <br /> <br />JL is excellent in this movie and there will be a lot of broken-hearted/delighted women at the end of the movie depending on what they like about JL. The climax of the movie is particularly fantastic. It is pretty difficult to write an original romantic movie these days, considering the vast no. of movies in the genre. But then writing out a mature script like this, must be tougher! <br /> <br />NP stars in the role of this neo-waif who appears in JL's life and plays out an amazing sequence of events. This must be her best role yet. And she delivers like a Blue Whale on Steriods! Solid performance. She is absolutely at home playing this natural, no frills, young lady in JL's life. She is particularly terrific in one scene with CO where she keeps uttering soft \\"Thank You s\\" while he's raving. She's \\"Oh! so desirable!\\" as the young carefree girlfriend of JL in the initial parts of the movie. And then there's this extraordinary scene in which JR is shooting NP.  <br /> <br />JR essays the role of a professional photographer, quite creditably. Her character brings to mind the protagonist's lover (also a photographer) in Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\\" She's got an ordinary role in the movie, not quite as strong as JL/NP/CO, but she is very impressive as the woman who's torn between a man who dotes on her and a man who can't see her with anyone else. <br /> <br />The surprise packet is CO. He excels in the role of the sex-obsessed husband who is surprisingly faithful to JR, to whom he is married till the ending of the movie where the movie turns into a hash of relationships gone awry - like the script writer went crazy. Anyways, watch out for the last few scenes in the movie where JL goes to meet CO at work. Awesome. If one thought that a star could never be overshadowed by a lesser known actor, check this out. <br /> <br />On that tantalizing note, I recommend Closer for anyone who's been in and out of an intense relationship or will be!
0743454529|5.0|Picoult is a new author for me, and I will definitely be reading more of her work. She creates believable characters and situations, and her story is that of a gifted writer. This book opened my eyes to a situation I'd never considered before: \\"designer babies\\", whether for genetic reasons or not. I've heard different sides of the debate in the past, but had never really given it much thought from my own personal viewpoint.<br /><br />Not only does this book bring up this issue, but it also explores family dynamics and the struggle to grow into an individual person, separate from the family yet still connected. Every emotion is evident in this book and I would highly recommend it. Don't let the size of the book scare you off. It reads quickly and eloquently and after one page, you'll be hooked.
0671015206|2.0|There is no question that the book provides good advice to  consumer oriented American society. But,it fails to deal with living choices, balancing the pleasure of luxury vs a large bank account. Life is short and self denial does not seem a satisfactory way to live it. <br /> <br />The so called statistics are laughable. They remind me of numerous professional lectures in which the presenter thinks that a series of slides with a \\" laundry list \\" of data is effective education. <br /> <br />Page after page of repitition does not make for good reading. <br />The message here would have been easily delivered in one half the space. <br /> <br />In short, the concept is laudable, but the research and the way it is delivered is a joke.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Rented this thing - thank goodness. If I had paid to see it in a theater I would have been mad. <br /> <br />First off, it's not a complete movie. There is no real ending. Tarrinto thinks everyone loves him so much they will lineup for what is basically episodes of his half-baked story. <br /> <br />Secondly, if you're going to create a ridiculous fight movie, leave it fun and ridiculous. Tarrinto tries too hard to make a plausible story line and the movie loses direction. <br /> <br />I'll pass on the sequel.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|At some points this movie is almost like a Nerd Documentary.  The dialogue is alarmingly on the button.  The wide-open country western setting of Preston, Idaho, provides an exhilarating backdrop.  For being so hopelessly realistic, the generous ending comes as a pleasant surprise.  Can't say I fell in love with the thing (I kept waiting for a story, a critical conflict, or at least one major emotion from one of the principals) but points have to be awarded for originality, and there is a certain moment at that dance where the universal awkwardness of being human just slammed me in the head.
B0001I561E|5.0|Yep, this is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. It is right up there with Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. When I heard the movie was released on DVD, I did not hesitate to purchase it. The movie is a combination of adventure, comedy, lessons of learning to just be yourself, and romance, with the magic carpet ride being one of the most amazing love sequences Disney has ever made.  <br />The special features are also very enjoyble. Diamond in the Rough is one of my favorites; it goes behind the scenes of the making of Aladdin. There are some games, sing alongs and music videos, including the pop version of \\"A Whole New World,\\" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle. The are tons of other things on this DVD that are just amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone no matter how old they are.
B0007P3582|4.0|I loved get rich, u love get rich, WE ALL loved get rich, and so far this album really seems to be a love/hate almost 50-50 (no punn intended). Get rich or die trying was so good becuz every beat was good and it none of the verses dragged out or got old. this album has a lot of repetition (for example 50 talking about his teflon vest), not good beats, and lacking 2nd and third verses. HOWEVER, ther are great and good tracks on this album. 50 cent makes really great choruses, and his first verses are pretty good. Also his voice, laugh, and precence on each track are something that some more lyrical rappers lack.  hears a break down of the tracks: <br /> <br />-In my hood: i like this song, first line:great, form ther on it is very good. It has a hot beat with a cool little sax solo at the end, good start (8/10) <br />-This is 50: a let down from the first track, i usually skip it, but its not that bad (5/10) <br />-Im supposed to die tonight: one of my absolute favorites! the chorus and the beat are TOP class. REALLY GOOD (9.5/10) <br />-Piggy Bank: y is everyone putting down the beat on this song!? its hot! the disses arent that good, but ther not terrible, i even like the things he says in the song that arents disses, one of the stronger tracks on the album (8/10) <br />-Gatman and Robbin: this song had a really cool idea and structure, but it could have been better.  Eminems beat is lacking, they should have let dre do it (6/10) <br />-Candy Shop: one of several hate it or love it tracks, for me however, it was really good when it came out but it got played out faster than in da club and wasnt as popular as in da club, still hot (7/10) <br />-Outta Control: Definitely one of the strongest tracks, a dre track with 50 cent rapping, enough said (8/10) <br />-Get in my car:hmmm, cathchy? thats about it nothing special here but its not that bad, i skip it less than half the time, so i think it deserves over half score (6/10) <br />-Ski Mask Way: probably wont be popular becuz of the underground type beat and lack of hype, but its maybe my favorite, the lyrics are nice, i like the concept and the beat (9/10) <br />-A Balitmore Love thing: another one that i dont see becoming popular, but another of my favorites. the beat seems a tonal, like wall paper at first, but it grows on u along with the mood of the song. A bit of creativity here as 50 plays the part of a drug. this song is great (9/10) <br />-Ryder Music: one reason why im not in love with the album. this is song is pitiful, NO ONE could ride to that, God (3/10) <br />-Disco Inferno: Beat is overrated but not bad, the song isnt original but its a good listen (7/10) <br />-Just a lil bit: the first time i heard it i sort of liked it, but after a couple more listens its really very boring. The chorus is one of 50's worst, but the song isnt as bad as some of the others (5/10) <br />-Gunz Come Out: Can someone explain to me y 50 cent is trying to sing soprano, that is horrifying, besides that its sort of a cool beat and traditional gunman gansta rap (6/10) <br />-My toy solider: pretty good, i like the way 50 says toy soldier, thats pretty cool.  Good beat, cool sound effects, completly different from eminems like toy soldiers, but still good. However, why does every one feature tony yayo doing one verse,he isnt that good, and he definitely doesn't add to these somgs as much as some other rappers could (8/10) <br />-Position of Power: im not gonna write much about this song, its ok (5/10) <br />-Build You up: this seems like a love hate, i hate it.  the beat annoys the hell out of me and jamie foxx does nothing for the song (4/10) <br />-God gave me style: like just a lil bit this got old, maybe as good or better then the latter (5.5/10) <br />-So Amazing: i can actually say this; SO BAD. this is disgusting and disgraceful, i love u 50, but what were u thinking (3/10) <br />-I don't need em: Mad Good, the part where he speaks right after the chorus just gives me the chills: thebeat, his speech, so hot. i really like this track and it has the same style of beat as ski mask and love thing, it grows on u (8/10) <br />-Hate it or Love it: as good as the one on the documentary, pretty cool (7.5/10) <br /> <br />All in all i like this cd, but even the songs i rated highly are just missing something that get rich tracks had, i was disapointed. Ski mask way and baltimore love song are great but not exciting, like some of the other tracks. this album doesnt get me as pumped as some other albums.  Solid, but not 50s best.
B000005JA8|3.0|Although there are bright spots in this double album that really are entertaining, too much of it is just doodling.  I'm suspicious of anyone who claims to honestly get more excited by Beefheart's doodling than by his music.  If you want to hear what Beefheart was really capable of, start with Strictly Personal.  Never mind the critics who complain about the production.  A little bit of studio mischief detracts little from his best work.
6305428425|5.0|How can you not love this film? The unbelievably lovely and talented Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow play Romy and Michelle, high school galpals for life who decide to attend their ten-year reunion at Sagebrush High in Tucson.<br /><br />Realizing that their lives aren't so exciting after all (as 28 year old unmarried roommates who work as cashiers when they work at all, and spend most of their nights out clubbing but going home alone together), the girls decide to make themselves over as businesswomen. Romy poses as the inventor of the Post-It Note. (Michelle picked the color yellow.)<br /><br />It's a neat plan, but of course it gets fouled up by the \\"A\\" girls and mean ol' Jeaneane Garofalo who can't say a single sentence without at least three colorful one-syllable words in it. Having been exposed as goofy fakes, Romy and Michelle decide to be themselves (that is, as goofy fLakes), and steal the show.<br /><br />The plot's more worked over than the girls will ever be (let us hope), and just as slender, but Sorvino and Kudrow are so endearing and obviously had such a good time being silly together on camera that the movie never lags. You just feel good at the end. It doesn't hurt that they are simply cuter than kittens, either.<br /><br />Sit back and belly laugh!
0316921173|2.0|Nearly a decade after its first publication, David Foster Wallace's novel \\"Infinite Jest\\" remains a literary ink-blot test.  With its 1,079 pages (including nearly 400 footnotes), and its fondness for gags, drugs, cultural theory, recent US popular culture, scientific minutae, and latinate vocabulary, the novel invariably divides readers on matters of literary technique and the question of Wallace's literary talent.<br /><br />I tend to believe the author's stylistic pyrotechnics are not bright enough to hide the comparatively dull substance of his writing; but I can't dismiss Wallace as a literary artist.  \\"Infinite Jest\\" is neither the Next Big Thing (except for the size of the tome itself), nor does it signal the beginning of the end of American letters, as Dale Peck et al seem to believe.<br /><br />The novel's tragic flaw is its lack of emotion depth.  Wallace seems more interested in inventing acronyms and an \\"apres\\" filmography than in rendering human beings.  And while his drawing adolescent tennis phenoms in the terms of popular psychology and millenial technological frenzy rings true, his doing so with the mostly lower-class urbanite residents of a halfway house does not.<br /><br />Focusing on such young, shallow characters violates what might be the only rule for compelling fiction: there has to be something at stake in the story.  You may not forget Hal Incandenza, the teenage tennis and linguistic prodigy who is as close to a protagonist as this novel offers; but it is this implausibly combination of natural gifts, not Wallace's rendering of character or of his story itself, that make the eiditic Hal memorable.  Hal's lower-class counterpart, a thirtyish petty thug named Don Gately, recovering in a Boston-area halfway house, is more intriguing for the difficulty of his situation.  But Wallace presents Gately as lacking self-awareness to a degree that kills whatever sympathy readers might otherwise hold for him.<br /><br />Wallace's experimental style does not disguise the essential weakness of his writing here either. Few of the narratives coalesce, and it is often difficult to imagine why editors did not simply send certain passages off to the exosphere.  The apparently arbitrary chronology works against any sort of pace Wallace might have established.  And, though the novel wisely ends on an ambiguous note, this note is frustratingly oblique.  It's difficult to imagine why a writer of Wallace's blinding intellectual gifts and erudition would offer up a cheap metafictional trick as the denoument of his magnum opus.  \\"Infinte Jest\\" feels like it should have ended at least 500 pages earlier, and yet it hasn't earned an ending.<br /><br />Wallace should be commended for his attempt to add intellectual depth to modern American fiction without sacrificing the traditional literary devices of characterization and narrative,  and to dramatize the effects on the consciousness, and the conscience, of our hydra-headed consumerism.

B000003C5C|5.0|Before i get into the review, lemme talk to that kid who had the balls to give this classic 1 star: go to hell! Chuck Schuldiner was one of the best guitarists of all time!!! He slays ALL of those bands you posted (not to say they're bad, they're all good)! If you say it takes no talent, have you ever tried PLAYING IT YOURSELF?!?!?!??!?! Hahahahahaha! Bet ya can't solo like Chuck could! Go back to listening to your gay Poison poseur metal.<br /><br />Now back to the album. Death's second album, Leporsy (1988) is one of the biggest improvements in metal history, if not, in all of music. The lyrics, in particular, have changed. On their debut album, Scream Bloody Gore, the lyrics were inspired by horror films and were violently gory, in the vein of Cannibal Corpse. Here, however, the lyrics are AMAZING. This album also contains killer guitar solos, insane double-bass drumming, great bass-lines, and brilliant vocals/lyrics! Not to mention some killer rhythm work from guitarist Rick Rozz (shame he only lasted for this album and the next one). The album starts out with the tital track, which contains an awesome long, high-pitched scream from Chuck. The next song, Born Dead also is kcik-ass. My favorite songs are Leprosy, Born Dead, Forgotten Past, Left To Die, Pull The Plug, Open Casket, Primitive Ways, and Chocke On It. Have you noticed that I mentioned ALL the songs? Well, it's because EVERY song here is a masterpiece! Overall, a greta album, but start with Symbolic of The Sound of Perseverance; those are their best albums and best places to start. Thank you for reading!!!<br /><br />R.I.P. Chuck Schuldiner 1967-2001.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Judas Priest does not disappoint on this new album.  Don't let their age fool you, they just get better and better.   \\"Demonizer\\", \\"Judas is Rising\\" showcase the spirit of Judas Priest.   Mellow-er tracks such as \\"Worth Fighting for\\" and \\"Angel\\" might be slower but they are no less powerful.   The rest of the album is A+.    The real selling point of this album is this: producer ROY Z.  Anyone who is a fan of Halford (solo project) or solo Bruce Dickenson will know what I'm talking about!!
1576751988|3.0|I liked all the great reviews and even now I am thinking that I missed something in this book that others got out of it.  But really guys...is it me or is every chapter talking about the same thing.  In fact there are a few pages that every chapter starts about the same thing just reworded a little.  Its like a really good chapter was made and all the rest were reworded versions of that one great chapter.  I wouldn't buy this again.  I did get some useful stuff out of it but take a look at it in a book store before you buy it.  The author has like 20 or so audio books and stuff in the back section.  The topics even seem to over lap with each one.  Its like buying Turbo Tax.  Why did they make so many versions of the same thing?  Over marketing?  One heck of a great chapter but this short book would have been even better if they kept it 20 pages or so.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|A very good album.  A dam*ed good album.  I nearly broke into tears when I heard the first song \\"Judas Rising\\" and Halford's shriek to begin.  Okay, enough metal propaganda.  For the serious review, I will stand by what I say as to this being a five star album.  The guitars and drums (along with the vocals) are in top 'Priest' form.  The hiatus from playing with the band seems to have given Halford a much needed creative break because through out the album one of the outstanding features are the lyrical writings.  Brilliant I tell you.
0060005688|4.0|I don't necessarily agree with the author that less choice is better. We are always faced with choices and will make bad ones on regular basis. Actively limiting choices so that our life becomes easier and therefore more fulfilling - I disagree. I think to have more choices is great and presents a lot of opportunities.  <br /> <br />What important, however, is to understand how we make our choices. And in that regard this book is great. It is full of examples of how we actually do that, be it jam in the supermarket or career. Most importantly, it's great fun to read about it. I found many instances when I acted in the same way as subjects in experemints described. We really get very confused trying to justify our choices.   <br /> <br />No matter how educated or developed, we are humans, with all our emotions attached to us. Despite what many people think, emotions penetrate almost everything in our lives. Our careers, choices of food, investments we make, the way we talk and act and miriads of other things - are all dependent of our emotions. This book presents it very well. And it helps to understand our limitations.  <br /> <br />So next time I am confronted with a serious choice, I will try and formally analyse pros and cons of each option, and make my decision based on that analysis... And then agonize over it anyway. <br /> <br />Have fun, read this book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00013EY7Q|4.0|Lost In Translation <br />  <br /> She is young, cute, and outgoing. He is married, successful, and unhappy. Together Bob Harris-played by Bill Murray and Charlotte-played by Scarlet Johansson, make up the dynamic duo in the film Lost In Translation. Directed by Sofia Coppola in 2003, the drama/comedy is stunning and full of flavor with the help of the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan. As a great friendship evolves into something that some of us would simply envy, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson deliver award-winning performances as the fun loving characters Bob and Charlotte with the help of a great musical score and creative filming techniques. <br /> Bob's life is no more exciting than watching paint dry. Going through a mid-life crisis, the film opens with him receiving a message from his wife saying that he has forgotten his son's birthday. We see early on that Bob has lost touch with those close to him. With his television career going down the drain, Bob seems lost within his own world, which makes great reference to the films title.  His run-down battery is instantly re-charged when his eyes fall upon Charlotte while on a crowded elevator. Just seeing Charlotte for the first time Bob's eyes are fixed, almost in a daze, on no one but her. Once they meet and hang out some, something in Charlotte inspires Bob.  However when Bob reaches out to his wife via phone, she only pushes him away by assuming something is wrong with him. It would be safe to assume that Bob wanted to perhaps take the first step towards changing his relationship with his wife, but he hangs up regretting he ever called.  <br /> Charlotte on the other hand is not as alone. She seems to seek peace within herself since her husband is so occupied with work. As Charlotte searches for a new outlook on life, she also re-evaluates her marriage to her workaholic photographer husband. Early in the film Charlotte visits a temple of worship. Later, when she calls a friend to talk, it's only obvious thatsomething is bothering her, but her friend doesn't notice. Charlotte hangs up the phone and begins to cry silently to herself. Recently graduating from Yale in Philosophy, Charlotte is going through a quarter-life crisis. Her concerns seem to be with her direction in life. Although several years younger than Bob, Charlotte is too looking for a new lease on life. She listens to self-motivating tapes, and is unsure what she wants to do with her career when Bob inquires.  Charlotte's witty, intellectual personality sets the stage for Bob's sarcastic, yet almost empty personality. Their uneventful lives end when they begin spending lonely evenings together and hanging out with friends together. <br /> Overall, the film is a great feel good movie. However, disappointing to me was the absence of a love scene between Bob and Charlotte. Understanding that both of their characters are married, I did not see why their relationship could not have included a love scene or continued beyond Tokyo. I guess it is morally wrong to suggest a love scene, but a small one seemed appropriate. In the film, Bob ends up sleeping with the lounge singer. I thought the story would have tickled more fancies had there been a love scene between Bob and Charlotte instead. If their connection were so powerful to the point that they did not even introduce themselves to each other, a small physical scene between them would not have killed the movie. On the other hand, I suppose it is the genuine connection between the two that give the film its eloquent status.  <br /> Even without a love scene, the music used in the film is what set precedence throughout the film. From the beginning, as Bob awakens in his cab to see the vibrant and colorful city of Tokyo, the angelic music sets the melodramatic tone of the film. Complementary and atmospheric, the music plays a major role in the film. The music is a part of the film and not just used during brief intermissions or to pass time. The music was more than just a great score. It helped create and to generate the audiences emotions. As Charlotte gets on the train to visit the temple, the soft-rock playing lightly in the background represents how she is feeling at the time, upbeat and feel good. Then as she enters the temple, the soft-rock is faded-over with bell dongs, the beat of drums, and chanting from the monks. Lastly, the soft piano playing in the bar, as Bob and Charlotte poetically connect, is another example of the music complementing the films content. The music altogether complemented the films characters, content, and filming style. <br /> Positively, the most creative and artistic part of the film was Coppola's use of Tokyo's decorative and magnificent city lights. The technique of filming outside of a cars' window to see the reflecting lights on the window is a stunning technique that Coppola utilizes more than once in the film. I particularly enjoy those shots, because it is the city and its color that enhances the films overall character. The massive city, bright lights, and great crowds of people, demonstrates how being lost in translation can simply mean more than a simple breakdown in communication.   <br /> Rolling Stone magazine says, \\"Don't stall on seeing Sofia Coppola's altogether remarkable film\\", and I must agree. Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is fresh, unique, and honestly refreshing. Steering away from the traditional romantic comedies, the relationship between Bob and Charlotte is so instantaneous you seem to forget important things about them. You forget that they are both married. You forget the differences in their ages. The only thing that does seem to be important is the fact that the two of them find great companionship while lost in translation.  <br /> <br />Pamela Elam <br />Life University <br />Marietta, GA <br />
0316172324|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have read in some time.  The book centers on the concept of how fast we really do make judgments, called \\"thin slicing\\", and how deeper analysis can sometimes provide less information than more.  It is all about cognitive speed.<br /><br />The concept of \\"thin slicing\\" is dissected and explained.  What I found fascinating, and also common sense, is that we process information on a subconscious level, \\"behind the door\\", and process so holistically that to over analyze can actually hinder our ability to make decisions.<br /><br />Several key points are applicable in business.  One of the in depth studies looked at a military leader who was particularly successful.  One of his more poignant observations was that a great leader needs to let the people do their work.  When deciding how often to follow up \\"you are diverting them, now they are looking upward instead of downward.  You are preventing them from resolving the situation\\". (Page 118)  Further \\"allowing people to operate without having to explain themselves constantly ... enables rapid cognition\\" (Page 119).  It seems that most micro-management actually prevents people from successful decision making.<br /><br />Another strange phenomenon occurs when we try and explain how we come to some conclusions.  It seems that the more we try to analyze how we come to some conclusions the less reliable they become.<br /><br />The ability to absorb and detect minute changes in facial expressions allows us to essentially \\"read minds\\" if we pay attention.  There are several chapters on how reliable we can be in predicting behavior with very little information.<br /><br />Overall, this book is so well written that I had a hard time putting it down.  My only compliant, and it is a minor one, is that the book just ends.  No summary or wrap up, just \\"boom\\", it's over.  However, that is more a testament to how engaging the book is I suppose.  Highly recommended!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is so beautiful, it is beyond words.  Yes, there is graphic violence.  I don't think you could tell the story of Jesus's crucifixion without it.  And I think it makes it all the more real for the viewer.  We can almost taste the pain that Jesus suffered for us.  It really brought home to me just how much Jesus sacrificed himself for us.  No other story of his life has done it for me.  This one did.   <br /> <br />Beyond the story itself, this movie was beautifully filmed and directed.  If you pause the movie at any time, the picture you are left with looks like some of the greatest art and imagery I have ever seen. <br /> <br />The acting is perfect. <br /> <br />The editing, I thought had some problems. <br /> <br />Overall, a must-see movie whether you are a believer in the divinity of Jesus or not.
B000067J1H|4.0|Ok for all you who didn't like this movie.  I completly understand why.  Its the kind of movie that plays with your head and makes you think and makes you feel.  The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite get it.  I liked it, but I didn't get it.  The second time I began to see the subtle intericusies and ironic twists about the movie that I missed the first time around. <br /> <br />I've seen this move about a dozen times, (every time it comes on tv.)  its a clever movie that has reached cult level status and it deserves it to.  But be warned.  THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE.  Its violent.  Its antagonistic.  And it is down right political in an anarchist sort of way. <br /> <br />But if you give it half a chance and watch carefully, you will watch a good movie that makes you think about where America is heading.
1400032717|5.0|I start to read this and it feels like a gimmick at first. Can Haddon keep this up? Then I truly become immersed in a reality that is so different from my own. I started to forget that this was a novel, I really felt I was privy to this young man's journal and his examination of a mystery that led him to revelations that he was ill-prepared for. Having had some experience working with autistic children, I was prepared for the typical tics and public perceptions, but Haddon stunned me with how well he was able to create Christopher's inner life. The mathematical interludes, the inability to perceive the meaning behind facial expressions, or even the numbering of chapters using primes are all brilliantly expressed. This book works on so many different levels that it should be a must read for...well, just about anyone.
B000067J1H|1.0|The movie has a pretty standard \\"man alienated from work and materialism\\" theme.  Then graft onto a good deal of violence, followed by a weird psychodrama where the main character is really a projected other person, tougher and more charismatic.   <br /> <br />Young men seem to like this movie, but it is both banal and ugly in its violence.
B00003CXA4|1.0|Before i begin i must profess that i am from Pakistan. The low rating of this review is not based on that fact. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Gandhi; he was a very noble man indeed and did not allow the question of ethnicity or ideology hinder his preachings. In this movie \\"Gandhi\\"; Mr. Jinnah has been incorrectly protrayed as an irresponsible; shabbily attired confused leader. Hardly the characteristic of a leader who created a nation without firing a bullet. It is a well documented fact that Mr. Jinnah was an impressionable speaker and immaculate in his attire. In his dealings Mr. Jinnah is known to be very noble and just.  <br />Richard Attenborough does immense injustice to this fact and in doing so does a great dis-service in setting an unbiased and impartial portryal of characters of the time. It is to this fact and this fact alone i give this DVD a low score.
044024157X|4.0|I thought that this was one on Grisham's most creative novels.  an interisting thing about the book is that there are two distinct yet intertwined storylines.  One is the relation of the narrator and protagonist Willie with the older, \\"festivly plump\\" black woman Miss. Callie Ruffin.  The other prominent storyline is that of the murder/rapist Danny Padgitt, given that the title of the book is \\"The Last Juror\\" you would expect it to be more about the trial and the jury, however the bulk of the book is about the relationship that Miss. Callie and Willie share.  Not as suspensfull as some of his earlier works yet just as easily able to make you fall in love with one charcter and absolutly despise another.  One of his most engrosing books.
B00004RFFS|5.0|...REALLY surprised me. I didn't think they could pull it off...<br /><br />But that aside, this was one awesome movie! It sheds a wonderfully unique light on vampires (there are no main mortal characters, btw), and the main characters struggle with the morality of killing and his ever fleeting humanity. Specifically on the movie, special effects, music, sets, costuming- all fine, and it wasn't a bad adaption of the book either.<br /><br />This may seem annoying or trivial, but I feel I have to retribute to two flaming reviews this movie was given. 1)If you have any idea what a German accent sounds like, you'll realize that none of the characters speak like that, and 2)Interview with the Vampire isn't really a \\"horror\\" film or a normal vampire flick, it's about the vampires themselves, and how they live caught between humainty and blood lust. Okay, I had to get that out.
B0006399FS|5.0|There's nothing wrong with disliking U2... but you can't say that they \\"suck.\\" U2 is one of the greatest bands ever.  And their new album is more reason to give them this title.  During the song \\"Sometimes you Can't Make it on Your Own\\" Bono sings about his father that recently passed away in 2001... Bono sings \\"You're the reason why I sing... You're the reason why the Opera's in me!\\" By his voice, you can tell he's still in pain for his loss.  Also, the song \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" has a \\"streets have no name-ish\\" feel to it mixed perfectly with a piano and The Edge's killer minimizing guitar.  The song \\"Original of the Species\\" is beautiful.  Bono screams \\"I want the lot of what you got... and I want nothign that you're not... Everywhere you go you shout it!  You don't have to be shy about it!\\" And, as always, the songs pace picks up faster and faster as it goes on.  U2 can STILL make music.  And the fact that they are nominated for several grammys is proof of that.
B00005AQGH|5.0|Thug living to the death \\"Against All Odds\\"  has been 2pac's image throughout his career and Makaveli is nothing short of a classic.  Vindictive as most of this album is, 2pac flows with feelings of life or death situations.  He compare all that he's seen in a street life with Bible scriptures that no one man can answer his questions only in an after life.  There is brighter side on this album with \\"Hold Ya Head\\".  'Pac and Outlawz have a dedication to the ladies on \\"Just Like Daddy\\".  Even with the explict lyrics you can understand the point and feel that he has a heart hidden in his masculinity.  Titles like \\"Krazy\\" and \\"White Man'z World\\" he plants his position on family and being an African American male in America as said \\"...you don't have to be in jail to be serving time...\\"  If you don't listen to the lyics on here from a perspective unbiased you'll miss the message like \\"Me And My Girlfriend\\" where he's actually speaking about his trust in his guns.  Combat and retaliation is Pac's strength battling other emcees/rappers and calling them out.  To the bloody end I send a 21 gun salute.  R.I.P. 2pac.
0553296981|5.0|Ok, to start with: I cannot believe the ignorant jerk who reviewed this book just a few days ago. If you think it's boring: ok.... but don't undermine what happened to her!!! This is a fantastic book about a young woman's strong will to live. Just two weeks after Anne died in Bergen-Belsen, the Jews were set free. It's such a shame that she didn't make it. I love this book.
B00003CXBH|4.0|Set in Paraguay in 1750, a Jesuit mission faces extinction for political reasons in Europe. Robert De Niro is a slave trader who one day kills his brother when he finds him in the arms of his fiance. He becomes guilt ridden, goes to the local monastery, and wishes to do penance. A missionary (Jeremy Irons) invites De Niro to return with him to his mission deep in the jungle; his penance is toting a heavy sack of material things behind him. Climbing up a huge waterfall he almost dies lugging this junk, but he refuses to let go. Finally, the Indians, whom he hates and vice-versa, cut the sack free, and he is overwhelmed by a feeling of forgiveness. He wants to join the Jesuits, and is reminded he will have to take a vow of obedience. From here on we can see what's coming, and what was once a powerful movie becomes more routine. Portuguese troops come to close the mission, and the Jesuits are ordered to leave by their superior. Of course, De Niro refuses and decides to fight it out to his death. (Irons disobeys orders, too, but sits and prays with the natives and does not fight.) The movie is visually stunning and mostly entertaining, although the ending is cliche ridden.
B0006L5RXS|5.0|With a style that mixed lightweight, teenybopper music with heavy metal (a strange mix, indeed), Sweet ultimately ended up falling between the two, not pleasing anybody from either camp. Before that, they scored a string of UK hits including a number one (Blockbuster) and five number twos (Co-co, Hell raiser, Ballroom blitz, Teenage rampage, Fox on the run). Note that Fox on the run is an original song, not a cover of Manfred Mann's song. Little Willy and Wig-wam-bam both made number four in the UK. Their last major hit, Love is like oxygen, made the top ten in Britain and America - it actually did slightly better in America than Britain.<br /><br />All seventeen of the Sweet's UK hits (including the minor hits) are here together with three album tracks that illustrate what Sweet wanted to do with their music. Having had their career controlled others (the production team of Chinn and Chapman), they cut loose on titles such as Restless and Set me free.<br /><br />This is the definitive Sweet hits compilation. If you enjoy British glam-rock of the early seventies with a hard edge, you are likely to enjoy Sweet's music.
B000002HEP|4.0|Review no. 69. 'Welcome To Sky Valley' is the band's third effort. Heard somewhere this disc had the guys taking extra time to perfect the making of this record. It shows. End result is an lp worth of ass-kicking stoner metal. Only thing that bugs me about this CD is the fact the first three tracks have three (3) tunes tracked together. I guess Kyuss doesn't want the listener(s) to skip around from song to song. Killer tunes include \\"Gardenia\\", \\"Space Cadet\\", \\"Demon Cleaner\\", \\"Odyssey\\" and \\"Lick Doo\\". Good pick of music here. Line-up: Josh Homme - guitar, John Garcia - guitar & vocals, Nick Oliver - bass and Brant Bjork - drums. Should appeal to fans of Fu Manchu, Monster Magnet, Sons Of Otis, Fireball Ministry and Sleep.
0345409671|5.0|I personally loved this book.  This book and Queen of the Damned are my favorites out the the vampire chronicles.  I thought it was a different and exciting version on the \\"God vs. the devil\\" story.
0375758992|4.0|Like a magician or a general leading troops to war, Alexanra Fuller directs your attention away from the real struggle by focusing on minutiae. She writes pages on the smells and feel of Rhodesia and the fighting, but in reality, her story is deeper. This is a book about Fuller's personal war with her sister.  <br /> <br />The Fuller girls' impoverished childhoods had nothing to do with lack of money, but with a lack of parental devotion. How could an alcholic, depressed mother be a parent? And the father is in his own fog, looking smart in a suit, but aloof and neglectful, choosing his own independence over the real needs of his children. This is a story about neglect. Of children. Of servants. Of the people they live next door to. And in a larger sense, it is about our own neglect of the people we share the planet with.   <br /> <br />But ultimately, Fuller's story is about sibling rivalry, as tellingly revealed by the magician/author in the end, in a crazy letter (the only one) by her Mum, 13 December 2000, and these two sentences about the author's prettier sister: <br /> <br />\\"Poor Van going mad with depression and pain and waiting (for the baby to come). The've moved into Dunc and Nicollet Hawkesworth's house (closer to the clinic)....\\" <br /> <br />The key here is that the author deliberately threw in as a coda that her gorgeous, tyrannical older sister is now carrying the same evil descriptive as the crazy Villain/Mum of the story: \\"Depression\\". That word. The most important word in the story. The word that shows that the prettier sister has succumbed, lost. And full circle has been achieved with the author as victor and chronicler. <br /> <br />There is nothing wrong with sibling rivalry, if acknowledged and worked on. We are to heed the warning in Goya's paintings --it's not a war until a brother (sister) fights a brother (sister). And the same is true in Fuller's family. She suffered a tough childhood and (almost) escaped. Let's hope that she's honest enough to see what the war was really about. Best of luck to her. I look forward to reading more about her journey to escape her neglectful past.
B00068IOWC|4.0|I've only been a fan of U2 since about 1992.  I had to learn all about everything I could about them in order to enjoy their concert in June of 1993 in Munich, Germany.  Needless to say, it took me awhile to accept Achtung Baby, and for the longest time, I wouldn't even listen to Zooropa.   By the time Pop emerged, (and in my opinion is easily their most underrated album), I had accepted Achtung Baby which in now probably my favorite, and I loved Pop Immediately. <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb to me is the sequel to All You Can't Leave Behind.  AYCLB to me was U2's mid-life crisis, and HTDAAB is their post mid-life crisis.  I think it is probably their best engineered album, period. <br /> <br />Edge's guitars are The Edge.  He is the best at what he does, he is the ultimate Rhythm Guitarist.  What stands out here is Adam's bass.  First time I heard Vertigo, it wasn't the metal-sounding manic pace which caught me, it was Adam's rolling bass which really carried the hook. <br /> <br />Fast forward to City of Blining Lights, which I disagree with an earlier reviewer who just kind blew it off.  I think this will be a concert favrorite.  There's alot of momentum in this song and as each verse takes higher, and higher being led by Adams soaring bass (contradiction I know, listen to the song), then let's you down easy \\"In the city of blinding lights\\".   <br /> <br />Yes, there are several spiritual references to God (last song is title Yahweh).  Apparently, some can't accept this, but this really is who they are.  Personally, my favorite song is Original of the Species.  That's a joyous, embracing song.  I can see the hands clapping overhead when this song goes live.  I think this song if it is ever released as single has an excellent shot at song of the year also.   <br /> <br />One note on One Step Closer.  Great song, first time I heard the album, this was my favorite.  It made me weep.  Then I learned when Bono's dad was dying, he was speaking with NoelGallagher of Oasis, and he was wondering whether or not his dad understood where he was headed.  Noel Gallagher responded \\"he's one step closer\\". <br /> <br />This is a top 5 U2 album.  Lyrically, it's not as strong as Pop, or even ATYCLB.  Musically, it might just be their best, and when you combine the two, it's a great listen.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|This cd just isn't up to Daft Punks usual standerds.  It seem like this is just all the songs that weren't good enough to go on their last album. While there are two good tracks(Technologic, which is almost exactly like Harder, Stronger, Faster, and Human After All, it's just not worth paying for.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Haley Mills does a MARVELOUS job in playing the twins:  Susan and Sharon!  This is an all-time Classic!  And Maureen O'Hara shows her true talents as their mother!  Funny, romantic, this movie has it all!
B000268QB2|5.0|There are only a few debut recordings made where every song could be a single. Keane's Hopes & Fears is one of those. The best songs are Somewhere Only We Know, We Might As Well Be Strangers, Everybody's Changing and Bedshaped.     While Tom Chaplin's voice is powerful and soulful, Tim Rice-Oxley is the real star here. With only a piano, he manages to keep the songs crisp and interesting. Who needs a guitarist?    Even the b-sides combine to make another great CD. Songs like Snowed Under, To The End Of The Earth and Closer Now are all excellent songs and could have been a-sides.     [DW]
0440237688|4.0|In The Giver there is a boy named Jonas. He is eleven year old boy that lives in a world which is made perfect in everyway, no hunger, no pain, on war and no danger. When he turns 12 he is given the most respected job of them all, the Giver. This job consists of holding all of the memories of the people. Through many stages of his training he becomes more mature and relizes what the world is all about....happyness and love. Soon he has to make many vital desicions which change the course of his life. <br /> <br />I recomend this book so anyone that is looking for a suspensfully, a sit at the edge kinda story that will stun you more that anything realistically now. I hope you understand this novel and really get to love it. Some times we take things for granite and dont realize it. This book points out what life would be like with having nothing, no emotions and no feelings toward anything. <br /> <br /> <br />by: spencer hockey <br /> <br /> <br />
0571202284|5.0|As I said in the title, from beginners to pros, there's something new for everyone to learn in here. <br /> <br />None of this stuff is `elitist' or only applicable to specific cases, it's all rock-solid animation basics which every animator needs to know. Whether you're into traditional 2d, stop-frame or digital content, you need this book. <br /> <br />Richard Williams has toured the world teaching animation to packed theatres and lecture halls, and his own hand-written notes form the core of this book. None of this is cribbed from other sources, so you can be sure that what he says - he means, and has found useful himself. <br /> <br />I read this through in one sitting, over a few hours - and got all fired up to pick up my pencil and hit the lightbox. This is seen as an animator's `bible' along with the works of Preston Blair and Disney's `illusion of Life'.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I rented this movie on PPV late one night during a bout with insomnia. I figured it would put me right to sleep. I admit, after seeing the promos for the film during it's theatrical release, it looked to be just another run of the mill vanity project for  <br />Gere and Lopez.  Never judge a movie by it's lame trailer. This is a wonderful, wildly entertaining film. Jennifer Lopez is a revelation. With her slimmed down dancers body and her restrained performance as the elegant, melancholy dance instructor Paulina, she is stunning. Richard Gere is totally believable as a man going through a mid-life crisis. Watching him do the cha cha was worth the price of the rental. This guy is sex walking. The supporting cast is superb. I really liked Richard Jenkins as the flirtatious private eye and Anita Gillette as Miss Mitzi. The choreography is exciting and sexy as hell and the soundtrack will keep your feet a tappin long after the movie ends. Highly recommended.  <br />
0060926317|1.0|A vile and vacuous collection of predigested inanities for vacant readers. <br /> <br />Buying this drivel will fatten the bank account of one Marlo Morgan to the detriment of the people she has nominally scrawled this rubbish about.  <br /> <br />Imagine a cute book which describes wandering around the desert with a Jewish tribe, feasting on succulent pork ribs and lobsters with them. Imagine this book denigrated much of the deeply held convictions of that culture. This is what Mutant Message does. <br />The sad thing is that this clueless woman has no idea just how insulting her book really is. <br /> <br />The parts of this book not simply made up with the help of a whiskey bottle are a few factual nuggets seemingly culled from the odd tourist guide and stitched together rather badly to form the abortion known as Mutant Message Down Under. <br /> <br />Should you be stuck out in the desert with bad diahorrea and no toilet paper, I can heartily recommend this book. <br /> <br />For credulous Americans and the like who actually believe the Crocodile Hunter is real.
068485743X|5.0|In advertising parlance the 10-Second Rule is immutable:  You must grab the reader's attention up front, very quickly. In the First Five Pages Lukeman properly extends this mode, time-wise, to a novel-length product.  #####  But, sadly, how often have you seen this modus operadi overdone, carried to ridiculous extremes?  Far too often I have cracked open a novel where, right away, I am asked to believe a half-dozen impossible things before breakfast.  I am expected to follow the flight path of a transexual Albino who is running in a zig-zag pattern to dodge both a load of crushed rock being dropped on him from a crane at a construction site while somebody is similtaneously shooting at him with an AK-47 from a low-flying helicopter.  I say let a few pages lapse before his flight takes him, safely, to a low-rent neighborhood where a deranged, heavily-tatooed dwarf comes running at him wielding a crow bar aimed at his legs.  #####  When in doubt, I feel, it's always best to follow Commandment VI of the Plot Development Ten Commandments:  Thou Shalt Not Distort. #####  Lukeman's chain of thinking seems to hit the proper balance:  Excite early, but pace, with taste.  Along with all the other pearls of wisdom on how to get an editor to do a double-take of your work, I  found this book priceless.
B00006RU5B|2.0|This is a band smaller than their name! I was sceptic about this album, only have heard \\"Cochise\\", before, which I thought sounded cool, so I was dumb and bought the album. I don't understand why these guys made a record like this, because: It's VERY similar to Soundgarden (and not only cause Cornell sings), but only worse! SG was OK, but in Audioslave Cornell doesn't have anything new to offer, and he isn't even at his same level as before, he's worse! R.A.T.M.- players Morello, Commerford, Wilk are all just decent, having a more Soundgarden + classic type style, than Rage had, only giving a little bit of those weird guitarsounds on some songs (which don't even sound good), so that we are reminded that these guys were in 'Rage'. The tracks are very similar one to the next, and from 14 songs there's only like a few standouts 'Cochise' 'Like a Stone' (probably the only really good track) & 'Show Me How To Live', but the rest is fillers! And, man I'm telling you, this album is VERY POORLY MIXED!!! You get very fast bored with this, if you even like it for a while! Soundgarden was boring, in my opinion, but I admit they still rocked in their own way, and RATM was very good, but this mixture...damn, so unuseful! <br />a hint to Audioslave: If you aren't gonna refresh yourselves, atleast try to get better at what you do! Worth to give a try though, of course they're always better than some Good Charlotte or other pop sh*t, but that ain't too hard to be.
0142004413|3.0|I found this book to be very confusing and I had to re-read the pages about 3 times until I understood it. My teacher MADE me read it so it took a while to finish because I kept re-reading it over and over. Maybe when I get older I will enjoy it more, but for now it is REALLY confusing.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I can't believe anyone rated this concert lower than 5 stars. It is a live concert with great music and so much more. Cher does about 12 complete costume changes. There are wonderful good quality flashbacks to her performing with Sonny. There are excellent flashbacks to her best movies. The stage is filled with exciting non-stop dancing of Cher and her team. The audience is so alive - it is amazing.<br /><br />Live Concert (Memorial 358/9)
0790729350|4.0|I've had this DVD for quite a while now and I love it the only <br />problem I have right now with it is during Jefferson Airplane's <br />\\"Uncle Sam Blues\\" they Skip A whole guitar Solo I also have the woodstock boxset and it has the complete solo, why they would cut it out i don't know, and also we don't need two joan baez songs instead put in another Santana song, other than that I have no Complain, I also think that Canned Heat's \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" is one of the best performances on here even better than some of Hendrix's Songs.
B00009W0WM|5.0|One thing I always hated with certain people is that they label films \\"undeniable classics\\" and if you so much as question the film or say it's bad, you're automatically verbally assaulted by people saying how wrong you are and why they're classics. Casablanca I've found that there's lots of people who love the film and will defend it if need be, which is great because it'd be funny if someone wanted to defend let's say, From Justin to Kelly. <br /> <br />Rick Blaine owns a bar in a town called Casablanca in the 1940's.  He doesn't really talk to people or share drinks and he barely pays attention to his girlfriend.  Casablanca is under French Vishy control and there's Nazis crawling all over. 2 couriers are killed and papers signed by Charles de Gaulle are stolen. In these papers, whoever signs their name is allowed safe passage out of Casablanca so naturally everyone wants them. <br /> <br />All is fine until Victor Laszlo and his wife Ilsa Lund have stopped in the bar. Victor is a kind of a hero fighting the Nazis. His wife however knows Rick personally. They were once lovers in Paris before German troops came in and they split up, leaving him heartbroken on the train platform. So naturally he's upset, like he says: \\"of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the places of the world she had to walk into mine\\". And so we're dealing with 2 characters who are conflicted and have to deal with their past and also who gets the papers, which Rick actually controls. <br /> <br />A film I think becomes a classic when it almost seems to transcend it's medium, where it's quoted or referenced. Infamous lines in cinema like \\"hasta la vista baby\\", \\"here's looking at you kid\\", \\"we all get a little mad sometimes\\" and music themes like Jaws and Star Wars almost become part of pop culture. Casablanca has quite a few of these with the here's looking at you kid, of all the gin joints..., beautiful friendship and play it again Sam becoming well known quotes in cinema history. <br/> <br />Not to mention it's a good film too. There's not a lot of actors/actresses who can tell you so much just by a look. There's a scene where Rick finds out that Ilsa is in his bar. You don't know their history yet just their looks tell you all you need to know. There's some missteps however. There's a scene where Paul Henreid(Laszlo) has a conversation with Rick(Bogart) near the end. Bogart has a long look and almost like assessing this guy and figuring him out. But Henreid just stares blankly almost like he's remembering the lines in his head and it's throughout the film too, he's almost wooden in a way. <br /> <br />But, if you ever feel the need to just watch a good film, can't go wrong with this one.
6304711891|1.0|Buena Vista has released this \\"widescreen\\" DVD of The Rock, but the \\"widescreen\\" is FAKE! I owned the full screen VHS version of The Rock, and then I bought this \\"widescreen\\" DVD. But while watching the DVD, something looked suspicious so I compared the \\"widescreen\\" DVD and the fullscreen VHS side by side on my DVD/VCR combo player. What I noticed was the framing for the DVD and the VHS was exactly the same, except the black bars on the top and the bottom of the \\"widescreen\\" DVD covered up footage that could be seen on the upper and lower portions of the screen in the fullscreen VHS version. So a caution to people who want to buy this DVD: DO NOT BUY IT. More and more of these scams are arising, especially with MGM releases of movies on DVDs.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This was the film that almost never was. Orson Welles, an accomplished radio personality was given a really extraordinary deal by RKO Studios. Basically he had complete control over his projects, final say on the final cut, whatever actors he wanted and could write, star and direct this film. However, it was too closely related to the life of a newspaper tycoon that he wanted it destroyed. And how's this for irony: the \\"greatest film ever made\\" was actually booed whenever one of it's 9 Oscar nominations were announced on stage. <br /> <br />The movie starts out famously with Charles Foster Kane, an old man clutching a snow globe and muttering \\"Rosebud\\" before dying. A news reporter wants to find out what was so special about this word, could mean anything, could mean nothing. So we find a man named Thompson visiting people who knew Kane and see if he can unravel the mystery. <br /> <br />While it may not look like since it's been near 60 years since the film came out, there was a lot of new camera techniques and lighting on the film. One it introduced was deep focus photography, where everything in front of the camera and everything way in the background were in focus, which was new since it was usually one's clear, one isn't.  <br /> <br />Also with the help of deep focus, certain scenes suggest something without saying it. There's a shot where Kane is signing away control to his fortune so he doesn't by everything in sight and in the room behind is what looks like a standard sized room with a standard sized mirror. However he walks closer to the mirror and you find out it's a big damn mirror with the top of it being close to 20 feet above his head. Another scene is in regards to a massive fireplace same concept. <br /> <br />There's the infamous political rally where he just basically had a painting, punched some holes and moved lights around to simulate movement. When Kane meets his 2nd wife his face is fully lit, but when things start to go little sour, he's backlit(meaning his face is in shadow). There's many more of these(for example in the opening scene there's one window that is always in the same place every single frame despite we're getting closer to the mansion. <br /> <br />All this talk of the technological feats and not a word about the film itself. To be honest, it's a good film. It's not \\"holy $%#@ that's the best film eva!\\" but it's not horrible. You watch it and it's not a moving film, it's just really well done. <br /> <br />Also, check out the Ebert commentary. Say what you want about his tastes but he does know film. He's like an encyclopedia almost bringing details that you'd think \\"why would he know that? and how?\\" He also gets into the technical shots and how they were done which is quite different for a critic. <br /> <br />Anyway you look at it, it is a quite well-made film, it's just it may not be everyone's cup of tea but there's a lot of people who seem to like this cup. <br /> <br />P.S: The tycoon is William Randolph Hearst and for proof that this may be based on his life: Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies, had a nickname for her umm, sexual body part between her legs....\\"rosebud\\".
B000056K04|5.0|The Lillywhite Sessions are a collection of songs performed by the Dave Matthews Band in 1999 and 2000 and produced by Steve Lillywhite. Lillywhite had produced past Dave Matthews Band albums, so he was no stranger to the group. Rumor has it that during the production of \\"Sessions\\", the whole band was not \\"in the groove\\". The songs were not turning out the way the band wanted them, so the album was shelved, and the band began its 2000 summer tour. After touring, Dave Matthews flew out to Los Angeles to work with Glen Ballard on the shelved \\"Sessions\\". However, during the time they spent together, Matthews and Ballard wrote an entire album of new songs, which was released as Everyday. <br /> <br />In March 2001, a fan of the band received a CD containing the lost Lillywhite Sessions. The fan encoded the songs into the MP3 format and posted them to Napster. After the controversial release of Everyday, which many fans complain is too \\"pop-ish\\", the leak of the Sessions gave the fans what they wanted: The Dave Matthews Band they had come to know and love. <br /> <br />In 2003 the Dave Matthews Band released Busted Stuff, which contained re-recordings of many of the songs that were left collecting dust with Sessions. <br /> <br />Track listing <br />\\"Busted Stuff\\"  <br />\\"Grey Street\\"  <br />\\"Digging a Ditch\\"  <br />\\"Sweet Up and Down\\"  <br />\\"JTR\\"  <br />\\"Big Eyed Fish\\"  <br />\\"Grace Is Gone\\"  <br />\\"Captain\\"  <br />\\"Bartender\\"  <br />\\"Monkey Man\\"  <br />\\"Kit Kat Jam\\"  <br />\\"Raven\\" <br />

B00000583F|5.0|For all the Black Sabbath fans who loved Master Of Reality, this is for you. All the songs are groove-heavy stoner jams with some brilliant riffs. Dragonaut sounds like Sabbath circa 1971. Get this now if you love old-school doom.
B000002HRE|4.0|Oh well, First I wanna say that Reload is much better than Load, whatever you can think about it. The songs are not what they've done best, but it still a nice cd, when you get tired of all of the previous ones (I can listen kill 'em all up to black album often in a week, so sometimes I get tired)<BR>Ratings:<BR>Fuel: 9.5/10 (Really nice song but.. the lyrics..??)<BR>The memory remains: 9.5/10 (Great but WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ANNOYING VOICE??

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|What an album!! Beautifully unique lyrics, fantastically catchy and totally original. Alex Kapranos and Nick McCarthy are the new and improved Paul McCartney And John Lennon!!! Their voices, playing and lyrics are so amazing, and so full of real passion and emotion. The song are brillianly descriptive and with each listen, provide new deeper meanings. Take Me Out and Matinee are untarnishable classics but the choice of other fantastic songs goes on - Auf Achse, Darts Of Pleasure and Come On Home are my personal favourites. So personal and passionate, the astounding talent of this band is untouchable. <br /> <br />JACQUELINE :  <br />Slow, soft beginning which brilliantly rips into one of the album's catchest songs. <br />The classic bass breaking the calm silence from Alex's voice is memorable. <br /> <br />TELL HER TONIGHT : <br />Once again, fantastic opening and undeniable catchy tune. Vocals are a little high-pitched, but its still a rocking tune!! <br /> <br />TAKE ME OUT : <br />Can there ever be a more fantastic or original song??!! The pounding beginning changing to the most incredible theme ever - destined to go down in music history!! <br /> <br />DARK OF THE MATINEE :  <br />A close call when decided if this or Take Me Out is FF best song....The wonderfully catchy chorus rolls off the tongue and Alex and Nick are as brilliant as ever. PS check out the video - classic!!! <br /> <br />AUF ACHSE : <br />Beautiful beautiful song. Starts with Nick on the keys playing a gorgeous melancholy tune, then the rest join in gently. Some of FF most emotional lyrics, it will melt the most cold of hearts..... <br /> <br />CHEATING ON YOU : <br />Again, totally catchy, with a fast-paced rocking beat. A revenge song with a difference!!! <br /> <br />THIS FIRE :  <br />Smouldering and burning, this song is classic FF, Hypnotic lyrics give way to a pounding, vibrant song that burns right into you....crack out the water hydrants.... <br /> <br />DARTS OF PLEASURE : <br />Howsexy can a song be?? Sultry, passionate lyrics captivate the senses completely as Alex pulls you under his spell......unresistably forbidden <br /> <br />MICHEAL : <br />Catchy beyond belief, this song is another smouldering temption. Two guys getting it on - odd subject but based on a seen event, the boys weave their naughty lyrics into a burning tune.... <br /> <br />COME ON HOME :  <br />Bittersweet and beautiful, this is one of the best songs. Nick is on the keys again and together with Alex has once again managed to create a brilliant brilliant song......unmissable!!! <br /> <br />40' :  <br />Fantastically cold beginning, the emptiness echoing in this tune resounds inside. Contains the most aesthically beautifully lyrics ever.....just listen!!! <br /> <br />So to sumarize it, an incredible incredible album. It just gets better every time you hear it!!!! :)
B000002H2H|5.0|Well, I have no words to say how I like this album..! I can't stop listening to it, it makes me feel so good! All the songs have really deep lyrics and James' voice has improved a lot! I think that it's not a surprise, but Fade to black was, still, and will always be my favorite song ever. I can listen to it all day on repeat lol :) Although, the lyrics are touching me so much that sometimes it makes me cry like a baby! Anyway, here are my rates:<BR>Fight fire with fire: 9.9/10 (Nice intro!)<BR>Ride the lightning: 10/10 (Great lyrics that fit entirely with the music)<BR>For whom the bell tolls: 11/10 (Sooo nice this song!! I'm in ecstasy when I hear the bells tolling at the begining)<BR>Fade to black: Oh my god, I don't have any rate for that song because it would be too high! *Death greets me warm*<BR>Trapped under ice: 9.9/10 (We can really imagine that we're trapped under ice)<BR>Escape: 9.9/10 (I love the lyrics, they're like an exit for some people)<BR>Creeping death: 11/10 (Wooooww that song litteraly kicks ass! I could have died the first time I listened to it)<BR>The call of Ktulu: 9.5/10 (Nice instrumental but it is a bit long... I rather like Pulling teeth, don't ask me why)
0671027387|2.0|This novel just isn't that good. Brown tends to reuse ideas in his books, and some of them are his own! In this one, the female character's mother was killed in a car accident and she doesn't really talk to her father due to things he has done. In the DaVinci code, the female character's family is killed in a car accident and she doesn't talk to her uncle due to things he's done! Sounds familiar, eh? Anyway, it gets long and drawn out towards the end, which is not necessary. This should have been cut down at least 100 to 150 pages. We all can guess the ending, Tolland and Rachel end up together, Corky survives, the mixed up envelopes are full of the incriminating nude photos, not the data on the Meteorite. Not too hard to figure out. Brown makes it too easy to guess the outcome of his books (including Da Vinci code.) Does it annoy anyone else that he ends many chapters with a \\"He was not prepared for what he saw next\\"  or \\"He never would have guessed in a million years what would happen next\\" cliche? If you want a real mystery pick up an Agatha Christie novel, not this junk.
B000002H6C|5.0|This alubum is undescriptible!!!!!! Kirk Hammett's solos make me speechless, Hetfield's voice is at his best, Newsted is taking nicely his place (R.I.P Cliff) and Lars is wild as a lion! loll<BR>It would have been so great that fade to black and sanitarium would have been on this album .. it would have been heum.. GIGANTIC, but anyway, it still soo great! Here are my rates ! <br />Blackened: 9.9/10 (Great choice for track °1)<BR>...And justice for all: 11/10 (That song has been my favorite song for about half of a year, I wasn't able to pass a day without listening to it, the lyrics are just too powerful..)<BR>Eye of the beholder: 9.9/10 (Nice song)<BR>One: 15/10 (Listen to the beginning of the song with the sound up and up and up and you'll understand why I put 15.. The rest of the song still really great, especially when the beat becomes faster *Darkness!*)<BR>The shortest straw: 8/10 (I don't like that song.. Maybe was it written for Cliff but I think that it wasn't a nice choice.. The lyrics are weird and the music doesn't fit with them..)<BR>Harvester of sorrow: 10/10 (Really great song)<BR>Frayed ends of sanity: 10/10 (Listen carefully to the lyrics)<BR>To live is to die: 11/10 (Why? This song just kick ass 9:48 minutes without being bored, only Metallica knows how to do)<BR>Dyers eve: 10.5/10 (Heaaaaavyy song ! Well, being Lars during this song, I could have died 15 times! The drums are so tight!)
B00064MW6K|4.0|To hear some people talk, you'd think this movie was a cross between Ed Wood and Rudy Ray Moore in the field of Bad Cinema. Actually, I found it full of redeeming qualities and quite entertaining. <br /> <br />The story has been discussed, but I actually felt a sense of empathy in the idea of Halle Berry (who I met in Charleston when she was filming \\"Queen\\" and later in Columbia during \\"The Program\\") as the overtly insecure Patience finding herself and reaching her true potential as a human being as Cat Woman very appealing. I like the idea of my neices (and hopefully one day my daughters) seeing this \\"girl power\\" message to identify with. A lot of people could relate to the idea of being very shy and withdrawn and longing for the ability to break free from such emotional confines. How can you not cheer at Halle Berry standing up to her evil boss and the wild partygoers who disturb her sleep? <br /> <br />The biz about the cat \\"Midnight\\" breathing life to her after her murder and the interlocking of ancient cat mythology is a nice bit of added hokum that makes it entertaining. It's clear that this movie is not taking itself too seriously, a point a lot of people seem to miss.  <br /> <br />The actress who plays Halle's boy-crazy buddy who encourages her to take a walk on the wild side is a nice added bit of comic relief. <br /> <br />Plus, you could actually enjoy this movie as a family. The action and fight scenes (I will admit that the constant angle shifts are a bit much) are not of the stomach-turning guts hanging out gross-out variety, there is hardly any cursing, and the sensuality is handled in a classy-not-trashy fashion. <br /> <br />Overall, while it's not a great film, it's a good one. To me, Halle Berry has redeemed herself in my mind from the trashy \\"Monster's Ball\\" and the stomach-turning \\"Bulworth.\\" You go, girl!
B000002NFM|4.0|I've liked The Prodigy a little bit for a while but never really had any of their CD's. Today, when I went to my local Record Exchange I was able to pick up \\"Fat of the Land\\" for $2.50! What a steal! Sure it's a little scratched, but that doesn't really affect the playback. Breathe, Firestarter, Smack My Bitch Up, and Mindfields are great songs. Narayan is alright too.  Climbatize is a beautiful melodic masterpiece. From the moment I heard the distorted, mellow, wavery chords mixed up with some well timed percussion, I knew this song would be a blissful experience unlike any other. I highly recommend this CD if you're into techno or electronica or even dark music. It's one of the great albums of the 90's! Some of the songs on this album were recently featured in The Matrix and Charlie's Angels. If you enjoyed either of those movies you ought to like The Prodigy's music.  If you've ever seen their music videos or seen them in concert, then you how crazy they can be!  Keith Flint is hilarious to watch move around in the \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Firestarter\\" videos.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen them live but I'd love to sometime.  I know Keith Flint and Maxim Reality have departed from the group, but Liam Howlett and Leeroy Thornhill are the ones who hold this group together.  I'd like to hear some of their other stuff as it is quite interesting to listen to.  I heard there's a lot of unique talent on the new album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned, like Juliette Lewis, actress and lead singer of her band, the Licks. Prodigy Rocks!
0425188809|5.0|Watchers is definetely Koontz's most popular and well-loved novel, but I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical at first.  Koontz had never let me down before, but how exciting could it was about a genius dog?  Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but they are typically not very thrilling to read about.       I was wrong.     Travis Cornell is a miserable, lonely man.  He lives the life of a loner, and he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.  Nora Devon is a shy, woman who has lived a sheltered, lonely life and wears drab unflattering dresses and never does her hair, because as her mother has always told her, she'll never be anything but plain and homely anyway.  Her only passion in life is her painting.      Meanwhile, two animals have escaped from a company called Banodyne.  One, a golden retriever named Einstein, was created over several years of altering genetics, creating a dog with the IQ of an average man for the purpose of using as a spy for the government. The other, a monstrous creature known as The Outsider that is determined to destroy the dog for reasons which the reader eventually learns.     Travis finds Einstein and adopts him.  He also, with the help of Einstein, saves the life of a stranger, Nora, from a sexual predator who has been stalking her relentlessly.  The two eventually fall in love and learn to find ways to communicate with Einstein.  He eventually learns to \\"speak\\" by arranging Scrabble tiles to form words and sentences.  They even teach him to read and rig him up a device that turns the pages for him.  Even though he is remarkably intelligent, he is still very much a dog.     After Nora and Travis learn of The Outsider and his murderous trek across California, coming ever closer to their home, they must protect themselves and Einstein from not only this mysterious, deadly creature, but from the people in high places that are determined to capture Einstein and take him back to the lab.     You really become intrigued and attactched to the characters in Watchers, even the ones that you see very little of.  Nora's transformation from a frightened, sheltered mouse of a woman into a brave, strong, confident woman is amazing, as is Einstein's learning progress.  The dog himself is utterly delightful and you'll long to have a dog just like him.  Even The Outsider is someone to feel for when you learn more about him and why he's after Einstein.  And his final scene made me shed a few tears onto the book.  What a sympathetic villian he was.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Phantom of the Opera is definitely the best movie i have seen in my entire life. i am not a fan of musicals, but POTO captivated me and now i am a fanatic. i have read the book and the movie is definitly better. many have said that Gerard Butler's voice is too deep for the part of the phantom. but i ask, have you every found a man with high pitched voice to be sexy? a deep voice is the essence of appealing. a man with a deep voice is more coaxing and sensual than a man that sounds like a girl. i am not putting down any other actors that have played the Phantom because i have not heard them and i'm sure they played the role with talent. but a man that is supposed to captivate a woman sensually should have a voice that coaxes. Gerard Butler was amazing! me and my friend love \\"the look\\" he makes in the tunnel scene when the phantom is taking Christine down to his lair for the first time. Gerard Butler did an amazing job and truly made the phantom come to life.
B0001CNRS4|2.0|The cheesy HONEY has all the cliches right.  Attractive bargurrrl with stars in her eyes gets discovered by a sleazy mentor who tries to blacklist her when she won't \\"get with his program\\".  But the girl reaches inside herself, finds her \\"inner spunk\\", and shows everyone, including that evil Snidely Whiplash mentor that she has what it takes to make it after all.  Add a hip-hop soundtrack featuring a few \\"I'm gonna live my dream and you ain't gonna stop me\\" songs, and the ususal \\"street\\" choreography, and you've got a movie that can be seen back-to-back with BREAKIN 2:  ELECTRIC BOOGALOO.
B000069CWE|5.0|If you are a Linkin Park fan and have not yet heard this album....WHY????  This CD is nothing short of awesome.  That being said, you WILL have to listen to it all the way through about 3 times before you begin to really appreciate the artistic license that has been taken on the great songs from the Hybrid Theory album.  The absolute BEST song on the entire album is track 19, 1stp Klosr (One Step Closer).  Along with the musical and lyrical changes we also get the added benefit of vocals by KoRn's Jonathan Davis.  Jonathan and Chester's voices playing off one another is just AWESOME!!!!!  It's worth the price of the album for this one song alone!  Go out and buy this one today!
B000002LN9|5.0|Solid and powerful music. The live recording quality is A+. A reminder that EC still has it. Make it part of your collection.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I was so affected by this film I cried for several hours afterwards. Like Schindlers list, this does not put you off but instead places it in the top ten list of great films about reality, life and the society that we have created and live in. <br /> <br />To think that children where pulled away from their parents and driven miles away to very strict schooling and no freedom, is just barbaric. But these three girls walk home. And this is the story about their courage and how they followed the guidance of their ancestors to achieve this. The great female and aboringial wisdom broke all distance and you are left wandering whether we have corrupted all similar tribes and whether the loss of our instinctial tribal ways is one of the biggest costs of a western society. <br /> <br />The cinematography resonates with the rawness of the film and you feel as if you are walking with them. <br /> <br />To then meet, at the end of the film, two of the children that are now grown up women is such a wonderful ending and such a poignant moment but is done in such a casual way.   <br /> <br />To all those that have now lost their homes all around the world, you realise what a tragedy that really is. My heart goes out to them. <br /> <br />Watch this film, it is really beautiful. <br />Mrs Engen
B000683VI4|5.0|If you are a romantic and enjoy love stories, this movie and book are perfect for you! I loved them both. The movie stayed pretty true to the original book which is sometimes rare in book to movie remakes. The acting is wonderful and after it was over, it made me appreciate my husband even more as the movie helps you remember how special true love really is.
B0001WTWCO|3.0|If you have this much time and want a beautiful desert, you would do better to watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want a great love story set in World War II - at least Casablanca or many others. <br /> <br />Overall not bad, and Kristin Scott Thomas very lovely, but the reviewer from Queens, Andrew Macewen, got it right with his reference to the narcissism of the two ill fated lovers and the damage they spread around. <br /> <br />Steer clear. <br /> <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|To put 30 songs on one album is very ambitious, but somehow they pulled it of, and how...    There are three iffy tunes to be truthful, both versions of Honey Pie, and Revolution 9.    The rest though is brilliant Pop, and certainly makes this the greatest double album ever!!!!    What I think makes this their best album though is the range of styles, to classic Beatles Pop, The continuing story of Bungulow Bill, Birthday, Everybody's got something to hide and Revolution. To blues, Yer Blue. Even rock, While my Guitar Gently Wheeps, and Helter Skelter. It even has sentimental moments, I'm so Tired, and Julia (a song by Paul MCartney dedicated to his mother) There's even a tribute to The Beach Boys, Back in the USSR.    A brilliant album that deserves every single piece of hype it gets. If you only buy one Beatles album...this should be it, you won't be dissapointed, trust me.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|We all remember the song, \\"Around the World\\". A simple repetition of those 3 words in a robotic voice brings to mind the infectious techno track released by Daft Punk ages ago. It was just one of many great tracks off of \\"Homework\\", their debut release in 1997. Four years after that album, they released \\"Discovery\\", which contained more incredible techno anthems, including \\"One more time\\" and \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\". Well, it's been four years since \\"Discovery\\" and Daft Punk is back with \\"Human After All\\", an album that they supposedly created in a mere six weeks. Is it worth the wait? <br /> <br />Well, the answer just depends on what you're looking for. With this album, Daft Punk reverts to a more simple way of creating songs. A lot of the beats used do not bring anything new to the table, which is a change from their highly original \\"Discovery\\". Their sound is less bouncy and instead, feels grittier. Even with the change, it's still hard to sit motionless during the addictive loops. With a more minimalist approach, Daft Punk still creates an enjoyable ride. <br /> <br />\\"Human After All\\" starts off the album and is one of the best tracks on the album. Its melody can get stuck in your head for days.  \\"Technologic\\", one of the only tracks with vocals, is another highlight and is the definition of an infectious dance track (it's been playing on my stereo for the last 20 minutes). The lead single, \\"Robot Rock\\", roars in with loud guitar riffs and pretty much sums up the feel of the album. Although the majority of the album grows on you, there are still a few moments that are forgettable, and on a CD with only 10 tracks, this can be a major drawback for some people. <br />  <br />When a group tries a more simple approach to making a techno album, it's hard to not seem repetitive. This is one of the main drawbacks to the album. At times, it seems extremely cyclic, and during songs that don't really catch your ear, this can get annoying fast. \\"Discovery\\" wasloved because of its fresh and unique qualities, so this album is sure to disappoint some of their fans. But with each listen, the album seems to have more to offer. They make up for the repetitive nature with tracks that even with simple guitar loops can evoke emotion and immerse you in an atmosphere that you won't want to let go.
0385510454|3.0|A montage of a fast lane american broker becoming acclimated with the Italian culture and taking time to learn about the finer things in life. The author's descriptions were masterful and the intrigue was passable, but I was left unsatisfied at the end. The story kept building to a grand creciendo that never came about.  <br />At least the book was short enough that I didn't feel like I wasted a monumental amount of time. Exciting, entertaining, informative and smart at times, but overall a disappointing result.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This film is by no means phenomenal, as many have said...rather, it is your typical three-star film.....two A-list actors (Cruise-compared to jean reno's performance as a hitman, cruise's performance was weak; and jamie foxx-a better performance than cruise's...foxx proves himself to be quite a versatile actor in this film..), unique plot-hitman hires cab to drive him around to make his hits...decent action, laughs, acting, etc., and a somewhat thought-provoking ending...it's creative and exciting cheap thrills make Collateral worth seeing, but it doesn't go down as one of my favorites
0312995423|3.0|This book doesnot reach the standard of the other books by Dan Brown but for his first attempt it is forgivable.There are certain flaws in the plot and some pages are written just to increase the length of the book.The cryptographic information is fine but there are many drab moments in the plot.The ending will interest many as beat the clock scenario unfolds.If you are looking for characterization look elsewhere.It is a book written for chase scene lovers and thrill seekers there is plenty of action and pages keep turning.All this happens in a haphazrd manner.The storyline is not controlled and some twists are predictable.It is not dissapointing but doesn't reach the standard of \\"da vinci code\\" or the two other books by Dan Brown.
6305313687|5.0|now this is my type of film...a serious, debated topic in history (in this movie it is the ugliness surrounding white suppremacists/neo-nazis) is taken and made into a film...but not a film of history and dull facts...instead, a beautiful story is depicted throughout the film, as a once extremely racist young man (edward norton) transforms into an understanding, caring indiviual after spending time in prison...meanwhile, his brother (edward furlong) has welcomed his brother's racist outlook...thus provokes a struggle between the two, and esentially their family and friends.....great acting by both men...stayed historically accurate; not at all overwhelming on facts, etc.  check this one out
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I think the title 'Greatest Hits' is very appropriate. Twenty-one tracks is very satisfying to the customer, and not a single hit is missing. The new songs are worthy to be released... as I'm sure they will become hits, too.
B000001GAO|5.0|Few single works in Western music have ever aroused such discussion as Mozart's epic \\"Requiem\\" mass, a piece he was working on when he died less than two months short of his thirty-sixth birthday.  The work remained incomplete, and Mozart's fellow composers Franz Beyer and Franz Xavier Sussmayr, at the insistence of his wife Costanze, made efforts to complete it.  This has given rise to whether this is REALLY Mozart's Requiem, and his alone.    When listening to any recordings of the work, however, it is best to leave the speculating of the work's authenticity to others and just allow the power of the piece to wash over oneself.  That's what is achieved in this live 1988 recording made by conductor Leonard Bernstein, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and a distinguished group of vocal soloists--Marie McLaughlin; Maria Ewing, Jerry Hadley, and Cornelius Hauptmann.    Bernstein was often savagely criticized in his later years for his increasingly slow tempos and often over-emotional conducting style.  But how can one NOT get caught up in the emotion of works like the Mozart \\"Requiem\\"?  That kind of emotionalism is what is required for anyone, no matter how big a name, who conducts the piece.  And Bernstein is never overly emotional here, just grabbing this work for the powerful performance it deserves to get.  The performance itself may be deemed a bit slow at close to 59 minutes, but there have been slower ones even before this (Karl Bohm's 1971 Vienna Philharmonic recording runs to 64 minutes).  The vocal soloists are first-rate, as is the Bavarian Radio Symphony and Chorus under Bernstein's direction.    Mozart's \\"Requiem\\" is unquestionably one of the greatest single choral works since Handel's \\"Messiah\\", and it deserves to be heard, especially when it is through such a stunning, mercurial recording as this one.
B00000JPH6|1.0|absolutley disgusting. Go ahead and tell me that I have no insight into pure genius if you may, but I failed to see the success within the bad production of this film.
B000002I53|4.0|Compared to the other Coltrane recordings I have, this one seems to fall short of the mark.  While the title cut is adventurous, has some impassioned sax playing, and has a beautiful rhythmic flow, it seems that McCoy Tyner (who, incidentally, is one of my favorites) spends his entire solo section trying to figure out what to play, killing time by plinking some octaves, or vamping while waiting for Coltrane to come back in, which doesn't happen for too long a time. Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye is a beautiful first-rate rendition of a standard ballad, and Summertime and But Not For Me are very enjoyable uptempo pieces.  Try as I might, I still feel like I'm waiting for something to happen when listening to the title cut.  Maybe I'll get it a few months down the road.
B00003W8NM|1.0|An immeasurably bad movie. The apparent audience for this film is the same group of pre-teen boys toward which Carl's Jr focuses their burger ads. If you think this movie is good, find an adult and have them explain to you why this is complete and utter bovine excrement.    I've had the misfortune to see much of this movie twice and it just gets worse. Bad writing, bad acting, lack of substance and a complete dissasociation from reality make this a stinker for the ages.    My theory is that Brad Pitt didn't want Seven to be known as his worst movie so he did Fight Club.
B000003N8R|5.0|The music on this CD is dynamite.  It ranks second only to A Love Supreme, and is far superior to My Favorite Things.  The title cut and Lonnie's Lament are the standouts on this great CD.  Coltrane's and Tyner's melodic ideas flow as naturally as a river on its way to become one with the ocean. It is this natural flow of ideas that is the standout quality of this wonderful collection of compositions.  If tears don't come to your eyes during Lonnie's Lament, you ain't never gonna get it!
B00080Z53O|5.0|I'll watch anything with Javier Bardem.  Check him out as Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's \\"Before Night Falls,\\" or as gangland boss Felix in the recent Michael Mann thriller \\"Collateral\\" (the confrontation between Jamie Foxx and Bardem is the movie's best scene (in a film with many of them).<br /><br />Here in Alejandro Amen&aacute;bar's \\"Mar Adentro\\" (Sea Inside), he ages 30 years to play quadraplegic rights activist Ram&oacute;n Sampedro.  That DVD cover image of a hale and hearty Bardem glancing over his left shoulder?  That's about 1/50th of this movie (at most).  Bardem spends much of the movie behind an excellent make-up job as a very convincing 50-ish, bed-ridden individual who must convey every meaning with just a slight nuance of facial expression.  It's quite a feat.<br /><br />Amen&aacute;bar's script brings out the dignity in Sampedro.  No surprise given his work in penning 'The Others' and 'Open Your Eyes' (which Cameron Crowe later bollixed up as 'Vanilla Sky').  'Sea Inside' richly deserves its 2004 Academy Award for best foreign film.  Don't miss it.
B000001GPX|5.0|As a teen my first classical LP was Beethoven Symphonies Five and Seven performed by Chicago under the batton of Fritz Reiner.  With the absence of that recording on CD I have searched for something comparably moving and powerful.  I found it here.  Agreeing with the multitude before me, this must be among the finest recordings of Beethoven's Fifth extent.  Bernstein (NYPO), Ormandy (Philly), Solti (Chicago) and Karajan (Berlin) have all recorded the Fifth, but this must be considered the benchmark for all future interpretations.  Here is subtelty... absent Karajan.  Here is purity... absent Berstein.  Here is pacing... irregular in Solti.  Here is the beauty of quieter moments... allusive to Szell.<br /><br />The Seventh -- often an \\"orphan\\" to the more well known 3rd, 5th and 9th -- is delightful, and the performance pulls the listener into a center seat.  While this rendition of the \\"Dance Symphony\\" is perhaps not as noteworthy as others (e.g., Reiner, Walter), the performace, too, is exceptional and, coupled with the Fifth, makes for a bargain package.
B00003CXWV|3.0|What I liked about 'Blow' was the intersection of protagonist George Jung's life with kingpins like Pablo Escobar.  These events help put into perspective the dangerous game that Jung was playing.  The introduction of Escobar into the tale (and what an intro) is meant to show the Johnny Depp's character has crossed a threshold from lifetyle choice into serious nacrotrafficking.<br /><br />What's strange about 'Blow' is some of the casting choices.  The late Ted Demme obviously liked to go against the grain.  I can respect that.  The Johnny Depp of 2000 was known for his risky role-taking, so having him carry the lead isn't a problem (and, as a native Bostonian, I think he put on a fairly credible Massachusetts accent...certainly light-years better than Laura Linney's savage botch job in 'Mystic River'). And, Jordi Moll&agrave; is outstanding as he is everything he does.<br /><br />But Kiwi Cliff Curtis (of subsequent 'Whale Rider' fame) as Escobar?  Maori...Antioquian...what's the difference.  What an odd choice.<br /><br />Likewise, getting me to buy off on Ray Liotta as Depp's father (eight years in age difference between the two) was a stretch.  Liotta looked 45 throughout the film (his age at the time), regardless of the amount he spent in the make-up trailer.<br /><br />And, 'Blow' was another in a string of movies from that period (along with 'Woman on Top,' 'All the Pretty Horses' and 'Vanilla Sky') designed in part to force-feed Penelope Cruz down the throats of the American public and make her a bankable Hollywood star.  And, that was not - nor is it ever - happening.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I was a little sceptical about this album considering the last three albums Marillion released. Not being a fan of 'Radiation', 'Marillion.com' and 'Anoraknophobia, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Reading through the fan club newsletter the band said the new album would be darker than the previous albums.  Knowing Marillion's track record, dark usually meant 'great'.  Thank goodness this was the case.   <br />From the opening notes of 'Invisible Man' to the commerically available songs 'Don't Hurt Yourself' and 'You're Gone', this album meets and surpasses all preconceived ideas.   <br />As they said in the 'Brave' liner notes, listen to this album in the dark with the music LOUD!  Those that still can't see Steve Hogarth as the lead singer of the band, you should have seen him sing Marbles live this summer, unbelievable.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|It would seem that having great special effects was enough.  The story line was boring and silly, not worthy of great talent that was in the movie.  The actors must have done it for the money.  I'm sorry I bought the DVD, even thou it was used...
B0007OY2MG|5.0|The third season of this amazing television show made me a Gilmore Girls addict. The relationship between Rory and Loralei isn't typical but the relationship between Loralei and Emily is! <br />     I love how this series makes me feel. I look so forward to watching it and slipping off into Stars Hollow. You never get tired of watching the episodes. The lovable characters, witty banter, and surroundings, all make Gilmore Girls a great family show. It is very smart. You have to be well tuned-in to the world of pop-culture to appreciate the dialogue, but even if you aren't, you will love the laughs and the tears it provokes.  <br />     Owning the series on DVD has been a treat. When I am feeling like I need a pick-me-up I just put a DVD in the player and watch the girls do their thing. You never get tired of watching the people of Stars Hollow.
B000058983|5.0|A true gem, an emotional kaleidoscope of beautiful sound.  This is one of those cds that honestly deserves to be considered \\"a classic that has been overlooked\\".  It is classic... and it was overlooked!  I am happy that this cd is finally getting its due credit and I feel fortunate that I came across it and gave it a try.  My life is richer because of it; honeslty.      I highly recommend that you read the other reviews offered on this site, people have done a wonderful job explaining and detailing the quality of this album.  I am just here to tell you to give it a try, to believe the reviewers.  You don't have to be a lover of sixties music to enjoy this.  Although this album does a great job of incorporating many sounds of its time, it is highly original and progressive... and ultimately timeless. It is rich lyrically and musically.    Right off the bat, the cd explodes with beautiful textures and when the horn section busts in you realize that this music is different than anything you have heard before, but somehow familiar.  What follows is an emotional roller coaster of songs that swoop to beautiful lows and ascend to atmospheric, colorful highs.  This is an expression of life itself, of love itself - and few cds have done a better job of expressing the human experience.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|I would have to say this album is not as good as Discovery, but it is still a very good album.  The sounds Daft Punk creates are still in my mind so vastly different then what anyone is doing. Tracks like Human After All and Robot Rock just infectious.
B0007P3582|1.0|Its a shame that every real musician that makes good music, doesn't make a lot of money, when this loser who has absolutly no talent, makes millions because all these idiots will buy his crap, and they will wear his clothing, and steal stuff and try to be cool. It just sickens me that real good taught guitar players and drummers dont get any respect and losers like 50 cent do. Rap is not music its just talentless noise, anyone can rap. Just listen to me, ok cause if anyone says it takes talent to rap, is a total moron, or they are in special ed. Rap sucks!!! Go and listen to something that is actually music, losers, if you like rap, you are just an idiot. and these rappers get these Grammys and stuff, for what??? Acting like a punk, and getting wasted and getting women? Why hasn't Shadows Fall gotten a Grammy yet? They are real musicians, they can actually play instruments. Rap just sickens me, its the dumbest thing on earth, and it sickens me that people actually listen to it. RAP IS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    \\"Music is melody\\" so if rap has no melody, which it doesn't, that means its not music.
B00004YYDI|4.0|I agree with another reviewer, that the shorter <br />version, is better. That's why I gave it 4 stars. <br />Alot of the footage in this uncut version, was <br />a bit boring. I found it to be a bit strange that, <br />whenever Matilda said she loved Leon, and that she <br />wanted to have sex with him, NOT ONCE did he say, <br />you're only 12 years old! If Leon survived at the <br />end, they probably would have gotten married and <br />had kids! There was only a 45 year age difference!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russel Crowe was made for this movie! <br />The acting all around was great. The <br />story was just as good. The sound on <br />this disc, will make you happy too! <br />You won't want to miss this one!
0385510454|1.0|How disappointing...I wasted almost 30 dollars on this book when I could have waited for NO PLACE LIKE HOME by Mary Higgins Clark. Now she's an author that never lets you down, but now, on April 5, I won't be able to buy it. This book should be banned this December from New York Times bestsellers, and if it becomes a #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER...I'll sue Doubleday. Of course, his books started declining ever since the RUNAWAY JURY which was suspenseful enough, but with The Partner...it fell down to the floor. He could do better than that, and he proved it infinitely with THE CLIENT and THE FIRM. Tomorrow, 3-22, I will buy NIGHTTIME IS MY TIME in paperback, and even if I already read it, I will enjoy rereading it. John Grisham has disappointed me, and if this website had any decency, they will give the option of giving 0Stars as an option...and it would go to The Broker. By the way, I loved the picture on THE PELICAN BRIEF (HARDCOVER) where he looks so young...I love his hair and his mouth, his face...(dreaming of 1992...when he wrote that book)...he had me dizzy, and I couldn't finish the book because I would instinctively look at the back of the book to see his hot spiked hair...his nice face...John Grisham used to be very handsome, I won't deny it...and neither can you. Just take a trip to the public library, look for THE PELICAN BRIEF in harcover, and then enjoy his face. You'll see what I mean. Anyway, this book was overall...less than enjoyable, but I nevertheless enjoyed the tips of Italy. I hope we can go to Italy one day together...
B000002O4X|4.0|John Barry won an Oscar for this score and it still holds up as a classic.  Each selection is moving and heartfelt.  Barry is at his best here, by pulling emotions out and just barely keeping under the radar of over-whelming emotional sweeps.  There is only one drawback to this soundtrack and that is that it is only a little over (33) thirty-three minutes long.  That's a tragedy.  You might consider buying the Royal Scottish National Orchestra's recording.  I found it to be nearly identical and it certainly does justice to Barry's work.
0312995423|1.0|I loved The Da Vinci Code and was not thrilled with any of his other books.  But my biggest complaint about this one was the incorrect explanation of a bianary code.  Since I am a dork, I attempted to work the code using the explanation provided in the book.  Couldn't get it to work, so then I had my fiancee (who went to MIT and is MUCH better at math then I am) look at it.  Turns out Mr. Brown apparently can't do math correctly, and neither can his editors.  Sorry but at that point I put the book down in disgust.  Plus, the story was awful.

For those of you who are not familiar with this 'cropping' device, it essentially cuts out pieces of the frame in order for it to fit on a television screen, effectively changing what the director had intended for the audience to see.

B000002H48|4.0|I suppose just about anyone could find a reason to give a listen to the 'No Nukes' recordings.  For many, some of the earliest and most blistering live tracks from Bruce Springsteen, still on his career ascent, which are offered here are reason enough to own these discs, even if he shares CD space with Chaka Khan.  Others may find their appeal in the workmanlike presence of Graham Nash, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, and The Doobie Brothers, who perform solo and are all over the place singing duets and background for other performers willing to ante-up in the fight against fission.  Despite my own appreciation for Crosby, Stills and Nash, what really caught my eye here was what amounts to a cameo appearance by Gil Scott-Heron, offering up one of his finest moments (and as a Detroiter one I can readily identify with) on the ominous yet funkified 'We Almost Lost Detroit'.  Next to 'Johannasburg' this is my favorite Gil Scott-Heron composition.  Unfortunately, it appears on a wonderful, but unreleased CD Scott-Heron produced in 1977 with Brian Jackson, 'Bridges'.  It tells a slightly overblown tale about a malfunction at one of the two Fermi nuclear plants near Detroit.  While the mishap could have theoretically progressed into a full-blown meltdown, the generator was quickly shut down and catastrophe was readily averted.  So while it didn't come close to producing a Chernobyl, it did produce one funky protest song, and Scott-Heron gives it an inspired treatment on 'No Nukes'  <br /> <br />1979 was a strange, transitional year in music.  Disco was all but dead, yet it's brief success had ushered in a retreat from the expansive progressive rock that had enshrined the late 1960's and early 1970's.  Something new had to be on the horizon, even with Bruce Springsteen assuming the role of heir apparent to those who would proclaim (along with Neil Young) that \\"rock and roll will never die\\".  No one could have predicted, however, that even for Neil Young, the 1980's would plunge rock and roll even deeper into an abyss of ill-employed synthesizers, and open the door for a reborn Michael Jackson and the birth of a Madonna as the dominant forces on vinyl and cassette. <br /> <br />So 'No Nukes' offers one last gasp for the faithful few from the golden age of rock and roll who had somehow weathered the disco storm.  Virtually all of the performers are in their prime, and some, such as Nicolete Larson, Raydio, Tom Petty, and even Bonnie Raitt, are able to truck in some pretty recent hit material.  The Doobie Brothers, who open and close the set presented here, are in top form as well.  The Crosby, Stills and Nash tracks sound a bit dated, even though they are preceded by Springsteen's covers of four songs that pre-date anything CSN offer up.  There is more crowd noise on the softer tracks than one would wish (why would anyone even want to unleash a two-fingered whistle in the middle of a song like 'You Don't Have To Cry' anyway?).  But the boys do serve up an edgy 'Long Time Gone', whose lyrics settle well with the MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) theme.  Some of the tracks, such as CSN's closer, 'Teach Your Children', and Jesse Colin Young's Youngblood's classic 'Get Together' are marred by the dreaded audience sing-a-long... a nice one-time experience for the audience, but torture for the owner of the recording who must listen to a mass of amateurs singing like a tone-deaf choir over and over and over... <br /> <br />While everyone can find something to like on 'No Nukes', it's also likely that it's wide range of artists and genre's will guarantee there is something you won't like.  While most of the tracks were either hits (consider James Taylor and Carly Simon belting out a live version of 'Mockingbird') or the main attraction on studio LP's (Jackson Browne's 'Before the Deluge'), some out-of-the-mainstream material also appears, such as John Hall's 'Plutonium Is Forever', which lends a sarcastic twist of the knife into the nuclearpower industry's back.  Predictably some tracks that look good on paper come across uninspired, such as the James Taylor-Carly Simon-Graham Nash take on Dylan's 'The Times They Are A-Changin' and Ry Cooder's 'Little Sister', which you keep waiting to take off but just keeps circling the tarmac. <br /> <br />The liner notes are extensive, but oriented toward an indoctrination for the 'No Nukes' agenda rather than commentary and anecdotes surrounding these Madison Garden concerts.  If this was all the information you had, you would undoubtedly conclude Jimmy Carter was a fool for not installing a line of windmills along the Continental Divide, and a massive array of solar panels covering the southwestern U.S.  Oh, well, at least it gave some of these soon-to-be-out-of-work artists one last excuse to fuse their talents before they turned out the lights on the 70's (pun intended).  Four stars 'cause Stephen plays some wicked guitar, but I may be straining my credibility.

B00000IFWE|2.0|There are cds in my collection that I wasn't impressed with from the get-go.  Sometimes months (or years) later I'll give them another try and I'll be pleasantly surprised that they are better than I had thought originally.  This is not one of those.  Let me also say that I'm a big Petty fan and it's hard to call him down on any of his albums but in this case I must.  Other than the opening song there's just no dynamics to speak of and the songs just run into each other without distinction.  In the course of a band's career there are bound to be lulls and, unfortunately, this one qualifies for that title.  But Tom and his gang weren't gone just yet.  They rebounded well with the powerful and controversial \\"Last DJ\\" that showed them to still be the true rock and roll rebels they are.
B000067J1Y|5.0|As in all Jim Abrahams movies, HOT SHOTS milks the movie pool for jokes of all kinds...from TOP GUN to GONE WITH THE WIND; SUPERMAN to DANCES WITH WOLVES; THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS to ROCKY.  It all works; it's zany, unsaturated hilarity all the way.  Charlie Sheen stars as a rogue pilot whose father's tainted past has haunted him as well; Valeria Golino is hilarious in the scenes where her navel and stomach set new standards for erroneous zoning; Cary Elwes is properly smug as the handsome but not too bright hero; Lloyd Bridges is absolutely wonderful as the klutzy, remade admiral.  Usual good guy Efrem Zimbalist Jr. even shows up as the bad guy in this one.  There are the patented sight gags, particularly the ones going on in the background that make this movie one you could watch over and over and still not see them all.  It joins THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE movies in the honor roll of zany spoofs.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|With a cast like Dustin Hoffman, Johnny Depp, Julie Christie, Radah Mitchell, and the amazing Kate Winslet, what other meaning could typical possibly have than: amazing, dazzling, stupendous, etc.? This is one of those movies that actually live up to the cast's potential. The acting is simply flawless, is as the script. The setting is beautiful and charming, and the music is a perfect fit for the whimsical attitude of the film. Depp defies logic by pulling off another perfect job as Barrie; you can actually see his imagination come to life. For the first time, Peter Pan can be seen as a real-life happening, not just a bed-time story. Also, Kate gives the story the tragic touch that brings the viewer's emotions full circle. Simply put, this movie has it all: romance, tragedy, fantasy, comedy, and drama; the makings of a true classic.
0783227434|5.0|Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD trilogy concluded with this over the top comedy thriller.  In addition to having some great pre-CGI effects, the witty and delightful Bruce Campbell and some ingenious creative moments, ARMY OF DARKNESS nicely pays homage to some great classic novels and/or movies.  We get \\"Gulliver's Travels\\"; \\"The Thing with Two Heads\\"; and of course, a tribute to Ray Harryhausen's ingenious skeletons in \\"7th Voyage of Sinbad\\" and \\"Jason and the Argonauts.\\"  There is kind homage also to the Three Stooges in some of the slapstick tomfoolery that occurs.  The scene of the skeletons marching into the castle with skeleton head drums; bagpipes and trumpets is priceless.  Raimi earned his credentials on these three films, enabling him to go on to higher class films and of course the superb SPIDERMAN series.  Gorgeously filmed and lit, ARMY OF DARKNESS is a marvelous movie; the theatrical ending is much more enjoyable that the Planet of the Apes one.  Enjoy.  I did!!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|This album cracked me up. Madonna the rapper? No wonder Missy Elliott's American Idol rip-off show bombed on UPN. Madonna was on as a guest judge, and sadly that didn't get any viewers interested. The show ranked a paltry #102 out of 115 programs for that week in the nielsen ratings when Madonna guested. Looks like her star has seriously sunk.
B000001EUL|5.0|Released in 1979, this album was a breaking point from the past Scorpions sound and world fame was just around the corner.  This is the first album with Matthias Jabs and the 2nd album with Michael Schenker (he was on the Scorpions 1st album).  Matthias Jabs initially began recording this album, but was let go when Michael became avalable after leaving UFO. Matthias would return for the tour for this album (Michael left to form his own band) and would stay for permanent on the next album. The future started here and it proved to be the correct path to follow.  This is a CD that deserves its place in the music Valhalla because it gave a new sound and fresh air to the stagnant rock scene at the time.  Here are my ratings of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />\\"Loving You Sunday Morning\\" - Guitar intro followed by heavy bass and surging guitars.  Some fine solos from Jabs.  Tremendous guitar solo to end the song. This song got alot of radio play during this time period.  A fantastic hard rock song that in sound and style was way ahead of its peers at the time. A classic metal song that sets the stage for the '80s.  I love this song because it's great, and you'll think so too! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Another Piece Of Meat\\" - the fastest and hardest song on the album.  Opens at a breakneck pace and then changes tempo during the chorus into a heavy drum/cymbal combo with thumping bass. Great playing from Michael Schenker (as if that's a surprise). \\"Hey lets go, Don't put on a show.  You're just another piece, another piece of meat.\\"  That's what they all say isnt it?  Another classic metal song with great singing as usual from Klaus.  This song also got some airplay.  A fore-runner of future metal.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Always Somewhere\\" - The ballad of the album and in my opinion the best ballad ever done by the Scorps.  Klaus sings with alot of emotion and conviction. Just beautiful!  Journey never did anything better than this.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Coast To Coast\\" - An instrumental with guitar by Michael Schenker.  Heavy bass lines from Francis sets the mood and tempo.  A midtempo tune and preview of \\"Into the Arena\\" by MSG.  Rating - ***<br /><br />\\"Can't Get Enough\\" - The shortest song on the album and it leaves you wanting more!  A great metal song!  Opens fast and furious.  Fantastic guitar solo from Rudolf.  \\"Rock and Roll for Speed Kings\\"  Damn, I can't get enough either! Great wailing from Klaus.  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Is There Anybody There?\\" - Reggae makes it to Germany and the Scorpions liked it so much they paid homage to it in their own Scorpions way with this heavy reggae tinged song. Efficient guitar solo from Jabs gives it a rocking quality.  A preview for '80s sounding Scorpions.  Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Lovedrive\\" - This song also received alot of airplay and for good reason.  This song ROCKS!  Heavy bass from Francis and a galloping tempo. Again, some great guitar solos in the middle of the song.  Fine singing from Klaus.  Great ending to the song. \\"It's a Lovedrive.\\" Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Holiday\\" - Acoustic guitar opens the song and remains throughout the tune.  A tempo change in the middle helps to break the monotony and give the song some color and feeling.  Great singing from Klaus. \\"Let me take you far away.  You'd like a holiday.\\"  Damn right I would! A nice rocking song.  Rating - ****<br /><br />Damn. the Scorpions were so far ahead of the pack during the late '70s from the rest of the metal bands, especially in terms of playing metal with a pop-edge.  The only comparable band would be Van Halen during this time.  They set the stage and all the other metal bands got on and performed thier play.  This album is a gem!  No real metal or music lover can rightfully be without this CD.  It is a true classic!ntal with guitar by Michael Schenker.  Heavy bass lines from Francis sets the mood and tempo.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Strangely, I think that this is my first zombie movie, and it's one heck of a way to start.  This movie mixes horror with comedy very well, making it a solid comedic performance. <br />The story revolves around Shaun (Simon Pegg), a guy who's kind of going through the motions in life, like a zombie.  His best friend Ed (Nick Frost, who looks a lot like a fatter Weiss from Alias) is even more of a zombified slob, and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is at the end of her rope with Shaun.  Soon, however, things happen that make relationship troubles small potatoes.  The dead start to rise and try to kill the living.  One of the best things about this movie is that, for a while, no one notices!  One reason is the improbability of it all, but another one is that Shaun and Ed just think that the zombies are drunk, drugged, and tired (social commentary anyone?).  They soon figure out the truth, and the fun begins. <br />Shaun and Ed pick up Liz, some of her friends, and Shaun's mom (Penelope Winton), and head off to a local pub to hide out from the zombies. <br />The movie is, for the most part, full of laughs, although the ending does veer a little more toward the serious end of the spectrum (up until the priceless gag ending that I couldn't see coming).  However, this is British humor, so if that isn't appealing to you, avoid this movie.  But if you like zombies, cricket paddles, and flat out silliness, this movie's for you.
B000002UB3|5.0|This IS the best Beatles album, hands down.   <br /> <br />The fab four were at their best when they produced this piece of audio pop art.
B00000294R|5.0|i bought the album a couple of days ago and all i gotta say is wow. what a lyricist! ive never heard anyone rip the mic as hard as he did. im sorry Rakim but, just by a little bit, he would have stood a chance against you in a freestyle battle. just listen to the things he says. the beats are gonna be a problem for most of you but not when your listening to the lyrics. 25 year old Jay Z is featured on Da Graveyard and rips the mic as well on this album. all real hip hoppers gotta hear \\"I dont understand it\\" its a message to all the pop rappers thats were once hardcore. my only question, what rapper was going pop at the time of 1995? the only one i can think of is LL Cool J but who else really? but still a good song even 10 years later. i wish hed stick longer id really wanna hear new material from here and i wonder if he would stay harecore in 2005?
B00005JN4H|2.0|Story is just ok for a brainless comedy, but by GAWD..that Jimmy Fallon guy is no good comedy actor. He miserably fails to deliver his role to be even remotely funny. I wished they have at least use one of the wayans brothers or any other comedian from SNL. The only person that made me through the entire film was the queen herself (the 2 stars go to her only otherwise this rating of mine should be no stars at all). PRODUCERS...PLS DO NOT GIVE THE ACTOR ANYMORE ROLES...we consumers do not want to waste our money too.
B0007OASII|5.0|To begin, I just have to say that I have been a Kamelot fan since their beginnings, but have always considered Conception the superior of Khan's projects and while I have been somewhat impressed with a few of Kamelot's releases, I have never put them on the same level of melodic greatness as Conception until I heard this album.  \\"The Black Halo\\" absolutely blew me away from the very first listen and I feel that almost every song represented here blows away anything Khan ever recorded with Conception.  Believe me, this is saying a hell of a lot coming from me!  Having been more impressed with their previous release \\"Epica\\" than any of Kamelot's earlier albums, I was a bit more anxious than usual about hearing this album than I've been with any of their previous releases, especially when I started catching early reviews that were calling it their best album to date.   <br /> <br />I honestly had chills listening to the opening track, \\"March of Mephisto.\\"  It's that powerfully charged and melodic!  With the perfect merge of symphonic melody, blistering guitar hooks and some of the most melodic vocals you'll hear anywhere on the power metal scene, Kamelot have taken epic power metal to a whole new level with this song along with the equally stellar \\"Memento Mori,\\" their longest song to date, clocking in at just shy of 9 minutes.  These two songs alone are worth the price of the album and easily rank in my book as two of the best power metal epics ever recorded and that's certainly not to say that the rest of the album is filler because there is not a dud in the mix on this one.  It's almost as if the band went back and analyzed their entire career to discover the formula for every great song they've ever written and infused it into every song they wrote for this album, then one-upped them with an epic tone and some the catchiest power hooks they could muster.  Add to this some special guest musicians that include Jens Johansson of Stratovarius on keys, Shagrath from Dimmu Borgir, who adds a touch of evil to the epic sound of both \\"March of Mephisto\\" and \\"Memento Mori\\" and Simone Simmons of the band Epica adding her hauntingly (no pun intended) beautiful vocals to \\"The Haunting (Somewhere in Time),\\" easily the most radio-friendly song on the album. <br /> <br />This album will undoubtedly easily stand the test of time as Kamelot's magnum opus and I'd rank it as, far and away, the best power metal epic that's been released so far this decade!  If you are among the group that has always equated this band with \\"dungeons and dragons metal,\\" this is the album that will most likely change your mind about them and win you over.  Khan, who sounds quite a bit like Geoff Tate, has never sounded better than he does on this album, especially on the middle-eastern flared power epic that is the opening track.  Kamelot have had this distinctive flare to their sound throughout their career, but there is just something that clicks here and brings it to a new level of perfection in epic proportion.  They've also added a bit more of a progressive element to some of the songs here than we've heard on previous albums.  This is especially evident on \\"Memento Mori.\\" <br /> <br />Other album highlights include the incredibly melodic \\"When The Lights Are Down\\" and the powerful title track, but it's difficult to pick favorites as this is one of the few Kamelot albums that I found extremely listenable from start to finish. They also include some interesting short interludes between songs, one of which even has Khan singing in Italian.  The only song that tones down the epic power riffs that dominate the album is the atmospherically charged \\"Abandoned,\\" which heavily incorporates symphonic elements that perfectly complement Khan's amazingly heart-wrenching vocals on this track.  Lyrically, this album continues on the conceptual storyline started off on \\"Epica\\" of the battle between good and evil, but don't let that scare you away.  They pull it off with a melody and epic style (of near operatic proportions) that I have yet to hear any other band accomplish without starting to sound like a Disney movie soundtrack (take note, Symphony X).  I have to agree with a previous review that there is unlikely to be a better album released in 2005 (although based on some samples I've heard of the new Pagan's Mind, due in April, they may have just give Kamelot a run for their money).  This is easily the most amazing album Kamelot have released to date and they will be hard-pressed to ever top it.  \\"The Black Halo\\" is THE absolute must-have masterpiece of 2005 that will appeal to fans of epic power metal and progressive metal fans alike. <br />
B00000DOZ4|5.0|It's amazing how Led Zeppelin managed to put out one classic album after the other for so long. The bluesy \\"Led Zeppelin I\\" was very impressive. This one, while sounding very different, is as good as the 1st one. This time the band decided to play heavy and loud rock music. It's bluesy base is still present, but this incarnation of blues is very heavy, basically, one of the first prototypes for what later became heavy metal. Most of the songs here are straight out rockers, and it's only a few of times in the entire album that the band goes for some acoustic part, or a mellower sounding rock. The two men driving Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant and Jimi Page, perform flawlessly, with Page putting out some insane amount of groovy riffing, and Plant sounding as passionate and convincing as ever. <br /> <br />\\"Led Zeppelin II\\" sold several millions of copies worldwide, and for a reason. The reason being nearly perfect songwriting and performance from all the band members, and the impact that this music made on hundreds of rock bands since, Black Sabbath being the first of them. This album is often overlooked, being compared to the godly perfection of \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\". But this fact shouldn't deceive anyone. Other bands would kill to have their names written down in history as the authors of anything as classic as the second album by Led Zeppelin.
B0002KVULG|3.0|Wow. I loved this movie.  I'm a true horror buff and most people complain that this isn't a horror movie.  They are right, it is a gothic tale with some shocks!  Tell me the scene with Mina crying \\"Pa-pa....Pa-pa\\" isn't creepy.  Langella gives a marvelously subtle performance with his hypnotic eyes twitching away like a mantis.      I really enjoy this film but what the hell were they doing with this DVD transfer?  The color is so messed with it takes away from the viewing of the film.  One moment it is like you are watching a black and white film and in the next moment the skin tones are back!  The colors were subdued enough in the theatrical release and messing with them here is just annoying.  I did like the bonus featurette but I really feel the film was done an injustice with all of the color sucked out of it.  Of course, the part that could USE the color drain, the \\"wedding\\" sequence, now sticks out even worse than before.  I really find this a pity since I love the overall look of the film.  The sets and props are perfect for the era.  It has the proper English look that a Dracula film should have.  The cast is great overall but I think the film could have perhaps benefitted from a better director.  Badham doesn't fail, but he does seem to be in well over his head and his voice over commentary confirms this.  Well, until a stage version of Langella's Dracula sees the light of day (was the performance ever filmed?) this is all we have of one of the greatest Dracula performances ever.  Lugosi made the role. Langella made it his own.      All we can do is hope that another version on DVD comes out with the color (and the life) injected back into it. This edition in my opinion does the film, and the great sets and locations, a great disservice.    Oh yeah, how could I forget?  The score to this film is terrific.  Easily one of John Williams' best scores and that is saying something.  It is a very lush sounding score that is perfect for the film.  John Williams isthe best film composer ever.
B000026FOA|5.0|Five Leaves Left is considered one of the greatest folk albums of all time, and rightly so. Filled with gorgeous guitar and orchestration, it is beauty if that word could ever be applied to music. \\"Time Has Told Me,\\" \\"Way To Blue,\\" \\"Day Is Done\\" and \\"Saturday Sun\\" are several highlights on an album filled with standouts.
B00079HZUM|5.0|Whenever a period piece comes out, I rush to the theater or video store.  This movie is so emotionally fulfilling and thought provoking that I watched it several times before I took it back to the video store.   <br /> <br />With gender issues and emotional meltdowns, the feel of the movie is humorous at times and extremely serious at others.  I loved the main characters and how they developed during the movie.  This is how the main population was in eighteenth century europe.  Though it is historically inaccurate at times, it's easy to overlook these inaccuracies because of the superb acting of the main characters.   <br /> <br />This movie deserves ten stars just because it is so out of the \\"norm\\" from other historical movies.  If this was a book I would definately read it in a heartbeat.
B000268QB2|4.0|I have to admit that the first time I heard this album, I thought all of the songs sounded the same. However, after a couple more listens, I was able to differentiate them and recognize which songs were good. \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" \\"Bend and Break,\\" \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and \\"Bedshaped\\" are just a few of the many good songs on this album. For a band's first album to have this many highlights is phenomenal, and I can't wait until their songwriting progresses. Hopefully they won't let me down.
B0000797IO|4.0|All the performances in this film shine, which is what makes the film compelling. Genuinely and pleasantly surprising was Jennifer Aniston's performance as Justine, the bored wife of a burned out stoner/house painter. Justine works as a dazed discount store employee, always dreaming of bigger and better things, lamenting the things she could or should have done in her life instead of marrying Phil (John C. Reilly). She is smarter than her small-town trappings and finds herself idly dreaming and longing for something different. Enter the melancholy \\"Holden\\" (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose real name is \\"Tom\\" (but this, he says, is his slave name). He is a writer, a dreamer, and finally someone who seems to \\"get\\" Justine. Their friendship leads rather quickly to a passionate and torrid affair, which allows Justine to imagine a more exciting life. Still, though, despite the excitement, Justine is an adult with a good deal more life experience than \\"Holden\\"; much of his optimism is unmasked as being naivete; Justine recognizes that their relationship cannot go on forever, although she acknowledges conflicting feelings on the matter. Her marriage with Phil is never going to go anywhere. When Phil's best friend reveals that he knows about Justine's secret affair, he makes demands on her. In many ways, her secret affair allows her to be manipulated into unpleasant or unsavory circumstances. Unfortunately, things do unravel with tragic consequences; though Justine's life is changed, most circumstances go right on being the same (in large part because her husband is too stupid to understand anything). In essence, this film just cements Jake Gyllenhaal's reputation as a great young actor with versatility and range, and is a breakout role for Aniston, who might otherwise have been typecast as \\"Rachel\\" for the rest of her career.
0385486804|4.0|A 24 years old boy...Chris McCandless was only in his 24, when he got into the small gap between life and death. His only dream was to find the real world. He left everything behind and started going. He really went into the wild.     Doesn't it seem fantastic to read? I am sure that everybody will think on it at least for 30 seconds. It was unbelievably fantastic in first 10 or 11 chapters. It was full of action and the style was making me curious in every sentence. Everything was perfect up to the parts that our dear writer Jon Krakauer started to convert this nice book to a autobiography of himself. He started to tell us his adventures and add a lot of his feelings and ideas into the story. It wasn't objective anymore but in the introduction part Krakauer was promising to tell us the story in the most objective way that he can. I think he lied and tried to show himself as a hero. He was more successful than Chris and he was like the only one that could come back after discovering the world.        Despite these all negative points, Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild was one of the best books that I have read recently. It was like a documentary in some points and it was making you really thing like our poor boy Chris. I think it is a nice book to read with a lot of thinking and dreaming.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I went to see what all the hype was about.  I came away with a mixed impression.  It was hard to follow at times and very hard to watch the violence...but I can see how some might think it a great movie.
0790732203|5.0|I have read reviews about giving plot info and so on, but one thing that everyone seems to miss is the irony at the end. <br /> Joel has evey teenage boy's fantasy come true while his parents are away, and nothing could have been better. But because he doesn't have the money he owes Lana, she steals his mother's \\"artsy fartsy\\" glass egg. From there a string of histerical and depressing events follow, until his parents return from out of town. Joel's mother discovers a crack in the egg, and Joel is blamed and punished as he was responsible for the house while they were away. <br />  The greatest thing about the movie is how it makes you say to yourself, \\"jesus, all he had to do was listen to Miles, tell his mom the egg broke, and none of this s*** would have happened\\" I think that most people miss this point, although it's plainly obvious throughout and near the end of the film. That's what makes this movies great, along with famous scenes of Cruise dancing in his underwear, sexual acts preformed on a train, and car chasing by Guido the killer pimp.  <br />  Truly awesome feature that everyone should watch. By the way, when they have sex on the chair and the american flag is waving on the TV, unbelievable.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Every time that I speak with someone and say: \\"You have to see the 'Phantom of the Opera', it was wonderful\\"; I either hear one of three things:    1)  \\"I've heard it was horrible and not worth seeing.  All of the critics say so.\\"  (So, really, to borrow a line from many parents: 'If all the critics decided to jump off a cliff, would you?)    2)  \\"I really don't want to see it.  Michael Crawford isn't in it.\\"  (Excuse me; Gerard Butler more then makes up for the lack of Crawford.  Wow, great voice, great acting, and what a hottie!)    3)  \\"We saw it and it was the best movie we've seen in a long time.  We're going to go see it again!  Do you want to come with?\\"  (This coming from a friend who said that he hated musicals and you couldn't force him to go to one.  But apparently his girlfriend could!)    Note that I've never heard anyone say: \\"I saw it and it was horrible\\", that seems to be reserved for the critics only!    The movie is a spectacular bit of eye-candy with lavish sets, beautiful music, wonderful costumes, and wonderful acting (Well, mostly.  I'm not really a big fan of Emmy Rossum).    And best of all, you get to hear some wonderful music - for weeks and weeks and weeks.  No kidding, I left the theatre humming the music over and over until I finally broke down and bought the soundtrack, which I then made copies of and kept one in the car, one at home, and yet another at work!  It took two months to get the music out of my head!    I truly believe that this is a 'must-not-miss-seeing' movie, even if you just break down and rent it from Blockbuster.
B00079018K|5.0|I grew up in the Eighties and I have to say that I love the current musical renaissance. These guys are great! Buy this CD if you love Eighties \\"New Wave\\" or the current \\"Brit Pop\\" explosion. The production is tight and the music is stellar. If you like the samples of \\"Club Foot\\" and \\"I.D.\\" (my personal favorites) you will love rest of the album. <br /> <br />I also recommend \\"The Killers - Hot Fuss\\", \\"lcd Soundsystem - lcd Soundsystem\\" and \\"Action Action - Don't cut Your Fabric on this Year's Fashion\\" if you enjoy this CD. <br /> <br />You can rip this CD using the \\"Exact Audio Copy\\" software. As long as the \\"Fair Use\\" law exists for music, copy protection on music is ludicrous.
1567184855|5.0|When I first purchased this book, I was just not \\"open\\" enough to entertain the ideas brought forth within it.  I read 1 chapter and quickly put it away - figuring that I had just wasted my money.<br /><br />However, about 1 year later (When I had run out of reading material and was waiting for my next shipment of books), I decided to give this book one more try.  This time, I could not put it down!  The experiences described were absolutely mind blowing to me!!!<br /><br />I have since purchased several copies of this book to give to friends - who have also said that they couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This is one of those books that will leave you pondering,  asking yourself \\"could this really be what it's like on the other side?\\"...<br /><br />Overall, I think that it's a \\"must read\\" for all those people who are searching for answers, and are willing to entertain ideas that may seem to contradict what they've been taught previously.  Although it may not be appropriate for the seeker who is just starting to expand their ideas on this subject, it's definately an excellent read for those who've been researching this topic for a little while (and, again, are able to be open to new ideas).
B0000024Z7|5.0|What a window onto the world when the LP of this music came out! As rock music eltonjohn'ed down, many of us were looking for a way out of the silliness and inconsequentiality of Anglo-American pop music. Santana was an open door: their music was popular, enough so to get onto AM radio in a big way (\\"Oye como va\\" would have gotten old, if it hadn't been Santana) and yet it suggested depth and freedom of form that wasn't present in even the furthest-out \\"prog rock\\". Those of us who were guitargod crazy were of course onto Carlos Santana, and I believe that he still stands, with his best work, as the greatest lyricist of the electric guitar, outside of jazz.<br /><br />Remember that this was before the great waves of Latin migration into the United States, so this sound was quite exotic to the ears of most of America. Moreover, cultures that aim at conformity and homogeneity, as America did at that time, tend to objectify \\"the other\\", negatively or positively. Some people reacted to the Latin nature of the music with slurs, some with the idea that this was a hot-blooded, \\"get dirty\\" kind of music. This was a gross, mindless response to the first three Santana records, fine in their own right, of course, but imagine what simple heads made of this band when it recorded, and performed, this relentlessly probing, spiritual music. \\"Boring\\".<br /><br />But not for some of us. And unlike some of the stuff that came out in this period that seemed interesting to those of us who were looking for something more, this has stayed interesting. I don't think it was terrible profitable for Carlos and his colleagues, though. After the LP's \\"Welcome\\" and \\"Borboletta\\", also interesting but not of the perfection of Caravanserai, Santana came out with disappointing \\"Amigos\\", a paint-by-numbers affair that simultaneously pandered to disco fever and the the whitebread America notion of the simple Latin.<br /><br />Well, you do have to make enough money to live on ...
B00001SIES|5.0|Ok,let's break it down. First, I kinda doubted about this band (cuz I don't really like Radiohead, and everybody said this band and Radiohead are identical). But after listening to the first 2 songs of this album. It really pulled me in(even though, it was kinda like Radiohead). Almost all the songs in this album are amazing.I strongly suggest that anybody who listen to rock should not let this album slip. Fantastic and Amazing
B00009V7P8|5.0|it's virtually impossible to listen to it and not fall in love... life altering music... <br />
B000683VI4|4.0|Although \\"The Notebook,\\" a film based on Nicholas Spark's novel of the same name, tells a familiar tale of star-crossed lovers, I found the movie convincing and moving enough to use all the extra tissues I brought along with me. The acting is remarkably good - how could it be otherwise when the cast includes such luminaries as James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Joan Allen and Sam Shepard? Directed by Nick Cassavetes, from a screenplay by Jeremy Leven, the story is told through a series of flashbacks.<br /><br />In an upscale nursing home, Duke, (James Garner), an elderly retiree, with a genuine warm nature, reads aloud excerpts from a worn notebook to Allie, (Gena Rowlands), a patient suffering from Alzheimers. She doesn't know Duke, but obviously adores the sad, romantic tale so much, that she becomes more alert and focused when he reads to her. His kind, tender manner may have something to do with her responsiveness also.<br /><br />The movie, and the notebook's narrative, go back in time to the year 1940 and the small southern town of Seabrook, NC. Allie Hamilton, (the luminescent Rachel McAdams), a wealthy, headstrong city girl is vacationing at her family's summer home. She meets a local boy, Noah Calhoun, (Ryan Gosling), and the two fall in love. Noah is a sincere, down-to-earth, intelligent young man, with a tendency toward the dramatic. On one occasion he hangs on the rungs of a Ferris wheel and threatens to jump if Allie won't go out with him. The two give exuberant performances as the spontaneous teens, who are reckless in their joy of each other, and refreshingly innocent in their love. Noah seems to free Allie from the refinements and restrictions of her class. Her mother (Joan Allen) does not approve of the match. She thinks Noah is a nice boy but calls him \\"trash,\\" because he is not of their social class. Unfortunately for the youngsters, Noah is not a member of elite society - at least not elite enough for Allie's parents. And he is poor, financially, if not in spirit. The Hamilton's put the kabosh on the relationship. Surprisingly, Noah agrees with them in a sense. He understands that he will never be able to provide for Allie in the manner to which she is accustomed. Then the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. Noah enlists. A year later Allie meets a wealthy, charming Army officer (James Marsden), scion of one of Savannah, Georgia's finest families. Her parents approve of the match. After the war, Allie becomes engaged. Then she spots a news story about Noah, whom she assumed had died overseas.<br /><br />This is a gentle film, which tugs at the heart-strings. My only complaint is that the film is two scenes too long. Occasionally it is best to leave some things to the imagination. Prior to seeing \\"The Notebook,\\" I had read various reviews criticizing it for being \\"formulaic, manipulative and treacly.\\" Labeled a chick flick, I know many men who have really enjoyed it. I am glad I rarely pay attention to film critics. I will gladly fly in the face of nay sayers and recommend this entertaining, emotional tearjerker as a romantic drama well worth seeing.<br /><br />JANAf not in spirit. The Hamilton's put the kabosh on the relationship. Surprisingly, Noah agrees with them in a sense. He understands that he will never be able to provide for Allie in the manner to which she is accustomed. Then the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. Noah enlists. A year later Allie meets a wealthy, charming Army officer (James Marsden), scion of one of Savannah, Georgia's finest families. Her parents approve of the match. After the war, Allie becomes engaged. Then she spots a news story about Noah, whom she assumed had died overseas.  <br /> <br />This is a gentle film, which tugs at the heart-strings. My only complaint is that the film is two scenes too long. Occasionally it is best to leave some things to the imagination. Prior to seeing \\"The Notebook,\\" I had read various reviews criticizing it for being \\"formulaic, manipulative and treacly.\\" Labeled a chick flick, I know many men who have really enjoyed it. I am glad I rarely pay attention to film critics. I will gladly fly in the face of nay sayers and recommend this entertaining, emotional tearjerker as a romantic drama well worth seeing.  <br />JANA
B000001Y5X|5.0|what can I say? this album simply kicks ass. i like just about every last song on it. definatley pertaining largely to The Spooky Kids' sound since they were, essentially still The Spooky Kids. many of the songs such as Dope Hat and Lunchbox were from the Spooky Kid-era, in fact. The music videos for Get Your Gunn and Dope Hat are so great. Dope Hat's one of my favorite videos ever. And I can only wish there was more footege of them during that time. They were so cool then.... <br /> <br />Prelude (The Family Trip) 1000000/10 - As a friend of mine once said: \\"It's the coolest intro to an album ever made!\\" <br /> <br />Cake and Sodomy 10/10 - Absolutely fantastic kick in the face starting for an album. It's transition from Prelude being equally great. Nothing I can really say I could dislike about the song. It's even cooler that what inspired him to write the lyrics. <br /> <br />Lunchbox 10/10 - Yet another great song. I dont know what to say about it, though. It really should be heard by the individual to see for themselves. <br /> <br />Organ Grinder 9/10 - HERE IS MY REAL HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAD!!! here is my real heeeaaaaaad. <br /> <br />Cyclopse 8/10 - This song is cool. It has style and attitude. Not one of the primary standouts though. Only another face in the crowd of something very good. <br /> <br />Dope Hat 10/10 - Almost my favorite in a poppy sort of way. The song can be simply discribed as really happy and....well...it's just really nice to hear. <br /> <br />Get Your Gunn 10/10 - A dark air to it. This masterpiece was done perfectly. <br /> <br />Wrapped in Plastic 9/10 - I can't think of anything to say about this song. <br /> <br />Dogma 8.25/10 - A good songs with even more interesting lyrics. <br /> <br />Sweet Tooth 11/10 - Favorite on the album. The beginning is so damn cool..this song simply kicks ass. <br /> <br />Snake Eyes and Sissies 9.5/10 - I love the lyrics to this song. It's a very strong track to the album. If you ever bothered tolook at pictures, you can see Mr. Manson's tatoo of a devil rolling two sixes on one of his arms. <br /> <br />My Monkey 11/10 - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Misery Machine 8/10 - ? ...I don't have any idea what they had in mind with this song and making it a last track. It's good but well...it's just good. There are songs on this album that would have made a much much better closer than this one.
B00004VMUH|5.0|After purchasing 'Oceanborn' - my exposure to the Finnish quintet, Nightwish - I could not get myself to order another album of theirs for the longest time. I was so completely blown away by what I heard here I feared I'd be disappointed with anything else they had previously released. My expectations were indeed set high, and while their latest LP 'Once' is really very good it pales in comparison to the greatness found within this disc that consistently churns out hit after hit. The moment you press play your psyche will be sucked deep into their vortex of no return as the opening guitar and drum riffs on \\"Stargazers\\" invade your speakers, captivating you utterly with harsh sonic soundscapes that are elegantly brutal. The instruments pound with beautiful intensity, and female fronted singer, Tarja, has a uniquely distinct operatic vocal style you'll naught soon forget...<br /><br />The tone of the music may shift from being metal, melodic, and at times progressive, but one thing remains the same: their ability to be ethereal whilst retaining their hard rock edge. I, however, highly recommend you get your hands on a copy of this limited European tour edition if you can for it includes three bonus tracks - one of which is a gorgeous ballad \\"Sleeping Sun\\", closing on a dreamy note, making the journey from beginning to end all worthwhile.
B0007O38F8|1.0|As much as 50 cent (or eminem) try to act, live, and rap like Pac, they cannot come close.  2Pac actually rapped about the issues, and had some deep and inspirational songs aside from angry diss tracks.  50 Cent is just an unrepentant ex-drug dealer who got rich off morons who gave him their $.  He has no depth, no soul, and if he said \\"can you feel me?\\" - no, no one can.  <br /> <br />Avoid at all costs.  Grade: F- <br />
0783235380|4.0|Unlike those who would've liked Ben to end up with Sarah, I liked the ending (he was finally honest with himself about his fears, he overcame the obstacles to be with the one he loves).  But I agree the ending was sudden - his inner struggle didn't come through clearly. <br />The DVD isn't great - image isn't very high quality, and there's no commentary.  But the deleted scenes and featurette are a nice <BR>feature.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|is still good, but I think what made QOTSA so awesome in the first place was the diversity of the vocalists.  Lets face it, Josh is a great singer, but he can't sing low and gritty like Mark and definately can't scream like Nick.  The different vocals are what kept anything from sounding the same.<br /><br />Even though it is my least favorite QOTSA album, it is still great and has some amazing songs, the best being Tangled up in Plaid.
0131103628|4.0|Still the best book for getting the feel of a fundamental <br />language, one that you can build just about anything, from <br />firmware to OS to application. Used the first edition on <br />many projects, wandered away to C++ and Python, but recently <br />back to C for a project, and this helped the return to <br />modern competence in little time.
B0007DAZW8|2.0|I loved Discovery so much that I bought this album as soon as I saw it.  I brought it home, put it on while I had some friends over, and before half the cd was done, we couldn't take it anymore.  The sounds on this cd are harsh, and they are repeated over and over again.  Listening to this entire cd straight through is torture. <br /> <br />Try and listen to a sample or a single first, before you buy this album, because it's nothing like Discovery.
B0000009SG|5.0|I don't believe, as other reviewers have stated, Zappa set out to make a blatenly commercial album with Overnite Sensation. This was the inevitable direction the band had been heading since 1970 (in Zappa terms that can & does mean a 6-8 album span). The songs were still indescribable as anything but Zappa compositions, still retained the fresh originality that he brought to almost everything he touched and contained more wit (and wisdom) than most of Zappa's recordings since the early Mothers of Invention records. At this stage, Zappa could afford to hire better musicians and of course better production facilities were available which tended to give this album a glossy veneer that previous albums didn't have (although Zappa always strived for the best in both production and musicianship). Overnite Sensation is definitely a great jump off point for the uninitiated, as is Sheikyerbouti or Apostrophe, but I don't necessisarily think fans of those albums are going to like Grand Wazoo or Uncle Meat. I have friends who like the unexpurgated Zappa but could care less for his instrumental and compositional recordings and I have friends that are vice versa, and I also know people (myself included)who love and appreciate his work as a whole.  What I am trying to say in a wordy way is, commericiality, when applied to Zappa's music is in the eye of the beholder. Most fans of top 40 music are not going think this commercial at all, but Zappa fans may think it so because it has more conventional song structures and such. I tend to think of later recordings such as Joe's Garage and Tinseltown Rebellion as having more commercial potential than this. <br />To cut this short (forgive my ramblings, I am very passionate about Zappa's music), this is a great album as a starting point for those unfamiliar with Frank Zappa. If it is appealing then by all means explore further, if you like his dirty little ditties head towards Sheikyerbouti, Joe's Garage or Tinseltown Rebellion (and especially the compilation Have I Offended Someone?). If you are impressed by his musical chops, head towards Uncle Meat, Grand Wazoo or The Yellow Shark and if you like his social satire head towards Freak Out, We're Only In It For the Money and Them or Us. It's all great to me!!!!
0064407667|5.0|Imagine that you are off somewhere with your friends and/or family and you find out that someone very close to you has just passed away. You would feel hurt and sad, wouldn't you? This is how Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire felt when they found out that their parents had died while they were at Briny Beach.   <br />   In The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket (his first book in the Series of Unfortunate Events saga) the three Baudelaire children are left homeless after their parents died in a tragic fire that completely destroyed their home. They are sent to live with a distant relative that they have never even heard of. His name is Count Olaf. The parents of the three children wanted them to be raised within the city limits and he was their closest relative geographically.  <br />   When they first arrive, they notice a beautiful house. Next door, there is a run-down, rickety old house that they hope to never enter. What they find out is that the old house is where they are to stay. The owner of the beautiful home (Justice Strauss) said that the children were welcome to use her library of books whenever they want. The children are happy to have such a nice neighbor next door that they think the stay may not be as bad as they had originally thought. But what they come to think is completely wrong. Their guardian, Count Olaf, makes them do chores all day and gives them cold oatmeal for breakfast. They also find out that he is after the enormous fortune that the Baudelaire parents had left behind for their children.  <br />   I don't want to tell any more about the story or I might as well have written the book myself. You'll have to read it for yourself to find out what happens.    <br />   When I first read this book, I was shocked. I was hoping for a happy book. But just like the old saying: \\"You can't judge a book by its cover,\\" I was completely fooled. It was one of the saddest and most depressing books that I have ever read. After I was finished, I had my mother read it also. When she was done, she vowed to never again pick up one of Lemony Snicket's books. She believes that he is, for lack of a better word, \\"insane.\\" I asked her what else she thought about the book and this is how she replied: \\"Anyone that can write like that is crazy!\\" I on the other hand, think he is an excellent writer. They may not be as good as the Harry Potter series but they are some of the best books that I have ever read. <br />   I believe that the storyline is well laid out. The detail is really great. I can see myself standing next to the three children as they are being told about the tragic death of their parents. My favorite character is Klaus Baudelaire. I can see myself within him, the glasses, the vast amounts of knowledge, and a passion for books. I have read books my whole life will continue to do so until I am on my death bed.  <br />   All in all, I thought that it was a good book. But like I said before, \\"You can't judge a book its cover.\\" If you like to read happy books, this is not for you. But if you like change, go right ahead and check it out of your local library <br />
B000002WU9|5.0|This album is my all time favorite hip hop joint of all time!  Songs like 'nuckleheadz', 'verbal intercourse' and 'ice cream' set the bar and the beauty of hip hop to unparalleled hights. WARNING: THIS ALBUM IS ONLY BUILT 4 CUBAN LINX!!!
B0000065O1|4.0|The Next Challenge is Cindy's second workout video with personal trainer Radu.  Radu's role is more minimal here, as he counts out repetitions only during the warm-up; for the majority of the workout, Cindy does all of the cueing.  Unlike her first video, Shape Your Body, this video contains only a single longer workout session, making it slightly more challenging.  The workout begins with a series of warm-up stretches; although these moves are very similar to the ones Shape Your Body, the pace is a bit slower, and at 7 minutes, the entire warm-up is a little longer.  Next comes what Cindy refers to as the \\"cardiovascular\\" segment, which is described as \\"legs\\" on screen.  I found the legs section to be somewhat like interval training:  there were brief cardio bursts alternating with lower body toning moves plus frequent on-screen breaks for water/rest.  For the first two minutes of cardio, you perform a series of simple footwork:  jogging, knee lifts, heels up, jumping forward/back, etc.  You'll then do a tough series of front/back lunges followed by a break and then lunges at a faster pace, including lunges with kicks.  You'll break again, do some quick jumps, skips, and squats, break, and then move into some kickboxing-type kicks.  For the final leg segment, you'll add leg lifts to the squats, then perform some brief stretches for a total of about 17 minutes.<br /><br />Next you'll move to the floor for a 13-minute abs and chest work segment.  For the abs work, Cindy does a range of crunches which target the lower and upper abs plus obliques; she also does a set of full sit-ups.  For the chest work, there are a wide variety of moves, many of which I'd never seen before such as cirlcing the arms of the floor, moving the arms in a V-shape, combining a flye with a chest press, etc.  The floorwork ends with a second abdominal segment, again performing 20 repetitions of each abs exercise (10 repetitions are used for everything else).  You then move back to a standing position for additional upper body work.  Again, an extensive assortment of exercises is used, although you do only one set of each move (with the exception of bent over double rows--for some reason, there are FIVE sets of these). Although Cindy performs the repetitions at a more reasonable pace than she did in Shape Your Body, the transitions between exercises is still very quick, and so you don't really have time to change weights (you can keep a set of heavier weights at your feet for the rows).  However, your muscles may be so fatigued by the last few exercises that you may actually need to DROP the weights altogether for these.  The standing arms section is about 12 minutes long, and then it's back to the floor for a final 8 minutes of abs and back work.  I found some of the abs moves in this section to be a bit odd; I wasn't really feeling the work in my abs, so I modified and did my own crunches at times.  The back work consisted of just a few basic back extentions while lying on your stomach.  To finish the workout, Cindy performs about 4 minutes of yoga-ish stretches.  She definitely does not hold the stretches long enough, although she states \\"you might want to hold these stretches longer.\\"  The total time for the workout was approximately 64 minutes, not including the glossary of exercise terms at the end.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure how to classify this workout or exactly how I feel about it.  It's definitely not a cardio workout and not even true interval or aerobic weight training; on the other hand, the weight work is too fast-paced to be considered a traditional strength training.  I did like the lower body portion, as the moves were a little different yet still seemed effective, but I felt more ambivalent about the upper body and some of the abs moves.  This might be a good workout for someone who is specifically seeking a high repetition, low weight toning workout, although personally, I prefer Cindy's A New Dimension workout to this one.  Like all of Cindy's workouts, however, this video has excellent production values, as it offers a good vocal music soundtrack and is filmed in an assortment of pleasant settings.  Overall, I would rate this workout at 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.l of Cindy's workouts, however, this video has excellent production values, as it offers a good vocal music soundtrack and is filmed in an assortment of pleasant settings.

B00005JNDZ|4.0|Not as good as the first \\"Bridget\\" movie, but actually not that bad. I enjoyed watching it and plan on purchasing the DVD.  Don't expect the movie to be like the book (when are they ever?)because parts are added or changed. I hated Jacinda Barrett's character's \\"secret\\" at the end of the movie and the Thai prison/\\"Like a Virgin\\" scene was also a bit cringe-worthy. Otherwise, an enjoyable movie kept alive by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.
B000683VI4|4.0|Now the first book by Nicholas Sparks is made a film.  That's no surprise after his original books 'Message in a Bottle' and 'A Walk to Remember' have been recently turned into films.  The point is, his books are not for people with cynical outlook of life, or those who believe that any good film must contain a bad guy or two.  You should know this is an unabashed tearjerker.  Yes, in 'The Notebook' love will triumph, but I didn't find that a bad thing. <br /> <br />A case of a simple story well told, 'The Notebook' introduces us to the unnamed two aged couple played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.  Garner is reading a story from a small notebook he holds dear like a day planner, and Rowlands is listening to the story very eagerly.  And it's a love story. <br /> <br />The story-within-story turns out the real story for us, which unfolds like old-fashioned love romance.  Rich Southern lady, Allie ('Rachel McAdams) who is going to women's college in New York after summer, comes to Seabrook, a small rural town in North Carolina, where she spends her peaceful holidays.  There she meets a lumberyard worker Noah (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br />They fell for love each other, if not at first sight for Allie.  But Allie's parents are not happy about that at all.  And when Joan Allen appears as Aliie's uptight mom, we know what will happen to the teens in love.  For her this likable boy he is just a \\"trash\\" which means only one thing to Allie: no future.  The time is set in 1940.  So there is only one thing that love-sick Noah can do.  Going to war. <br /> <br />You can spot all too familiar things in the young couples' story, soaked in sugery nostalgia.  However, for all its shortcomings and manipulative tones, 'The Notebook' remains forceful enough to make us cheer the young boy and girl, and wish them to win, probably because of the assured director's  hand or the universal theme of love story.  Director Nick Cassavetes does trust in this simple story, and shows his beliefin his straightforward approach to the descriptions of Noah and Allie's fate. <br /> <br />The film ends, I think, too neatly, and some say, perhaps rightly, that the Alzheimer Disease is not exactly what the film depicts.  But the beautiful images and strong performances are worth giving a try, if you're not a hardened romance hater (if there should be any).
0446677450|1.0|Like many other books in this genre,Rich Dad Poor Dad is heavy on potatoes,light on meat.Many of the \\"teachings\\" are basic and generic.There is no real teachings of money and/or investing.It seemed like an infomercial in text form.The book reminds me of an Amway rah rah session,but if this inspires one to delve deeper in a quest for money knowledge, then I suppose it would be money well spent. If you think that this book alone will answer your questions,look elsewhere.I have read this book twice ,on orders from my wife,and came away less impressed the second time. It is very quip heavy,I guess this style is supposed to motivate you to buy more of Mr. Kiyosaki's goods,but again its missing all the meat of money matters.There are many other books and videos that give a person more details and less antecdotes.Mr Kiyosaki seems to be more impressed in boasting of what he did instead of explaining WHAT he did.
0375422307|5.0|Never have I read a book with such simplicity and deep textures. This maybe categorized as a comic by some, graphic novel by others, yet I think of it as art. This book captures all the horrors of the revolution and yet retains the humanity of the people involved. I laughed, cried and felt what the author went through. You don't have to be Iranian to understand the journey.
6305313687|4.0|This was the film that brought Edward Norton to star status, and rightfully so.  This film was reccomended to me, and I though it was a great film about what unreasoned, reckless hate does to a person, but one underlying theme continued to bug the heck out of me.<br /><br />  First, the positives.  The stroy follows the family of a slain police officer.  They live in an area that is constantly being taken over by immagrants and gangs.  This is the platform for which Derick, the eldest brother of the family begins to form his neo-nazi ethics.  Derick is a bright, well spoken young man, and after his father is slain by black gangsters, he concentrates his energy upon forming a white, neo-nazi gang to counter the increasing black and immigrant gangs in the area.  When Derick's gang wins a basketball game, forcing a rival black gang from the local basketball courts, the black gangsters propose to get even by vandlizing Derick's late father's truck.  In the proposed defense of his family and property, Derick goes too far and is sentanced to prison.  While in prison, Derick begins to learn the flaws of his reasoning and the hipocracy of his Neo_Nazi gang's actions.  Meanwhile, Danny, Derick's younger brother, who practically worships Derick, continues down the dark path, making trouble at school (Writing paper on \\"Mein Kumph\\" for his class that has a back teacher).  Danny is enveloped by the very gang which Derick began.  When Derick is released from prison, it is up to Derick to streighten Danny out and try to set things right...but it has tragic consequences.<br /><br />  Now for my major gripe.  What would have been an extrodinary film is ruined when the scriptwriters turn the film into an advertisement for the DNC / liberal left.  Just about every arguement brought up in this film is one of the mainstream (not racist) conservitive.  The answer to every arguement proposed, such is that if you want illeagle immagrents deported, if you are against affermitive action, if you think race has no matter or no excuse for crime, then you must be a racist neo nazi.  This is what the whacko leftist hollywoood idiots want you to think (as does the communist media).  In other words, if you felt guilty because you began to understand Derick's arguments, don't.  Neo-Nazis go far beyond (and a lot more irrationally) than points such as these.  This was just the insertion of the left's propiganda.<br /><br />  In other words, this is a film would have come close to excellance, if it hadn't so ardently pushed an adjenda.  It would have been better just to have concentrate on what blind, unreasoned hate can do to a person and how it effects those around them.you think race has no matter or no excuse for crime, then you must be a racist neo nazi.

B00007GZR5|4.0|When I first saw this film in 1998, I was horrified because it was so different from the novel I had just read.  I wanted to see a film more faithful to the novel and the beauty and awe I felt when I read it.  This is not that movie. <br /> <br />I decided to watch this film again on its own merits.  I haven't read the novel for years, so I'm able to see this film with fresh eyes, and judge it on its own merits.  Its not the novel, and maybe someday there will be a film that is a closer representation of the novel, but this film presents the director's vision and still provides excellent insights into the afterlife.  For that, its worth watching and owning. <br /> <br />This film is visually stunning as they recreated a world as one might expect if a person lived in a painting, or a place that resembled a painting.  Having seen some actual works by Renoir, I know the feeling of being transported into another realm on the basis of a painting.  This film does it perfectly.  The symbology and recurring patterns (sailboats, for example) work exceptionally well. <br /> <br />The biggest changes made from the novel is that this film is about a family's connection in life and the afterlife, and the focus is on the relationships between husband and wife, father and son, and father and daughter.  Robin Williams plays Chris Nielson, who meets his soulmate in Italy, and they marry and have two children, who die in a tragic car accident.  The wife, played by the exceptional Annabella Sciorra, is institutionalized after the tragedy, and does get better...until her husband also dies in a freak accident.  He finds himself in heaven and she's left to grieve alone, which is a burden too heavy for her to overcome.  In heaven, Chris meets a few people who explain how the afterlife works (and its so much better in the novel) and then he's hit with the news that his wife had killed herself and was now in a hell of her own creation.  He decides to brave the dangers of hell (because one can lose one's mind being surrounded by tormented souls and the thoughts they carry) to rescue her.  This is a story of a love so deep, that a man is willing to give up heaven to be with the woman he loves in her self created hell.  Amazing! <br /> <br />This dvd also includes the original ending, and while it was more faithful to the novel (and one I would've preferred), I also know why they changed it to the \\"cutesy ending\\" we see.  Unfortunately, it downplays the way reincarnation supposedly works (the original ending was more realistic) and presents it as some adorable, Americanized version of reincarnation...which is more fantasy than reality.  However, imperfect this film is, I give it four stars because of the importance of such a film in bringing any vision of the afterlife to public consciousness.  There are not enough films like this being made and I'm one who would love to see more films about heaven and the afterlife (besides \\"Defending Your Life\\", \\"Ghost\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\", \\"Chances Are\\", \\"Made in Heaven\\" to name a few).  This is one of the better ones out there...but the novel is so much better.  If you haven't seen this film or read the novel, I recommend seeing the film first then reading the novel.  If you do it the other way, you run the risk like me...of having such a beautiful vision in your head and being disappointed that the film is nothing like your vision.  This film deserves to be seen on its own merits.  It is simply visually beautiful and if the afterlife is as the film presents, we really do have nothing to fear if we love others and treat them by the Golden Rule.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't need to go into detail, I mean read some of the reviews that do. This album is the best from the 1990s and better than anything from the 80s or first half of this decade too. It's simply unbelievably good. <br /> <br />Oh, and everyone buy Joy Division records.
B00000FCBC|4.0|Metallicas Garage Days is simply a cover CD. They, as they put it, \\"cover all your favourites\\". <br /> <br />Most of the tracks are decent, some I just skip, but the CD is worth it for some memorable renditions of \\"Turn the Page\\", \\"Loverman\\", and \\"Astronomy\\". I have the first CD of the double set in my car and I listen to it often. <br /> <br />So, the question is - should you buy it? Well, if you like Metallica's style then the answer is definitely yes - they do some very good covers of some songs you'd never think fit in metal (Loverman? Turn the Page? In Heavy Metal? Surprisingly, it works). <br /> <br />Don't expect every track to be a masterpiece though, CD2 of the set I have rarely listened to, and I barely remember it, since it simply doesn't contain as many gems as the first one. <br /> <br />All in all, a few good tracks definitely make the CD worthwhile, and who knows, you just might like the tracks I don't :). <br />

B0006J28BO|4.0|The Cat Returns is a light hearted magical tale that will entertain both adults and children. My six year old daughter loved this movie and my 1 year old daughter, who is going through a fetish for cats, got all excited to see the cats in the movie. The plot of the story flows very nicely filled with magic, adventure, humor and interesting characters. The English dubbing is very well done with Anne Hathaway, from Princess Diaries, voicing the self doubting clumsy Haru. Cary Elwes, Princess Bride, doing a great English aristocratic accent for the Baron, Peter Boyle as Matu doing a cat version of his cranky with a biting sense of humor character from Everybody Loves Raymond,  Elliott Gould as the raven Toto who serves as a foil for Matu, Tim Curry, Scary Movie 2 and The Three Musketeers, playing the laid back King of the Cats, and the King's lackey voiced by Andy Richter from Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Some of the funny moments of the movie are the parallels between the Cat Kingdom and the world of humans. For example, when an entourage brings the King to see Haru at her home in the middle of the night the King is protected by CIBs, Cats in Black, who serve as secret service agents pushing the normal cats away and throwing them over fences. For the pre-wedding banquet you see cats in famous art works come to life, for example cats in ancient Egypt attire. This film, distributed by Disney, shows more creativity and imagination than recent animation produced by Disney including Home on the Range and Brother Bear. This movie is especially appealing to parents with daughters because the main character is a teenage girl and you see her gain self-confidence and discover herself as she goes through this adventure in a magical world. <br />There are some extras on the DVD including a English version of a Japanese documentary and the comments of the English speaking actors about doing the voice over work. The 2nd DVD disc shows the movie in its original Japanese version. The movie is rated G with a minimal of violence and clean language, except for jerk.      <br />
B000092ZYX|1.0|I will start out this review by saying I think OK Computer is probably one of the best albums of the last decade.  However this CD, along with Kid A, has got to be the worst.  It is a collection of incoherent meaningless noise.  Anyone who thinks this is art is also the person who thinks someone is a genious because they can't understand them.  I am not opposed to experimentation, but some experiments are failures; and these \\"songs\\" (much like an ugly baby)are something only their creator would love.  What a disappointment.
B000002MUN|5.0|This album has so incredibly much to offer it's not even funny. This remains one of my favorite albums of all time and still maintains heavy rotation in my CD player to this day.<br /><br />I borrowed it from an aunt of mine back in '95, and was simply blown away. I kept procrastinating on giving it back to her because it simply was too good to let go. I finally bought my own copy in '97 and never looked back.<br /><br />Everything from the melodic \\"Wildflowers\\" to the Rock'N'Roll rhythm of \\"You Wreck Me\\", all the way through the orchestrated aura of \\"Wake Up Time\\", this album delivers through and through.<br /><br />This is easily Tom's best effort yet, and ranks right up there with Full Moon Fever. Does anybody find it a bit peculiar that both of Tom Petty's best albums were ones he put out himself (i.e. solo effort)?<br /><br />Way to go, Tom...you have won my heart and my respect for your music. Keep it up.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead has surpassed The Bends and created a work of art.  Everthing works here, and I find something new with each listen.  Despite the narcissism and alienation expressed in the lyrics, this album refreshes my spirit and reminds me why modern music can in many ways rival classical music. I find myself listening to this CD as often as I do to Dark Side of the Moon and the White Album.  A true masterpiece.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'm a huge Pat Metheny fan, and a fan of PMG too.  But I must admit that when I first listened to this I thought it might just be a bunch PMG clich&eacute;s pieced together with some extraordinary production; possibly even over produced.  After a few listens, the theme would not leave my brain, and little niceties here and there were begging to be heard again.  I enjoyed the recording very much after the third listen.<br /><br />But everything changed completely after I saw them live in San Diego at the Speckles Theater; this isn't over produced wizardry and tricks, they can do this entire piece live, and it was much much better still.  Truly unbelievable; the audience was completely stunned by the end of the second movement.  When the band actually stopped playing after 70 minutes straight the place exploded!  I think even the band was a little shocked at all the noise and the standing ovation.  I had not planned to go nuts, but it was spontaneous; folks really didn't know where to put themselves.  It was truly something; and then the band played for another hour non-stop.<br /><br />Now that I know this is not all just slick production, the album means a whole lot more.  This is quite an accomplishment of composition and musicianship. Bravo gentlemen.
1400031087|5.0|Rarely has a book drawn me in with its language the way this one did. Frey's style, so conversational and sporadic, makes for a book that grabs you and holds you. The tale is harrowing, the descriptions vivid. Even though the whole thing is set in one location, with anecdotes only told, not lived, for us, it never is boring. Not for one page, paragraph or sentence. <br />To lump this in with 'rehab books' is grossly unfair. It is a novel that demands attention, and you want to give it. <br />It is beautiful, in a sad and sickly way.
B0007O38F8|1.0|THIS IS STILL EAR POLLUTION!    First off, is it just me, or is his \\"flow\\" or whatever it's supposed to be getting worse & worse? On \\"GRODT\\", he slurred & mumbled his \\"lyrics\\" (or what's supposed to pass for them)\\" on his way to the top. On here, he sounds asthough his mouth is full of mashed potatoes. Damn! he sounds like he got shot some more times in the mouth!    Secondly, 95% of this album was produced by others besides Dre, and it certainly shows! The production on this turd is a cross b/w bland & just plain horrible! The only beat that's @ least half-assed @ best is the one for \\"Gattman & Robin,\\" which shows that Feminem needs to stick to the rapping.     Next, the lyrics were insipid, ignorant, juvenile, and amateurish, but this is \\"Fithy\\" we're talkin' about, so what should I have expected?    Next, the only 2 tracks decent enough to be released commercially as singles are \\"Build You Up\\" & \\"So Amazing,\\" which unsurprisingly are the poppish, love ballads ones, and have Ja Rule written all over them. The rest are completely unlistenable to say the least.     Lastly, I don't know what Vivica Fox was smokin' or sniffin' when she had her little fling w/ him (or what she would like to think of as a \\"relationship\\")cuz he ain't even worth 50 cents. I dunno, I guess she must've had a \\"Baltimore Love Thing\\".    In Conclusion, your money should be spent on buying albums by real lyricists like Nas. Sure, he may not \\"sell records,\\" but @ least  he's REAL. This scumbag is devoid of any real lyrical ability whatsoever, but this is the sh&t that sells. Lord, no wonder hip-hop is dead, and rap is on \\"life support\\". Just sad.
B00005JMCT|3.0|American Wedding is vulgar and is definitely not as good as the first two Pie movies, but it's not really as bad as these elementary schoolers below say it is. With every girl from American Pie and American Pie 2 gone except Michelle but every guy returning except Oz, nearly half the important and most interesting characters have disappeared: Vicky, Heather, Nadia, Sherman, Oz, Matt Stifler. Even Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas from Halloween Resurrection) is barely in 'Wedding'. There's an added young character, though, Cadence, Michelle's sister. I say young because this is the first movie where we see Michelle's parents, and they're not really one of the top 10 main characters. There's also Bear, who's hilarious. <br /> <br />Stifler (Seann Scott) is really the star of the show, even though Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan have the top billing almost every time I see a 'Wedding' poster or fansite. Stifler acts like a really annoying child in this flick - more so than Pie 2. All he really thinks about is sex and insults people for no reason. <br /> <br />I recommend renting the film, but not buying. The rated and unrated versions are both on the unrated edition. The unrated cut contains an introduction by the writer. DVD extras include 4 featurettes, outtakes, deleted scenes w/ intros, DVD-Rom and Cast/Filmmaker bios. Pay no attention to whatever you hear from children who are basically ten through twelve years old who shouldn't even be watching American Wedding in the first place. If you hear the same smack from a kid over thirteen, bashing the film, they behave like they're 11 anyways. As Stifler said, \\"F*** those f**k*rs.\\"
B00001U0DP|5.0|I was spellbound as I watched this movie. <br />This is a moving tale of a light-hearted father protecting his son from the terrible and tragic reality of the Holocaust by weaving a cocoon of an imaginary and simple world.  <br />The movie comes with a philosophy, that even in the ugliest of times, we can portray a beautiful life with things as simple but beautiful as love, family and imagination. <br />At the same time, the movie does not discard the gravity of the holocaust. The movie is so subtle that even without portraying the cruel scenes visually, it creates tension at a subconscious level. <br />A beautiful watch. <br />Dont miss it!
B00005AR3G|5.0|How in the world did something fun sneak out of the Disney studio?  The story of an utterly self-absorbed king brought down to earth is common enough, but in Last Groove the story is made FUN.  Disney movies should be FUN.  This one is great for all ages.  My kids enjoy it and the dialogue is witty enough that I can handle the constant replaying--that's a tall order for any movie.<br /><br />The movie has an originality about it that is lacking in recent Disney movies (Lilo & Stitch excepted).  In fact, it could be described most appropriately as a 2D Pixar movie.  One measure of a fine movie are how many quotable excerpts survive and incorporate themselves into the family discourse.  \\"Llama Face\\" \\"How Long Has That Been There\\" \\"Hate the Hair and Let Me Guess, you have a Great Personality\\" \\"Uh Oh, Let me Guess Huge Waterfall [Yup], Sharp Rocks [Most Likely], Bring It On.\\" and many, many more.  Like \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" this movie doesn't try too hard and ends up succeeding on all levels.<br /><br />If you have to buy a movie for a young relative that you know you will be trapped into watching--make it this one.
B0006419J6|4.0|i must say the worst part of this movie is the female lead of the film. i can't say i know if it's supposed to be that way but all i can say is her acting wasn't good. but i think Will di an awsome job! he was funny, stern, and at times intimidating. to bad all cops aren't like him. the robot, well there isn't much to say bout acting there cuz we really don't know what they sound like. but i thought it had a good artificial sounding voice. overall a well made movie.....
B00005JNBQ|1.0|It's not that I don't \\"get it\\" because I understood the jokes, and I knew why they were supposed to be funny. They just weren't (for the most part). I consider myself to have impeccable taste in comedies: 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is, hands down, the funniest movie of all time. Close behind is 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Tommy Boy'. Other faves are 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy'. In other words, I know a funny movie when I see it. 'Airplane!', for example, has a lot of the dry \\"stupid funny\\" humour that 'Napoleon Dynamite' attempts but fails miserably. If you haven't seen the movies I mentioned (especially 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'), I highly recommend you see what you're missing. The only reason that this movie can do so well among young people (of which I am one -- 22 years old) is because they (we) have been deprived of quality comedies (1995's 'Tommy Boy' being the last great comedy).<br /><br />If you think trite jokes about a guy \\"stuck in the 80's\\" are funny, then, by all means, get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you think \\"liger\\" (Napoleon's favorite mythical creature -- a cross b/w a lion and tiger) is funny, then get 'Napoleon Dynamite'. If you share my tastes in comedies, then avoid. Don't waste two hours of your life and certainly don't waste your money. I doubt this will truly become a cult classic; it simply isn't funny.
630512762X|4.0|the story line of this movie isn't the best i've seen in my life but i have to say it had some pretty nice action, there's tons of language in it and lots of explotions! over all i would say not a must see but an ok movie to go watch on a weekend with the 18+ group.....
B000005IRG|2.0|This is an ok album but the 'revolutionary' sound is definetly no where close to richard hell and the voidoids. The 'saturated' punk guitar sound is also no comparison to robert quines mastery on blank generation. Infact no single member of television can compare to his voidoid counterpart, especially tom verlaine, whos writing, although good compared to popular artists of his time, is still no match for richard hell.
0393035158|1.0|The End of Faith...?  Did you mean the end of Judaism?
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is insane in more ways then just the singing, noises, drums and best of all guitar. I strongly recommend this if you are a first time Mars Volta listener. ....every track is different in its own way and progresses famously through to the end. enjoy it as much as i
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green day is one of the best bands of all times. On this album they have Jesus of Suburbia which is like The Who's Tommy. There is also boulevard of broken dreams and american idiot!!!!! If you like music at all you should already be thinking of getting this grammy award winning cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me this album is worth every penny!! Also, if you like this alubum then try listening to other green day albums like dookie and nimrod.
0446691437|5.0|A must-read for every entrepreneur, innovator or anyone wanting to embark on the road of authenticity and great contribution. Also highly useful en-route. Deserves the play on words in its title, subconsciously associating it with the world's premier book of strategy, Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War'. The two books are genetically linked.
B000002MP2|5.0|If you have ever heard American Idiot or any other green day albums then I highly suggest you should get this one. If you like music at all you should already be thinking of getting any Green Day album, especially this one. Dookie is a great album because it has Burnout, Welcome to Paradise, Chump, and many more great hits on it. So don't just sit here and read my review, GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JO17|1.0|This movie is often hard to review because it didn't come out yet.Thats for sure.The previews are wonderful and active but it's way to stupid to be true.Parents would think it's a waste of time.&lt;Rolling eyes>Mark Dindal looks a vaery WEIRD derictor and it looks dissapionted.Although, if I had to go to the movie theaters and the choices were: Cars or Chicken Little I would choose Chick Little.The Incredibals looks and it IS good and WAY better than this rip - off movie.I'm not saying DON'T but just TRY NOT TO WACTH this stupid movie.The whole water cycle in the movie is just plain crazy in the system.I would pefer you yo wacth The Incredibals or War Of The Worlds. \\"MVP\\" Don't regret it(R)
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|I love the Queens so much. I heard Little Sister and got a leaked version of Tangled Up In Plaid before the album came out. SO... I figured if these songs are any representation of the album to come...then things will be just like they were. You know always raw and kick ass. Josh Homme is a rock god in my opinion and kick ass rock and roll is what he does better than anyone around right now. I mean Dave Grohl asked Josh Homme to play on his album. Dave is supposed to be the \\"it\\" guy of the moment in rock.  <br />  Unfortunately...on this album that kick ass has been turned down a notch or two because of the absense of the previously mentioned rawness of the last three albums. I mean it's way better than what I or most normal people could do but, it drags so bad. I fell asleep halfway through the album the 3rd time around. The other albums kept me on edge the whole album for at least the first 3 months after I had them. Joshua Homme better find that crazy punk abandon he had when Nick was in the band or he may have declinig sales for the rest of his career with the Queens.  <br />   But there are some really strong points on the album. Tangled Up In Plaid is the most bad ass song Josh has ever composed. That is one of the very few raw tracks on the album. Skin On Skin is crazy erratic with the vocals and it reels you in really quick. The pauses after the first verse are very reminiscent of You Would Know (off of the first album). Everybody Knows That You're Insane starts off really slow and scary almost like a Black Sabbath song would, then it quickily jumps into this really quick punky number from the first chorus on out. It is amazing at first but, it also tends to drag itself out because there isn't a real change of musical landscape.  <br />   I don't know... I'm not dissapointed but I'm not thrilled either. The album has it's moments but more often than not it doesn't. It's still better than the rest of the crap on MTV.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  If you are or want to be a bodybuilder.  Yes, it can be a little dramatic, but it is a bodybuilding movie.  The mind games, workout scenes, not to mention the level of intesity.  The fun side and the tough side.  Even the extras are fantasic.  Arnold with his impressions then and now.  If you are a bodybuilding fan or an Arnold fan, this is something you should add to your collection.  I wouldn't recommend that most work out to the level of intensity of those in this DVD unless you are a pro, otherwise, you can still get some great tips for building intensity, simply by watching them.<br /><br />Great stuff!
B000005RU2|4.0|Made In Japan (1972.), a Deep Purple live performance<br /><br />Deep Purple's 'Made in Japan' is a timeless capture of one of the greatest rocks bands performing in all of their glory. Deep Purple are arguably at their peak at this point, on the back of three quite amazing albums, 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' the Mark II Deep Purple lineup are captured here performing at their very best. The three concerts featured in this album took place on the 15th, 16th and 17th August 1972 at Osaka/Tokyo in Japan and with the tracks they play, DP literally bring the house down and you can seriously feel this when you play this live album with a great atmosphere from the crowd.<br /><br />What therefore makes this live album extra special? Afterall there are plenty of bands who have given really good live performances. The simple fact is that the album is very very honest. There are no studio overdubs, additions of fake cheers or claps or any tampering to speak of with the recording. You are hearing exactly what was been played on the nights of the concerts - this is the real McCoy and it definitely makes the whole thing extra special. My only real complaint with the whole thing is, and its a bit pedantic and is the reason why I gave it 4.5 stars is the fact that the cd does not give one full length concert but instead 5 tracks from the 2nd concert and the rest from the other two - giving it a kind of best of a live tour feel. You scarcely notice it when listening but from my point of view, I would much rather listen to a concert in its entirity rather than a piecemeal recording (A 3 CD version of the whole thing is actually available - now that would get 5 stars!). However aside from this minor niggle, you can't fault Deep Purple's performance, it is quite simply amazing. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenominal than what you hear on the studio album - his guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, he is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. By no means though does he overshadow his fellow DP bandmembers. Ian Paice's drumming is spectacular (more about that later) as is Gillan's amazing vocal range and Jon Lord puts out more than a good dose of great keyboard improvisation.<br /><br />There are a number of issues of this CD. The best version to get of the '3 concert overview' is the 25th anniversary edition, the version which I obtained. Aside from being quite cheap to buy, you get a bonus CD which contains 'The Encores' of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. They are a good addition and pad out the material available. The standard issue contains the 7 tracks only and not the encores, plus you don't get the extensive information booklet which comes with all the anniversary Deep Purple remasters.<br /><br />What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a rock n roll song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP do a great improvised version of it, with Gillan's vocals screaming to amazing heights. The original CD kicks off with 'Highway Star' and prepare to be blasted away by the bands heavy ferocity (something which continues right through with very little respite!). Blackmore gives us his trademarke style of playing with the first track, riffing like there is no tomorrow! The 'Child In Time' rendition is a great listen, in some ways has better effects live than in the studio and is a great listen. 'Smoke On the Water', well it never disappoints - you hear the crowd clapping and really getting into the groove on this song! 'The Mule' follows this up and is perhaps, for me the most entertaining on the CD - Ian Paice's drumming on this track is a solo and a half! Ive never heard a drum solo quite like it - full of energy and speed and practically creates a song single handedly - the highlight of the album - he is definitely one of the top rock drummers there is. The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. 'Space Truckin' at 19 minutes does go on just a little bit but is still a fun listen. On 'Lazy' there is some whizz keyboard work from Jon Lord - listen to his interesting and cleverly clashing opening. Gillan is always on hand to get the crowd involved, especially at the end of 'Strange Kiond of Woman' where he screams higher and higher with the crowd!<br /><br />All in all, great entertainment and very much a unique and polished (in live terms anyway) perfromance. A must for any DP fan - it is a capture of DP's greatest line up, the legendary Mark II!

B00003CXCD|5.0|There is something about Roman Holiday that is compulsively rewatchable and tugs at your heartstrings like crazy.  It is the film that won Audrey Hepburn fame and her only Oscar.  It is one of the first movies to be shot on location (during that time, most movies were shot in a studio).  It is, arguably, one of the greatest romances ever made into a movie. <br /> <br />Audrey Hepburn plays a modern-day princess, Princess Ann, who is becoming frazzled and overwhelmed with her duties as royalty.  While in Rome, she escapes the palace and runs in contact with Gregory Peck's Joe Bradley, who is not only a reporter looking for a big story, but has no idea who the strange girl is.  The next day, they both decide to play hooky for a day from their jobs and have a \\"Roman Holiday,\\" doing everything Ann has always wanted to do, but never really has.   <br /> <br />Most of the movie has an atmosphere of light romantic comedy.  However, the last quarter of the movie does a complete turnaround, making it one of the most heartbreaking, dramatic, yet ironically highly satisfying movies made. <br /> <br />Despite Peck getting top-billing, Audrey Hepburn's character is the biggest character, and it doesn't try to hide it.  The public was charmed by Hepburn that she made many other hit films such as Sabrina, My Fair Lady, and Breakfast at Tiffany's.  While they are all excellent films as well, none of them have the same magic as Roman Holiday.  If you have not seen the movie, you are doing yourself a disservice. <br /> <br />

However aside from this minor niggle, you can't fault Deep Purple's performance, it is quite simply amazing. Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing is sometimes more phenominal than what you hear on the studio album - his guitar playing live shows why, in my opinion, he is one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. By no means though does he overshadow his fellow DP bandmembers. Ian Paice's drumming is spectacular (more about that later) as is Gillan's amazing vocal range and Jon Lord puts out more than a good dose of great keyboard improvisation.<br /><br />There are a number of issues of this CD. The best version to get of the '3 concert overview' is the 25th anniversary edition, the version which I obtained. Aside from being quite cheap to buy, you get a bonus CD which contains 'The Encores' of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille. They are a good addition and pad out the material available. The standard issue contains the 7 tracks only and not the encores, plus you don't get the extensive information booklet which comes with all the anniversary Deep Purple remasters.<br /><br />What we hear from these live performances are lots of tracks from 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head'. The only exception to this is 'Lucille' which is a rock n roll song by Little Richard (I think!) - DP do a great improvised version of it, with Gillan's vocals screaming to amazing heights. The original CD kicks off with 'Highway Star' and prepare to be blasted away by the bands heavy ferocity (something which continues right through with very little respite!). Blackmore gives us his trademarke style of playing with the first track, riffing like there is no tomorrow! The 'Child In Time' rendition is a great listen, in some ways has better effects live than in the studio and is a great listen. 'Smoke On the Water', well it never disappoints - you hear the crowd clapping and really getting into the groove on this song! 'The Mule' follows this up and is perhaps, for me the most entertaining on the CD - Ian Paice's drumming on this track is a solo and a half! Ive never heard a drum solo quite like it - full of energy and speed and practically creates a song single handedly - the highlight of the album - he is definitely one of the top rock drummers there is. The last three tracks, 'Strange Kind of Woman', 'Lazy' and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams. 'Space Truckin' at 19 minutes does go on just a little bit but is still a fun listen. On 'Lazy' there is some whizz keyboard work from Jon Lord - listen to his interesting and cleverly clashing opening. Gillan is always on hand to get the crowd involved, especially at the end of 'Strange Kiond of Woman' where he screams higher and higher with the crowd!<br /><br />All in all, great entertainment and very much a unique and polished (in live terms anyway) perfromance. A must for any DP fan - it is a capture of DP's greatest line up, the legendary Mark II! Just think that in a year after this concert the Mark II line up was no more ....... although it was definitely not the end for Deep Purple, no no no, there was plenty of more great work to come!and 'Space Truckin' all extend into full out jams.

B0002V7ODI|4.0|Hellboy grew on me to point where I paid 32.00 for the Director's Cut.<br /><br />The first viewing didn't leave much of an impression.  We have cable and I couldn't find the remote and Hellboy was being shown and I left it on.<br /><br />The second time around, the respect and love Hellboy had for his \\"father\\" became obvious.  I wish there had more scenes between John Hurt and Ron Perlman.  They both are very good actors and, I thought, deserved more screen time together.<br /><br />Also, the second viewing left me feeling cheated.  There were hints of greatness overshadowed by a three-eyed reptile-dog with Medusa like locks.  Just when I began to get interested, the movie degenerated into a chase scene, in a subway.  2004 must be the subway action pack movie year.<br /><br />Roger Ebert did give \\"Hellboy\\" 3&1/2 stars.  After a talk with a movie buff friend, I gave it another chance.<br /><br />What I had originally viewed as 'been there, done that' with some of the scenes, was actually Del Toro's homage to \\"Star Wars\\" and 'Raiders', and even to \\"Men In Black\\".<br /><br />The main problem I was having with the movie was lighting.  It was grey and dark and dim, even when shot outside on a supposedly sunny day.  It took about 50 viewings for me to find all the care and detail that went into making this film, and this film was made with serious attention to detail.  I just noticed the scroll-work on Sammael's body, and that was literally after about 50 viewings.<br /><br />I watched it again.  Biddy Hodson's brilliant portrayal of Ilsa grabbed my attention.  She played the little blonde Nazi snickerdoodle (with a sledgehammer always handy)  with a cold vengence, smashing her way through the movie and delivering some of its best lines.<br /><br />It came on again and Jeffrey Tambor made me giggle.<br /><br />And so on, and so on, and so on...until I became an addict.<br /><br />Then I began to worry that it might be taken Off Starz! On Demand ...  so I though I'd better buy it.<br /><br />And so I did.<br /><br />One ironically sad piece of information, uncovered in the director's cut, was that the movie was pulled from many theaters because of its title.  Theater owners didn't want the movie playing at Easter time.  This movie is so laden with Christian belief and religion as a weapon in fighting the monsters of evil, it could be considered as biased towards Catholicisim.  Yes, Hellboy is a crucifix wearing, rosary toting demon with an undying love and respect towards his human Catholic \\"father\\".<br /><br />See the movie, a few times.  Itis worth it.<br /><br />mahh I'd better buy it.       And so I did.

B000001FS3|5.0|The Joshua Tree (1987.), U2's fifth studio album<br /><br />'The Joshua Tree' is a classic which harks back to the days when U2 were a real groundbraking force in rock (U2 are a rock band NOT a pop band for the record). This album, released in 1987 was their fifth studio album release and is in many ways the culmination of the U2 work which came before it, including works such as 'War'. 'The Joshua Tree' was the album which truly cemented U2 on the world stage. Its thoughtful approach makes it interesting to listen to every time and it is certainly one of my favourite albums, even if U2 themsleves probably do not feature in what I would regard as my top 5 favourite bands.<br /><br />In the 80's when there was too much a share of 'hair-metal' acts which brought down the rock genre as a whole thankfully there are albums such as this one which carry the torch for good music if you like. These were the days when, for me U2 had real respect as a rock band. They did different things, pioneering their own sound and gained many fans beacause of it. They avaoided advertising and appearing on commercials, often didn't turn up to collect awards at ceremonies and didn't allow themselves to be bowled over by wealth and popularity. And .... surprise, sadly all of these things are what U2 are not now - even their music - as good as the tracks on the recent album are - its nothing that they hadn't done before. Going back to the Joshua Tree, we see U2 switching the overall themes for their albums. From the earlier controversial political issues such as songs like 'Sunday, Bloody Sunday' in War, we see U2 go more onto traditional themes of love, troubles of life etc etc etc. However, it fits in well with the style of the album overall.<br /><br />All the material on 'The Joshua Tree' is first rate. Some of U2's most famous stuff is one here. 'Where the Streets have No Name' starts the whole thing off and we reacquaint ourselves with Bono's familiar vocals and The Edge's instantly recognisable guitar riffs. The fourth track on the album, 'Bullet the Blue Sky' is one of my favourites on the album. A slightly downbeat but effective riff accompanies well with Bono's story telling vocals and similarly 'Running To Stand Still' is a very passionate track to follow this. 'Red Hill Mining Town' is another highlight with effective synthesizer and vocal harmonisation. 'Trip Through Your Wires' is a great track, a bit different with a great harmonica part over the top with a progressive riff theme to it - its a track that I never tire of listening to. The other top highlight of the album for me is 'Mothers of the Disappeared' which makes a very interesting and very much surreal finish to the album.<br /><br />So, there you have it, 'The Joshua Tree', an 80's masterpiece which is well deserving of its classic album status amongst many critics. Definitely worth investing in, you'll not regret it.The fourth track on the album, 'Bullet the Blue Sky' is one of my favourites on the album.

B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid is one of the best bands to come out of the 90's, let alone one of the best punk bands to do so.  If you enjoy a good cali punk band, and you've either exhausted all of your NOFX sources or are just looking for something different, then Rancid is the band for you.  As long as Tim's voice doesn't annoy you (I'll admit it may be an acquired taste), there are enough songs on this cd to make any punk rock enthusiast happy.  This is Rancid at their prime, with not too much punk to make them hardcore, and just enough ska to get you bobbing your head to the beats, this album is, in my opinion, the definitive Rancid cd to purchase.  Rancid is both a good band to cut your punk rock teeth on, and a great band to listen to no matter how long you've enjoyed the punk scene.  All in all, this is an essential cd for any collection.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I purchased It's Time by Michael Buble after I fell in love with the song Home. I was disappointed to find that the rest of the songs on the CD were all basically covers of older songs, not original material.  Since \\"Home\\" was an original song, I did not expect that, and although I do like the CD, I would not have bought it had I known the other songs were all just covers of other people's songs.  Buble is very talented though and the CD is well done, if you like that sort of thing.
B000244EMO|5.0|This movie is about  a team of army commandos going into a jungle to find  ufo which has crashed in the middle, they discover that bodies have been skinned and then discover a terrorist camp and suspect them and have a shoo-out with them, but it isn't, the team start to die one by one by this creature until only Dutch (Schwarznegger) is left in the jungle being chased by the Predator (who travels through the trees). This has some great action and the acting is good with other co-stars like Jesse Ventura, carl Weathers and a few others. There is only about 8 in the cast but that is not really a problem.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have a few star trek dvds and they're ok.. i'd never heard of this series before i bought the set of disks.  I'm an engineer and am critical of 'water running uphill' - physically impossible plot and story lines cause they're insulting.  I found nothing like that here.  For my money (as a novice to the series) - i'd take this series over star trek.  It is more plausible (less 'magic') and to me (imho) more entertaining.  Despite the one star rating critic lambasting 'fanatics' for packing the reviews - i'd not classify myself as a fanatic - i don't care for \\"Buffy\\" - too much implasible magic and a 'star' who once remarked \\"I can't believe i have to work with these people!!\\" after showing up hours late for an appointment.  Non-professional to say the least.  Buffy is a 'groopie - teenybopper' show.. I'm over 60, so it doesn't appeal to me.  This show isn't in that category for my nickle.. Too bad there's so little of it.  Cheers   <br />Rabbit

1591840562|5.0|This book is immensely practical. It is very well written and enjoyable to read. It is packed with information that can save a person literally years of blood, sweat and tears that they would otherwise have to discover on their own. The style of the book provides engaging reading that is woven with just enough humor to make it a refreshing read.    I am presently part of a start-up company. The \\"Art of the Start\\" is required reading for our growing team. I have read a number of books to get a background education about the entrepreneurial realm, but none of them provided an applied approach. When I need to know \\"What do I do next?\\",  I am using the Art of the Start as my reference resource.     Guy has successfully boiled down the process and issues of starting \\"anything\\" to a usable size. A person can finish this book quickly, but they'll want to go back to refresh themselves on topics when particular tasks need to be accomplished.     In times when business and entrepreneurship are creating a new reality on the planet: i.e. \\"making a difference in the world\\", this book has contributed to the betterment of the cause. The altruistic mission, beyond helping to create successful businesses, puts this book on different footing than I have previously discovered. Our primary mission with our start-up is to make a positive contribution to the human condition. To reach that end, I, and our team, are using the \\"Art of the Start\\" as a guide.
B0000041DF|4.0|I'm sorry to contradict David Hurwitz, but Argerich's Rach 3 is NOT \\"the fastest and most physically exciting you will ever hear\\": this honour goes to Hurwitz's near-namesake Vladimir Horowitz in his 1941 live version with Sir John Barbirolli. In this wild rendition, Horowitz plays the concerto faster than anybody before or since, Rachmaninov and Argerich included.  In fact, here Horowitz is faster than Argerich in all of the most virtuosic passages, and much faster in the end climax. Argerich - or anyone else, for that matter - simply can't equal Horowitz's white heat, whiplash kind of technical brilliance and command, his unique power, speed and tonal control.

The drama develops late in the book and with so many opportunities and characters it failed to bring the action on time, therefore, the book remains almost flat until the end. The author suddenly finishes the story as it looks like the editor calls him to Italy and remand him the final draft of this novel. Far from Grisham best!
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|The last album by the Queens of the Stone Age was \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" a frenetic collection of the hardest kind of rock. It was a thrilling, visceral experience, not one soon forgotten. Then nude bassist Nick Oliveri departed from the band, taking the wilder edge of the band with him. Oh, what would become of the Queens of the Stone Age?<br /><br />Well, if \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" is any indication, then they are doing fine. This album relies on Josh Homme, and it's stripped down to... well, not down to the bare bones, but some very strong, lean sinew. The albums opens with a little acoustic ballad, \\"Lullaby,\\" which starts things off on a strong footing.<br /><br />From there on, things get stranger -- fast paced songs that just keep speeding up, ominous buildups, and nightmarish undertones.There are moments of quieter catchiness -- \\"Little Sister\\" seems perfect for the album's first single. And a few tracks feel a bit like filler. But overall, \\"Lullabies\\" is very much in the flavour of the Queens' second album, \\"Rated R.\\" Only darker and somehow more whimsical.<br /><br />Singer/songwriter/guitarist Josh Homme gets to rule in this one. Truth be told, he ruled all through the Desert Sessions, Kyuss, and now he sits in the middle of the Queens of the Stone Age, like a sinister-but-not-evil mastermind. Oliveri's manic style and gimmicks are gone, and in their place is steady, dark rock'n'roll that takes strange and unexpected twists.<br /><br />It's not a concept album, but it feels that way -- the mood gets generally creepier as \\"Lullabies\\" goes on. Fuzzy guitars, dark metallic riffs, and eerie harmonies get a few unusual flourishes, such as that broken music box. And Homme's vocals blend into the songs like another instrument -- great stuff. It only emphasizes how central he is to the band's unique sound.<br /><br />Queens of the Stone Age seemed to be endangered when Oliveri departed, but \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" shows that the band is just fine. Not quite perfect, but a solid creation.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco, quite simply, is the best. Jeff Tweedy's deep and thoughtful lyrics meld with the band's style of making cutting edge acoustic/ alternative -- Oh, never mind, It's unclassifiable. They expertly use technology to complement their strange, beautiful and haunted style of breathtakingly beautiful sound. Unbelievably, the snobnouses at their former label thought that they were joking, so they signed onto a nonesuch, ironically a division of that label. Oh wait, I'll stop writing now, so you can rush out to your nearest record store and hold the manager at gunpoint while you take every copy in the store.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I have seen this movie three times now and I feel I know this part of the gospels well, but in light of some books written by theologians condemning it I had to figure out why would you condemn such a movie. I know why the secular or Jewish community have condemned it that's obvious, but a man of God to do this just really perplexed me.  After reviewing some of the books written against this its apparent that a lot of it has to do with Catholicism as a whole rather than removing those tidbits and getting to the raw nature the film was intended to spark. Mel Gibson in an interview stated this was not to tell the WHOLE story of Jesus its intent was to show you visually the last 12 hours just exactly what we as sinners placed upon his perfect body and spirit. To say that Gibson interwove Catholic tendencies into this film sure after all he is Catholic. Do I agree with the way in which Catholics believe not entirely, but this should not detract from the film itself. Yes, Mary has a strong presence, but flip it around look at it from a parents stance you know your child's ending, the suffering he will endure what parent in their right mind would not want to try and save them. There is a scene in which Mary sees Jesus struggle and fall with the cross and the camera flashes back to Jesus falling as a child where Mary runs after him to try and SAVE him but the dichotomy is He is being put on the cross to save her and all of us. Some reviewers have likened this to a manipulation of guilt I honestly don't feel this was Gibson's intent but more so to make you understand Christ was born in the exact time of the most barbaric civilization ever. What better group of people to put the sins of man for all times on Christ after all he died and was separated from God his Father because of sin more than two thousand years of humanity's sin put on the body of a sinless man and you don't think its going to be brutal, violent and hard to watch WITHOUT feeling remorse or guilt. These samepeople can't get passed how brutal it was, but would watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a second. The realism is he was tortured for our sins. Is it easy to watch I would hope not. Does this stir your soul beyond its Catholic teaching in a realistic way? Absolutely ! The film is beautifully portrayed and seems realistic of the times. This film has ruined my entire family for any other so called Hollywood films. We even turned our satellite service off because we do not want to waste our time on secularism. Anyone who says God wouldn't want Christ depicted in this way because its to violent or not the overall character of Christ please explain to me why there is so much violence in the Bible and again no it does not depict Christ's character entirely this film was meant for those of us who already know the whole story. Christ's death and resurrection is just the beginning. Please avoid the negative hype and realize there are forces that don't want you to see what Christ accomplished through his death and resurrection. To say that it is to violent you would have define violent to me because of so many other just utterly grotesque films people would flock to the movie theaters to see, and the blood yes there is blood remember the old hymn there is Power in the Blood. Its sacred !  <br />

I love the part when Harry talks to Ron for the first time in the train and they feast on the delicious & very yummy sweets.  Tempting, isn't it?  If only we could eat all of those candies without worrying about diabetes, our teeth, & sugar intake.  Sigh!
0385510454|4.0|Nice unhurried character development and a perceptive insight into the more laid back European lifestyle. Action thriller fans won't like it,  but for those who want a tale with less violence and a little more realism, this is it. <br /> <br />IMO Grisham is not a fan of slam bang action type fiction.  Now that he's accumulated more money than he'll ever need with his legal thrillers, he can indulge in more of the character-driven writing he enjoys.   This can be seen starting in 2001 with A Painted House, followed by Bleachers, and The Last Juror. These stories feature real people dealing with plausable realistic situations. The Broker, with its suspense theme, is a swing back to the \\"old Grisham\\" but even here we don't have the full action thriller mentality.
B0002V7OI8|3.0|The only interesting thing I noticed about the two meteorite disaster films that came out the same year, DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON, was how they differed.<br /><br />(I didn't see either one in a theatre since just about everyone told me that, if I saw the trailer, I saw the coolest parts of both movies).<br /><br />ARMAGEDDON is a meteorite disaster flick from a guy's point of view.  The underdog rascals are sent into space to destroy the meteorite after much testosterone antics and posturing.  The chick (Liv Tyler) is hot.  It's a cowboy enterprise.<br /><br />DEEP IMPACT is the same movie but from a woman's point of view.  The world is about ready to end, but Tea Leoni tries to come to grips with her troubled relationship with her dad.  People hug, make sacrifices, deal with emotions.<br /><br />To be honest, I liked DEEP IMPACT better.  Even though it was the more laid back of the two, it was also more thoughtful and interesting.  But that ARMAGEDDON opening did kick butt.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great CD. It has some very meaningful songs and some really catchy songs. If you own some of their older albums \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Insomniac\\" and are expecting something like that you won't get it. This is a very different album. But still really awesome. The layout. <br /> <br />1. American Idiot: The title song naturally very good. Catchy and meaningful. Political. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia: Really long song which is made up of about 5 songs inside it. Pretty good though. 4/5 <br /> <br />3. Holiday: My absolute favorite song on the album. It rocks. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams: Another great song but in a very diiferent way. Was a huge hit. Still is. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting: Reminds of that P.O.D. song \\"Youth of the Nation.\\" But that ones alot better. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy: If you can actually understand what there saying it is really good. 4/5 <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine: Not that great. Not much to say about this song. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel: Very short. Very Weak. 2/5 <br /> <br />9. Extraodinary Girl: I usually skip this song because it's not the usual catchy Green Day song I like. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb: Another political song. No where near as good as \\"American Idiot\\". 3/5 <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends: I'm pretty sure this is also political. Even if it's not I like it. But doesn't sound like Green Day. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />12. Homecoming: Another really long song with 5 songs inside of it. Except one of the songs is sung by Tre Cool (the drummer). 3/5 <br /> <br />13. Whatsername: No good, no need to even listen to it. 2/5 <br /> <br />All in all this album kicks. When I say a song isen't that good I'm comparing it to the other songs on the album. Not to all other songs. So really it could be very good. It's just all the other songs on the album might be better. I that this all helped. American Idiot is a difinate buy. <br /> <br />
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Lets face it folks, Cannibal Corpse have been making the same album over and over again for years each one with ridiculously over the top gore loving lyrics (Sanded Faceless), mad drumming, George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fischer's drano insano gargling and conjoined triplet guitar/bass riff attack.  Variety wasn't their strongpoint and casual fans may have had as much difficulty discerning the differences between albums as non-zebras would have picking one zebra from another.  Cannibal Corpse doesn't stray from their tried and true formula on the Wretched Spawn, but this album is a standout.  The guitars are more harmonically adventurous, the songs more intricately structured yet punishing, not to mention fast.  The sound is just more brutal than on most of their previous albums.  And how about those song titles?:  Rotted Body Landslide, Severed head Stoning (kind of redundant I'd say), Blunt Force Castration (youch!).  I didn't think they'd be able to top \\"Gore Obssessed\\", my previous favorite, they have.  But like the title of their song \\"Nothing Left To Mutilate\\" implies, how much longer can Cannibal Corpse go on without running out of ideas?
B0002X314C|4.0|Here is an artist that is poised to take over the R& B genre, (which is sorely lacking right now) He has a mature sound that carries you along with what he is trying to say. I expect bigger and brighter things from this man. The only bad thing I can say about this CD is that it can sound a bit too gospely at times.  (I guess we can figure out where he honed his skills at.) Other than that I really enjoyed this CD
0792839730|2.0|This film plays the British Airborne in a very poor light. <br /> <br />They were the most Elite soldiers of WWII sent to do a very risky and dangerous job. However, due to American incompetence(the U.S. Airborne couldn't even take the lightly defended bridges that would let British Tanks go through and support the British at Arnhem) the mission was a failure. <br /> <br />The troops at Arnhem held out for 3 days against an enemy with tanks, artillery, mortar and the works and still managed to kill more Germans than Germans killed British.  <br /> <br />But just remember - the 82nd and 101st Airborne are not what they make themselves out to be. My granpa told me this and I believe him and I have no doubt that they caused the failure of Market Garden.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|If you love children, if you love playing make-believe, if you love live theatre, if you love fairy tales, if you *are* really Peter Pan at heart, then buy this DVD.<br /><br />This picture had me by the heartstrings from the very start. The casting for this story was as superb as the acting that delivered it. You will laugh and you will cry. You will love this film.
B0007QJ1N4|3.0|It's a decent album. There is a noticeable difference in the band since Nick's departure. As previously stated, the rawness is definitely gone, and to me, that's disappointing. I liked the punk rock/chaos aspect of Nick on previous Queens albums. He added to the diversity that has made Queens so successful. <br /> <br />Josh and Company still make a good record, it's just not exciting anymore. For instance, the opening track with Mark Lanegan feels less than inspired. That really set the tone for the rest of the album for me. If you own the other albums then you'll probably buy this one too, just be forewarned that the band sounds different, and not necessarily in a progressive or positive way. <br /> <br />I guess nothing lasts forever, and that's too bad.
0440237688|5.0|I read this book when I was in elemetary school and again in high school. I bought my own copy after reading it the second time. This is a great book for all ages. <br /> <br />The story is set in a world with no pain, war, color,love, or emotion. When children reach a certain age, they are given jobs chosen by the elders. Jonas, the main character, is chosen to be the \\"receiver.\\" His job is to receive all the memories of things like color, snow, cold, war, and love; the memories that no one else in this little world know. The question the book raises is, Are the good things in life worth the pain that comes with it? Read it to find out what you think, and what Jonas decides. <br /> <br />
0743246616|5.0|I'd seen the first Magnolia cookbook in a friend's shelf for awhile now and even though she'd never bake anything from it (she never uses them, just collects them), I'd been wanting to do so for a long time so on a whim, I ordered both books. I just received them two days ago and already I have tried THREE different recipes from this one. Yes, it is a bit much but after the first one, my family begged me (they didn't have to, really) to keep on trying more stuff. Even though I haven't baked extensively from it yet, I'm an avid baker and have the feeling that most of these recipes will turn out amazingly well as they look and sound positively delicious. And well, millions of customers at the bakery can't be wrong, these really are good desserts! <br /> <br />The recipes are varied and all use fairly simple ingredients (no running around for exotic stuff at the last minute). The directions are very simple and almost any level baker will feel totally at ease following them. Add to this that she begins by giving a few really basic pointers (just in case you need a few more moments to familiarize yourself with the kitchen) and you got a very comfortable starting point to a great baking experience. <br /> <br />On the downside, I guess I could've used a few more pictures of the finished products but honestly, the book was good enough to more than earn my 5-star rating. These are simple, home-y, old-fashioned, mostly high-cal desserts that will probaly bring you fond memories of your favorite baker, be it your aunt, grandma or in my case, my mom. A tradition I definitely want to follow in this day of cutting time in favor of convenience. This really helps! An amazing book... a new favorite of mine and one I definitely plan to keep on using.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland is a marvelous, magical movie that celebrates the inner child in all of us. The entire cast is superb, but special mention has to be made of Johnny Depp's performance. His interpretation of this character is simply magnificent to watch. Passionate restraint and unbridled imagination all wrapped up and delivered with a seemingly effortless Scottish brogue. Depp has created some of the most memorable movie characters over the past 15 years ~ Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco, Raoul Duke, Capt.Jack Sparrow, Agent Sands & now J.M. Barrie. His versatility is limitless. Treat yourself & your loved ones to this heartwarming movie that hits all the right notes ~ impeccable acting, glorious visuals, flawless musical score and a lead actor who is clearly at the top of his game.
0385512058|3.0|I am not a natural networker, so I found nuggets worth having in this book.  I would recommend it to people who regard themselves as unproductively reticent.  Many of the other reviews recount the book's strengths so I will focus just on my reservations. <br /> <br />1.  Perspectiveless <br />Mr. Ferrazzi is wildly enthusiastic about the chance to meet people and sign deals.  To most businessmen this is just a start, however.  Good business starts with moments like this, but then goes on to substantial accomplishments.  These accomplishments are invariably complex, as it requires addressing the needs of customers, employees, shareholders, fellow executives, creditors, suppliers and others.  None of this comes into play in \\"Never Eat Alone\\".  I can recall one sentence that acknowledged that a well-connected life can include complications like a spouse or child.   <br /> <br />2.  Inconsistent  <br />An earlier review mentioned this point.  Let me just confirm that I too found some of the authors positions in conflict.  Mr. Ferrazzi comes very close to admitting getting burned out (who hasn't?) and finding relief in getting away (evidently to a meditation retreat, although that wasn't clear).  It seems hard to reconcile that to the chapter entitled \\"Balance is B.S.\\". <br /> <br />3.  Sometimes vague <br />This criticism is completely untrue of the first two-thirds of the book.  However, having repeated himself rather often in that fraction, the author seems to have run out of concrete details in the last third.  For example, in a late chapter he enthusiastically endorses mentor/mentee relationships.  That seems very plausible, but it is unclear what is meant by the term.  Does mentoring involve meeting with a young person once, twice, or regularly over a period of years?  Much of the first part of the chapter revolves around Mr. Ferrazzi's relationship with his father, which is something more than a mentoring relationship.  Then focus shifts to how he met his first boss/mentor, but that has only one paragraph that extends past the process by which he was recruited to his first post-MBA job.  <br /> <br />4.  Sometimes unfair. <br />The last chapter considers the question, \\"What is my legacy?\\"  Fair enough.  In response to a challenge in the last chapter, most people over the age of 40 will find it easier to recall the names of any three civil rights leaders than the last three CEOs of a large corporation (IBM, Wal-Mart, GM).  But it is illiberal ask for any three people from one group versus three specific people from another, to ignore the obvious media bias, and to then wrap it all into the now-sacrosanct aura of the civil rights movement.  Books designed to motivate should stay away from debating tricks. <br /> <br />If you, like Mr. Ferrazzi, are going to be the chief marketeer for a marketing company, then this may be just the book you need.  If you need perspective on how connecting with others fits in with your myriad other skills, look elsewhere.  But if you simply want advice on how to improve your ability to network, then this fits the bill. <br />
0385510454|1.0|I was really disappointed. I paid $16 for the hardcover and I feel cheated. After about 30 pages I could predict exactly how it would end, and I was right! I won't ruin it for you, but there is a common theme that started in \\"The Firm\\" that continues here.
0440238609|2.0|These three books start out well, the writing is interesting and the characters well developed. Then it gets thicker, and as I read into the third book, I was sure these books are not something I would recommend for children at all. in fact the minimum age for these is probably the teen years.  There is a lot of frankly anti-religious boilerplate going on here. Whole portions of the third book I felt were rants about religion and the authors personal take on it. Not any religion in particular.  God is old, useless and has been supplanted by another being who has only the worst in mind, and this is the resolution.  I would want my children to read something that won't capitulate them into the hopelessness that permeates the outlook here.  There is so much excellent literature, \\"Harry Potter\\" included, that is so much fresher, better written and lacking venomous screeds.
0345451325|5.0|I was very impressed with Eric Nylunds book, \\"The Fall of Reach.\\"  Going into the first chapter, I had many doubts, due to the fact that it was based on a video game.  However, Nylund creates a great story that is moved along with detailed characters and surroundings.  I liked how the book switched between John, and Keyes.  The reader gets to see great development in their characters as they move through training and battles.  One thing the book lacked in its style was the use of foreshadowing, and figurative language.  The book is very straightforward, but that makes it easy to understand.  Overall I was very impressed with Nylund's work, and i look forward to reading his other Halo novels.
0060512806|5.0|Better than Snowcrash.<br /><br />You might disagree that it's cyber, because it's not incredibly sci-fi.  It's more realistic- rooted in WWII and modern multinational internet business.  That's why it's better than Snowcrash.<br /><br />Snowcrash is a pimply immature teenager's cybernovel.  Cryptonomicon is for grown ups.<br /><br />As an avid reader, and a sci fi fan since I was 12 (now 31), this is one of my favorites ever.  When I was younger, it was Hitchhiker's Guide, Stranger in a Strange Land, Star Trek novels... later it was the Ender series (some of which still rocks)...<br /><br />But this blows them all out of the water in terms of scope, storyline, tech/geek details, realistic characters (lots of scifi writers have trouble writing realistic women), etc.<br /><br />And as anyone who loves to read can tell you, when you find a good book, you don't want it to end.  No problem with this one.  It's like 3 books worth of excitement, interest, length, breadth, etc.<br /><br />Both my wife and I have read it, and you definitely think it's the best book ever when you read it.  I've only reread a few books in my life- e.g. in this genre, Ender's Game, Hitchhikers, My natural reaction was to start over and read it again- but I had to let my wife read it. :-)
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I watched part of the Celtic Woman show on tv and thought it was fantastic! The 4 women have amazing voices, and the 5th, who plays the violin, is incredible! It made me get goosepumbs; I was unable to speak (especially on the song Nella Fantasia - that woman has the most beautiful voice in the world!) <br />On tv, the cd (or tape) is being sold at 75$. On amazon, it's at 13.99$. I'm going to buy the first AND second cd here and pay much less than I almost did for just one!! <br />Every single song on this cd is beautiful! It is worth every penny, and it's a great deal! I love it!
B0000028UK|5.0|I bought this album soon after \\"Ten\\"...honestly, I could never really get into \\"Ten\\" much. it was great album, but I had just heard the songs many times before picking it up...tho I still listened to it very often, which lead me into buying \\"Vs\\". <br /> <br />\\"Vs\\" was the album that turned me into a major pearl jam fan. from start to finish, this album is absolutly amazing! <br /> <br />\\"Go\\" is the greatest opening I've ever heard in an album, I cannot sit still while listening to it...it begins with a quick guitar-strum, moving into fast, pounding drum beats, with fast bass lines in the background, then quickly breaks in loudly. awesome drumming, awesome guitar, awesome bass, and quick Eddy-like rambling/shouting...nothing beats that!...next comes \\"Animal\\"...its just as great as \\"Go\\", IMO. then moving to \\"Daughter\\", which is great as well...ETC. <br /> <br />I'd have to say this is probably pearl jam's heaviest album...with songs like \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\", and the absolutly kick-ass \\"blood\\" (gotta' love that 11 second scream! :D). but its not just the heaviness that gets me...\\"Elderly women behind the counter in a small town\\", \\"Daughter\\" and the amazing, dark, and mysterious \\"Indifference\\" definatly caught me as well. but don't assume I'm saying these are the only good tracks you'll find here, I worship every Pearl jam album there is, and most especially this one. <br /> <br />soon after hearing this, I bought everything else by PJ, which are all very great, indeed...and also Temple of the dog's album, and eventually leading me into buying the soundgarden albums that I didnt yet have...and I'm satisfied. and Yes, Pearl jam are my favorite band (all because of this album right here. :D).
076790592X|5.0|I read this book at a time in my life when I needed a bump.  It talks about life lessons, Love wins- love always wins. I also think that if you like this book, you will like Bumper stickers by Bob Meehan.
0441172717|5.0|<br /> When you read something this good all you need to say is \\"It's a great book,\\" that's all. This is one of those books that you wish it would never end, but unfortunately it does, but then you get to read the sequels. This is Frank Herbert's masterpiece that started a saga and turned into several movies. <br /> The story is about young Paul Atreides (son of Duke Leto Ateides) and his family who are moving to take control of the planet Arrakis also known as Dune. Dune, however, is not a normal planet, it is all desert and is the only source of \\"spice,\\" the life blood of the human race. While on Dune they must overcome the Harkoneans, a noble house that will do anything to gain power. <br /> Over all this is one of the best books I've ever read and definitely the best sci-fi I've ever read. This is truly a master piece more than worthy of Frank Herbert's name. From the amazing story and great detail and description this is an astoundingly interesting book one you should read even if you don't like sci-fi.    <br />
B000060OFT|5.0|This movie has it all. It has all the romance of Romeo and Juliet into a modern day version. With tons of Romance and alot of fight scenes this movie is one to have on the shelves!!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This was my first time experiencing \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\".  My mom owns the tape of the original stage version with Crawford as the Phantom, yet I hadn't heard this amazing music before now.   <br /> <br />I'll basically explain the story in modern day terms: a deformed man trains a young girl to sing beautifully, then falls in love with her.  Then she basically gives him a one night stand in his lair and runs off to marry Raul, her childhood sweetheart.  The Phantom was the real victim of this film, no matter how evil and disturbing he acts.  Gerard Butler, who was in a rock band and starred in smaller roles, brings the Phantom alive in this film.  In my personal opinion, he does a better job of portraying The Phantom then Michael Crawford did.  His singing may not be great, but it's the emotion in his voice that will literally hypnotize you.  You feel the tremble in his voice when he's sad, the anger when he's enraged, and the romance when he's sensually trying to whoo Christine.  Speaking of her, Emma Rossum gives a great performance as the star of the opera.  Her voice is amazingly beautiful.  Raul was the one I hated most in this film.  While his voice is amazing, the character seems like an arrogant punk compared to the more adult Phantom.   <br /> <br />The film itself left me speechless all the way through.  It's obvious that The Phantom was supposed to be the real star of this film, and that doesn't bother me at all.  In my opinion, he's a character people can relate to.  The sets and wardrobe were all just amazing. <br /> <br />Basically, check the film out.  It's worth it and I think it's one of the greatest films I have ever seen!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I'm not about to stand up on my little soapbox here and proclaim the first Matrix film a triumph of science fiction that radically altered all subsequent movies in the genre. Well, I'll say that but I won't take credit for being the first schlep to recognize this blatantly obvious fact. Even a chimpanzee waking up from a five-year coma knows the Wachowski brothers revolutionized the concept of the thriller with this exciting film. The fact that they--the Wachowski brothers, not the chimpanzee--pulled it off in spite of casting boat anchor Keanu Reeves in the lead role made the coup even more exhilarating. Yep, \\"The Matrix\\" is an experience I rarely tire of; I can watch the movie over and over and always get something new out of it. That is why I came away with a heavy heart after watching the much anticipated sequel, \\"The Matrix: Reloaded.\\" Where the first film oozed originality, the second sinks under clich&eacute;. Where the first developed interesting characters the viewer came to care about, the second dumbs them down into cartoon caricatures. Where the first achieved a balance of action and philosophical musings, the second resorts to over the top acrobatics and nonsensical mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />We learned at the end of the first film that Neo (Boat Anchor) realized his destiny and could now destroy the matrix at will. Why the need for a second film? Beyond the idea of Hollywood cashing in, I can't say. Sadly, I have a tough time recalling the intricacies of \\"Reloaded.\\" I remember Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) orating to the assembled masses in the underground city of Zion in a series of scenes that had me laughing hysterically one minute and feeling embarrassed for the actor the next. What follows is even worse: some sort of extended slow motion dance number involving all the residents of Zion spliced together with a touchy feely love scene between Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). It's reassuring to know that when the fate of humanity hangs in the balance everyone turns into a hoofer. Gimme a break! Then the movie introduces us to some other characters, primarily new crewmember Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), a former associate of Morpheus named Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis), Persephone (Monica Bellucci), the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), and a bunch of other folks. Watch the movie if you want to know what these people do. My response to their various onscreen activities was a resounding \\"Who cares?\\"<br /><br />By the time I slogged halfway through this film, I began to wonder if the Wachowskis were pulling a subtle prank on us. \\"Ahhh, this must be a parody,\\" I thought. If it isn't it should be. Everything we saw in the first picture reappears here pumped up on steroids or is the exact inverse of things established in the first film. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns in all his teeth gnashing glory, but the movie eviscerates any threat he once posed. Remember in the first film when we learned that agents were dreaded figures to face in combat? In \\"Reloaded\\" everyone lines up to take a crack at these guys. So much for any sense of menace. Trinity also presents a significant problem. A tough, gorgeous, no nonsense chick in the first film, she now turns into a weepy, doe eyed woman who follows Neo around like a puppy dog. It's simply infuriating to watch. Fishburne put on so much weight that he evokes painful images of Steven Seagal as he lopes through the action sequences. Need I go on? O.K. I roared my head off when I noticed Cornel West playing one of Zion's councilors. Talk about unbelievable! Any society that puts this nut job in a position of authority is doomed to destruction! And so it goes, one ridiculous scene after another. What a disappointing--and painfully long--sequel.<br /><br />I know it sounds like I hated every aspect of \\"Reloaded.\\" I hated most of it, but I did enjoy a few things. The action scenes, while totally overdone to the point of self-parody, were entertaining. I would definitely watch the chase scene on the highway again, and I liked some of the fight scenes between Neo and Smith as long as I didn't look too closely. Unfortunately, I looked too closely. Notice how the graphics look like a bad video game in the big showdown between the Smith clones and Neo. I'm sure fanboys have a quick retort to that comment, but I don't want to hear it. That particular fight ultimately stunk and that's that. Outside of the action scenes, it was nice to see Gloria Foster reprise her role as the Oracle (she soon died and her role went to someone else in the third entry), and the idea that the machines are launching a massive assault on Zion and will be there in 36 hours is a neat touch too, helping to add at least a modest amount of suspense to the proceedings. But the parts can't save the whole, and \\"The Matrix: Reloaded\\" on the whole is an overblown, lumbering beast sinking under its own stinking weight into a pit of abject banality.<br /><br />Another positive about \\"Reloaded\\": it ends and \\"Revolutions\\" begins. The third entry, although suffering from some of the same flaws found here, is vastly more entertaining then this scattershot effort. The special effects found in \\"Revolutions\\" will blow your mind, the mumbo jumbo fades into the background a bit, and some real suspense unfolds. Too, Morpheus foregoes any attempt at public speaking. I think \\"Reloaded\\" might have succeeded if everyone involved sat down and just admitted they should make an effects heavy actioner. There wasn't any chance of topping the original, so why masquerade nonsense as deep thought when all you really want to do is blow stuff up?f-parody, were entertaining.

B00000IMTF|5.0|This definitely is the best album by rainbow. Dio sings fantastic on this album(ofcours he always sings fantastic) and the guitarsolo's and keyboardsolo's are great. The album kicks off with 'Tarot Woman'. That is a really good song. It starts with some mysterious keyboard play, and then you slowly hear the guitar becoming louder and louder, and then it breaks out. Great start of the album. Then 'Run with the Wolf', good song too. And at number three you get to hear 'Starstruck'. Another very good song which had been a great hit. So the first three songs are very good, well, it will only get better. <br /> <br />'Do you close your eyes' is good, but all the other songs on this album are better. After that one you get 'Stargazer'. That is definitely the best song on the whole album. I think it's even the best song of all rainbow-songs. 'Stargazor' is just magical. The song always gives me chills and I think it is THE highlight of this album. This album is THE highlight of all Rainbow's albums. I can't really explane more how I feel about 'Stargazor', it's just such a fantastic song. <br /> <br />The last song is 'Light at the Black'. Good song, and the guitarsolo and keyboardsolo are fantastic. So as you can here, this surely is the best Rainbow-album ever. I wont be the only one who will say that, just look at the other reviews and see. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B00000JCOV|5.0|This has got to be my favorite album ever. period. i can't stand it when people don't recognize good talent, and thankfully most of you have not with slipknot.  Every single track on this album kicks your ass, although i would agree with some that the Iowa (their second disc) was less... intense, it's still a decent disc as well.  anyway, if you truely love metal, you should love this album.  The vocals... wow... probably the best i've ever heard, so unique and varied unlike MOST heavier bands, i don't know about everyone else, but i really enjoy it when someone's doing a bit more than just screaming full blast into a mike non-stop for a whole song.  The drums are simply amazing, the 3 drummers give you an almost tribal vibe.  Mick and James' guitar work may not impress many of you, understandably.  Most of the riffs are simple, but, they do the trick, and sound exellent with the drums and corey's vocals... meshing 9 musicians together never sounded so great.  And this is how slipknot is meant to sound, heavy, pounding, insane, and just... great.  i feel sorry for those of you who can't see the talent in all of the members of this band... they're simply amazing.

B0007KTAU4|5.0|I have been listening to this recording for over a year when my daughter brought it back from France. I still love it - and I don't speak french. Carla Bruni's vocal style is very intimate, expressive, and so interesting to listen to. And the music is captivating in it's simplicity. The players add much to the telling of these songs with riffs that I still wait for. Sweet, beautiful work. <br /> <br />I understand that she is a popular model in France and this is her first recording. Gotta love the risk takers. I hope she continues recording. I'd buy her next one in a heartbeat.
B000001ELL|4.0|This is also known as Kiss' disco album. There are really only two songs that carry any sort of disco beat: \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" and \\"Dirty Livin'.\\" Everything else is pretty much straight ahead rock music.<br /><br />The highlights for me are Ace Frehley's contributions. \\"Hard Times,\\" \\"Save Your Love,\\" and an excellent cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"2000 Man.\\"  Even after his solo album, Ace still had some great musical ideas. \\"Hard Times\\" is probably my favorite Ace Frehley song of all time.<br /><br />Out of Paul Stanley's contributions, \\"Sure Know Something\\" ranks as one of his all-time best songs. The band saw its merits when they included an acoustic version on their unplugged album from the mid-90's. And as for \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" being badmouthed as a disco tune, it still holds its own today as a fan favorite.<br /><br />Gene had two strange contributions -- \\"X-Ray Eyes\\" and \\"Charisma.\\" While not deep lyrically (\\"I've got x-ray eyes, ahh; And I can see right through your lies, ahh \\"), I guess they fit with the Demon persona.<br /><br />Peter's track \\"Dirty Livin'\\" is okay, but if any song deserves the disco label, it's this one.<br /><br />Before you dismiss this as a Village People album, look at the time this originally came out -- 1979, the height of the disco era. Kiss was able to adapt with a mega selling single (\\"I Was Made For Loving You\\"), and stayed a top concert draw. It may not be their best album, but it's got some of what I feel to be Ace Frehley's best Kiss contributions.
B00008PW2D|1.0|One word \\"horrible\\". This season took all the characters out of there element. They are not sassy and cute anymore but old, alone, frustrated and depressed. This season was a total waste, it contradicted the whole Sex and the City theme of women being able to be as free as picky and as carefree as men! If this season was about men being 36 going on 37 nothing would have changed men would be free as birds still young, still on the hunt and no need to settle hence, Mr. Big the guy is practically in his 40's in the series and still won't commit to Carrie, but that's ok he's a man and still needs to get some things straightened out. In season five there is that constant reminder that woman at 36 going on 37 should stop fooling around and start getting serious. It was a complete dissapointment and made the sex and the city gals look like desperate old maids. So they have slept with all of Manhattan if they were guys it would be excepted!  <br />All those who think this season was GREAT get real, did you forget the name of it \\"Sex and the City\\"!!! Hello these characters are meant to test the waters, no matter how many dirty fishes the hudson river has.

0151008116|3.0|It starts out a little slow, becomes quite engaging, and ends quite brutally. I really quite enjoyed this book, but was left annoyed by the ending. I give the author credit for creativity but has anyone thought what Yann Martel MEANT by this work? Was it a choose your own adventure novel? I don't think it was. Consider this, Yann tells a story that is fun, frightening, and contemplative. It's a story unparalleled. We want to believe it simply for its excitement and uniqueness. At the end the possible \\"truth\\" is given. Its a horrid story, one I would not have chosen to read had I known. Its a more possible story, but one we don't want to believe. The author then leaves off by asking the question to the interviewers, \\"Which story do you like better?\\" They of course reply that they like the one with the animals better. Pi replies that \\"So it is with God.\\" I'm tired of a world of subjectivity. What's true for you is true for you, it just depends on what you WANT to believe, bla bla bla. Is the author merely setting forth his philosophy on God, that God is merely a good story and a nice thing to believe in so heck, lets believe it?  Whether its really \\"true\\" doesn't matter. I think I would have been more impressed had Yann Martel decided on an idea, that either God exhists or He doesn't and stuck to his guns. We need no more subjectives. We have enough.
0060930349|3.0|I came away from reading this book with mixed feelings, but I knew I would do that before I even started it.  I have read other Johnson books before, most notably \\"Modern Times,\\" so I knew that Johnson is a conservative, and I fully expected that point of view to be reflected in this book.  [...]    First, the positive.  Johnson is an excellent stylist, which of course makes him highly readable.  He has an astonishing ability to gather mountains of material and weave it into his narrative.  His narrative begins in pre-colonial days and ends with the Clinton administration.  He tends to overdo statistics a bit, such as detailing the increase in the numbers of bales of cotton produced in the pre-Civil War south, and when he does this my eyes start to glaze over.  Fortunately, these instances are relatively infrequent.  He also reveals interesting tidbits of trivia that humanize some of his subjects.  In some ways reading Johnson is as enjoyable as reading a novel.    However, when Johnson arrives at the twentieth century, he ceases  being a historian and becomes a polemicist.  Now I am not stating that Johnson does not have a right to his opinions.  But these opinions should be based on a responsible and thorough rendering of the facts.  This means that he has a responsibility to search for the facts as assiduously as possible, to present them to the reader thoroughly, withholding nothing relevant, and then give us his opinion.  Instead, on many occasions, Johnson presents as rumor and innuendo as fact, without any qualification, and he omits important facts.  He also engages in highly specious reasoning.  (...)    this is not to recommend against the book.  As I stated initially, it is an excellent read, and I have no reason to question the factuality of Johnson's reportage on earlier eras.  But the reader should be aware that when it comes to the 1960 election and everything following, Johnson may not be reporting all the facts.
1400043662|4.0|I am really enjoying reading this novel. I haven't read any of Murakami's other novels, but this one is hard to put down. Murakami's writing, while not sophisticated or erudite, is forboding and always keeps you below the surface, wondering how the adventures of Kafka and Nakata will end up. While the plot twists are sometimes farcical, for example Johnnie Walker the cat-killer asking for death, Murakami is able to weave a tapestry of suspense and redemption that keeps the novel going and keeps it believable. Through Kafka, he creates a reality not unlike the metamorphosis, in which the whole world tilts on its side and nothing seems real anymore. The only negative aspect I've found is making Kafka and Oshima talk like university professors. They seem to be too young to engage in such intellectual dialogue. But it's a great read anyway.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is HILLARIOUS in every possible way. Some people may not understand the humor, or to some people it may just not appeal to them, but either way this movie made me laugh until my stomach was raw. The whole concept of 3 teenagers being so obvlivious in a world such as this and so outgoing and uncaring about what other people think makes this such a hillarious and free spirited, watch it more than once type of movie. If i could, I'd give this movie 10 stars, this movie deserves a higher rating!
B00009P1O2|5.0|This concert has so much energy between queen and the audience, its  like the audience was puting on the show. The most amazing part of the concert in general is Freddie Murcery, in my opinion he is the greatest performer that i have ever seen. He has so much energy and emotion. Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are all excellent at what they do backing up Freddie. May Freddie REST IN PEACE and i hope he knows how much his music has made an influence on the music world
B00005S6K8|5.0|Please, please, please, whatever you do when deciding to view this film, try to forget everything you might know or feel about the earlier, 1954 production.  Do so because in this 1995 remake you have one of the most perfectly written romantic movies of all time. <br /> <br />Here is one of those once in a lifetime films wherein everything that could be perfectly spoken is spoken....perfectly.  Highest of kudos to the script writers; praise which would mean nothing without the very best levels of performance provided by these first-rate actors/actresses.  If you do nothing else during this movie, look and listen with the utmost attention to the delivery of lines---they could not possibly be bettered.  An added plus is the imaginative camera work which is nothing short of award worthy. <br /> <br />PS:  While I grew up with the original \\"Sabrina,\\" in this newer production I must have seen a completely different film than did a reviewer recently preceding me.
0671027573|3.0|I also give it an A- for being funny and witty. I picked this up right after reading Sarah's Child. Wow, how different the writing and the story but nevertheless very, very enjoyful. I'll be purchasing more Linda Howard books for sure!
B00006LLNU|5.0|There are few cd's that would prompt me to write a review of them and this is one of them. The music accomplishes what is sets out to do. Altering my mood it makes me feel good about life which is I think their main point or goal. A very high goal at that.
B0002IU988|4.0|Ok, so I never liked Creed that much (just the first album, kinda), but after listening to my fiancee's copy of this, I am pretty hooked.  Creed made a smart move dumping Scott Stapp.  Myles Kennedy is a real rock and roll singer with range, power, and emotion to crush Stapp like a bug.  He kinda sounds like a cross between Chris Cornell and Bono.  Oh, and he's from Seattle, which makes him extra cool. :) <br /> <br />This album rocks like the band never has before.  Mark Tremonti sounds like he's been listening to some Dream Theater, because he's built up his shredding nicely, and his playing is just generally better than ever.  \\"Find the Real\\", \\"Metalingus\\", \\"Watch Your Words\\", and the title track are just grade A kick-butt hard rock.  They slow things down a bit too, with \\"Shed My Skin\\", \\"Burn It Down\\", and \\"The End Is Here\\", and those are cool too.  There's a couple of songs here that kinda sound like wimpy Creed songs, but only a couple.  Most of this album is damn good. <br /> <br />Buy this if you like good old hard-rocking, grungy kinda stuff.  It's better than Creed for dang sure.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|but once it does, it doesn't let go. dark, hypnotic, mysterious, sensual & rockin. those naysayers who say \\"bring Nick back\\" need to get a life. Nick wasn't even on the first Queens record. this is Josh's band thru & thru and always has been. sure, Nick & Mark were a welcome addition to the group, but they have their own careers, anyway. so, 'Queens lite' this ain't. \\"Someone's In The Wolf\\" will put you on the far side of the universe. \\"Little Sister\\" is a catchy, tight little rocker, complete with a little woodblock for added effect. \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" almost sounds like My Bloody Valentine. \\"Broken Box\\" makes it feel like your ears are having sex. and \\"Burn The Witch\\", with Billy Gibbons' (ZZ Top) guitar is worth the price of admission alone. don't compare it to past records. it stands on it's own. let it sink its teeth in.
B000000WCA|3.0|I wouldn't say this the best album of Spice Girls, but it certainly is not the best. Some of the songs are kinda weird, if you know wht i mean... It's just so, weird. But of course some of them are very nice, such as wannabe, 2 become 1, mama, etc. So if you buy it, good for you. If you don't buy it, it's not a big lost, after all...
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|This album is great. It grows on you the more you listen to it. In my opinion, it's better than Songs for the Deaf, and much much better than R (which I thought only had a few good songs). This album however is a great overall album - good songs the whole way through. Especially tracks like 'Everybody Knows That You Are Insane', 'I Never Came', 'Medication', and 'Someones In The Wolf' for which there's a film clip on the bonus dvd (in Australia). I think this album is a little darker and more melodic, which is a good thing in my book. It's also sounds more like their classic self-titled album (I need to listen to this new one a bit more before saying it's better than their first album, as it one of my all-time favourites). The absense of Nick Oliveri seems it will now prove what Kyuss fans have known all along that Josh is a very talented musician, as the first QOTSA album also proved (I'm not saying that Nick isn't very talented himself).
B000000WFF|5.0|Oh my god! I can't tell you how amazing this album really is, it's just very amazing! Loves it! This is probably the BEST album of Spice Girls. EVERY songs is amazing! It's just too perfect for words!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This unbelievable psychological thriller is one I won't soon forget. From the opening scene to the disturbing conclusion, I was completely engrossed. Beware though, if you have a weak stomach you may not want to watch this film. I personally have a love for movies of this sort and for me, the \\"gross\\" scenes are part of the ride! As I watched this movie my mind went in many directions trying to figure out who was responsible for the repulsive scenarios. But I was truly stunned when the villain was finally revealed. Utlimately, the thing I enjoyed most about SAW was the fact that the person responsible for the deaths was not even really a killer...he did'nt really kill anyone. He only set up scenarios where people would die trying to live! Disturbing, but D*mn good!!!
0380789019|5.0|I was hesitant to read \\"Neverwhere\\" only because I was afraid of being dissapointed after liking \\"American Gods\\" so much.  But I really think this was better.  It's exciting, a little disturbing and a lot of fun.  When reading \\"American Gods\\" Gaiman sometimes sounded like a British writer writing about America.  But in \\"Neverwhere\\" you can tell he knows London well, and loves it.
B00007LTIA|4.0|TFTO marked the period when Yes fell out of critical favour while losing the more pop-oriented fans they had picked up after \\"Roundabout.\\"  Yes were still filling stadiums and shipping gold records, but it was now to the hardcore progressive rock fans, and Yes gave them what they wanted, perhaps a bit too much of what they wanted on Tales, and this is coming from a major proghead!  In my opinion, Relayer is a better album because it is more concise.  Still, many fans drool over this over-the-top record and there's plenty to drool over!  Tons of long instrumental passages, virtuoso musicianship galore, grand symphonic passages.  Even the concept, execution and artwork are the epitome of prog.  Not one of these four sides though comes close to \\"The Gates of Delerium\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\" though, which probably says more about the strength of those pieces than any deficiencies in the pieces at hand.  \\"Ritual\\" comes closest for me.<br /><br />This record found Yes trying some very different sounds.  Rick Wakeman had some new keyboard tricks, a trend continued by Patrick Moraz on Relayer.  And how many Yes albums can you think of where hollowed-out logs and sheets of tin are used as instruments?  There are King Crimson-ish sections of harsh dissonance unlike anything else in the Yes discography, but plenty of melodic beauty as well.<br /><br />For those who still can't get enough, the reissue has studio run-throughs of sides 1 & 3, \\"Revealing Science of God\\" and \\"The Ancient.\\"<br /><br />Not the first Yes CD to buy, but a must for progfans.
0440237688|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book because it presented the idea of a eutophia and it proved that even perfect worlds are not perfect. I liked that the idea was original, and it is a great read. The book really makes you think about what life would be like if it were all so structured. I found the characters to be very well developed. Although I found the ending to be frustrating, I guess it's just because I don't like to wonder. But if you are looking for a great and easy read that will make you really be thankful for what you have in life, this is your book!!
B00005JLR8|4.0|For all its surface grittiness, this 2002 movie feels very much like a beatific fable, which I'm sure is the intention of \\"My Left Foot\\" director Jim Sheridan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten, based on his own life.  In fact, the movie's title doesn't feel literal but more allegorical, as America becomes a symbol for all the opportunities that have evaporated elsewhere in the world. The plot focuses on Johnny and Sarah, who along with their two young daughters, Christy and Ariel, have arrived in the United States in the early eighties from Ireland via Canada. After a dodgy border crossing, they end up in a large tenement apartment in Hell's Kitchen. We find out that they just lost a son and that the whole purpose of their moving is for Johnny to fulfill his dream of being an actor. Given their suddenly hardscrabble existence in New York, it does seem rather idealistic that he would not face any repercussion from his wife for choosing such an unstable profession. However, uplift seems to be Sheridan's agenda here, and luckily, the wondrous Samantha Morton plays Sarah with such honest conviction that the situation doesn't seem remotely contrived.<br /><br />There are the inevitable setbacks along the way, in particular, dwindling finances, a risky pregnancy, catastrophic hospital expenses and a crisis in faith. But random acts of kindness and sheer luck get the family through the darker passages of their existence, whether it is going to see the movie E.T. at the local air-conditioned theater when their own air conditioner breaks down, or Johnny vying for a much-sought-after E.T. doll at the arcade (a thrilling scene), or the girls meeting an unsuspecting savior in the form of an initially angry artist neighbor named Mateo. Secretly dying of AIDS, Mateo becomes an angelic figure to the family, and even though Djimon Hounsou is alternately striking and touching in the role, his dramatic transformation from anger to unmitigated joy feels much more like a plot device than an authentic change. It certainly doesn't help to have a saccharine scene of him making angels in the snow with the girls. But such lapses in credibility are forgivable given how Sheridan has otherwise created many small poignant moments that give the film a realistic edge making the immigrant experience come vitally alive. He also has the good sense to cast two wonderfully unaffected children as the girls - 11-year old Sarah Bolger plays the serious-minded Christy with her red camcorder, while seven-year old Emma Bolger is a bundle of sparkling energy as the sunny Ariel. Sarah Bolger, in particular, provides some of the most emotionally true moments in the film, whether plaintively singing \\"Desperado\\" at the school pageant or admitting that no one seems to recognize she lost something precious when her brother died. As Johnny, Paddy Considine bounces off the other actors effectively, but he remains the most cryptic in motive since his passion for acting is never really articulated with respect to his family. Relatively minor flaws aside, Sheridan has made an ultimately heartwarming film that perfectly captures family dynamics in a strange land.uch more like a plot device than an authentic change.

0062502182|4.0|\\"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"    The alchemist, by Paulo Coelho, is a story about a shepperd named Santiago who sets out to find his personal legend by chasing a treasure that he learned of in a recurring dream. By the end of the book, Santiago finds himself back where he started except that now he had realized that the \\"treasure lies where your heart belongs\\", and that the real treasure was the journey itself, the discoveries he made and the wisdom he acquired.    This novel forces one to question  the world's greatest lie ... that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.   It leaves the reader considering his or her  personal legend, and questioning whether or not they lost the ability to realize their dream because they gave in to the belief that it simply was not meant to be.     Coelho suggests that those who do not have the courage to follow their \\"Personal Myth\\", are doomed to a life of emptiness, misery, and unfulfillment.  Fear of failure seems to be the greatest obstacle to happiness.  As the old crystal merchant  confesses :  \\"I am afraid that great disappointment awaits me, and so I prefer to dream\\".  This is where Coelho  captures the tragedy of a man, who sacrifices fulfillment to conformity, who knows he can achieve greatness but denies to do so, and thus ends up living an empty life.    The novel is filled with symbolism, spirituality and cleverly disguised valuable life lessons such as ... to realize one's Personal Legend is a person's only real obligation  ... that there is no such thing as coincidence ... one must learn how to follow the omens left him and my personal favourite ... that the secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.     Frequent religious references notwithstanding, I enjoyed this novel.  More importantly it provided  a conduit for a inner reflective journey that was long overdue.
068987474X|5.0|I will never stay with a jerk again.  I realize from reading this book all the signs are there from the beginning sometimes.  Never had I encounted the type of guy who doesn't want sex until recently.  I thought he was just really nice and waiting because he really liked me.  After reading this I realized I was making excuses for the other jerk-like behavior he had been exhibiting the after the first 3 weeks (I wasted an additional 2 months).  Finally we have one of the guys telling us what they are feeling and that some guys are just too scared to face up to the girl they really aren't that into, but continue to see so they don't have to tell her they aren't into her.  This is a must read for all women dating that feel like they are doing something wrong.  It's not your fault and we all need to stop blaming ourselves.  I am buying this for one of my best friends so she can avoid the pitfalls I have had to put up with recently.

0684800713|3.0|This story is told by Jake Barnes a veteran of World War I. He is in love with Brett Ashley as are most everybody in the story. Jake was wounded during World War I which caused the love problems between brett and him. Pretty much everybody in the novel lives an aimless purposeless life. They are mostly heavy alcoholics and they claim that alcohol is used to ease the pain they suffered caused by the war. Additionally, they all followed almost the same routine every single day: wake up in the morning, work, eat lunch, meet friends, go to cafe bar, or club, get home, get drunk and go to sleep. This is what the sun also rises refers to, everyday the sun rises just as thier lives proceed. <br />This story is about the lost generation, and as the book goes along you can really begin to see how this generation was lost, thier lives lacked meaning which made the book somewhat of a slow read which lacked action. Although the novel lacked action, it contained a lot of meaning and hemingway's style was very enjoyable.
B0002DB52M|4.0|Though it is a long movie, it struck such a resonant chord. My wife and I moved from Los Angeles (pop. 7 million) to a town in northwest Arizona (pop. 250). We loved the country but suffered a malignant hostility, all too late, that clothed itself in righteousness. We created a fire department, we provided medical services, all volunteer. It was taken and used by this town with no thanks, but exploited. We could not understand the actions of the townsfolk or the lens through which they perceived reality. My wife is dead, my children are dead, and I live, very very far away from this town.
0783226063|4.0|The movie is a visual and auditory delight.  Once you have the DVD, find a friend with a really good home theater, turn off the lights and crank up the volume.  You're in for a treat - sort of.<br /><br />The plot jumps from major event to major event.  Those who've actually read the book will be able to follow what's going on, but everyone else is going to be a little lost.  When I first saw this movie, 20 years ago, I remember thinking \\"that was great!  Imagine how good it would have been if the scriptwriter had actually read the book!\\"  This movie looks like Lynch got his script by reading the blurbs off of various Dune dust-jackets.<br /><br />There are major plot lines thrown in for no apparent reason.  For example, a big deal is made out of Paul Atreides drinking the \\"water of life\\" in order to become the \\"universe's super being.\\"  And what does being the \\"universe's super being\\" get you?  It turns out that you get nothing.  The Emporer is conquered by Fremen riding Sand Worms and shooting imperial troops with \\"wierding modules.\\"  Paul is just another guy riding a worm and shouting deadly Arrakeen words at fleeing figures so tiny that they look like stick figures.  (None of that is in the book incidentally - Lynch apparently got tired of the movie and needed any excuse to bring it to some sort of an end.) The samething happens when Paul has to rope himself a sandworm and ride it around - no reason for doing something this stupid is ever given.  Until the climatic battle scene described above, no one rides a worm - they walk in single file with a rhythm and cadence that would make a battalion of Marines proud.  (If you've read the books you know why that's a problem.)<br /><br />The movie itself has a number of bloopers and those are always fun.  Watch Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stewart) when he announces that he's walked in on Paul for \\"shield practice.\\"  He hits the button on his belt for the shield, but nothing happens.  Apparently these erratic devices do this all the time, because no one notices.  Later, he gives the button a good slap and this time it works.  Must have to hit them just right...<br /><br />All that said, the movie is a classic, though imperfect, telling of a story too vast to tell in a single movie.  It would take something like Peter's Jackson's three movies breakout to even approach doing justice to this tale and, frankly, the audience base just isn't there.  I give the movie four stars for it's ambition and visual reach.  But do yourself a favor and read the book - you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more!ces do this all the time, because no one notices.

B0002NRQTS|3.0|After several albums of growing influence of synthesizers, Rush began reemphasizing guitars on \\"Hold Your Fire\\", \\"Presto\\" continues that trend.  The album, produced in a manner to emphasize the separation between instruments results in a clean sound, drastically different from the hazy synthesizer emphasis of the past few records. <br /> <br />The music itself, like \\"Hold Your Fire\\", has that feeling of transition, Lifeson's guitar sound is bulked up a bit, and there's quite a bit more variance in sound than there's been on the past several albums.  What I've always found mystifying about this one is that its got all the pieces for an album I should enjoy, but it doesn't hold my interest that well.  It seems to me that the bright spots on the album all occur within the first few songs-- \\"Show Don't Tell\\" is a great rock song with the most up front guitar on a Rush album in years, \\"The Pass\\" is bar none one of the best lyrics that Neil Peart has ever composed (and performed top notch by the band), with a great simple structure to the song, and \\"scars\\" is downright funky, they've toyed in this direction in the past, but to so overtly embrace it is stunning, and the title track is a great mostly acoustic song, the first of several great ballads on the next several Rush albums. <br /> <br />The rest of the material doesn't really grab me-- the band's looking for a direction, that much is clear, and they seem to have pursued a somewhat more pop route than the synth wash of the previous albums, this could be a response to cleaning the synths off the last couple albums combined with the rather separated production.  End result, songs like \\"Chain Lightning\\", \\"War Paint\\" (does have some great lyrics), \\"Superconductor\\", \\"Red Tide\\" and so on really don't feel like too much, maybe a bit too clinical. <br /> <br />Honestly, it may be worth the purchase for \\"The Pass\\", the song is entirely stunning, but the album itself is a bit too lifeless.
B0007G89G4|2.0|I am deeply disapointed by the reviews I read by the amazon editor.Giving wrongful information made me buy the dvd.Had I known this was in mono I would never of bought it! How can a movie filmed in 1986 and re-issued as the Deluxe Edition be in MONO?I also read a review of another on here who also said the dvd was in 5.1  I promise you it is in MONO!!! I for one will be trading my copy back into my favorite music shop.I am sick of the way the companies are re-releasing with no upgrade on the film itself, instead offering packaging or a booklet or a c.d. soundtrack!Give us collector's what we want,re-mastered picture and sound ( 5.1 ) anamorphic,extended,deleted scenes,commentaries,alternate beginings/endings  With todays technology no movie should be re-released without a minimum of 5.1 and the picture anamorphic!As a collector and owner of over 500 dvds my best word of advice to any new dvd enthusiast is to take your time buying and be very selective!The companies are playing games with us and it is time to let them know we are on to them. Put the releases out the first time with a standard edition and a special edition at the same time.This really upsets me, and this movie is such a great film but I refuse to keep any movie in MONO  I guess I'll have to wait..........
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Very 60s... but can you compare this to Polanski's work in the 60s? Polanski shows us what five star sixties movie should be like. Blow up seems to get a mention now and again by various reviewers in film magazines because it is has a sort of panache to it, a little art house movie that arrived smack in 1966, a dawn of an era, certainly a little cult item, but to be honest it is a great big pink elephant, becoming very arty more than thriller towards the final reels, I would not invest your time in this one as an interesting mystery, it isn't and most people liked it because Vanessa Redgrave and some other nice looking British woman take off their clothes for David Hemmings, that being about it. This is often tooted as Michaelangelo Antonioni's little masterpiece and there is much to like about it, but the truth is that the man is a nobody in terms of British or American cinema.<br /><br />I just can't help but say it was more than a bit dull at times, protracted, still is, probably more so because of its dated theme we have seen many times before, and since, in 1960 a little movie called \\"Peeping Tom\\" was made by a director Michael Powell, and I think that one steals this sort of show for me instead and Polanski did these themes a lot better, Blow up can be a bit more arty hype than anything else. Certainly see it before you buy it.
0735619670|5.0|An unusual pragmatic approach to software construction which closes the gap between the abstract/formal \\"state of the art\\" college textbooks and reality. <br />I wish I had come across the book after my formal education, because actually participating in a real software project exposed to the massive preassure and technical deadlocks can be somewhat of a shocker if you are used to small, confined and formal projects. <br />If you are an experienced developer, the book will ring countless bells and provide answers and reason to countless recognizable issues... if you are fresh out of college, prepare yourself for the real world with this, the only book in my experience, that unites de-facto real-world practice with the theory you're usually bombarded with.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Let's be honest: Radiohead were never an \\"albums band\\".  Even their most homogenous release to date, 1997's OK Computer, devolves into a series of anticlimactic murmurs and at least one recycled song from the A-side of the album -- no surprises means some seriously let down listeners.  Clever artistic choice?  That still doesn't mean I'm listening past track six.  So.  Now we get around to possibly the least surprising Radiohead album of all: Amnesiac.  Even the most unwavering radio-'heads were readying their counter-arguments to the protesting cries of \\"Kid B??\\", and the metallic atmosphere being rehashed through these vapid lullabies doesn't make it hard to decipher why.  Unfortunately, the legions of yes-men armed with blue Radiohead blankets are missing the real chink in the armor -- the fact that this is a collection of uninspired, uninteresting, and underdeveloped sleeping pills. <br /> <br />The record opens with a trademark weird sound (thank you, Brian Eno), before the monotonous hum of \\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\" buzzes by your head and is gone.  Wait, did someone just hear a Radiohead song?  Oh well.  But actually, just a moment -- the next sound to grace the record is one of the three tracks Radiohead has cut that could almost be called beautiful.  \\"Pyramid Song\\" is startlingly pretty, features some arresting lyrical imagery, and to put it in short terms, positively shimmers.  After that.... lights out, kids.  The show's over. <br /> <br />\\"Pulk/pull Revolving Doors\\" is that long-awaited song to us artistic purists: the Radiohead song that even die-hard fans can't say they like.  Approximately one sentence of this review will be devoted to the boring soulless ballads, \\"Paranoid Android\\" (Act 1) revivals, and hookless failed experiments that make up tracks 4 through 10 of this record.  We've been listening to this album for well over a half and hour and we're desperate for something to stick... and, thank God, it does.  \\"Life is a Glasshouse\\", along with \\"Pyramid Song\\", is one of the two good or otherwise memorable tracks on this whole piece, and is destined to have legions of fans crying \\"Look!  It's jazz!\\"  Aside from the fact that horns do not equal jazz, and Radiohead has never shown any penchant for a jazz influence, this is a pretty solid track.  The New Orleans funeral march is an interesting sound for these guys -- too bad they had to take a few more scattered stabs at it on the similarly hollow Hail to the Thief and ruin all the fun.  Meanwhile, those of us who like our avant-rock with a jazz twist are off listening to Talk Talk's Laughing Stock.  And no, that doesn't involve a wall of horns. <br /> <br />Goodnight, Thom.
034544678X|5.0|In just a month we will be bringing home a Golden puppy.  We have become aware that there has been quite a change in thinking about dog behavior and training since we trained our previous dog.  In order to educate ourselves and hopefully do the best we can for our new puppy, we have bought virtually every highly-rated and recommended book on the market.  I have spent the past couple of months reading everything in site, in hopes of finding that one person that we could \\"elect\\" as our doggy guru (because it's just too confusing to try and follow too many schools of thought).  \\"The Other End of the Leash\\" is the book that convinced us that we could stop looking, as Patricia McConnell was just what we were looking for.  We have since gone on to purchase most every book and video that she has made.  Her approach of explaining why dog's do what they do AND why we humans do what we do with dogs, makes her a unique standout in the field.  Not only does she give a big picture explanation, but she also gives specific training advice.  I'm glad we found her; I'm sure our puppy will be glad, too.
B00005JL78|4.0|...your future can be changed.  But don't doubt what you may be capable of doing.  This was what I got from this movie.  The idea of being able to identify people who will commit murders is an intriguing one.  What it would be like to live in a city where no murders take place? <br /> <br />Minority report is based on another one of Phillip K Dick's novels, a writer who had no technical inclination but great skill for using science fiction to tell very imaginative and human stories.  In this one, the Washington DC police force has a `Pre-Crime' dept, led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) who can see the most lethal of crimes long before they happen.  This, plus some obvious civil rights twisting, allows them to arrest the person they view performing the murder.  Things are not great as we are introduced to the characters.  Anderton is a good cop, a workaholic who is estranged from his wife because of the death of their son.  He is also a drug user, apparently it is some sort of drug that just makes him forget the world and leaves no trace affects. <br /> <br />The big problem comes when John goes into work and sees himself as a murder suspect through the same system that he has used to arrest so many before him.  This creates an obvious dilemma and Anderton is soon on the run, knowing that if he is caught, he will be put in status like everyone else without any sort of trial.   <br /> <br />Minority report is filled with imagination and explores the deep recessed memories of the characters.  The futuristic world is unlike many others, washed out with bright lights and filled with possible exploits of technology that could very well become real in the future.  Imagine an advertisement board that scans your eye to ID you and then uses your name in the spoken ad. <br /> <br />Spielberg makes a huge hit with this movie and makes up gracefully for the abomination that was AI.  This story moves at brisk pace and is chock full of his signature touches.  Cruise does a great jobportraying the troubled cop who looses himself in work by day, and does the same with narcotics at night, making it painfully obvious that he is not dealing with his own issues. <br /> <br />The movie covers a lot of ground has John discovers the truth as he tries to find out why he would be seen as a murderer to the `Pre-cogs'.  The movie is a thriller of the highest caliber and should not be compared with AI, even though it shares some of its look. <br />
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This album definitely has a more whimsical sound than that of its predecessors, but this is not a bad thing. Josh and his posse of miscreants have once again pulled together a nice album. Now all he has to do is cut his nasty hair.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Sky captain is an exercise in specific throwback story telling that most people can recognize right from the first frame.  There is no mistaking the film-noir/action-adventure/sci-fi genres that this movie so firmly holds in its roots.  However, stylish visuals and computer animation alone cannot hold a movie up. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong; Sky Captain is a decent movie, with great action and a sense of humor and fun.  It throws in many elements of old films and comes up with an interesting amalgamation of creative production value.  The story starts off somewhat normal; scientists are being abducted and Polly Perkins (Gwenith Paltrow), a brash and fearless reporter, is hot on the story.  As large robots attack New York City, the Sky Captain (Jude Law) is called in to defend the city.  Flying what looks like a Corsair fighter plane, he successfully runs off the robots but not before they have unearthed generators in the city.  As the story goes on, more pieces of the puzzle are put in place and the dangers become bigger and more menacing.  They discover that they must stop a mad scientist bent on a `New World of Tomorrow' domination scheme. <br /> <br />The technology and sci-fi aspect get so wild there is a large amount of faith put in suspension of disbelief.  I personally thought the 40s era approach and perspective on some of the technology was fascinating.  They found such simple ways to do complicated things.  But if you have no love for that kind of far fetched technology (planes that can go underwater, flying mobile airstrips) then you may hate it quickly. <br /> <br />The direction of the actors leaves a lot to be desired.  Despite the heavy hitters, Paltrow, Law and even Giovanni Rabisi, they obviously had a hard time trying to act in front of green screens (their parts were filmed against green screens first to have everything added later in the background with computer animation).  They do well in some parts but others they just seemed lost.  Overall they do well, considering what they are up against. <br /> <br />The movie is still a sight to behold and surely others will follow the example.  Director Kerry Conran is living his own dream and does a fantastic job of pulling out one fantastic fantasy visual after another.  He obviously has a soft spot for the Wizard of Oz as well, which becomes very apparent, as the heroes get closer to the finale.   <br />
0440213525|5.0|This unpredictable thriller will leave you thirsting for more. After Mark witnesses a nasty suicide and is told a deadly secret, he's swarmed by FBI Agents and, of course, the Mafia. <br />Pressured by the agents, Mark wraps up a plan with his lawyer, Reggie love. Now Mark is forced to spill, but comes up with an idea so crazy it'll keep you turning pages. I would definitely recommend this book to a peer, one that's ready for a good old thriller.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Let me start off by saying I had never watched this show until I started going to the gym during its time slot on ABC Family (I believe), so I basically saw bits and pieces of newer episodes some from this season. I finally decided to pick up Season One and that's how I got hooked! The relationship between Rory and Lorelai is what you wish you had, and the relationship between Lorelai and Emily is often what you get! Some say it's overwritten, but if I wanted reality TV, I'd flip over to The Apprentice.    This show is great! I ran out to buy Season 2 as SOON as the last episode of Season One was over...you just want to keep watching!
1591840562|4.0|The Art of the Start is a practical, easy to read, easy to digest book about how to launch a new business. The book is written by Guy Kawasaki, now a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who got his early career experience working for Steve Jobs at Apple Computer Inc. At Apple, Kawasaki evangelized the new Macintosh Computer and turned ordinary customers into fanatics. As founder and CEO of Garage Technology Ventures, he has formulated and tested his ideas and philosophies on real-world start-ups.  <br /> <br />The Art of the Start is a well structured book with many valuable, easy to implement tips that will assist and inspire an entrepreneur. Each chapters starts with a GIST (Great Ideas for Starting Things). The GIST sums up the essence of the chapter in a few points or a single paragraph. This is wonderful when referring back to the book a few months after reading it or for getting an idea of where each chapter is going before you read it.  <br /> <br />The key entrepreneurial issues addressed in the book are:  <br />* Positioning - Entrepreneurs must answer the critical questions of: why you want to start a business, why customers should patronize my business and why good people should want to work for my business.  <br />* Pitching - Successful entrepreneurs sell their ideas to others by getting a fast start, explaining their relevance and staying out of the detail.  <br />* Business Planning - Although very few people ever read an entire business plan, writing the business plan is still important as it forces a team to work together and formalize their intention. There are some components of the business plan that investors, recruits, and potential board members are really interested in and Kawasaki explains what should be included in these sections.  <br />* Bootstrapping - One of an entrepreneurs real battles is surviving the critical, capital deprived early days of any start-ups existence. According to Kawasaki they need to pick the right business model, makecash king and immediately get to market.  <br />* Recruiting - Recruiting employees for a hot start up is described as one of the most enjoyable tasks of an entrepreneur. In the process of recruiting, entrepreneurs should focus on three factors: (1) Can the candidate do what you need? (2) Does the candidate believe in the meaning that you are going to make? (3) Does the candidate have the strengths you need? (as oppose to the weaknesses you are trying to avoid).   <br />* Raising Capital - VC's want to know: Are you building something meaningful, long lasting and valuable to society? Kawasaki experience in the VC industry empowers him to make some insightful and useful comments about what funders really look for in a business idea.  <br />* Partnering - According to Kawasaki a good partnership as should accelerate cash flow, increase revenue and reduce costs. Partnerships must exist for valid business reasons.  <br />* Branding - Branding a start up is tough. Entrepreneurs need to focus on creating something that is contagious and infects people with enthusiasm. Branding is about community building.  <br /> <br />Some of these topics are more relevant than others for the South African entrepreneur. South Africa's underdeveloped venture capital industry means that the raising capital and pitching are not that relevant in our context but the discussion on bootstrapping and positioning in highly pertinent in the South African environment. South African entrepreneurs need to be positioning themselves to meet the needs of a defined market and in most instances they need to operate with minimal resources in a competitive environment so efficient bootstrapping is essential.  <br /> <br />South Africa needs a flurry of entrepreneurial activity and books such as this will empower people with the knowledge, insight and motivation to launch and grow new businesses and there by create jobs and grow the economy.  <br />
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I ran out and bought this as soon as I finished with season one. I can't believe I didn't watch this show when it originally aired. The relationships have made me laugh AND cry, sometimes simultaneously! <br /> <br />I love this season because of the arrival of Jess, and I really believe that he and Rory are meant to be. I know they don't end up together, but I can't wait to see what happens between now and then. =)
B0000214F0|4.0|See the title of this review to see what this movie is all about. Nuff said. If this is what you're looking for, then don't bother to read the other reviews. By the way, don't get the R-rated version of this film; you'll just be wasting your time and seeing a bad movie. Get the Unrated version. Nuff said.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Well, I am a Professor in Classics in the University and I really can't believe that so many people despise this excellent movie because \\"it is not faithful to the Iliad\\", or because it \\"is not historically reliable\\". <br />First of all, decide what you want: if you want history, you need to throw the Iliad out of the window, because Homer was definitely NOT historically accurate. If you want Homer, you have to get rid of history.  <br />Now, some short reflections. Speaking of \\"historical mistakes\\" with reference to Troy is  nonsense: the movie is inspired to a myth, and the myth is the result of  fantastic amplification and transfiguration of historical events. The Trojan war was very different from its poetical (not only Homeric) representations: as historians such as Moses Finley showed, it did not last ten years, but probably was  a series of short raids aiming at plunder. As a matter of fact, the post-homeric epics describe Achilles as a thug and the Myrmidons as a band of robbers, spoiling temples and abducting daughters of priests. Besides, at the time of the Trojan war the Myceneans were considerably impoverished in comparison with  the wealth of the previous centuries, and so they needed new lands to conquer and sack (as Pierre Levecque has clearly pointed out).  <br />Homer describes the Greek army as powerful and glamorous; he aims to glorify the heroes and their achievements, but after all the poet is a Ionic rationalist, and every now and then he lets us understand how brutal and ruthless these ancient warriors really were. And just as he is a Ionic rationalist, he seems not to take very seriously the Gods and their astonishing deeds, fascinating relics of an ancestral tradition which Homer remembered well but maybe could not completely understand himself.  <br />And now, some words about the so-called `unfaithfulness' towards the Iliad. First, the movie tells the whole story of the Trojan war and not only the subject treated by Homer (Achilles' wrath,Patroclus' death, Achilles'revenge); therefore, the screenwriter needed other sources, and he found them not only in Greek ancient poetry (post-Homeric epics, tragedy), but also in Medieval and modern literatures (Benoit de Sainte Maure's \\"Roman de Troie\\",  Christa Wolf's \\"Cassandra\\"). Besides, Homer was NOT faithful to the previous epic tradition (for instance, he denies Iphigeneia's sacrifice, or Achilles'stay in Skyros, two episodes which probably date back to a very ancient stage of Greek mythology) and later poets and writers were NOT faithful to Homer. They told the myth of the Trojan war in different ways and from different points of view. For instance, the authors of the Roman era (such as Virgilius, Seneca, Dracontius) show a deep sympathy for the Trojans (who were considered the ancestors of the Romans): they exalt Hector's courage and try to excuse Paris for his faults. During the Roman empire, the applauded rhetor Dione of Prusa (something similar to a modern TV anchorman) criticized Homer for his employ of the Gods in the action; besides, he said that Achilles was killed by Hector and the war won by the Trojans, and that the whole tradition on the matter was conditioned by the greek point of view. Later writers told about Achilles'love for the Trojan princess Polyxena, how they met in Apollo's temple where Paris treacherously killed the hero, and how she killed herself on Achilles'grave (Philoxenos).  And so on: the Greek myth is a perpetual work-in-progress. Any scholar in Literature should know this well.   <br />So,  Benioff's screenplay is  really a fine work, which elaborates quite a lot of sources with some personal touch, in order to adapt the myth to an antimilitarist and anti-imperialistic point of view.  <br />As regards the mise en scne, I loved the breathtaking battle sequences (especially the duel between Patroclus and Hector and the one between Hector and Achilles: the latter is nearly a homoerotic scene, with the palpable physical contact between the two heroes), the magnificent scenery (especially the palaces of Agamenon and Priamus, and the Greek camp), the accuracy in reproducing weapons and armour (notice that, just like in Homer, only Ajax fights in the Mycenean way, while Achilles and Hector use more recent tactics).   With regard to the acting: Brad Pitt/Achilles is awesome (he IS Achilles!), but also Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom  are very convincing in their roles (however, Bana, who acts the \\"good guy\\",  has got an easier job). Rose Byrne/Briseis plays her part very well, and Julie Christie gives as a present her delightful cameo.  <br />
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|After hearing \\"Take Me Out\\" on the radio, I bought this on vinyl and have given it a few spins.  I'm not disappointed but I'm not enthralled with it either.  This album definitely has its moments and shows a lot of promise.    The first single, \\"Take Me Out\\" is a fantastic piece of dance rock.  \\"This Fire\\" and \\"Darts of Pleasure\\" are also great songs.  Unfortunately, besides those three songs, there's not a whole lot that grabs me.  The album really isn't that bad, but it's not one that you'll look back on in five years and be saying \\"Now there's a gem!\\"  This record shows a lot of promise and I'll be looking forward to Franz Ferdinand's next album to see if they can improve on this record.

B000683VI4|4.0|I don't usually read or watch this genre, but I've been a Garner fan since *Maverick,* so I got me a big box of Kleenex and got ready for the flood. And it sure enough did. The romantic leads - young and old versions - do a fine job and the cinematography is gorgeous.  I'm not going to go through the whole summary - you can look above or below for that - but I just want to warn potential movie viewers that they might want to read the book - which I hear is pretty slim - first.  And skip on to the next review past this<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />I have just ordered the book to answer the following questions, which must have gotten lost in the translation to screenplay (1) How does Noah, former lumberyard laborer, who bought the Windsor Plantation with the sale of Daddy's old house & GI bill, refurbished with sweat equity, become a man of leisure prior to Allie's return? (2) Was Allie's Ice Queen Momma saying that that guy out there at the quarry was Allie's biological daddy?<br /><br />/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer
6305508550|5.0|When I was twenty four I had the most awful job and the most horrible boss in the world. I used to come home every night and weep tears of rage and frustration that my life had shoved me into this hideous corner ruled by an unpredictable, illiterate control freak .  She (sorry - this feels good - maybe I should let it all out) was one of those horrific people who is appalling at communicating and yet believes themselves to be a \\"people person\\". With a slight grasp of management speak  she would jumble metaphors and clichs \\"You've got to be on board about this\\" whilst gesticulating in a strange half-knowledge of body language intended  both to put me at my ease and to communicate her assertive demeanour. The  result was a stream of gibberish accompanied by contortions. It would have been amusing if it wasn't actually my life. <br /> <br />\\"Office space\\" was a source of enormous comfort. I mean- I was really bad at my job. What my boss lacked in communication skills I could match with poor organization and sadly this prevented me from feeling too hard done by. Peter, ,  - the main character in the film -is perfectly alright at his job. However  he is constantly chided by his eight bosses for putting the wrong cover on a set of reports. Attention to detail was never my forte. I'm with Peter all the way. <br /> <br />He works in  a cubicle surrounded by ghastly people. A woman with a really annoying voice. A strange sociophobe who has a weird attachment to his stapler. A dreadful boss who begins each sentence with \\"Hey, what's happening\\". American for \\"can we have a chat\\". Christ I'm glad I don't work in an office any more. His job is made tolerable (just) by  two fantastic mates - Samir a foul-mouthed Muslim who taught me some new ways to swear and a marvellous geek lumbered with the name Michael Bolton.. There's a love interest too: Joanna - the waitress at the local them ed restaurant (played by Jennifer Anniston). Just in case we wondered whether working in a restaurant were any better than in an office, Joanna shows us that she too is hostage to a moron boss, shoved into a hideous uniform and forced to wear stupid braces with badges on and supposed to charm the customers with non stop driveling banter to give them the \\"experience\\" they expect along with their burger. She's got a vile colleague as well-  brown nosing, back stabbing and irritating. <br /> <br />In a road to Damascus moment Peter decides that all he wants from life is to \\"sit on his ass\\". He starts to skive work, be rude to his boss and do flap all. But, the management consultants - brought in to do some routine \\"cutting out of dead wood\\" decide to promote Peter and sack his two friends. The boys create a computer programme to rip off the company in revenge and I shan't tell you any more in case I spoil the ending. It's great.  <br /> <br />If only the characters were less believable. Even the cultural differences couldn't stop me recognizing a previous co-worker in every single scene. Apart from the one I would definitely have copped off with  -a blond, sex-obsessed frat-boy, from whom I learned the phrases \\"take a ride on the bone rollercoaster\\" and \\"I'm gonna show her my O face\\". If you can't work it out watch the film. And if, after watching it, you decide that your life is imitating art it's time to sit on your ass. You never know - you might get a promotion. <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|People change ok. I have read some negative reviews on this movie where people seem to complain about how they prefer Jim Carrey to be `Jim Carrey' AKA the persona that plays the mask, Ace Ventura, liar liar, Bruce Almighty etc. Well I can't blame him for wanting to explore his other side, even if we, the public, prefer to have our funny bones tickled. What if, in his next movie, he played a violent rapist? Would we bitch and moan about how we want our friendly likable persona back, or praise him to the stars if he did a decent job? Who knows? Onto the film, I personally enjoyed it. To me it demonstrates how, when we our hurt by someone we care about, we see them in a wholly negative light, and if asked, we will rant about all their bad points. I know I've done it in the past. Joel gets severely hurt by Clementine. He then decides to completely erase her from his memory. Before the procedure he compiles a tape about his feelings for her. All are negative. About how he dislikes her for this trait and that trait of her personality. Only halfway through the procedure he realizes that she has many positive qualities about her and remembers all the happy and meaningful memories they shared as well as the bad. And since there is not one without the other he tries, in vein, to stop the procedure. To cling onto those precious, irreplaceable memories. I thoroughly enjoyed this film I didn't find it complicated, but it was certainly thought provoking. I recommend that you rent it first though. The supporting cast were excellent as well, especially Kirsten Dunst. Unfortunately Elijah Wood will always remind me of Frodo but hey, I wont pigeonhole Jim Carrey ever again.

B0006GAO3G|3.0|Elmore Leonard books have been around for a while.  I haven't indulged because essentially they are genre books, detective, gangster yarns.  However, they adapt nicely to film: Jackie Brown, and now Get Shorty. <br /> <br />John Travolta, Gene Hackman, Danny Devito and other Hollywood or gangster types give a modern characterization of sleazy schemers, fast sex, and money.  The gangsters are portrayed not unlike Hollywood producers or actors.  They are all ruthless and money grubbing.  Power and egotism is all that matters.  Life is cheap.  Yet this is a comedy, a satire.  Travolta is playing a parody of his Pulp Fiction character.  Danny Devito isn't very convincing as an actor though he is an actor.  Get the joke?  Here's the problem: it's funny at times, but in the end, nobody cares how cool Travolta is.  Nobody is sympathetic.  We don't identify with thugs and slime.  Call Sam Spade if you want something more. <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|Man, if it wasn't for Dream Theater, I don't think I'd have ever been turned on to prog. rock.  This album has a full storyline, kind of like some of King Diamond's works.  The band's musical talent is superior than most, if not all other bands out there, and they mesh sooo well.  Incredible sound, even their softer, more melodic tunes are awesome.  A Definite must-have for all prog rock fans.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|This was an okay movie.  The acting was great!  I think the actors played their parts well.  But the filming was choppy, and looked more like pieces of Napoleon's life mixed together instead of a movie where all of the parts blend into one big story.  The humor was also more memorable humor, and not the laugh-out-loud kind.  I actually find myself enjoying repeating Napoleon's lines more than watching the movie.  But the movie was unique, and there were a lot of characters involved, so things were at least decently interesting.  Overall, I recommend this to people who are looking for a different kind of humor than what is in the usual comedy movies.  My cousin also says that the movie is one of those that gets better every time you watch it...so who knows?  Maybe if I watched it a couple more times, I would like it better.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is about a professor and a student who have build a great bond with each other.  They have let the world know who Morrie is in his last days. This book teaches you life lessons. It shows you views on how to deal with death and just life itself. I thought it was a great book; it keeps you interested. It's intense at times but also very sad at other times. I would definitely recommend this book.
0792833201|4.0|The original tag-line of the movie gets it right: It knows what scares you.<br /><br />I have no idea how many times I have seen \\"Poltergeist\\" now, but it never fails to keep me entertained and it's never left me.  As much as I loved E.T. in the summer of '82, I spent the entire summer wanting to see \\"Poltergeist.\\" One Saturday, we four kids finally did get to see it.  My mother says she has no idea what she was thinking letting my youngest brother, who was 6 at the time, see it but these were the days of G, PG, R and X so PG seemed okay. (Warning, this movie would be a definite PG-13 today, no questions asked.  NOT for young kids.)<br /><br />It's interesting that so much of the things you hear about the movie are tangential to the plot: who really directed the movie, Hooper or Spielberg? Is there really a curse? Should the scene with the parents smoking pot have been included?<br /><br />First, I think Poltergeist was collaborative.  There does seem to be a lot of Spielberg in the movie with just a few hints of Hooper (I've seen both \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"'Salem's Lot\\" in the past few years and neither of them anticipates \\"Poltergeist\\" nor does any work Hooper has done since have any real cache.)<br /><br />The more I watch \\"Poltergeist\\", the more I enjoy it.  Here are some of the things I've always loved:<br /><br />--  JoBeth Williams! JoBeth Williams! JoBeth Williams! She is so good and so convincing in the movie.  I was young when I first saw it and Williams wasn't a huge actress at the time, and it only increased the reality of her performance. Some of the best moments in the film involve her character, Diane.  I also love the relationship she builds with Beatrice Straight's character.  If 1982 had been a less competitive year, I think JoBeth Williams would have been nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />-- I love how Beatrice Straight and her grad assistants represent the \\"rational\\": the sciences. The paranormal researcher aren't portrayed as cocky or ridiculous, just very determined until they encounter a force far bigger than anything they've ever dealt with before.<br /><br />By contrast,  we have the diminutive psychic Tangina (who has now become a pop-culture icon in her own right) who is the spiritual heart of the movie, representing the realms of the preternatural.<br /><br />I think what makes Poltergeist so good is not that it's horror-movie scary as much as psychologically scary.  As a kid, I think we understood the fears of the young children in the film because we all know of at least one person who was scared or clowns or the tree outside their window or the closet.  When I last watched this film, I saw the movie from the perspective of an adult and it's just as scary.  What can be more frightening to a parent than the abduction of their child? This movie just nails those fears.trayed as cocky or ridiculous, just very determined until they encounter a force far bigger than anything they've ever dealt with before.  <br />By contrast,  we have the diminutive psychic Tangina (who has now become a pop-culture icon in her own right) who is the spiritual heart of the movie, representing the realms of the preternatural.  <br /> <br />I think what makes Poltergeist so good is not that it's horror-movie scary as much as psychologically scary.

B0007QJ1N4|5.0|Wow, with Nick Olivieri gone, you would think that some of QOTSA's juices were gone, well they didn't lose a thing.  Sure with Nick gone, the yelling and hardcore screaming songs, which are good, ex. Tension Head, wouldn't be on the album, but it doesn't matter.  This is QOTSA's most \\"stoner\\" rock album yet. This is by far the best album of the year so far, and could be a candidate at the end of 2005. Here is a track by track review:<br />1.This Lullaby - Nice acoustic and nice vocals 4/5<BR>2.Medication - The answer to Feel Good Hit 4/5<BR>3.Everybody Knows That You're Insane - Wicked song, great chorus 5/5<BR>4.Tangled Up In Plaid - Tied for my fave song, amazing 10/5<BR>5.Burn the Witch - Billy Gibbons on guitar, all good 5/5<BR>6.In My Head - Out of Place on this album 2.5/5<BR>7.Little Sister - Okay, its to pop for me, the first single 3/5<BR>8.I Never Came - Best volcals on album 5/5<BR>9.Someone's In the Wolf - Tied for my fave on the album, an epic 10/5<BR>10.The Blood is Love - A tad long, but very nice 4.5/5<BR>11.Skin On Skin - Wicked song about S.E.X - 5/5<BR>12.Broken Box - Not My favourite, but still good, awesome when guitar kicks in 4/5<BR>13.\\"You Got a Killer...\\" - Major stoner song, which is good 5/5<BR>14.Long Slow Goodbye - Nice quiet track to end the album 5/5<br />My favourite songs are Tangled Up In Plaid, Someone's in the Wolf and You Got a Killer Scene.  Great album, the DVD is ace as well.  Buy it!
B0000640SB|5.0|I have owned this movie for two or three years, and I still watch it maybe once or twice a month. It is fast paced, very funny, and full of slapstick humor and cliche'd lines.<br /><br />Very fun, watch this.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|With the exception of the Uncle, it seems the entire cast was high on dope. Napoleon D-Man just huffed his way through the movie with the effort of a sleeping baby. The whole movie almost seemed to be in slow motion. His buddy Pedro was just as slow and stoned.<br /><br />There is no real plot, just a bunch of stuff thrown together, kind of like life. He's got a crazy motorcycle riding grandma, a web-chatting brother, an Uncle obsessed with 1982, and a Hispanic friend running for Student body president. The only time Dynamite uses any skill at all is his dancing skit which was quite good considering what the heck he was doing.<br /><br />Thisis a movie you may or may not watch once a year, and when it's over, you'll just scratch your head and realize anyone could make a movie, if this project actually saw the light of day.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This depression era period piece is simply a delight.  The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.<br /><br />That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win.  (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.)  But never mind.  The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.<br /><br />That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen.  Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996).  Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events.  O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing.  Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on.  Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance.  When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.<br /><br />One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot.  He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees.  With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.<br /><br />Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen.  He is one of those non-glamourous actors who is at the top of the profession.  It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off.  This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).<br /><br />This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer.  As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters.  But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor.  He was really that good.  (He did win a Golden Globe award.)<br /><br />And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick.  When the \\"Soggy Bottom Boys\\" come on with their \\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" it really brings the house down.  The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot.  And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: \\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\"!<br /><br />See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.le was much imitated. <br /> <br />Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen.

0689859368|4.0|I wasn't sure how to rate this book because it is wonderful for one audience, disappointing for another.  <br /> <br />I generally love children's books - Harry Potter and all that lot, you know. I expected another delightful fairy-tale-ish story suitable for both adults and children. However, the writing style was very plain and simple with a small vocabulary, and each book read like one short chapter of a longer book. I never forgot that I was reading a book made for children. Also, the main characters were a little bit irritating with all of their bickering - constantly telling each other to shut up. I suppose that is how it really is with siblings, but I didn't enjoy reading their arguments much. It had a nice plot, but again, very simple.  <br /> <br />That was for all you grown-ups looking for a fresh read.  <br /> <br />For kids, I expect this book would be marvelous. The illustrations are very good and plentiful, and the writing style is easy to understand and follow - just right for kids reading on their own. The fairy-tale creatures introduced are actual creatures they will have heard of (elves, trolls, hobgoblins), but with their own personalities for the story. The plot is original and complete; all the loose ends get tied up. I know I would have loved it when I was seven or so.  <br /> <br />Buy it for all your young relatives.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|Without wanting to insult anyone,I really don't get why this movie is rated so bad.I found it brilliant!The humour was great,the plot was very intersting too,and the special effects were state-of-the-art if you consider that this is a 90's fim.I also found this movie epic,having a friendly relationship growing between two guys that in the beggining hate each other,each of them being the star of the film on his own way.
0784010501|5.0|Shameless self-indulgence and self-glorification are the overall themes in this documentary of Madonna's life (using her Blonde Ambition Tour as an excuse); but you'll never have as much fun watching anything else. Watching 'Truth or Dare' is like watching a public flasher on the street: you can't believe someone would have the nerve to expose themselves like that, yet you can't keep your eyes off it and be intrigued. Despite the fact that Madonna comes off as a self-absorbed brat, she is never funnier than how she portrays herself here. Who knows (and who cares) whether or not this is the 'real Madonna'; after all, we'll never know the real Madonna. Whereas it would be the height of obnoxiousness to see other stars behave the way Madonna does in this film, for some reason we all seem just as willing to indulge her in her fabulousness as she is willing to. After watching this a few times, I would suggest that you fast-forward through the concert segments to get back to what the film is really about: the most notorious and infamous woman in history shamelessly basking in all her glory.
B000002MZ6|5.0|From the first listen I knew this CD would be one of my all time favorites from any artist. Normally it takes me a few times through a particular CD to kind of get what is being communicated in a piece of music. This one seemed to click right away for me. I think if a CD could get worn out by too many listenings, this one would be long gone. There is a strong electronic style to most of this work with various voice and instrument sampling and some really great bagpipes. Very space or sci-fi oriented.  <br /> <br />I would like to hear more like this album, but there is something to be said for variety. For example I also like his Voyager album about as much as this one, and it is completely different - Irish traditionals etc. on hand played instruments and no electronics. He's definately not in any kind of rut style-wise. And definately one of the great composers and musicians of our time.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|I'll be honest:  when I heard \\"Little Sister\\" a few weeks ago, I was less than impressed.  I was fairly apprehensive that QOTSA were going to take the low road and produce a substandard record to satisfy their pocketbooks.<br /><br />Not the case.  The band sounds better than ever, even without Nick Oliveri.  Some of the grit and off-the-wall strangeness is gone, and that's probably because they don't have Nick to open this album like he did on \\"Songs For the Deaf.\\"  However, what it lacks in rawness is made up for in creativity.  The songs are driving and unmistakeably QOTSA.  In an industry where these guys were once the exception, and then the norm, they've proven themselves once more to be a step above the rest.<br /><br />\\"Little Sister\\" is my least favorite song on the CD.  Songs like \\"Everybody Knows That You're Insane\\" are edgy and stay with you.  The \\"Wolf\\" (not sure of the exact title) song trails off, descends into some surreal noises, and comes blazing back for a finale, staying true to the QOTSA roots.<br /><br />All in all, a great album that won't leave my CD player for quite some time.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Haven't seen it yet (Of Course) but can't wait too! Johnny Cash was an American Icon weither or not you liked Country Music or not. I'm glad this movie was made just so more people can undersntad just how amazing this guy really was. Johnny Cash was no fluke.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I loved this movie!  When I first heard about it, I didn't have high hopes, but a couple of co-workers kept talking about it so much, I had to give it a try.  The writing is hilarious, the characters of Kip and Pedro are two of the funniest creations I've seen all year.  With all the remakes and endless sequels out there these days, it's nice to see fresh, original movies once in a while.  If Uncle Rico and his football video doesn't make you laugh out loud, then the 'Happy Hands Club' will!  Go out and see this great, unique film!  It takes a bit to grow on you, but once it does, you'll want to see it again!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie will definately become a Cult Classic!  My wife and I absolutely loved it.  In fact I am going to make it a part of my Movie Collection today. <br /> <br />VOTE FOR PEDRO!!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|step inside the wondrous imagination of \\"peter pan\\" playwright J.M.Barrie as his friendship with a special family inspires him to write his greatest work. <br />DVD includes deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes, a \\"creating neverland\\" featurette and much more. <br />all characters were played to perfection in this great film, definitely one that the family can watch and enjoy together!
B000000WA4|5.0|This Cd has to be one of Smashing Pumpkins greatest albums ever.  I hear a lot of you saying \\"It sounds like they just put this music on here to fill up space\\", but that is not true, they actually cut a lot of the music out.  And one thing that makes Smashing Pumpkins so unique is that each album has a different sound and actually a lot bands do this to attract other listeners.  This cd inparticular has something for everyone on it.  It has your grunge, alternative, rock, grind core even classical.  By realeasing this cd The Smashing Pumpkins helped death meatl go more maintstream in a way even though it was mostly Pantera.  In my opinion I think the heavier stuff is even better then the slower on this cd.  And disc two is better then disc one in my opinion.  For a band to cover that many genres of music on a single album has to have some sort of artistic abilities.  I went to French websites, Germen websites, British websites, etc. And they respect this cd more then their native country (they even respect the band better as a whole), if you ask me that is pretty sad.  I mean the Pumpkins are just amazing.  I think one of are problems are, is that we expect so much from the artist, we expect the artists to stay with one sound, but what i say is, is how are they going to get a bigger audience to listen to their music if they don't go with the flow.  And every once in a while it is good to experiment with different sounds it makes you more of a musician if you do. Here is my rating on the songs.    Disc 1    1) Mellon Collie and The Infanite of Sadness - 10/10  2) Tonight, Tonight - 10/10  3) Jellybelly - 9/10  4) Zero - 15/10  5) Here is No Why - 9/10  6) Bullet with Butterfly Wings - 15/10  7) To Forgive - 10/10  8) F**k (An Ode to No One) - 15/10  9) Love - 10/10  10) Cupid de Locke - 8/10  11) Galpogos - 8/10  12) Muzzle - 9/10  13) Porcelina of the Vast Oceans - 7/10  14) Take Me Down - 7/10    Disc 2    1) Dawn to Dusk - 15/10  2) Bodies - 15/10  3) Thirty - Three - 10/10  4) In The Arm of Sleep - 7/10  5) 1979 - 10/10  6) Tales of Scorched Earth - 15/10   7) Thru the Eyes Ruby - 7/10  8) Stumbeleine - 13/10  9) X.Y.U. - 15/10  10) We Only Come Out at Night - 7/10  11) Beautiful - 8/10  12) Lily My (One and Only) - 9/10  13) By Starlight - 7/10  14) Farewell and Goodnight - 7/10    Some of you complain about the distorted voices and guitares, but you know what i say, my Dad and Aunt who are both 49 like the heavier better then the slower.
