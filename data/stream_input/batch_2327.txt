0316044695|5.0|Fantastic book. Was not able to put it down. Found my self crying tears of pride. God Bless the SEAL teams involved. My prayers go out to the families who lost these brave heroes.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I originaly had the free version. The i up graded to the HD version when i got my Kindle Fire HD. I love all the Star Wars characters and the things they can do in the game.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|Try opening this app.  Great!  It opens!  Now try doing anything else.  LinkedIn, get it together!  You are supposed to be a global interwebs company, but you can't get your app to work?  What's wrong with you?!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I think this is the best Angry birds to date. I am a big Star wars fan. i have all six of the movies. i also have all five of the Angry birds games.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I purchased gems and they dissapeared. waste of money to purchase anything. done playing now that I was scamed. was a good game until then.
B007N85POS|5.0|I just love the Angry Birds series of games....They are all so addicting and easy to play on my Kindle Fire HD
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a wonderful story of a few young men. The trouble and enjoyment they . Get into keeps you going.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My grandson and i both love this game. It is a great addition to the Temple Run collection. I reccomend this game to any one who has the other games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is really fun and inexpensive,but the only reason<br /> I give it four stars is because some of the games they give you are annoying or boring,but it`s up to you,this is just my review.
B0086700CM|4.0|this app is really fun when you first get it buy when you play it a lot it get really boring l
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is the worst thing ever<br />I hate it<br />I'd  rather sit in a hole and die than play this stupid game
B0074VA2T2|3.0|Two and a half year old grandson liked it for a short time and then lost interest, not enough stimulation.  Although he does like to count maybe in another six months he'll have more interest in it.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|It was shipped fast and It was a even better copy that I bought at the store years ago! Amazing!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Easy to start and very high paced game makes time go by quickly if you don't watch it. Good for those that like an interactive game.
0545101425|3.0|This last book of the Hunger Games trilogy is depressing, scattered and unsettling.  The first book of the series is brilliant.  The second book is really good, but has a lousy cliff-hanger ending.  The third, well... The plot seems to go round and round in a depressing destruction of everything.  The writing becomes a little forced, and in such a way as it crushes the characters so cleverly written.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Do not start this book unless you have time to read. I literally couldn't put it down!  Have to buy the next part of the series.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|In fact, I'd say it's the best self-published book I've read so far.  Many are so poorly written, with obvious spelling/word choice/editing errors, that I end up deleting them from my Kindle within a few pages. Not so with Wool Omnibus.<br /><br />Granted, Wool isn't perfect.  I did find some word choices that were suspect -- words that didn't quite match the context of the sentence, where it seemed that Mr. Howey was going for a \\"fancier\\" word than was necessary. One instance of this, where he both used a somewhat uncommon word and used it incorrectly was when \\"augured\\" was used instead of \\"augered\\" -- \\"...a tear finally formed as she augured the handle in small circles.\\"  Augur means to predict, whereas an auger is a rotating drill.<br /><br />A minor nitpick, to be sure -- even I had to look up the definitions for both words because I was unsure of which was correct.  But had there been more errors like that, it would have been enough for me to stop reading and leave a poor review.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the Omnibus. The theme was somewhat reminiscent of Harlan Ellison's \\"The Starlost\\" (I won't say why, as that would be a spoiler), which isn't a bad thing. I'll definitely seek out some of his other works.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|love this --- this is my second time through. It appeals to the lawless side of me. If it could just be so easy to exact revenge on the enemies of my &#34;family&#34;
B007MDB71O|5.0|Perhaps the ability to successfully market a movie.  Although this flopped pretty spectacularly at the box office, it is actually a faithful interpretation of the Burroughs novel, and a very decent action film with some heart at its core.  Great special effects, attractive human cast withh good acting, some great non-human actors as well.<br /><br />Really wish this could have launched a franchise--the first three books in this series remain some of all-time favorites.  Even without much liklihood of a finish to the story, this a very fun and entertaining movie, well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Only downside about this product--the blue ray disc came damaged and we could only watch the DVD--still looks OK, but was really looking forward to the movie in blue-ray.<br /><br />Anyway, highly recommended for  a Saturday afternoon of fun and adventure!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|The game is grear, absolutely. But everytime I quit the multiplayer match, I lost several thousands of gold credit. Please update for Kindle Fire version. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The world tour sydney update wont work. Please fix, thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) It would be five stars if the updates WORKED.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I could see so much of my previous life in this.... constant firefighting, phone calls at all times of the day & night and a long suffering family. I wish I had access to this book then!!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I thought the movie was very dry but interesting.  There has been some disagreement as to it's historical accuracy; nonetheless, I never knew there was so much debate about how to end the civil war.  This movie should be shown in schools.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game if you like temple run two or one because it has kinda the same features but some better features like the mystery box and the jet pack so you could get more coins
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman were terrific.  I actually think it is one of John Goodman's best performances because it was out of the box for him.  The movie is beautifully filmed, and very interesting -- however parts of it are a bit far reaching from a plot perspective.  There was a lot of content crammed into the movie, which I feel left the viewer to make some comclusions on their own.  Definately adult not only in content, but also in thought process.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am now on  book 5 in series--full of surprises and tender moments as well as not so tender moments---but realistic with life events that can occur. The books are addicting! An amazing author.<br />Donna
B0074VA2T2|2.0|Works great on my phone but freezes constantly on my kindle fire  need to fix this!  My daughter really wants to play!
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Excellent and well written.  This book is a must-read for everyone interested in developing applications and web sites that are intuitive and easy to use and navigate.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I absolutely love this show. It has everything a good show needs. The winchester boys are totally lovable. I hope that they never cancel this show.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Great wacky spin on film noir. Lebowski is some of the Coen Brothers' best visual work, dialogue, and characters. Sam Elliot as narrator, too!
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I haven't really seen a lot of games like this one, the controls aren't super intuitive and take some time to really get down to a science. Beyond that I was happy to see something new and gave the game some time. I was glad that I did as it was a real pleasure to sit down and enjoy.
B00B4YAQ5A|5.0|I was waiting impatiently for this album to come out, and i must say it was worth the wait. In the 35 plus years that Saxon Has been around, these boys show no sign of slowing down. Sacrifice Is A True Masterpiece. I Highly Recomend This Album To Everyone Who Has Been A Fan Since The Begining And to New Fans. You Will Not Be Dissappointed.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|The game is simple use your thumbs to control the direction of your aircraft and to fire your weapons. The controls work well if your touch screen does, I have only one issue with on screen controls and that is that with larger fingers and thumbs sometimes I miss this or that, guess it's time for a bigger screen, nonetheless this game didn't present that issue to me very frequently so I was happy. Unlocking new planes is rewarding enough to keep you playing through the levels and trying to beat your own scores. A great little challenge game.
0783225547|5.0|Another in a long line of movies featuring an EXPERT (Pierce Brosnan) who knows something bad is about to happen only no one will believe him, including his boss (Charles Hallahan) who publically ridicules him because \\"delicate politics\\" are involved......which always trumps life and property!?  I love a boss willing to undermine his best expert because it doesn't suit his delicate sensibilities.  What a perfect putz.<br />I happen to like disaster movies so I didn't view the competing volcano movies of 1997 as a matter of one over the other.  I counted myself a winner for getting two instead of just one.  As for which one is better......I don't care!  I've got both in my collection and watch both with the same enthusiasm as the first time I watched either one.  This is a case of having my cake and eating it too.  Trust me; you can't have too much cake.<br />Even if you can't quite accept Pierce Brosnan as a volcanologist, you have to appreciate the attempt to do something besides suave and debonair.  And even so, you still have Linda Hamilton as the charming mayor of a small (DOOMED) town in the middle of nowhere.  The rest of the cast serves the purpose of taking sides or becoming fodder for the coming disaster.  And disaster it is, all ash covered and fiery, one pivotal scene after another.  It's an embarrassment of riches as far as catastrophes are concerned (the freeway collapse is fabulous).  So what if the story is clumsily stacked against the poor volcanologist who's just trying to help.  In the end, there's a silent I TOLD YOU SO!  That's all that counts.
B003B17YZE|5.0|I choose this rating because I like this album a lot.  The bonus video is definitely worth it and I will be watching it again.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|just installed the .99 cent app., lost the ad pop ups along with the weather portion, even though it shows I should have it visible. not happy right now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You will put your life on hold to finish this trilogy. I have never, in all my life been so deeply engrossed and captivated by ANY other book!<br />Definitely more than what it was hyped up to be! Deliciously Intoxicating!!!
0525953728|5.0|Not my usual read, however it kept my attention, taught me a little, and enjoyed the story/information greatly! I have recommended it, and loaned it out several times, all have returned it with positive feedback
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You will put your life on hold to finish this trilogy. I have never, in all my life been so deeply engrossed and captivated by ANY other book!<br />Definitely more than what it was hyped up to be! Deliciously Intoxicating!!!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is a really great app for children. My grandson, who just turned five, loves this app and will play with it for a long time. There are so many different things to do that it will keep children entertained long enough to avoid stress during appointments. It is a great creative outlet for any age.
B00456PKG4|5.0|We can discuss this more when we start our sessions next week. Love the acrobatic running around that Jake Gylenhaal does. Worth a watch
1935251740|5.0|Brilliant and prophetic. A rare revelation\\"<br />What did you love best about Biocentrism?<br />I appreciated the storyline adn anectdotal stores especially the inital story of Robert Lanza at Harvard as a young boy (himorous). excellent. And to see similar insights in this new field of unification with a kindred spirit. Dr Lanza is truly a luminary with a lifetime of contribution to science and biology as well as philosophy and regenerative neurobiology I consider this book to be a milestone in consciousness reseearcvh and all this coming from a brilliant award winning biologist who has changed the history of human health and regeneration with his stem cell research.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Works well and keeps me listening to my favorite stations no matter where I am.<br />Any motel or hotel with wyfy puts what I love at my fingertips.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Characters lives are all intertwined which leads to a surprise twist in plot. Love to hate and love to love the many character flaws that make each person.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|There is no much else to say except that Steve Jobs ewas an inspiration to  millions. And  this book shows why. 5 stars just because  it was Steve Jobs not to mention it was a great read!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I thought the book contained some good information and was put together in a way that most people could easily understand.
B00778GL0G|5.0|I enjoyed this product very much. I am a big fan of Steve Buscemi and Michael Pitt. They are great together. I like the genre of the show. It gets a little violent but I believe that is the way it was during that time, especially during prohibition. People like to celebrate with bubbly and taking it away only opens a venue for blackmarket which then leads to competition and then of course the violence when they war over territory. I think the casting is fantastic and the entire project is very well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great but I wish the y had boats,buckets<br />Herobrine should be in the game to make this game better<br />This is an awesome game
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The Hobbit greatly expands on what is written in the book.  Peter Jackson incorporates a great deal of what is in the appendices, and it makes returning to Middle Earth a Pleasure.  Some say it's a bit long winded, but I certainly wanted more!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I can't do anything on my tablet because my son is always playing this game..it is fun I play it sometimes when he in school..
B001AH6ZWY|1.0|The movie did not stay true to Dr.Sagan's writings. The movie almost has nothing to do with the book, It was so pathetic I wanted to scream! If you people really want entertainment go read a book don't watch movies based on books.
1936891026|5.0|Pressfields ability to detail thoughts and action that impede on all our productivity is exceptional. The clarity with which he explains the resistance we all go through is enlightening and clear. I found myself identifying with the concepts expressed and realising how much more productive I could be. You can't help but improve your productivity after reading this book. Brilliant!!!!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|SO... I got hooked on vinyl records sometime last year.. I got a reissue of Abbey Road and fell in love with vinyl. So when I saw that this box set was out I couldn't help but to be overly excited like everyone else... My father is a huge Beatles fan and I am now too. I have a Hastings store where I go to get some of the newly released vinyl.. For the heck of it one day I walked in and found no box set.. BUT I did find 8 of the 14 records in the set. So I bought them, and special ordered the rest. I now have all 14 digitally remastered vinyl albums, although I bought them one at a time. NOT in the box set I can honestly say I have had no major problems! I thought I did with the White Album because I went to play Birthday and it skipped.. But not to panic instantly I cleaned my needle off and it had no problems. To add I also have the misprinted Magical Mystery Tour that lists Baby You're A Rich Man as George Harrison's song but that doesn't bother me. I still would love to have the box set, but when its all said and done I paid maybe 50 dollars more for the albums singly than all together PLUS I had no problems with the vinyl.(and no booklet but that's OK) I never actually owned the originals, but I am happy with the remasters. I am sorry to those who are having problems with returns and bad shipping.. My advice is to buy them singly.. I noticed that Sgt. Pepper has dropped in price so if you buy them singly now it would be for less.. My only warning is if you order online you still have to worry about shipping. I ordered the Let It Be... Naked album and Love on vinyl new from Amazon and it was shipped beautifully no problems.. But I can not say that for sure if you order all 14 albums in the same order.. To add I have played all 14 albums over and over so much that my mom wants to get rid of them.. I know the vinyl will make it sound like vinyl... Another thing you have to remember when getting the vinyl is that all vinyl will pop or have small crackles its just how it is. It comes down to if you want them for show or use or both. For me it is both. I can honestly say it was a really good job well done with the remasters.. Of course with any job things can be done better. It seems that more care was taken with the single remastered albums than the ones that were put into the box set. I realized this when I got the Record Day Singles Box and the print on the label was sideways compared to the Apple on my Revolution single. But I will go into further detail if asked. Thanks I will be glad to help compare and discuss issues. I hope we can all get the 14 albums that we can be satisfied with. I know I have! To all fans new and old I am 16 got my first album at 15 and it was Abbey Road and ever since I have wanted all of The Beatles vinyl that I can get. It is a piece of history and like I said.. When bought one album at a time they are nothing short of beautifully fantastic!! Thanks!! Hope all who have had problems are getting the ones they deserve!
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|I think you should try this game because it is hard but fun and i think everyone should try it i think even adults would like it to
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I'm not sure how I had not heard of how great this book was until recently, but it really lived up to the hype.  Very well-paced and Herbert paints a beautiful picture for the reader.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Haven't read a Jack Reacher book that I didn't like.  They are all really great.  I have read all of them.  Never disappointed.
B00BI5IXL4|2.0|I do not like musicals, and I did not realize that this had no spoken words in it. I did know it was a musical, but I guess I thought it would be more like a Disney movie with some songs mixed into the movie. But I think there was 2 sentences in the entire move that were spoken, the rest was sung. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it had a good story line.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|The Kindle Fire works great with this one... It scans and protects... even when you forget to disable external apps from loading.<br />Very light and doesn't slow it down that I can tell... Excellent stable app...
B0044XV3R8|2.0|the lighting was bad,I couldn't seem to do anything about it.I will think twice about ordering any more movies on line,not worth the hassel of sending back.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I knew that Eddie Vedder had done a lot of the music and I'd heard many positive reviews so I suggested this to my wife and we watched it together. It's well acted and there is a lot of natural beauty to appreciate, and it tells the story well enough. The one thing I really didn't like cinematically is the single moment when the lead actor acknowledges the camera - wasn't necessary, didn't add anything, very random. It's ultimately a downer to watch this and so I can't say I'd watch it again.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|These tracks are amazing. On my first listen through I didn't even notice that there were instrumentals. I recommend this for anyone who likes this genre.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a sudsy fun delight of a show. I only wish there were more episodes. Looking forward to more in the future.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Unbelievable what is happening in our own backyards.  I had to follow up on some of the claims in this piece and was mortified to find out how much of it is really true and how much disregard to peoples' health and safety there is.
6304711905|5.0|Bought for my sweetie. We are both fans. He loved it...of course!<br />Bought for my sweetie. We are both fans. He loved it...of course!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I have no idea why those people with one star reviews think that it doesn't work on kindle fire, it works perfectly, you should get it it is really awesome I love how it has a gravitational pull and the birds costumes are awesome. Talk about fashion!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Great book but sad to read given his recent death...helping young soldiers with PTSD.  A great guy who deserved better.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed a replacement charger cord for my kindle, and phoned customer service at 5 pm on a Saturday night.  The replacement arrived on Monday- that is not just good customer service-it's magic!!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I had been following this show and love it, however I was disappointed the season finale was not on the dvd also
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The beginning is pretty much how all seal books start talking about, where they come from, the training etc. But once you start the Afghanistan part of the story, it's very, very good. Definitely a must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it works really well, there are no &#34;glitches&#34; or whatever you want to call them. And it's a really fun game, and it'll keep you entertained if you're bored! :)
B0091WMSNU|5.0|Excellent cast and a great mob movie!! Only reason I bought this over the other classics like the Godfather, Goodfellows, Casino, etc was that I've already seen all of those flicks dozens of times.<br />Even though they have smaller parts in the movie, the characters that Baldwin and Wahlberg play are hilarous.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like to play this game. It has so many varitions..It is like eating popcorn, once you start it is hard to quit playing..
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Need I say more?  This movie was eerily relatable for my husband and I.  Too funny and will definitely watch it a 2nd, 3rd, 4th time.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|It fits perfectly with my Canon Vixia HFM500. Has a wrap to easy adjustmen, and two little slots in the interior of the bag, to store MSM memories..
B00BF11STU|4.0|If you enjoy a good drama this is for you.  Acting was impeccable and of course the story line keeps you involved.  Very intense.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Everything about TheGoodWife is excellent: the plots, the dialogue, the acting.  The characters are many-faceted, and are all struggling to do their best in the crazy milieu of corrupt Chicago politics and litigation.  And in spite of all the deceit and criminal behavior, it's actually a good morality play -- most of the main characters are trying to do the right thing.  Margulies perfectly captures the ambiguities of her situation.  Baranski can't help enjoy the humor and irony.<br /><br />I've only watched the first season -- it might be difficult to maintain this quality in the 2nd and 3rd seasons.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this season.  Enjoy this series because it is drama filled but not full of smut.  Can't wait for season 4!
B0058BI896|5.0|Words cannot describe how much fun it is to watch these actors. This is undoubtedly the best humor on television.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is different from any of my other games. It's fun and a real challenge. I love the graphics and all the colours
B005K17RU0|4.0|Use this app on a regular basis now able to easily follow the local weather and several other areas in the country on my Kindle.
B000ANDBTY|4.0|it was a real treat to watch movies from our childhood. I bought it for my husband as a gift.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is charming and draws you in and I personally loved the characters and the story. I would definitely recommend it.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I went into it with a predjus because I am a BIG Denzel Washington fan.<br />If you are a fan I believe you will like this one too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best television's shows, I've ever seen. It is absolutely perfect. I really love it.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Excellent writing with a different approach to the story telling. Interesting twist to story that keeps the reader guessing until the end.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This album was definitely worth the wait. It really shows the range of Justin's voice and overall talent as a pop singer. He definitely has proved for sure that he is versatile in his ability to make great music. This album is definitely going to be playing on repeat for awhile. It also looks like the soundtrack for Summer 2013. Great job Justin, keep it up!
B003WEA4UM|5.0|Haven't read something that worked on so many layers for a very long time. Hope you get the chance to enjoy it as well!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very readable history lesson about life in the mid-1860's.  Great descriptions of the atmosphere and comparisons of the backgrounds of the main contenders for the nomination for president.  Many details of daily life are described in a way that made me understand the remarkable person that Lincoln was.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|I think this movie would have been just as funnny if they didn't use the &#34;f&#34; word so.......many times.  Love Jason Bateman.
B0088TG252|1.0|I was not able to watch this movie. It cut out several times during the viewing and was very poor quality. I have never had this experience prior when watching digital movies. I would like to receive credit for this title or another opportunity to view it.
B00005LK94|5.0|Would recommend this movie to anyone.  Actually bought two DVD's, one for a Christmas gift and the other for myself.
B003WUYQSW|4.0|This is an animated book, written by a passionate guy! I enjoyed it, the videos in the kindle edition were a nice add.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard. Very intelligent predictions and sleek design. Customizations are fairly decent although I wish there were more. Very impressive.
1419702238|3.0|jest fajna ksiorzka napewno sie karzdemu spodoba polecam ja i nie jest droga<br /> zobaczymy czy sa jeszcze jakies ladne wersje
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  I loved it how the author gave us hints about what was to happen in the future.  Stayed up way past my bedtime to find out.  Was not expecting the ending - what an ending it was. Great book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was so good, kept my attention the whole time. Cant wait for season 4. You will love this set.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|One of the things I marvel at is the creative genius that musical groups like Pink Floyd offered beyond their contemporaries or current &#34;artists&#34;. I try very hard to give each musical genre some passing evaluation, but when I adjudicate them relative to something like &#34;Dark Side&#34; they pale. Now, I generally run contrary to popular taste anyway, so that cuts like &#34;Money&#34; which were chart toppers, while great pieces, are not necessarily my favorites from the album.  You can find haunting cuts that will make you pause -- and then replay over and over again. This remastered album makes me value time all the more and motivates me to change my ways when I perceive them to be out of sync with the world around me.  See you on the dark side of the moon!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My mother is a voracious reader. She reads 1-2 books a day. She always tells me you should read this, you should read that. When she read Wool, she said I had no choice. We have to discuss this book together. So I purchased the omnibus and it was SO WORTH it. I have told all my friends and now they are reading it and love it too. Thanks Hugh Howey! Can't wait for more.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A must-read for every woman and man. It would make our world a better place. Thank you for this genius!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|I bought this for my 7-yr-old for Christmas.  He loves it, for its intended purpose.  Now don't get me wrong, we have a LOT of legos at our house and this is by no means a reasonable storage solution for a large volume.  BUT it is terrific for storing and playing with his Star Wars legos - and it is easy to transport up and down stairs, from room to room, and back and forth from the grandparents'.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A fascinating look at the emergence if the computer industry intertwined with the unique personality of a genius. Anyone who is in the design field should read this, certainly, but it can inspire anyone to strive to do whatever they do better and smarter.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|It was fun to use these characters of Star Wars to battle the evil pigs of the universe. But I went through it pretty fast and need more levels to burn.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Keeps my attention, exciting, always look forward to nest episode, I wish i was watching season 3 right now, very suspenseful.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I an not sure that the Kindle Fire HD is the the ideal device to used for taking photos.  This camera does not make it any easier or better.  I'll probably never use it for anything that I want a good shot of.
B001JK7Y9K|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites, I watch over again every 6 months or so especially for that mesmerized feeling.  I love dance and you to will enjoy this film more than just ballet and tap there is actually a story to follow as well.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I don't use it that much, but it does what it is advertised to do and is relatively straight forward.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really a great time passer, graphics nice and clear. I do have a problem withsome of the hang-ups?? Newwd molre direstions.
B001EBWIV8|5.0|This film takes high concepts of spirituality and disguises them in an impossibly entertaining action movie.  Performances are superb and the cinematography is pure eye-candy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book should be titled amazing people.  Adam is a one in a million person his story gives me hope for the population.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Now here's a great little workout video app!  At first I thought it would be stick figures, but it is real video with real people doing real exercises!  What a great way for me to take my exercise &#34;buddies&#34; along to conventions, out of town meetings and on vacation!  I don't miss my exercises, and I actually find some of them a bit challenging.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves to exercise (or has to) but travels, too.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great fit ,easy to use,and light weight.<br />Tried another and this was the best fit. Try it you will be happy with it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Absolutely loved the movie!!!!  Can't wait for the next one!!!!  It was such a fun show to watch, great actors all in the same place!!!!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Does exactly what it's supposed to do. It protects my Plantronics M50 bluetooth headset very well. Nice construction. Look authentic and does not look cheap at all.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Any other sequels will definitely be purchased in this household.  We loved the actors and the roles they played.  Can't wait to see the next one!!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am an avid WD fan and my favorite season hands down was season 1. That being said. I thought this season was right on par with the quality of season one. I have a couple of bones to pick with season 3 though. #1 Andrea is really annoying. #2 The first half of the season has a break-neck pace while the second half doesn't quite match up. #3 The zombies become less of a threat to the group, although that does put more of the focus on the human on human conflicts, I do feel it takes away from what makes the show awesome. The first half of the season gets a solid 5 stars while the second half gets 4 stars. I have high hopes for season 4 though.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I do not rent R rated movies.  The powerful story of this movie comes through without the use of profanity. Two thumbs up!!!!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a nice case and a good price.  I got one for my dad and one for myself for our iPhone 4 phones.  We've used them for 15 months and are very pleased.  I think the case has yellowed a bit, but it's not noticeable unless i take the case off.  I didn't use the screen protector.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series has really pulled me in. You are totally gripped by the plot of both the upstairs and downstairs characters. The next day I find myself thinking, \\"I can't believe what happened in the last episode!\\" The sets and costumes are sumptuous. I highly recommend this series.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was a nice love story.  A good book for light reading.  I found  the ending a little bit boring.
0307593525|5.0|Wonderfully put together a must buy for any serious cooking enthusiast. The recipes are dead on  ! However if this is going to be a gift for someone be advised that the techniques are a bit above \\"entry level\\" . Myself , I am in love with a book yet again ! Thank you amazon !
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A real mystery.  It kept me guessing until the very end.  Another great book by John Grisham.  I could'nt put it down.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I don't typically enjoy love stories.  This movie manages to be a beautiful emotional love store without being a \\"chick flick\\".  The emotional response this movie gets out of someone like me is remarkable.  I've never understood negative reviews, but I guess there's no such thing as a movie everyone will like.  This movie requires a tremendous amount of focus the first time you watch(or second or third time for that matter), but it all pays off.  It may seem like a disjointed mess at the beginning, but by the end it turns out it is laid out perfectly.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Makes you think about life while you enjoy great visuals and a great story. I reccommend this one for you
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The only solace in putting down the book is the hope of the dreams it conjures. Ms. Morgenstern, you have done more than tell a story.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was weird in the middle when he shifted gears to tell a second story.  It was not a smooth transition... The way he writes about the potential love and the next chapter she's his crime partner.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Thsi package has not downloaded on my KINDLE and looks to be usless and a waste of my money. I wish I had of cancelled my purchase, now I stuck with a product that does nothing.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|just got this great cd i just love it and the whole family can vibe to it. It has a little something in it that gives it an old school feel to it.
B002J301NM|5.0|I have two wonderful friends that met in very similar ways... they actually named their children and company after the characters of this movie... love love love it! =)
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Very user friendly.  Thus far I've had only one tiny problem (LOL) I can't figure out how to go back to previous months, anyone have a clue as to how this is accomplished?  Could use a few more icons but the ones that are there are workable and fun.  Really glad I got it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome. Once you start playing you find it hard to stop. Try it you will see.If you like to play slots. Take my word for it.
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|good remake of the old classic. long, but interesting take, showing the girl as fearless instead of so lost and helpless.
1416575464|5.0|This has been an invaluable resource as my husband and I choose new furniture and décor for our tiny brownstone apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. I bought a total of 12 decorating books, and this one has been the surprise gem that travels with me everywhere. Well worth the money, this is a fantastic investment!
1451673442|5.0|Book had great ideas on how to change the way you think and view things for a more enjoyable life.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Quite fun. Visceral. I downloaded it for my kid but play it a lot more than he. Great graphics. Funny. Easy to just pick up and play. Really hard to stop.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|If you are a dance fan you have to see this movie.  Mikhail Baryshnikov and Gregory Hines are amazing dancers and actors in this movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing! The book takes you on a journey and it never ends. It's a great book by a great author.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really like playing this game. I've had some issues/errors while playing the game so that the game data has been erased so I've had to start over from new with my shark. I don't know if it's specific to my device or if this is a general problem that the game creators need to address.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its nice to have Facebook on the go, but when it comes to the wall it feels like it doesn't update as frequently as it should and some of the postings get their order mixed up even when it is on the most recent option.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Twists and turns in the fortunes of the families in the Seven Kingdoms. The plotting and strategies plunge them into a brutal war. Can't put the book down, reading to see how my favorite characters fare in this gripping saga! On to book 3!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was enthralled the whole time with the cute story line and I laughed so hard I cried in the comedic parts.
B009FZFONO|5.0|When I talk to people who haven't seen this show, I tell them it's a drama that just happens to be set in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by zombies.  That is, the characters are developed enough that they would be interesting even without the zombie story.  That said, the story is awesome. The writers do a good job of keeping you hooked with cliffhangers and the like, and they're not afraid to make major changes such as killing a character.  This isn't a show that just resets everything to perpetuate variants of the same old story from episode to episode.  Highly recommended.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have used Yahoo mail for a very long time now and I was glad I could sync it to my phone so I can read my messages on the go.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|If you're into this time frame of Rock and Roll, then buy this album.  Geezer rock at it's best and Greatest.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great to know what the weather is going to be like when I am a busy on the go type of person. I don't have time to sit in front of the television and wait for the weather channel to come around for a detailed explanation of the weather, so an app helps me greatly.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book very much. I actually read it in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. It really makes you understand fully what it feels like not to have a real family. Makes you count your blessings.
B005721W9O|5.0|You know what it is, all you need to know is: how good is it? Very good indeed. It's got wit, heart, slyness and believe it or not an actual story. I just showed it to a crowd half of whom had never seen Star Trek and they uniformly loved it. Approve of the idea? You'll definitely approve of the movie.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I love the CD everything was great. i recomend this CD it is great. I am thinking to buy another one
B009DA74ES|3.0|I really like it. But, this fifth season tells again and again the same story. I hope the 6th will find a real new dimension.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|The format on this app is my favoite out of all the ones I've looked at. I hope they continue running somehow even after reader shuts down.
B0044WQHA2|5.0|Those of us of a certain age went to high school with every character in that movie.  Watching it is like browsing through one's yearbook.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is great had the free version for a while then paid for the full version cause I use this app all the time after work to unwind sometimes and every night to go to sleep and I actually wake up feeling relaxed so amazing definitely recommended this is actually the first app I've actually paid for and it's so worth it
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have not reviewed a book before this one.  I found Dr. Alexander's experiences very well written, and given his medical background, gave a great understanding of what happened to him.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Fun. I love Sandra Bullock. I've become more picky, though. I've decided a movie has to praise Jesus for me to give it a 5. And they won't let me give this a 4.8, so there we have the \\"4\\" rating. Didi13
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I read the book and enjoyed the movie. Not sure I'd like to see the european version. It was just riht for me.
0399536108|4.0|its good that i get the book as i expected, but its better if the shipment process is much faster. tq~
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Simply amazing and epic, and any review I give beyond that would be pure nonsense. The years in his books flow by effortlessly, seemingly just like ours, so that at the end of the chapters you feel time slipping as everyone grows older. Mr. Follett is truly a master.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Been playing for months its getting better with ever update. Cant wait for guild vrs guild again, but thats as soon as amazon post the dl....
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game can't wait till 0.7.0 comes out in a couple weeks I also have pc Version and it is awesome!
B002N44XSG|5.0|This book was very good. I liked that it had a few shorter stories. It is very interesting. You can read it again and again.
0756405890|1.0|This book is to Harry Potter what Sword of Shannara was to Lord of the Rings. I was fantastically disappointed with this tedious journey to nowhere with a totally obnoxious hero.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! I could play it all day! But I can't find out how to update the app! But it's really cool!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is a very addicting game and its awlsome I deffently recommend it to everyone thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the peak of cool architectural designing. It's worth every cent they charge for it. It may not be as good as the full version. Two thumbs up!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched all three seasons over the course of a week. Good story line and immersing twists. Ingesting to see who got liked in each episode Great ride.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game is very good.  Only problem is that it takes too much battery energy.  It helps build your memory.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I love this game!!!! its so cool because you can connect with friends on facebook. but its very hard to update on the kindle fire. I wish it were easier to update the game. can someone help me update it? plz fix
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|It's really boring and lame it's ok but if you like cave run you will like this a lot star
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Enchanted my grandchildren, 5 and 3 who sang &#34;follow the leader&#34; long afterward.  Good color and sound.  Held their attention.
B00555X8OA|5.0|The book is written in a style that's really easy to read. It's amazing how much of our perception is on autopilot and easily affected and manipulated. Apparently, the research has been ongoing several decades, but you simply won't know this stuff unless you read this book. Highly recommended.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|The guys knocked this new CD out of the park. A  a fan I knew I wouldn't be disappointed and I'm not. The CD features a lot more of Joey on lead vocals than the previous CD. Its.a lot of ballads, but they were always great with those. If a fan, please get!!!! You'll be happy you did
B007N6NGYG|5.0|It takes forethought and coordination. Really a lot of fun and gets harder as you go. I really like it.
0062086529|5.0|I would recommend this book:) The book is small, so you can take it anywhere you go. Your child will also love this book
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Really enjoyable!  Fresh and down to earth.  I hear a touch of Janis Joplin in the singers voice.  It's worth checking out...
0061692042|3.0|This book is an exploration of familial and personal guilt. The guilt arises from various incidents of criminality and taboo-violation committed by the protagonist or those near and around him. These acts include larceny, incest, child endangerment, illegal border crossings, homicide, interfaith marriage, and more. So the question is how can a well intentioned person/narrator get out from under this cosmic load, and is it even possible? The answer given is yes, but only if one is able to abandon one's family and one's country and go to someplace like CANADA and enter the wondrous world of books and literature.<br /><br />I found myself thinking about this process of exoneration and redemption through geopolitical migration in the light of Hindu theology wherein one's actions/karma remain in pursuit not only wherever one may roam, but across multiple generations! There seems to be a fundamental distinction between these two world views. In this novel (and arguably in the Western view in general), the way to escape spiritual punishment in this life is by a physical and spiritual emigration from one's place of origin. This is such a 'New World' view based on making a 'fresh start' in pristine and virgin terrain. Looking at it one way, the Western view makes it easier to trangress against humanity, society, and nature since the consequences over time can be lighter. The problem is that the concept of a 'fresh start' in a 'New World' presupposes that by leaving a place physically one can also leave behind one's life experiences and world views and also that the world where one is going is 'New'.<br /><br />I wonder if the new Dell, the married professor in Canada, is actually a fully realized Dell or simply an empty shell of a person living in a state of non-being arising from a denial of the past. Is this Dell or merely a person filling his own mind and spirituality with the words and thoughts of Yeats, Ruskin, etc., instead of flourishing within his own poor Southern (USA) and Jewish origins? Dell's life is an understandable rejection of his ancestry and origins, an assimilation into a culture far removed from his own. Is the answer to life's riddles that we should become someone else, somewhere else, or that we should connect with the common humanity of our own histories? This book presents a credible affirmation of the former approach. And yet there is a sense in which the author wants to show us a dead end, a failure of sorts. As stated earlier on in the book, Dell believes the interfaith, interclass marriage of his parents should never have happened, his own life should never have happened: all he can do is run away from these mistakes into a new identity in Canada and then put an end to the fracas by becoming, along with his sister, the last of the Parson's line. For this reason I would consider this book an ultimately tragic view of life and, if we are lucky, a stepping stone on the author's unfinished exploration of what it means to be a sentient human being in twenty-first century North America.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am enjoying this game.  Great graphics and sound effects.  Would definetly recommend to anyone. Can't wait for part two.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome you get to collect coins and buy stuff with the coins.You should get it today right now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because some of the games on it is challenging. it is awesome hhhj j j j
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I did like the idea of having interaction with your readers by setting up a blog and Twitter page.  I thought there would be more direction, like a road map to use to achieve success.  But I guess each book has its own way of succeeding.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its all my favorite games in one! it has monster pet shop cute monsters that you get to care for, and it has the different buildings and things that give you money like in tiny zoo!!! PLUS YOU GET TO FIGHT WITH YOUR CUTE LITTLE GUYS!!!!! Its absolutely amazing!!!!!!!
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|A beautiful story of how a woman fights to be a parent. Touches on serious issues in society today. I would definitely recommend it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many things to try and share. It's gives me great things to try for holidays, and birthdays.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Used with the tablet alone, this is a good product, good price, and the first one on the market.  However, many of the cases available for the Nexus 10 don't have room for this connector while you are using the tablet.  I hope the next cable that comes along puts the cable parallel to the edge of the tablet, instead of perpendicular.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have family all over the US. I've added their zip code and I can see how there weather is.I also like that when the weather is acting up I can see the  symbol that is warning at a glance.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|too much like a musical. costumes were great scenery was cool but just didn't like it. story as old as time liked the old one better
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like to keep everything where I can find it fast. Love being able to make book for my interest, crafts, sewing, books. I'm able to list were I've stored item's and what projects I'm working for and for who. This is such a time saver.
B009FZFONO|5.0|hooked on walking dead. my husband the zombie king loves it and is hooked. i just can't get my 83 yr mother to like it :)
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Am pleased with the film however was disappointed how long this took to come as was not on the day of release as expected
B002YGSZBY|1.0|I was incredibly disappointed that I spent money on a DVD that won't even play. I was mad that to ship for return would cost just as much as the DVDs. I got ripped off.
B00BI745AA|3.0|I have to say it didn't touch Evita and I dislike Madonna as much as Hathaway.  it was a homely cast except for Jackman. It didnt really tell the story.  Susan Boyle is better than Hathaway.  I just didnt get it but I also thought Argo was a bore unless you've been in a coma the last 50 years.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|SOME MORE GREAT LISTRNING. SHE HAS A WONDERFUL PERSONALITY AND MANY TIMES IT IS REFLECTED IN DIFERANT SONGS.GOOD LISTENING SO ENJIY
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book was going ro be great, but it was even better than what I had thought! There were exciting twists and turns and every area of trouble in teenage life is touched upon. I saw the movie first and fell in love with it, but the book is even better. By far the best book of all time. You need to read this and you'll feel infinite...:)
030758836X|4.0|This was my first Flynn book.  I could not put it down, a page turner, I really liked it.  But..two butts.  I love great endings, and I was a little put off because this was not....rather abrupt.  But...after I thought about it I did kind of love the  rather sinister, abrupt  ending.  Second but....I won't read another Flynn book, because not one of the characters is endearing.  Not one. I need at least one character to be somewhat likeable.<br />...ok so, having said all that, I DID read another of her books, Dark Places...it was a bit slower, and her characters were just as unlovable...but...something about her writing is so compelling and draws you in.  Looking back on Gone Girl, I know I wanted to throw it at the wall, at the end....BUT  it sticks in my mind now as a very good read...including and because of the ending.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome!! Such a fun game and its just like Mario. I don't have anything else to say but I have to keep typing. My little sister plays this game all day
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Best Science fiction show. If you like sci-fiction shows and haven't seen this, give it a try.  You will enjoy it.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|When I first heard the Are you Experienced album in 1968, I was amazed. It changed my whole outlook in music.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I watched this with my wife and she was cringing a bit at the barbaric nature of some of the characters and extreme rough sex. She is definitely not a prude so we'll see how it goes. It seems like it'll be a great show once we get into the characters and knows what's going on as far as all of the kingdoms and such.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|Order, shipment, and condition excellent. If you want to hear some rockin' blues played by one of the best guitar players on earth, buy this DVD.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|All the intrigue of Westeros and its inhabitants continues. The plot takes many twists and turns along the way. New people are met and new locations are visited. Great Bonus features lie the Inner Circle diacussion and Battle of Blackwater Bay provide even more insight for the Game of Thrones enthusiast.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|This is an oldie but goodie.  I have to use my brain but it is not hard to win if you keep going.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is one of the best blues rock guitarists to come out in some time.<br />Dust bowl is a great album. Songs like Slow Train, Black Lung Heartache, and dust bowl rock.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|~~~~ TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY, the 2011 film ~~~~was very good. Watching the older six hour television mini-series with Alec Guinness again...then this new two hour movie was the way to go. The story wasn't changed just shortened; several sideline operations were cut to show only the hunt for the mole in Circus (the British MI6)...there were four suspects. And I enjoyed the George Smiley \\"the spy who came in from the cold\\" interpretation by Gary Oldman who was a better age for the role; both Guinness and Alexander Knox as Control were old men in the 1979 film. The other performances including Colin Firth and John Hurt were so-so...compared to the fine cast of the tv production. (Although Mark Strong as Jim Prideaux and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillam were very watchable.) The settings were dark, dreary, and dull except for the ending scenes.<br /><br />A very snappy cabaret song, \\"Le Mer\\", sung by Julio Iglesias after the mole was discovered ended the film with sunny portraits of the remaining Circus guys...including Smiley, the last spy, sitting on the \\"throne\\" as its chief. (I'm reminded of a regal bright red suit worn by Henry V at the end of a production of the Shakespeare play at the Newberry Opera House; such spectacle ends an altruistic story on a high note, don't you think?)<br /><br />Although I could have watched this current film without the plot refreshment of the television series....I believe it helped to follow the story better...and to see different actors in the main roles was interesting... I have an ancient Greek viewer attitude about remakes.<br /><br />See my 5 star review of the tv miniseries starring Alec Guinness [[ASIN:B0059XTTW8 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]]. I just wrote the review last week and titled it \\"A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma....\\" from a quote by Winston Churchill about post-war Russia.<br /><br />And consider watching [[ASIN:B00007LV9M Smiley's People]] the sequel and last of the Karla trilogy if you have another six hours to spare! John Le Carre, the author of the novel co-wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />Janeave another six hours to spare! John Le Carre, the author of the novel co-wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />Jane
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Another great album by Joe Bonamassa!  The title track is great and the track &#34;Somewhere trouble don't go&#34; just became my new favorite song!  That song ROCKS!  Can't figure out why that track isn't all over the airwaves.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I would recommend it to any Lord of the Rings fan, even though you have to wait for the two sequels following it!
B0076D21O2|5.0|Movies that even refer to the complexities of class interactions and tribal politics in this way are rare.  This movie carries the complexities well, and delivers plenty of food for thought, though I can definitely see how many people would find it a hard movie to get into.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I have read and reread this book and the others in this series.  I love and was hooked frombthe firs word. Great book
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVED this book because it has everyone`s point of view about Auggie and I think the R.J. Palacio is an amazing author. It describes Auggie` s life and how much he goes through, still only being ten years old. In conclusion, I LOVED this book because of the description and how the author described him and his surgeries and his friends. Just how he lived life and what he went through was a real page -Turner. The book is amazing and if u have not read it, you need to because it`s an amazing book.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Amazing book amazing movie. My all time favorite. One of the only movies that very closely follows the book. Very worth buying.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I saw the commercials long time ago and figured I would just rent the seasons later. After the pilot I was hooked!! Love how it incorperates the fairy tale and reality crossover so well!! These writers or so creative. I enjoy trying to figure out who is who in the fairytale and how the story plays out. So far in one night I managed to watch 4 episodes and can't wait to finish this season to start the next. Hey at least I don't have to wait one week apart or hassle with commercial breaks!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I bought it on a friend's recommend. It is a book you cannot let go of. Great for 5th grade read aloud on KINDNESS.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is highly addictive.  There are so many important characters that have interesting story lines that you can't stop watching.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I downloaded this to try to replicate the facebook on my computer to my kindle.  I removed it after a couple of hours.  It was slow and there were so many ads that I couldn't see my news feed.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|just got the backpack today and was satisfied with the purchase. it feels very durable and top quality.  has a lot of compartments for photo accessories. Ill see if it holds up in the long run. It sure feels like it will!
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I love this calculator! I have terrible handwriting, and it picks it up so easily.My only complaint is how you have to write out the problems. You can't have variables or 'x', but you can use a '?' Instead. Most of the time the question marks works really well as as replacement, but other times not so much. Still, a great app, worth getting!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game its one hundred thirty two games in one app so I do not have to waste all my memory on one hundred thirty two separate. games
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie gives every person plenty to think about whether they have disabilities or not. It seems that Mark O'Brian unknowingly reflected the same fears and concerns that many people feel about love and sexuality.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This was another great purchase from amazon Love Dexter and this is a great one to own don't miss out on this deal and it came very quickly.
B001KZG99A|4.0|This is an action packed movie and my son loves it too. Robert Downey, Jr is funny and a great fit for this movie.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Not a &#34;musical&#34;, but a true opera where all dialog is in song. The first opera that I've ever understood - I don't speak Italian.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Glad to see it is available on My Kindle Fire.It is a Fun Game. Would like to see more Facebook games on My Fire
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Really a good show...  At least the first espisode.  I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the season.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love the game , It is a easy game to master. Glad to see it available on  My Kindle Fire
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughter plays this often on my droid phone i have played to but she likes it more then i do.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book.  The book actually helped me understand the movie better.  I couldn't stop reading the trilogy.  It is so great that I will probably read this trilogy again, which is something I very seldom do.
B004R1Q296|4.0|this is a history of the 14th century in France including everyday life, the war, weather and the black death. Without distinctly pointing them out the author brings to mind parallels with todays world that are disturbing to contemplate. I read it first for recreationbecause I was interested in history and the black death. It's narrated to follow one upper class family in a way that makes it readable and approachable. While not as engaging as fiction it is very interesting and I'm starting my second read through as I plan a novel about the plague.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Someone much fun and addicting! It's  time consuming, so it's perfect!Would definitely let people know about this game. Can't wait for part 2 to come out.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|I love me some Anthony Hopkins.  Several dynamics going on in this show.  Beautiful scenery, too.  It's one of the few shows I go back and watch from time to time.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Some fantastic twists on classic Rock tracks.<br />I smiled all the way through. Apart from when laughing or singing!<br />5 star
B001H1SVO8|5.0|David Fincher did a great job translating the marvelous and twisted mind of Chuck Palahniuk's masterpiece into a living legend. This would never have been possible if not for the brilliant performances by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. The DVD shipped super quick and was in perfect condition.
1476734941|1.0|The authors are journalists, and the subject is not original.  They are not qualified to sell written advice about fasting.  They are just two more opportunists feeding the confusion about diet and health that is swirling all around us.  If you want to learn about fasting, read up on the True North Health Center in Santa Rosa, CA.  You don't need to buy a book, as the information is readily available from reliable sources online.  Go to True North for a 14-day water-only fast.. and learn how it really works. Do not follow this intermittent fasting schedule.  You will lose all your muscle tissue before your body burns off your fat reserves.  Do it right, water-only, under careful supervision by a competent physician who understands how it works.  This book is an irresponsible publication.  DO NOT BUY IT!
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is just as addicting as any of the Angry Birds games, but has a neat twist to it.  Instead of destroying things, you're trying to save homes from a fire.  Like Angry Birds, some levels are harder than others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 4year old granddaughter knows how to play.So you know I had too download it:) an it Great, She knows how too play it better then I do:)
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was amazing...the first couple chapters were slow, but after that it was really hard to put down...I finished the whole trilogy in one week...I kept telling myself that a good portion of this was so sick and wrong, but at the same time it was intriguing as it delved into some of the human psyche and slowly thru the series unraveled why Grey became the way he was.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|you have to read this book because is has interesting in this book you should read this book then sports book that how good this book is you must read it!!!!! it you read the book i will give you candy if you read the best book ever.

B006TJXZ30|3.0|The functionality is great the the advertisments coming up as alerts is a horrid idea.  Every 5 min or so my phone is beeping because of some add rather than emails coming in.  The app itself is great and understand that it is free so they had to pay for development sometime but just too much
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that likes these type of stories. It is very entertaining to people like my son. It excellent for kids as teenagers.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I like Maroon 5s music and can't seem to keep my feet still whenever their songs play on the radio. For the price this album was offered on Amazon, it was a no-brainer that I would get it. The album is fun to listen too
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It was a very good read that made me hope the book never ended. I wanted to keep reading. Everything is tied together in an interesting narrative style, all the while making you feel like forgetting everything and going running.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|It's PJ's best album and I wanted a digital copy of it! I am not a big fan of really aggressive rock, this one has a perfect balance
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun addictive and fun to play u will enjoy it when your bored going to work or school recenttly they have had an egg hunt and unlock a person it was cool
0307895475|5.0|A must have if you are going to play Skyrim.  Well written and extensive coverage of the many adventures and quests and includes two maps of the area.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed every moment this book gave me. The intensity the two characters shared with each other and the silly moments they shared. I loved it. I'll be reading more from this author for sure!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this series. Great read.I am very pleased that I ordered this book for my kindle.  If you are into this type of storyline or just curious get it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn as a writer, She keeps you in suspense the entire book! I had a hard time putting it down
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I wasn't prepared to like this movie, but it it great!!  Funny, charming, monsterous!!  Our whole family has really enjoyed it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game so much. This one of my favorites. The graphics are great. It can be a bit slow, but it is still fun. The horses are so cool. I highly recommend this game.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Excellent movie - read the book also and really like this author. Recommend to anybody who is interested in legal plots.
0307346617|5.0|The book catches your attention from the beginning. I am not a hipster cray-cray zombie loving teen fanatic (gross)- but World War Z was entertaining and really convinces the reader that the &#34;ZACK&#34; could really happen.<br />Excuse me while I go hide under a rock after admittedly enjoying a zombie book.
B009FZFONO|5.0|love the show, so glad I could get season 3 shows. Nice to have that as an option & get it on demand.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Clearly the producers were in fear of the dreaded &#34;Remington Steel Syndrome&#34; and so teased the viewers with Castle and Becket's relationship until the end of Season 4.  But it shouldn't be difficult to keep the series interesting, and they have succeeded.  Ryan's character was greatly expanded in a recent episode, and Castle's daughter was highlighted in a two-part episode.  The show maintains a good balance of character, story, and charm.  Shout-outs to Sci-Fi are fun to find, as when Castle apparently had a meeting with a famous actor (I won't spoil it) high on his 'bucket-list.'  Not to mention the episode at the convention, which was one of the year's best entries, mostly for the parody of both Firefly and Trek.  As mysteries they will not displace Christie or Conan Doyle, but I haven't found anything since Remington Steele that can match this show's mixture of light mystery with romance.  And this show is much better.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|LOVE LOVE love these books read them twice in hard cover, listened to the books on tape twice now read the serious on the kindle can they enough!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Excellent book. Book club all enjoyed his journey both physically & mentally. The author thought about his wife and her home 'walk' as well.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very interesting story that gives us an excellent insight into what it takes for a man to achieve this kind of success. I think it is a must read.
B001TM14VC|5.0|still love this movie great music Don't like Tom cruise but he is good i this. love love the music
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|I was a bit surprised when Argo won Best Picture as it was not shown in many theaters across the country. Good story of the Americans who took refuge in the Canadian Embassy and their liberation from Iran.
B009AMANBA|3.0|If I were to rate the acting in this film, I would say \\"excellent\\".  I found that the film itself 'dragged'.  There is so much more that could have been added when portraying Lincoln. I would recomment this film to those who really know nothing about this once great President (Lincoln) I would not recommend it otherwise.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A good representation of J. R. R. Tolkeins story. While The Lord of the Rings came out in three books it will be interesting to see how The Hobbit is stretched out into a trilogy.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This a very entertaining movie for all ages.  The original motivation of the main character is to impress a girl.  However with guidance from his grandmother, he begins his quest to find a real tree.  During his journey he realizes how important trees are.  We may not start down the right path for the right reasons, however by always willing to learn, we can accept lessons and expand our knowledge.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I am a big Hitchcock fan.  I saw the HBO movie about the making of his film The Birds.  It was disappointing, however this movie was very entertaining.
B0000C23DO|5.0|I grew up with the Grateful Dead and this album is one of the best I would recommend this to anyone
0762777931|4.0|This book was recommended by friend of mine and unless you're a hard-core vegetarian the recipes might be a little much however it has a lot of great information about plant-based diet and how it benefits your body
B00000612P|5.0|I would buy this again. I am a big Rod Stewart fan and I wanted to add this to my collection
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a lot more better than temple run Is a must-have game I reccomended to temple run fans also hurry cause there are some limited items!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Bingo Blitz is okay.  Very simple to follow.  Easy to play more than one Bingo Card at a time. Its Bingo-not much else to say.
0767805712|4.0|Shows lots of possibilities of using individuals DNA information in the fututre. Students enjoyed and learned from it. long movie.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I enjoy the game.  But opponents take way too long to respond.  Many don't give a challenge and will write the answer to the puzzle instead of drawing it.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is awesome. There is just something about the whole darn thing that makes every time you watch it so great. I can't stop singing the songs and thinking about all the quirky parts and characters.<br /><br />Its cheesy, funny, a little romantic and the ending is glorious. I love the music, the characters and just about every detail.<br /><br />The only part I hate is that there isn't another one! I haven't met a person who didn't like this movie or laugh at something.<br /><br />Fat Amy was great! Everyone should watch this, better yet, everyone should just buy a copy so when they get that urge to watch it again they have it.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I think it's a great game. Wish it would change with each time you play. But other then that I keep playing.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|While this BluRay release is terrific, this is a film that should be seen on the BIG SCREEN. Get your friends together and demand that Disney re-release the film in IMAX 3D. Wow! It's an incredible experience and seeing it on your 50 inch home screen doesn't come close.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|While buying is fun, research is just as much fun, and FREE!!!  Check out if your weapon can fire the ammunition, before you load.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I found this already on my Kindle. I could not find a reason to have it on my Kindle.Save your money.
1439153663|5.0|Great historical fiction. And you learn new things about the south and slavery. Great character development. Would definitely read this author again. Our book club loved the book.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Love the app. I have a first gen kindel fire and it causes it to lock up sometimes. Newer one should do better.
B000FCJZUO|3.0|I have read quite a few books told through letters written and I totally enjoyed this one. The characters are very alive..their thoughts and dreams, desires and disappointments palpable. A delightful read.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was amazing. I liked her whole story I liked everything about the book except for the chapters when it just stops talking about the thing it was saying. And so I recommend this book for anyone who likes good books.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|my son loves this game.  he has it on every device we own.  over vacation at the beach my son got shark teeth and shark t-shirt so when he plays it he can be more &#34;authentic&#34;
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun and really addicting! It's like Temple Run,but you can get more characters and power-ups. I would probably say this is more fun than Temple Run and everyone would enjoy it, even adults. I would suggest this game, only to people who are patient because it takes a while for your coins to add up.
B000059QYB|4.0|I really love this CD. The only problem I have with this product is that it came in a cracked CD case.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. It always changes so you never get bored. The missions were exceptionally challenging and exciting. Everyone should try this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am still reading this, am about halfway & loving it! No idea how this is going to turn out!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Playing this game is a great resource to keep your mind sharp with hand eye coordination and is a challenge when you play against others competing with  others for  high score
B005DJREJS|4.0|Yes it is a retool of a typical teenage angst series, but it looks at the &#34;trials and tribulations&#34; in a different, amuzing way.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Kathryn Bigelow should stick to painting and music videos.<br />Watch if you can get it at Red Box...with a coupon.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Julianna Margulies hit the ground running with this \\"show stopping\\" performance.  Alicia Florrick was a woman swimming in emotional turmoil but found herself anchored as a lawyer in a successful practice, Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.  Josh Charles as Will Gardner dated Alicia during law school.  With Alicia's skill as well as her astute knowledge, she found her identity as a solid lawyer for the \\"firm.\\"  Of course her \\"Florrick\\" name recognition was the drive that sparked her character to support \\"the firms\\" clients.  Margulies is one of today's strongest female characters on TV.  Matt Czuchry as Cary Agos is an extremely likeable character and plays the tension between himself and Alicia ideally for the multi-month try-out position in the firm.  Once Alan Cumming was introduced at Eli Gold, the character slots were \\"in place.\\"  Archie Panjabi as Kalinda Sharma is the best, kick-ass detective/researcher ever.  Kalinda is insanely smart, keenly instinctual and a beautiful knock-out.  What a fabulous assembly of characters.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I love anything that is well written and doesn't take religion to seriously. The characters are memorable and endearing and the book was a great read. I was trying to figure out who wrote which parts and while I think it's possible, they did a great jojoba of creating a single voice. If you liked this then I would recommend &#34;Lamb&#34;
B0064MPXFA|4.0|it's just a reall well done show with an interesting cast.  Makes you want to watch the next episode right away!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Wow! I've seen Pride and Prejudce on tv and regular DVD. This classic must be seen in Blu-ray. You will be thrilled with the quality. This Blu-ray probably sets the standard for the re-mastering of \\"old\\" films.<br /><br />A&E did an outstanding job on this blu-ray format which was first released in April 2009. It was re-issued in 2010 with the only difference being the cover art. So, if you're confused by the different packaging, don't be. The quality and features on the 2010 blu-ray are the same as the 2009 version. The 2009 blu-ray has Colin Firth pictured prominently on the cover with Jennifer Ehle and Susannah Harker sitting in the back.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality: The 2 disc blu-ray offers enhanced picture clarity, natural and rich colors and superior sound. The English countryside, costumes, and settings were simply stunning and were meant to be viewed in this manner. The viewing experience was so improved it was like watching an entirely different film.<br /><br />SUBTITLES: The English subtitles are right on the dvd menu and are optional for both the film and extra bonus features.<br /><br />Bonus features: Since thousands have already written positive reviews on the 1995 film, there's nothing unique to contribute here. The 4 extra features were also enjoyable to watch. They are worth mentioning again for the sake of convenience.<br /><br />Lasting Impressions<br />A Walkabout with Adrian Lukis (Mr. Wickham) and Lucy Briers (Mary Bennett)<br />Pride and Prejudice: A Turning Point for Period Drama<br />Technical Restoration<br /><br />Price: Fortunately, the price has dropped dramatically over the years. It should be noted that the disappointment expressed in past reviews were probably also influenced by the then unreasonably high prices being charged for the poor quality of previous dvd releases.<br /><br />Cons: None
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who cares about what they are putting into their body as &#34;nutrition.&#34;  If you saw the horrendous conditions under which many food products are grown, it would make your disgusted and exasperated and you will find new ways to shop to get make healthier choices.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that is better than it should be. I've watched it a dozen times and still get a big kick out of it and everybody I've showed it to has made a point of letting me know they enjoyed it, too.<br /><br />Richard Donner directed a mild spoof of the old TV series that starred James Garner and Jack Kelly as the brothers Maverick, gamblers in the old wild west.<br /><br />This remake stars Mel Gibson, as brother Bret, but brother Bart is nowhere to be seen. Gibson, we learn, is heading for what is, for lack of a better term, \\"the World Series of Poker\\" and needs to come by an extra $5,000 to make his entry fee. On the way he has many adventures that make up the story. Somebody is trying to keep Maverick from getting to the big game, but who? There are many twists and turns and the final outcome is hard to predict as it so well played out by all and sundry.<br /><br />Maverick, of course, is Mel Gibson - his main support is provided by fellow gambler Jodie Foster, who plays a disarmingly charming yet deadly wench. On the other side we have veteran James Garner, the original Maverick from the TV series. Garner is Marshall Zane Cooper, who guards the $500,000 in entry fees. Alfred Molina plays a tough hombre who seems to be stalking Maverick.<br /><br />The supporting cast is almost a who's who of old western movie stars like James Coburn, Denver Pyle, William Smith, Doug McClure, and Dub Taylor. You'll doubtless spot more familiar faces as even Mel's \\"Lethal Weapon\\" partner Danny Glover gets into the act in a laugh out loud moment. Superior kudos must go to Graham Green, who plays a Plains Indian who is a scamming partner of Maverick's. Their antics alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />When you need a laugh, Maverick is a movie that will always come through. Good for the entire family.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Good story, graphics and soundtrack. The whole family watched it twice! We'll probably watch it again too! Love Q-bert, :).
B0049YH0GA|1.0|This is one of my favorite albums from a unique and talented artist.  The cd is nothing short of brilliant, both musically and sonically.  Unfortunately, the expensive Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl is very poorly mastered, so that the level is far too low to be satisfying.  I am an experienced audiophile and music lover, I own several thousand lp's and cd's and I have no axe to grind.  In fact, I generally love all of MoFi's releases.  This time, however, they blew it.  I have contacted them, and they will not acknowledge the problem, notwithstanding that I know others who have had the same experience. It is not just that this album was recorded at a low level - it is clear that the vinyl was mastered improperly, so that the level is WAY too low to be played back at ordinary listening volume.  As a result, it lacks dynamics and is dull, lifeless and boring.  Stick to the cd.  Five stars for the cd on musical and sonic merits.  Zero stars for the MoFi vinyl remastering.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I never knew what the movie was about until it was too late, but hey, I don't mind nudity, and Helen Hunt is to be commended on her bravery to have accepted this role and done such a great job. This movie, of course, is not about corporal nudity, but about emotional nudity. The protagonist of the movie is emotionally raw (no, not like the Hulk, think more like Mother Teresa) and has some sort of Midas touch with women. I won't say more not to spoil the movie, but suffice it to say: I was surprised with and impressed and even touched by the movie.
B00C1E8E7E|1.0|WHY DO PEOPLE SUPPORT OR DIG THIS GUY? THIS ISNT MUSIC PEOPLE. I DONT GET IT. HONESTLY HE LOOKS AND ACTS LIKE A BRAT AND I WOULD PROBABLY BITCH SLAP HIM IN THE FACE IF I EVER SAW HIM. MUSIC IS SAD THESE DAYS. LOOK AT THE COVOR HE LOOKS RETARDED.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I love being on Twitter. It is so much fun to read all the happenings with people. My family likes twitter too. Thank you very much.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I like the story for its imagination and theme.  Interesting good against evil plot. Looking forward to the next book in the<br />series.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|It was a wholesome escape and a step back in time.  I loved it and watched it twice in a row!
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|I can see how some people may find it relaxing, but it was too slow for me. I uninstalled it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Will read again and again. It is different than movie, but they both are awesome<br /> Strongly recommend it to everyone
B0053KWDES|5.0|Put it with sony walkman & a pair of JVC Marshmellow earbud and you got a system.Great if you are a biker.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm big on history and this show has a little of everything in it. Romance, Suspense, History, Mystery just an overall good show
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|the movie started out pretty good. then it just started to suck. The end was the worst i have seen in a long time. My dog could have came up with a better ending. movie could have been much better.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I found out about this bag from a member of a FaceBook group called Nikon Digital Camera & Photo Enthusiasts who had great things to say about it!<br /><br />I just recently graduated to DSLR from pocket cameras and was using a Xbody bag that made my neck and back hurt like crazy after a couple of hours. Upon receiving the backpack, I loaded it up with my Nikon D40, filters, 3 pocket cameras, a tablet, 3 extra batteries, my phone, my medium tripod strapped to the side and sundry other items and realized  that I have to get a lot more stuff to even begin to fill this! Tons of room for extra lenses, another full size camera and just about anything else you can throw in it! The straps are super padded so, even if it gets a little heavy, it doesn't cut in. I spent over 5 hours and about as many miles at the UW Quad shooting the cherry trees there and not a twinge in my back or neck!<br /><br />I recommend this pack to anyone who does a lot of 'roaming' shooting or who has to transport a lot of equipment back and forth to shoots. It's really well made and, like I said, it's very comfortable! The only negative thing I've heard about it so far is that if you are a larger man or woman the straps will cut in a little and the front bracer and the waist strap won't clip.<br /><br />The friend I mentioned in the beginning of this review .. he picked up several to give as gifts! Mother's and Father's Days are coming soon!  ;)
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This movie was ok. had an ok story. just felt like if I seen this movie before just with differnt atcors. but in all it was an ok movie.
B00459GJUM|4.0|Until someone comes up with another pseudo-scientific idea as innovative as the Stargate, SF on TV is dead. The series killed itself. Hollywood writers do not understand how genius works, nor do they know how to deal with reality. Everyone who works and functions in society knows one or more with an IQ above the threshold for 'genius'. The next one you meet could be the cashier at a truck stop! Every scientist on that ship had to be some level of genius in order to qualify for a position on the project. Eli and Rush were both super-genius'. At that level, it really doesn't matter who was more intelligent. Youth has fresher ideas, but Age knows what to do with them! The end of the season was illogical --- and fatal.
B000FA675C|5.0|I don't think there is very much that I can say about this book that hasn't been said thousands of times before me.  It is a fast paced adventure that combines history and religion in a fascinating way.  Read it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the best game I have gotten on my kindle fire! LOVE it! This game is easy to understand how to play, but perfectly balanced with good challenges. Would recommend this game very highly
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I work nights and often have trouble with insomnia, I started this book at 3:00am one morning and absolutely could NOT put it down until I finished it later that day.  It is one of those books where you keep telling yourself  &#34;Ok, just one more chapter....&#34; over and over again until it is finished and you are exhausted!  There are so many unexpected twists and turns and I can't count how many times it made me cry.  This is the first book that I have read by Colleen Hoover but I will definitely be back for more.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|VOice is amazing and her live performances are better than the CD this girl has TALENT, cant be duplicated. She is def in her own lane!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a very well done movie. It is one you would want to watch more than once, so it was worth the money.
B004D0B0I4|2.0|if ur into pitchy tones, that dont sound good together. GET this CD... I only like 2 songs on this CD. The whole feel of this CD is too GENERICALLY OLD.. It seems forced.. He tried
B008Y73940|5.0|This movie is worth watching. Twists and turns in the plot keep you guessing. I would highly recommend this movie.
B002X6DQV4|5.0|this works great if you need an additional power outlet on a motorcycle lawn tractor or what ever you maybe using the charger on . Very well built and should last along time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved this show.  The actors are complex and very entertaining.  I like how the story changes with the times and follows history to some extent.
B000000OU0|5.0|What is not to like about The Eagles? This is an old favorite so I wanted the CD version to play in my car.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|I bought this CD as to copy it to SD Cards and Zip Drives. It is a good sounding disk,. Delivery was quick.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|I was lucky enough to see The Eagles in concert the year this collection was released and being promoted, finally got around to buying it...better later than not at all...
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I am a lover of flowers and did not know there was a language connected to the flowers.  Enjoyed the book and<br />also enjoyed the story of the main character.  Her journey was a good read.  From nothing to a &#34;bed of roses&#34;.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|If you love this movie, read the book Prince of Thieves, this is what the movie is based off. Cannot get enough of this movie!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good quality entertainment.  I wish there was more of this on prime time television. I can't wait to watch Season three!
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Only use when in blue or deeper water diving. The snap on feature is quite handy while other competitors products are permanent red filters or are not easy as snapping on and off. Great product
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|kids love the toys for this game. while waiting at the doctor they can play this. its a fun game for kids!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Runs good on my kindle, A good buggy racing app. Good action, and the controls work pretty good on the hd kindle.  Fans of driving apps should appreciate it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Any Mahjong game can give you hours of play and to get three stars for each game make you race your self against time! Fun and action!
B0087EACJK|3.0|It kept my attention for a few minutes. Somewhat fun but the deal was really great. I am sure I will play it again.
B004YXE438|5.0|I love doing Jigsaw Puzzle's. The graphic's on this one is great and the color's are so pretty and stand out. I love buying challenging puzzle like these. They are harder to put togethr but that is what is so challenging about these kind. I look forward to doing each one. I will do them over to try and beat my previous time. I would reccomend this game to all who love different Jigsaw Puzzle's!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|There is a reason this album is so popular. Amazon had a deal on it and I had to snatch it up.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Hate Spider's and it is a boring Solitaire for me. My Husband and I like Rainy Day Spider that they have on Pogo and also a more varible Solitaire. This is the same thing over and over. There are so many Solitaire gam's that are exciting to play. If you like playing straight Solitaire with no twist and turn's this is for you!. I returned it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this is a awesome Bible app it has so many things I share things on faceboom that really hit me. I hope you get it. There are somethings they could change because I was reading it and they had misspelled words and sentences with no spaces.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun and a time passer. It also is funny that u dressed the<br /><br />Security guard up as a bunny for Easter. Maybe you should dress him up as a<br /><br />leprechaun for the month of April. That would be funny.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Im unbiased, i dont know the arrow comic well enough to judge; but i love this show. The acting is great with some characters...  I believe.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|It is still as great as when it was first released.  I had to have it for my collection on DVD.
0307730697|5.0|What a wonderful story of an inspiring man who faced adversity and continued to live his dream and in the end paid the ultimate price for his country.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|great great great DVD we love rio in our house.  great story line, great animation, great music.  buy it for your kids today!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This isn't your typical business and technology book. Written in the form of a novel, you don't even realize that you're learning the truth about IT's impact and mission to business success.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When an author writes a continuing series, we sometimes think we've come to know the characters. We share their joy and pain.<br /><br />This third book is the final chapter of a world that we loyal readers have likely felt we've spent  a lot of time in. We have lost those dear to us, fictional of course, but their loss makes reading a series like this difficult.<br /><br />This writer has given us a conclusion that I know some people didn't understand and even fewer liked, but I couldn't see it ending any other way.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms Collins, for sharing your extraordinary adventure with us.
B004G600A4|5.0|My kids really enjoy this movie.  It's much better than some of the other movies that we have that for no reason really related to the movie have material that I do not approve of....like Ratatouille, which I would enjoy a whole lot more if I didn't have to fast forward through the gun scene in the beginning, the &#34;welcome to hell&#34; part, and the &#34;shut up and eat your garbage&#34;. My children are too impressionable and I do not want that junk repeated.  But, Tangled is fantastic!  If there's anything bad, I have missed it, thus far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've seen this series on the best sellers list for a long time & thought about buying them, but held off. I ended up see part of the movie & wanted to know more about the story. I'm so glad I finally bought this. The story is so original you can't predict what will happen! Katniss Everdeen is a strong rebelious girl living in a very different world than what we live in. Can you imagine children being forced to kill other children in a deadly game for there to be only one winner? I'm glad the story is fiction & not real!
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is really nice to have, I love it ,it is big and I can see it , this work well with my kindle,thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This 2nd story in the series is even better than the 1st (Hunger Games)! I couldn't put it down! Instead of life getting better for Katniss & Peeta after being winning tributes, it only gets worse! Katniss is a force to be reconned with. Her willingness to keep her's, Gale & Peeta and their families alive are her only objectives. Can't believe the way it ended! I'm onto the 3rd, The Mockingjay.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely love this show and can't get enough! I highly recommend wAtching this show.  I am Looking so forward to the next season!
0307010856|5.0|Both of my kids (20 months and 3 yr) love this book. It is definitely read at least every other day and we have a ton of books. For sure one of the top 5 books in the house. I would recommend it!
B00B5P37IG|2.0|can not get half the stuff a person might want to look at..not happy w/ item....can not get the USA item to come in and to much stuff I don't care for.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This movie exceeds my expectations. It was an older movie so I expected some defects...BUT THERE WERE NONE!!!! The box was also in perfect condition. Speedy delivery. Perfect transaction!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love Christopher Eccleston on the Dr, he is gorgeous and charming.<br />Rose Tyler is a wonderful companion, smart and courageous!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I always imagined what Transformers would be like if it became real, and these movies were pretty much exactly what I imagined as a kid.  The stories get a little stretched, and the love angle is overused in a lot of movies these days, but all in all these are fun movies with great visual effects.
B0087EACJK|4.0|If you are bored and are wanting something to keep you entertained, this will do it. Also it makes you use your brain to figure out where the pieces go enjoy.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|My 3 year old loves watching it over and over again. It's been restored but there are still parts that look outdated. It's a Disney movie though so the story/music is still very fun and relevant.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|I had seen the previews before the show had started & really wanted to watch it! I never got to watch but was so excited when I found it available on Amazon PRIME! So with no additional cost (plus no commercials) I will be able to catch up with the still running show!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it definitely takes a certain kind of interest to really get into this game, but once I started it I loved it!! the only issue that I have is forgetting about the one-time add at the beginning and slowing the game process down by clicking it accidentally.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am enjoying the Downton Abbey series  - will probably purchase them all.  This is one to be watched again.
B000FP2KH6|1.0|You sent me the wrong item .-. there wasn't the Japanese one but the normal one and the case was broken. I cannot send it back but I'm so disappointed about!
B006OOHYIC|2.0|I do like the game but I can't get past certain levels no coins.  Reluctantly joined facebook. to get hints.<br />Went to quell reflect on facebook no hints. Guess I'll just delete the program.  Only spent 99&cent; and got that much fun out of it. Quell original had hints on line and I solved every puzzle with a perfect score. Won't do that with reflect. Certainly will not buy the next one.
B004478AS4|5.0|The man who took on Joseph Conrad's  Dark Heart writes of  colonial smothering of personhood with  his power and lingering imagery.  He helps us see the hunt through the eyes of the lion.  Enough writers have us look through the eyes of the hunter.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|...Applies across the board! Its timeless! Read it to your children - and do the characters with different voices!!!  (-:
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|kinda far out there and a lot of violence but an overall good read.  glad it had an ending. recommended
B005NJU8PA|4.0|i found it very illustrative, its a thoroughh essay in the habilities basic to being a cook, with a pinch of the usual Tm Ferris craziness
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|I love this notepad. I love the fact that I could write in my own handwriting and I can send it to Evernote :)
B008OOYALE|3.0|The game has addictive but slow paced.food is far to expensive and there should be more ways to earn gold rather then real money other and include more then just breed this Dragon with that Dragon,but other then that highly addictive
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I love the LOTR trilogy, but the animated version released in the '70s was always my favorite and I am so glad they are remaking them!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This  was one case where the movie was better than the book. The book got rather boring to me, while the movie was great.
B005HNMPBM|5.0|This is my favorite x-men movie, with x-men origins coming in close to this one.  Pretty cool to see how they all come together.
B0091WKXKU|5.0|Characters seemed sincere, plot was good, very authentic flick.  I'd give it a 8.5/10.  It was worth the price. word.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Been a fan since the Mickey Mouse Club!! LMBO!! Yep that long and JT just keeps getting better and better like fine wine!<br />Every track on this album is awesome!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Notebooks is easy to use. It gives you instructions on how to use this app when you begin.<br /><br />You can<br />-draw pictures<br />-make graphs<br />-have a audio reader<br />-and take notes<br />but the graphing and drawing is kinda hard, press the pen writing in red ink to see it, it is hard to use that feature.
B0086700CM|5.0|Looking for mindless entertainment, with no thought involved?  This game is for you.  It is a fun way to kill time and not have to think.
B0064W667Y|5.0|Enjoy it alot! A very nice read! Really cool story and can't wait to read others! Awesome pictures and graphics
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Ok so I paid to rent this film from Amazon, however, I get this error that says it is having problems running the film. The darn thing is running behind the error message! And so when I refresh, I head to my video library since I've already paid for the film and it's not there. Looks like a waste of $5. I might just stick with Netflix...
B005LAII08|5.0|My wife and daughter love this movie and love watching it together.  We saw it at the theater, but it is worth having to watch again and again.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Arrived quickly. Packaged well. Bought as a birthday present for husband. Cheaper here than in stores. We both enjoyed the movie.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Applied the new update.  Really think I'll like it, but for now the main radar will not load.<br />The snapshots of different locations works, but none of the moving radar maps will come up!<br />Tried uninstalling and re-installing, but maps still not working on my android phone.<br />Had no trouble with the older version.<br />May have to go with someone else if it can't be fixed.  :(
B00873GRU4|5.0|This takes a little while to 'get into', as the premis is not quite clear as to where they are and why.  But stick with it and the story evolves and builds momentum.  Characters become clear and the book becomes one hard to put down.  A logical ending leads into the second book in this series (just released) and it will be interesting to see if there is enough new material and scenarios to maintain the interest.  Hopefully not too much climbing up and down silo levels!<br />Do grab this book, you will not be disappointed.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is a good game as far as it goes.  I'm more of a word game person.  I loved the novelty of it at first, but it is just not my kind of game.  Tip:  on your tablet, shrink the screen so you can see the target when releasing the bird.
B0087EACJK|3.0|Could see how it's fun for some, but there was nothing to bring me into the game and truly enjoy it.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Amazion was having difficulties after I paid. I paused the movie and was never able to restart it. I called but just got a message stating that they were having tech problems. So they charged me and I never got to watch the movie.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|It was an awesome game, and way cool.  But with only two levels I think it falls severely short among other apps today.  I was able to get all stars on all levels in two days.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first and has a lot of variety in different environments and power-up strategies to keep you on your toes. If you need to kill some time, this is a great app to do it with.
B00138KE5Y|5.0|Any fan of Barbra will love this. These are the duets edition which, in some songs, I never knew she did. It was refreshing to hear the old favourites with some newer artists. All of them keeping with signature Barbra. Johnny Mathis, Barry Manilow, Donna Summer, Ray Charles, Judy Garland, Josh Groban, Barry Gibb, etc.. Very worth the price for 19 tracks on this collection. Get it. You'll be glad you did. And how can you not love the cover photo!
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|The graphics and game play are cute but it became repetitive and boring after a few minutes. Didn't feel anything keeping me to want to play the next level.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|As a fan of the Pet Shop Boys since West End Girls, they have always been ahead of the music scene. They started releasing albums of B-sides because they had so much music that people never heard. It also put it all together as opposed to trying to hunt down rareities and limited editions that they are know for. Format is their latest collection of great music that sounds pretty damn good. Some songs you may recognize, and the rest you'll just dance to. It took me a while to find this CD and it is worth it.
B00B6OEDS4|4.0|The soft and steady harmonious elevated vocals over well blended piano, trumpet, and violin give Rhye's debut album \\"Woman\\" a beautiful and refined sound, befitting its subject matter. Singles \\"Open\\" and \\"The Fall\\" begin the album delightfully as smiling and smitten lover's requests- \\"Don't close your eyes, stay open\\" and \\"Don't run away, don't slip away.\\" We feel the passion of the couple, the slide of the violins reminisce lover's touch and the cool organ the layer of contemplation and rest in bed afterward. The strongest musical element is the feminine voice that hums along with the music and brings us into this deep, jazzy love affair. Out of respect for the singer's intent for the audience to focus on the music instead of the member's identities I won't reveal names and I enjoy the music more not thinking about distracting personal particulars. If you MUST know, check out the \\"Pitchfork\\" interview ([...]).<br /><br />The voice is perfectly pitched/mixed and in tune marvelously with the supporting bevy of instruments. On \\"One of Those Summer Days\\", the song that led me to return to the album again and again, most instrumentation is stripped away and we are left with the echo of the singer's ode to a summer day, \\"one of those pretty, summer, summer days.\\" I imagine myself in a hammock in the garden in the late afternoon, an oft sought after memory and emotion. On songs like \\"Last Dance\\" and \\"Hunger\\" the beat picks up and we get an 80s sketch dance rhythm that is different enough from the more delicate songs to offer variety but not so different as to take away from the album's core sensibility. \\"Woman\\" is the last song on the album, it is basically instrumental as the vocals are non-literal, and with the backing cyclical digital beat I feel as if I am reveretly watching the female form in slow motion like \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", contemplating its processes and its place in my hurried life.<br /><br />This album makes me miss the tender embrace of my girlfriend, and Rhye's quote from the Pitchfork interview echoed this. \\"I hate that music is so debaucherous these days. It's all overly sexualized in a perverse way. Love is beautiful, and sex is beautiful, and I don't think those things should be shown in a grotesque way. I'm just attempting to express love and sensuality in a very honest way.\\" Well done Rhye.'s quote from the Pitchfork interview echoed this. \\"I hate that music is so debaucherous these days. It's all overly sexualized in a perverse way. Love is beautiful, and sex is beautiful, and I don't think those things should be shown in a grotesque way.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|The other day I took the Kindle from my kid and tried to get this game off the screen. Imagine my surprise when there was no way to do it (except turn the device off). Mediocre game (nothing to write home about) and either poor of willfully malevolent programming to lock up the screen or not offer an explicit and obvious exit option.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I like it, but if I don't wear it for 24 hours, since it is automatic, it goes dead and loses time!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app its so fun but it is defenently addictive I play it 24/7 when ever I can and yes I have a life but since I can bring it with me I can play it while having fun.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really lived the book it was my favorite book!!!<br />I wish there were more books. Otherwise great!!<br />Sad but happy nice way to get people to read
B00BI73CVI|2.0|its not that it was bad, it was really, really bad... kept trying to watch thinking it would get better, ended up just watching something else. super dissapointed since it had a good cast and cinematography was great, just the singing was kinda so so and it was very slow paced...
B0047O2FDA|4.0|It takes some getting used to cooking without flour, eggs or milk.  The recipes are good, but some just didn't turn out no matter how many times I tried, like the icing recipes they were like sugared water, way too runny.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I liked the book but thought the author repeated himself often and went into very technical detail that the average reader who is not tech savy would understand.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I couldn't put this one down, loved the book, wish there were more out there like it, but then I like the dystopian books<br />:-)
B003OUXECE|5.0|This is by far the best video game companion novel I have ever read. Its an in depth look at the world of rapture falling apart previous to the events of bioshock and is excellent for filling in any details in story line you may want more background on. Its written welll enough it could be read as a novel on its own without caring about the game itself.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well-developed game. Great graphics. Great sound. The designs for the horses and the details in the graphics themselves are extremely good considering this is a free game. Overall, very successful.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I think this book was really well written and look forward to reading other books by this author in the future.
B00BVVA138|5.0|Siiiiick riffs, awesome melodic screams and more metal than your momma's kettle. A must buy.  Not thrilled with the CD price for a digital copy.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Thanks, as soon as I got it I immediately play it. New songs to get to use too. DM forever
B006RBZV82|5.0|The photography is beautiful.  I would have preferred to only have Johnny Depp's voice instead of going back and forth from a woman to a man.  If you just in a relaxing mood, grab a glass of wine or a cup of coffee and enjoy this amazing film.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|After the prior books of the series, this one is constant action and twists. A great addition to the series.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|This movie is boring and makes Denzel Washington look bad - a flagrant drug, alcohol, and sex abuser, as well as a serial liar. If I was Allstate Insurance I'd stop using him as a spokeperson.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|Solid kids movie for Easter. Animation & real people kills it every time. It stars the Big Bang Theory's Katie
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Nice to have more of a complete calculator.  This is it.  Works nicely with no problems so far.  Will update this posting if anything changes.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book created tension and fear from start to finish.  The ending caused the most tension as the book had no ending.  Don't read this book before going to sleep!

076115728X|5.0|Such a fantastic book with a great message, plus it's interactive, which my 21 month old loves (and he also liked in when he was a bit younger).  Also love Arlo Needs Glasses, by the same author (which is how I found this book).
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is a great game that's free don't listen to people who says that there are inappropriate ads on it but just deal it's great for entertaining yourself in a long car ride or home sick it's great and entertaining
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great free app for a nice game. Only downside is the advertisement between each hand, would not recommend for children because of that....otherwise it runs smoothly. If adds bug you I do not recommend, May be better to purchase to avoid the slight annoyance.
0880796863|3.0|I have been a reader since 1993. I have seen many types of the Rider - Waite deck, but I didn't like this deck. I may know every card by heart, but this deck was sloppy if you ask me. The artwork on each card is blobbed together. I will keep this deck, but would never use them, unless I really, really had to. I recommend getting yourself another deck of Rider - Waite besides this deck.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|No better cast on television with seamless writing, production and directing. Chicago!!!!  Who would have thought the windy city could go uncredited and speak volumes as the voiceless cast member.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This headset is amazing. It makes playing xbox live come to life! I highly recommend purchasing this Turtle Beach headset!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Wow I was hesitant at first because I didn't think it would work.  It is very easy to use and is loud and clear.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were great, it got me horny as hell, now I want to create my own red room.  Just waiting for E. L James to come out with another book love you girl.  Keep doing your thing.
B0035XQW74|5.0|I cant believe i never had heard of this movie. I bought it on a recommendation from a friend and have already watched it twice
B004MYF4SS|5.0|As per the review on The Chessmen. I couldn't put it down.The Lewis Man, no.1 in the trilogy is equally engrossing with the added attraction of starting off in Edinburgh.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is Amazing, shows a real life potrayal of a wife and the issues she must overcome and conquer.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|To be straight forward...I love the walking dead. Seasons 1-2 are by far my upmost favorite. There was nothing I found even remotely wrong or frustrating or annoying. Of course I can pinpick little details in season 3 that get on my nerves slightly..such as the focus on the governor and Woodbury/Andrea. It seems like slowly they draw the focus off the main cast (rick and the group) I understand the governor is the main antagonist but really they could at least even it out or put the focus mainly on the lead roles from the 1st 2 seasons. That's mainly the only things I disliked about season 3. Although there are annoyances, this season of the walking dead holds up to it's previous episodes. I think they did a phenomenal job as always. The only other thing I have to say is that season 3's finale is indeed a letdown. I won't spoil it for anyone that didn't see or read. But they really get you excited and crazy over the 3rd finale. Then it's just a big pile of boredom. I recommend this season to anyone who enjoys the show definitely, and advise you to see the 4th season when it releases in october!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I enjoyed season three much more than season two.  While it doesn't follow the graphic novels exactly, the main plot elements are all still there.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|Within' the top 3 Zep albums, just an amazing feel to this album. One can only hope for a reunion tour someday ;-)
B000QRIGLC|2.0|Too much political right-wing religious zealot commentary..terrible writing style and worst of all... somewhat unbelievable accounts of happenings...okay but not recommended...seemed to have movie screenplay written all over it
030758836X|5.0|Loved the book so much that I couldn't put it down!  Very cleverly written and a surprise at every turn.
B008220C38|3.0|Wright and Stoppard make a fascinating attempt at the classic, turning the story into a lush spectacle instead of a character driven narrative. It was enjoyable watching the director further develop techniques he'd used years earlier in Pride & Prejudice and I absolutely loved the stage framing and model work. Sadly, with two exceptions, casting was a big detraction from the film (most particularly unconvincing is a young and wavering Aaron Johnson). Although few could ever seem as perfect for the titular character as Vivien Leigh, Knightley acquits herself well, only occasionally feeling overwhelmed in the role. Domhnall Gleeson's Levin is probably the strongest casting choice, but here the filmmakers seem at a loss over Levin's earnest melancholy, and turn the character into someone at times awkwardly cartoonish. Overall Anna Karenina is a beautiful, if emotionally weak effort that is well worth a one time view.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the flexibility to pick what music I wake up to, the different faces of the clock, the other music they offer is also really nice and soothing.  I'm thrilled!  I was very sick of my smart phone alarm!  :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect for when you are bored and have time to kill. This is one of my favorite classic games. And once I start playing its hard to stop
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Storm of Swords is the best book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire...and that says a lot! ASOIAF is hands down the best series I have ever read, and I read a lot. This book will not disappoint you!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The Game of Thrones are a must read series for sure! I seriously couldn't put them down. I hope this series never ends.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|First let me start with the positives:  The device is easy to set up, simply plug and play.  It sounds fantastic, the surround sound works great and voice chat works fine, too.  It fits well, is very comfortable.<br /><br />And then the device starts to crackle and pop.  It's irritating.  Gaming requires good sound on a constant basis, but when the sound drops even for brief seconds, that's the difference between life and death in games.  Another problem is the horrible battery life.  It kills batteries faster than a fat kid kills a box of doughnuts.<br /><br />It's sad that something that sounds and feels so good is so broken.  Such a waste of 150 bucks.  Think I'm going to have to find a better company for gaming headsets.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for compact size and light weight for a survival kit.  It fits the bill on both and sharpens a knife well.  As with most of these kind of sharpeners, if you are trying to fix a messed up or improperly sharpened blade...it won't work.  It is a maintenance type of sharpener.

B00787IR2Q|5.0|Original and light-hearted film appropriate for older elementary and up. Plenty of action and just enough suspense. My daughter enjoyed it!
0143122061|1.0|This is another anti-west, pro-china tirade from an author that clearly suffers from post-empire guilt complex.<br />One can only wonder if Ferguson and other authors are ever going to stop vilifying the west and singing the praises of oriental civilizations. This book advances the most ridiculous arguments to justify the \\"temporary\\" superiority of the western civilization, in their minds no doubt an historical mistake that will quickly be corrected.<br />Another question is if Ferguson ever plans to write a new book. This is a book that, by my account, the author has already writen a couple of times before, not counting many articles he published rehashing the same tirades.<br />The tragedy is that Ferguson has all the elements to become a great historian. Rather, he has decided to go for the money by being the chief editor of the National Inquirer Historical Edition.<br />A complete waste of money.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The movie is great. I can not wait till the next one. Peter Jackson did a great job. Thank. You
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Game is good I play it with my daughter and we both have lots of fun. Makes time fly on by...
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|Story line is bad. Cinematography, Special Effects and Stunts scene were bad too. I was misled by the trailer showing faster action scenes.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi Hendrix is my favorite guitarist...BIG time.  Any new Hendrix-related music is a guaranteed purchase for me and PH&A is no exception.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Anything to do with Lincoln and I'm there. Great reenactment. Have done all the tours associated with Lincoln and Booth. Will watch again.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I insisted on a .99 cent credit- I hated the app- did not work at all in New York City- it appears to be some sort of (in the words of Bill O'Reilly) &#34;Bible Thumping&#34; app- directing you mainly to &#34;Bible&#34; stations- C'mon- why the &#34;heck&#34; is it being sold out side of the South?<br />(Words self censored for general viewing!)
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Always meant to watch the series. Cannot believe they cancelled this show in its infancy. Cannot wait to watch the rest of the series now.
B00AY7Q01C|4.0|I heard good things about this documentary, so thought I'd give it a try. I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. On one hand it's a very inspiring story but on the other hand it's frustrating to see how nice people are taken advantage of. Not to give too much of the story away but the next documentary I'd like to see would be one that follows Clarence, as he loses all of his wealth, becomes homeless, and whose kids abandon him because he has no morals and only got to where he was by cheating and lying.
B005K17RU0|4.0|New update kinda confusing overall a good app when you're on the go I would recommend this app to my friends
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun...will keep.  you entertained .  I would recommend. I play for about 30 min everyday. you get more coins daily
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this one best of all.  Really wishing and hoping for a book four.  The whole trilogy was great and I am not a big book reader, but couldn't put these down.  Going to read again.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Les Mis is my favorite play and I have seen it many times.  I was concerned about how much a<br />Big Screen version would be loyal to the stage version. This movie surpassed my expectations.<br />The actors and staging were excellent. The ability of the camera to get in close to the actors<br />added an immediacy and intimacy that surpassed the stage version. Which is something I<br />have not seen before, usually the &#34;live &#34; actors win out.<br />They stayed very close to the original script; there were a few additions<br />but these actually added to the story. Even though this was about the 6-7th time I have seen<br />Les Mis, the additions added things that explained and tied together events I had not<br />understood very well in the stage version.  I loved it and would highly recommend it.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I had liked the show when I started watching it on Netflix. It was fast paced, suspensful and a little edgy.  after watching season 2 and getting caught up on the show I am now hoping for a fast way for it to end with Emili completing her original goal.
B005LJITS0|3.0|disappointed that my favorite young (using the term loo<br />sely)<br />actor is not enough to carry this washed out comic remake. seriously?

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing show. Addictive for sure. I find this time period in history so interesting and I think the show is spot on with the dress, manners and societal class rules of that period. Excellent.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|But that is only by the standards of Mr. Tarantino's other work, of which I'm also a fan.<br /><br />Uniform great acting all around, down to the smallest of the supporting cast.<br /><br />I've never been a big Jamie Fox fan, but I thought he did a great, understated job in this role.  It was fun seeing Don Johnson on the screen again - wish his character had played a larger part in the course of the film.<br /><br />But I was especially impressed with Samuel L. Jackson's turn as the treacherous brothel manager - he's been one of my favorite actors for 20 years, but this role was right up there with his performance in Pulp Fiction - actually, IMO better.  I can't believe he was not nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this.  I thought Waltz was excellent as well but I would have given the nod to Mr. Jackson between the two.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent way to spend 2 hours and 45 minutes - usually I'd consider that a bit long, but in this case it was just right.

B003PPDBQ2|3.0|Held my interest, but not enough to look for other books by this author.  The subject matter wasn't to my own taste.
B00BNTJG84|5.0|I absolutely adore this book and I've read it many times over the years! It is well written and the suspense is still good no matter how many times I've read it! I was so happy when a Kindle edition was released. I look forward to reading it again and again!
B003B5M0PO|5.0|Couldn't put it down, and wa surprised to find it was written for children.  As usual the book was better than the movie.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|To sum it up, two and a half hours of people talking politics in front of a fire place. No great epic story, very boring really. I expected a lot more considering the cast,director,and producer. Pass on this one.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Sweet deal I give it an a a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a a
0307346617|2.0|This really comes down to personal taste, I personally would never read or enjoy any book written this way, I never felt engaged in what I was reading because it felt like there was no development. However I have other friends that loved it. Just not my style.
B003UBTX72|5.0|This book was very enjoyable, well written.Keith tells it like it was, no holding back.You feel like you're on the journey of life with him.
0061726826|5.0|I have never picked up a book written by lauren Oliver. I love love loved this book. I like the plot and I am so excited to read the rest of the series.
B005FL8HCC|2.0|I ordered it and it came quicker then expected and that was good, but it did not work in my xbox or dvd player, I had to play it on the computer instead, which was a bummer
B00571F26Y|4.0|I found the book to be compelling and worth further investigation. I understand the concern and do wonder about the impact that genetically modified products have on us. I won't completely redo my diet but I would consider decreasing my exposure to wheat products. I'm sure there are those with intolerances of that protein that may not have all of the drastic clinical signs outlined in the book.
B002MFWLXK|4.0|This a very good movie that involves the viewer to recall those times in politics and the significant historic events that each of us must take to heart and pray for insight that they do not repeat
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Its crazy that as long as T.I has been around, and as much older as he is compared to all the new young rappers out there that he is still such a great rapper. I was very impressed...his true skills and time he puts into every track really shows on this album...
B006FXF9GQ|5.0|This is probably the most timeless album I can think of.  I was 17 the first time I heard this record (yes, back then it was a \\"record\\") and it is still so lyrically and musically perfect, at times humorous, and also soulful and wrenching. I have been a MF fan for all of these years and this is still on the top of the heap of all of his work.
0345803485|4.0|I liked this book, it was kinda steamy, and kept me interested in what the heck Christian was going to do next !!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not as well written as Gone Girl.  Too many characters with weird problems; its depressing to read about so many sick people in one place.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I usually don't like reading books after so much hype but after getting addicted to the first as soon as I finished that I had to buy the 2nd straight away

B001NLKXK2|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Fast pace reading with plenty of information for your own knowledge, a heart warming story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Some of the negative comments about this series  made me skeptical about wasting my time. I'm glad I decided to find out for myself, and enjoyed them immensely. It was great to read all three books in a row.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is my favorite out of the big fish game. I love mysteries like these mystery games are beast and I love this game...sort of creepy but awesome...people...I...don't...think....you'll...dislike this game.....I think u will love it...trust me....people who don't like this...maybe u don't like mystery games I don't read minds...but first try the free version and then if u think it's worth it buy it. Trust me thus is creepy and fun have to LUV this :)
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Good film overall but slow moving at times and slightly broken consistency.  Not up to par with the original series.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Loved it. Should be shown in schools as part of our Nation's history. Would recommend for all ages.  Portrayal of the times enlightening .
B007REV4YI|4.0|Slow to develop and bumpy transitions with some over the top ballistics.  For a Bond film it is not the tops but not the bottom either.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Fabulous Movie !!  I am not a big movie watcher and was very<br />Intrigued watching this movie. Robin Williams is Incredible .
B005HV6Y84|2.0|Maybe its my age, but I was disappointed with the cd except for the Bruno Marrs title.  I wish I had listened to this first.  I'll give to my niece since she is a fan of the movies.
B00AZLBIAA|1.0|Gave me the wrong passwords and everything in it didn't work.  Would be a great App if it worked correctly.
1938750977|3.0|Her Sweetest Downfall is set in Regency England, in a paranormal world of shifters, fae and immortal elementals called Cruor (who share common traits with vampires). The story introduces us to Ophelia, a ladies maid who discovers a strange mark of an ouroboros on her neck that she desperately tries to conceal, fearing persecution. Shortly after, Ophelia meets Ethan, a mysterious man who changes her life forever. When she learns the truth behind her mark and is thrown into a world she thought was only myth, Ophelia will have to make the ultimate sacrifices in order to fulfill her destiny.<br /><br />This is my first time reading Rebecca Hamilton's writing and I must say I was intrigued by her elaborate world building and characters. Ophelia is a strong and determined heroine who is easy to connect with, she might be naive to the paranormal world around her but she's no shrinking violet. The leading man, Ethan was a good blend of alpha and gentleman, a real charmer.<br /><br />While I wanted to learn more about these two characters, the author gave us just enough to become invested in Ophelia and Ethan's future. I'm really not a fan of an instant romance, but it's not a huge deal breaker for me when I'm reading a short story. Villains always add an element of suspense and Ms. Hamilton flawlessly weaves a sprinkle of \\"bad guys\\" into the story for an action packed plot.<br /><br />Readers who are new to this series (like me) will devour this story, craving more and existing fans will get to know more of Ms. Hamilton's fantastic supernatural world!<br /><br />{I received a complimentary copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.}
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One complaint with the show - Stop killing characters off after you redeem them!!!!  Other than that, awesome.  I love Andrew Lincoln as Rick and David Morrissey is fantastic as the evil Governor.  In fact, the whole cast is pretty spot on.  I could get nitpicky if I wanted I'm sure, but T.V. is supposed to entertain me and this show does that exceedingly well.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|Don't get your panties in a bunch about the music of the Beatles being used this way. It's a good, fun movie with a lot of memorable moments. &#34;I came in through the bathroom window&#34; LOL. And the Mr. Kite number...this is a blast...
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Although I thought she was rather kooky I always liked Shirley MacLaine and never missed one of her movies. But after reading her daughter's story, which is really a tale of horrific neglect by her famous mother and her dad, I don't think I'll ever see another Shirley MacLaine movie. What mother would send her two-year-old daughter--although MacLaine often said Sacha was six at the time--half-way around the world to live with her not so admirable father and his Japanese mistress, who hated the child? MacLaine said she did it because she didn't want her child raised in Hollywood with all its temptations, because her dad was sick and needed her, and because the Mob had threatened to kidnap her, none of which were true. Sacha'a dad, Steve Patker, a shadowy figure, was supposedly a producer and lived the high life, but was actually a con man. Nevertheless Sacha loved him because he was her dad and constantly strove for his approval, even when he called her \\"Idiot\\", wouldn't let her read books, and came close to sexually abusing her. Although she traveled back to L. A. from time to time to see her mom, and frequently visited movie sets, attended Hollywood parties, and met many celebrities such as Sinatra and the Rat Pack, she never knew who she really was or where she belonged. She attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland, but when she graduated and yearned to go to college, her rich mom refused to send her and announced that from that point on she was on her own. To support herself Sacha worked as a waitress, became an airlines stewardess, and suffered through several disastrous love affairs. before coming back to Malibu to be near her mom and start an acting career. She has appeared in several movies and gotten good reviews, but she was always haunted and tormented by the unanswered questions of her childhood. Finally she begged her mother to tell her the truth. The revelation was eye-popping and almost unbelievable as MacLaine confessed how her husband and his clone, who she absolutely believed in, swindled her out of millions of dollars through the years. It's an incredible story, yet in spite of her pain and sense of betrayal, Sacha still loves her mom. Today as the mother of two children she adores and with a successful career, she seems to have found a measure of peace--which is a miracle considering what she went through growing up.his clone, who she absolutely believed in, swindled her out of millions of dollars through the years.

B009OYSFDM|3.0|A little campy, but fun. Helps to remember the comic roots when things get ridiculous. Love me some vigilante archery action.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are utterly adorable together, but this is not your typical saccharin love story.  Sweet, heartbreaking, depressing and uplifting all rolled together in a witty non-linear storyline.  Makes you want to go out and watch every movie these two have ever made.
0399226907|5.0|This is a great story for little ones!  The color graphics are wonderful.<br />All of Eric Carle books are amazing.
B007SXB498|5.0|What is there to say?  Austen has a way of telling a story that grips the reader and doesn't let go.  I am a hopeless  romantic and this book fit the bill.  I was just sorry when I finished the book.  Like I am with all good books, I want them to go on forever.
B0087EACJK|4.0|I like this game.  It's a lot of fun and simple to learn.  Hope they come out with more titles and hopefully a sequel.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I read this book at least every two years and never tire of the story or Bronte's ability to hold my attention.  A classic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book. Very life changing. Helps you get a better perspective of life and how valuable it can be. This book made me feel like I was living the whole story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am absolutely hooked, and I think the seasons just keep getting better and better! I only wish it was free with my Prime membership.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is an awesome and challenging game for FREE DOWNLOAD. you can get jet packs and you get power ups and lots of cool and exiting things. I love this game and I think that you should try it. The best game ever made in history.............. in my opinion.
B0035S996U|3.0|No oscar awards here, but if you want an original movie you get it here. Just a cool movie, good musical score also!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome, like crazy addictive. I love how it changes settings I only wish it would've been created sooner. Lol where have you been all my life!!!
B000CNESU8|1.0|What I did see of the movie was incredibly offensive. Partly because of the crass language but mostly because I couldn't find one character with enough redeeming qualities for me to care about them. That being said, there were also some hard truths yet to be digested. I will never watch it again but the message is still being evaluated in my brain and I have no doubt that a positive change will come from it all (at least in my little life). Thank you for the opportunity to give my opinion. Kathi
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game ever. I love this game so much I play this game all the time and this is my favorite game
B000025U2V|5.0|Very much enjoy the cd at home and the tape in my car. Next to The Radios, Simply Red is one of my favorite groups. Thanks for giving me many memorable hours of great music. Kathi
B00187WOXA|5.0|This movie is a great movie.  My friend has always wanted to see this movie and for some reason it is extremely hard to find.  The movie is a nice movie if you are into the whole older style premise.  Not really for a family movie though.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I think many of the Kindle books are SERIOUSLY overpriced and that is a problem. I waited for the price on this to finally drop to $7.99, it's a terrific book-5 Stars to the book. It was great being able to read it on my KIndle. Just wish the Kindle book prices would all go down, and more quickly!!
B009329Y30|4.0|This movie was purchased as a gift for a close gf of mine, she loves Nick Sparks books and she indicated that this movie does a pretty good job of following the book. The main charcaters performances are very much like the intent of the book and overall the book to movie transition was well done.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is written for those of us who love nature and truth. You can read what life was like so many years ago, and find that our humanity is still the same. We are all one. The story contains eloquent prose.
B00APACSJG|5.0|This is certainly a worthy sequeal to all the other Vorkosigan books that have preceeded. I enjoyed it and as always, am looking forward to the next Miles Vorkosigan adventure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well first off, it doesn't need Wi-Fi so you never have to worry about that. Second it keeps you occupied for literally HOURS so that's pretty cool. And third YOU can play with people like on pc and Xbox! But honestly In my opinion I think it needs more updates so buy it's amazing!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Loved the costumes.  Actors are magnificent and the storyline is compelling.  I would highly recommend this series to any Downton Abbey fan!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best trilogies I've ever read!! It keeps you at the edge of your seat unable to put down =)
B008B92U32|1.0|This app distorted most of the faces and just didn't work as described.  I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story expressed the hardship of being an orphan during the depression years and how the gentleman coped with this life.
B002361MLA|5.0|These words are magic! I will read this book many times and recommend it to all who may have even a slight interest!
B0087EACJK|3.0|This game isn't awful, but I would have to be extremely bored to play it for a long period of time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great great show. I love it. I never want it to end. Please keep it going.<br /><br />Telling me how many words I have to write will get you a bad review next time.or no review at all.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I really enjoy this show, but I feel it has too much contrived conflicts. I wish it were a bit lighter in tone, but it is still a great series, and I hope there will be a Season Two. I don't really need all the flashbacks to the island, but I guess they have a purpose.
0307477479|3.0|My wife got me this book. I must say it sounded great on paper--at least the premise did since I had lived through the era and had spent considerable time in the Bay Area. I am also a wanna be musician. The author has a wonderful imagination and she is obviously a solid writer. But I just couldn't finish the book. It did not keep my attention. It frustrated me. I moved on. Here's why: first, it simply moved so fast that I never became connected to any of the characters- I couldn't find any depth or develope any real empathy for the people in the story. The detail is pretty amazing but it is simply overloaded. Every line packs more info. Secondly, and this is really connected to that original idea, the writing is like a knife- it just keeps ripping. It never slows down to soak in the surrounding's. I have no idea how the cast goes to Africa on a Safari and it could just as easily have been to the local museum ( minus the lion). The location meant very little really. The pace is so hectic that the reader is just burrowing through it attempting to stay attached and involved. When bad things happened I just didn't care very much. It was like a one liner in the NYPost. And this might sound crazy but--there wasn't one memorable/ blow me away line--I mean one line that just stops you in your tracks and makes you reread it 4 or 5 times  because it so spot on, so beautiful, so insanely well written, so special that you just wanna see it again (think of Charles Frazier, Pat Conroy, Hemmingway...). I need a great story!Yes! But I also need characters with depth and writing that just carries me away--instead of running me over. I applaud the author for a first class mind and a wild story...wish I could have enjoyed it more. I'm sure some will disagree- I just love getting to know characters ...I love when the book/ story ends and I feel so bummed that it's not still rolling along...with this book I simply had to bolt.
B007PKOKTK|3.0|It was a cute idea, but it was just kind of blah.  The plot was poorly developed...the Marsden character just suddenly has a change of heart...it was very abrupt and didn't seem to fit the situation.  I know it is a kids movie, but if you measure against Ice Age, Toy Story, Mulan, etc. it has a very weak plot.
B009JZVT70|4.0|It helps to know and have read the fairy tales, nursery rhymes, etc. you heard as a child.<br /><br />The most prominent of them is Snow White in this series. The second season carries on where the first left off, filling in blank spots here and there.  It becomes addictive in a way hard to explain. The character know they were in a fairy tale and by a curse, came to a place where magic is lost.  They were not happy about that, but hey, such is life in the new world, Storybook, where they and we live.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Although the movie was long and tedious at times, I found it to be well done, and another reminder of the brutality of inequality and war.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great great game get it is worth the 0 dollars  you should get this game right now stop reading this and start downloading this game
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We were hooked from the very first episode.  This show is so well cast and well acted that you just get caught up in the story of all their lives.  Well defined characters lead the way through a quality script.  When we finish one episode we're already looking forward to watching the next.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Wonderful depiction of a functional alcholic.  Not condoning it, but it was wonderful to see how he woke up and landed that plane with minimal loss of life.  I don't understand why he went to jail, when as he stated, 'it was a broken plane' which they proved.  How he flew that plane was wonderfully.  But going to jail was the best thing to happen to him, it gave him an opportunity to bless someone with his experience.  I enjoyed the movie.
B0080MJYR0|2.0|Thought it would be fun to watch and, yes, had a few laughs.  But Oh. My. God.<br />Forget the past is sometimes the best thing to do...
B003O86FMW|3.0|I prefer the 1st and 3rd book over this, too much complex feelings that made me not comfortable and too much stuff just to filling the book
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I have been impressed with Taylor since she was a little girl starting out.  She has a crazy good knack for crafting and delivering catchy songs that tug at your heartstrings.  I have had mixed feelings about her lean away from country towards pop, but I got over myself and allowed her to have her own artistic journey.  Once I did that, I could just enjoy the country-pop for what it was and has become.  This album in particular tells her views on and experiences with young, reckless, crazy love. She is very specific about her intent in the liner notes.  She is honest, foibles and all.  She makes great music.
B00BF11STU|4.0|The movie was a sad story of gorilla warfare in a urban environment facing political uncertainty in a number of dark distance circles involving US officials and CIA officials.  In the end justice did prevail in the mist of revenge and death.  A story of war with no clear winner only hurt and destruction.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Don't even pause for a moment before buying this album.  So entertaining.  Clever.  Fun.  Dramatic.  Awesome music and mixing. Buy it.
B0033TI4BW|5.0|Read, read, ...read again. :))) Inspiring, memorable book. One of the best book I have read in last couple years. Go for it.
B005J2V74C|1.0|What a waste of time!  This starts out as a Ghost Hunters episode, quickly turns into a bad Blair Witch clone, and then desperately tries to save itself as with an attempt at remaking the underground tunnel scenes in House of 1000 Corpses.  I did get a few laughs out of the film, but I highly doubt that was the filmmakers intent.  Otherwise I don't know what else to say about this tripe!  If you have to kill 1 1/2 hours please watch an episode or 2 of Ghost Hunters, Blair Witch, or House 0f 1000 Corpses.  You're time will be better spent, and that isn't saying a whole lot.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I like his style, it's pretty smooth, the record has a retro feel yet enough pop to keep you interested.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good book, Better than the first book. Alot of the past was explained about Reacher. Highly recommend the book makes me want to read the next one.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Not able to use. This product does not work on my Kindle Fire HD. Waste of time and then hard to remove from tablet. Had to plug into computer and search for the folder it was in so that I could delete it. Not worth the effort.

B007VDN1PA|2.0|I bought this hoping to make my folks' 30 year old slide collection a little more accessible. It's simple to set up and use, and it scans fairly quickly. But color reproduction for slides is quite poor. Lighter areas are a washed-out flare, and darker sections are muddy. The brightness settings aren't very helpful, especially if the slide has bright and dark sections. In all, they came out looking like, well, old photographs: faded and washed out.<br /><br />I would have returned it, but judging from other reviews, most scanners suffer from the same problem. Maybe a $300 scanner wouldn't have this problem, but I'm not that nostalgic. Maybe a better option would be buying a slide projector, a good screen, and taking photographs of the projections.

B005PK56TA|4.0|I enjoyed this show quite a bit. Started to get pretty corny toward the end. Because of that I started to lose interest. That's why I'm giving 4 stars. The second to last episode redeemed the series from the corniness. Happy I finished the first season but will probably not be watching the second.
B0091THRCU|5.0|This is just what I was looking for! Although bumpers are most common for I-Phone users, I prefer this style of case. (I have actually never seen anyone with a leather case or pouch, as everyone uses bumpers and otterboxes that I've seen) I prefer this type of &#34;holder&#34; due to keeping it out on my desk daily and throwing it in my purse otherwise. I feel that this case will provide the most protection from falling, and/or the touch screen.<br /><br />This particular case is very sleek and attractive and the tab to help pull it out is quite neat. (It quickly folds down due to its being magnetic)<br /><br />I highly recommend this case and this seller!

B009AMANH4|5.0|I'll not be a trouble and offer any grand insights regarding either the production values, cinematography, direction, or acting that is evident in this film. Nor will I comment upon the Blu-ray intricacies that can be delved upon endlessly regarding color matching, defects, graininess, sound, etc. (I could, but only tech nerds would care anyway).<br /><br />Suffice to say that this film is a seminal work of history and illumination afforded to us by no less than one of the finest story-tellers of our age, Mr.Speilberg.<br /><br />I have read &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; (upon which the film is mostly based), as well as a dozen or so other printed works that seek to document Lincoln's most enduring legacies of completing the finale of our own civil war and the Constitutional assurance that all citizens are entitled to fair treatment and universal application of law are therefore applied with equality under that foundational premise.<br /><br />Sublime, superb, audacious, enlightening, and perhaps most importantly of all... &#34;Lincoln&#34; is offered in entirely as utterly consumable and digestible to any and all citizens alive today to better appreciate and comprehend that our democracy is always an ongoing process of inelegant sausage-making; not pretty to see, not enviable to display, not a braggart's point to emphasize as advocate for democracy as a whole...but ever in support of the simple notion of equal justice under the laws of our own making is always worth defending and insuring for all generations to follow.<br /><br />If you believe in America at all, see it.

B00BI745AA|1.0|Big fan of the stage musical, not a fan of the film. I don't think Mr Hooper truly understands what makes a musical work on film. I think he was too caught up in this Sing-Live-On-Camera.<br />Go back and look at films like West Side Story and Jesus Christ Superstar. Both of these movies didn't have 1/8 of the budget for Les Miz and they are far more compelling and emotional than anything in this film. It's not just about bring out raw emotion. It's about composing a scene, working with an ensemble, a most importantly, The Music.<br />Seriously, the musical score was added in post-prod. I kept forgetting it was there. All I could hear were the (often off pitch) voices.<br />Even the actor never heard the orchestra. They hear a piano in an earpiece. And it really come across in the movie.<br />I could go on and on about how terrible the camera word was and how Mr Hooper seemed to think steady cam shots and cutting every 5 seconds (and not even in time with the music) gave some sort of power to the songs. It just made me aggravated. I don't understand how this won an Oscar.<br /><br />Again, go watch the 2 aforementioned movies.  Those movies also either added new songs or changed the order of musical numbers to make the material work on film.<br />Everything Mr Hooper rejiggered in this movie may have been truer to the book, but did not work on film. Not for me at least. But what do I know.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This is the best music Documentary i have ever watched. It gives alot of history about sound city and shows how much music has changed over the years. I could not believe how many amazing records were made at sound city. Dave grohl did a amazing job. Great movie!

B00BLGXL3U|4.0|I tried very hard not to have expectations that this film would be an L. Ron Hubbard biopic. Mr. Hoffman's performance as the master was enjoyable to watch, but nothing special. The other assorted characters who came and went during the film were not memorable either.<br />And then there's Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). The alcoholic psychopath who wins the heart and mind of the master. The master's wife (Amy Adams), however, sees Freddie as a threat to her husband's Cause. As a compromise  Freddie undergoes<br />the full treatment by the master.<br />Joaquin Phoenix disappears inside Freddie Quell.  Gaunt and slightly hunched over  with a  ready grin, his physical transformation is unsettling.  This is Joaquin Phoenix's film from start to finish. A brilliant performance.
B00BQLSB3A|4.0|Following the lackluster box-office returns of \\"The Thing\\" in 1982, director John Carpenter set his sights on an adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller CHRISTINE for a Christmas `83 release. While the film is structurally flawed - and just barely outperformed the disappointing box-office receipts of \\"The Thing\\" - it's a movie that nevertheless contains some of his best work, thanks to a reliance on character instead of gory horror.<br /><br />Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Phillips made mostly sound decisions in reworking King's novel for the screen, stripping out some of the more overtly supernatural elements and focusing on the relationship between its central characters: a high school nerd named Arnie (Keith Gordon) and his more popular, football-playing best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) in the late `70s. The perpetually bullied Arnie is teased by a ruthless clan of thugs but soon finds an outlet to escape his social status: a red 1958 Plymouth Fury that he buys from a shady salvage dealer (Roberts Blossom). Arnie sees in \\"Christine\\" the potential for a sleek cruising vessel that allows him to flee from his high school existence as well as his overly-concerned parents; Dennis, on the other hand, has grave concerns about his best friend's decision, but the connection between the possessed auto and its new owner has already been established. Soon Arnie's geek days are behind him as he snags the new girl in class (Alexandra Paul) and finds his rebirth is perpetually tied to the seemingly \\"alive\\" car he's rescued off the scrap heap.<br /><br />\\"Christine\\" received some criticism from horror fans over the fact that it's not especially scary - but given the central premise of King's novel, it's hard to imagine what more Carpenter and Phillips could've done to make a \\"killer car\\" movie more terrifying. Individual shots of Christine, literally on fire, driving down a lonely highway in pursuit of one of the thugs who bullied Arnie earlier in the film are evocative, but the attempt to create and sustain a more psychological form of terror - through Arnie's personality shifting - was a laudable one on the part of the filmmakers. \\"Christine\\" takes its time - nearly 40 minutes - establishing the relationship between Arnie and Dennis, as well as setting the overall scene. These sequences are some of the most satisfying in Carpenter's entire body of work, with both Gordon and Stockwell coming across as likeable, believable characters.<br /><br />The movie's main weakness is clearly its second act, as Arnie's switch from hapless nerd to confident ladies man happens without a moment's notice. His relationship with Paul's heroine, Leigh, occurs completely off-screen - a severe miscalculation that serves as the largest misstep in Phillips' script, since without that component, it's hard to believe his overnight shift in confidence, or how it's tied into Christine itself. The movie also veers away from seeing the film through the prism of Dennis, who's sidelined with a serious football injury, and the change in perspective likewise curtails the movie's dramatic momentum. It's unfortunate the mid-section of the picture stumbles, because the latter portion of the movie mostly delivers the goods with Carpenter doing what he can to make Christine's killing spree effective, while the presence of veteran character actors like Robert Prosky, Roberts Blossom and Harry Dean Stanton (even if he's mostly underutilized as a detective) add to the entertainment value.<br /><br />\\"Christine\\" may not be a great movie on balance - it's ultimately two-thirds of a really solid genre exercise - but it has its moments, and once you're aware of its shortcomings, repeat viewing makes it easier to appreciate the elements in it that do work well. In a career filled with a couple of classics (\\"Halloween\\" and \\"The Thing\\"), cult favorites and more than a few missed opportunities, it's also one of Carpenter's more low-key thrillers, reliant less on gore (the film is R-rated for excessive profanity as opposed to on-screen violence) and with more of an accent on the people affected by its horrors than the vehicle itself.<br /><br />Announced as one of Twilight Time's March limited-edition Blu-Ray releases, \\"Christine\\" sold out in a matter of hours once its pre-order went live on the Screen Archives website. The prior bestseller for Twilight Time was \\"Fright Night\\" - clearly, there's something to be said for the continued popularity of `80s genre films as \\"Christine\\" was snapped up in a jiffy by eager fans. If you're looking for a copy now, the secondary market is your only option, and prices currently run from $100 and up (barring an overseas, region-free release, it's likely its value may only increase as copies become scarcer).<br /><br />The 1080p AVC encoded transfer licensed from Sony is hugely satisfying, enhancing the work of Carpenter and cinematographer Donald M. Morgan, which is marked by Carpenter's trademark use of Panavision widescreen. The DTS MA 5.1 audio is potent as well, delivering a score filled with period rock tunes and one of the more unobtrusive Carpenter/Alan Howarth collaborations (there's hardly any of their underscore at all in the first hour). Extras are carried over from the Special Edition DVD, including Laurent Bouzereau's insightful three-part documentary, nearly 30 minutes of deleted scenes (none of which would've really helped the movie's middle section), and a fun commentary with Carpenter and Keith Gordon. For folks lucky enough to find a copy, this is a splendid Blu-Ray presentation all around, capped by an isolated score track of Carpenter and Howarth's musical contribution.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Excellent story, excellent acting and directing.  Typically Le Carre methodical development.  Characters are well developed and casted. I enjoyed it.
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Long before the world visited \\"Jurassic Park,\\" Michael Crichton first laid the foundation for a pleasurable playground for the public where technology ran amok in WESTWORLD, a no-frills MGM sci-fi thriller that plays like an efficient \\"B-movie\\" with concepts the author/filmmaker would later expand upon - to even greater success - in his little novel about a theme park with living dinosaurs.<br /><br />Crichton's original script - which he directed himself - finds vacationers Richard Benjamin and James Brolin headed to a state-of-the-art theme park where guests plop down $1000 a night to live out a fantasy of their dreams at three distinct locations: Medieval World, Roman World, and Westworld. These attractions aren't populated merely with \\"living history\\" role players but rather android creations who are programmed to cater to every guest's desire or fantasy. Benjamin and Brolin find their Old West experience to be fairly run of the mill - cavorting with local ladies of the night, drinking in the saloon and playing poker - until they meet a Gunslinger (Yul Brynner) who displays tendencies that seem a bit more aggressive than they bargained for.<br /><br />With a sub-90 minute running time, \\"Westworld\\" has always felt like a film that could've used a bit more embellishment. The characters are paper-thin and the dramatic element of the film a bit undernourished to the point where we don't care really about Benjamin and Brolin's thrill-seekers since we know so little about them. That being said, \\"Westworld\\" is still extremely effective, particularly on repeat viewing since you're able to dial down your expectations and appreciate some of the prescient ideas Crichton was able to work into the film involving the public's ever-increasing appetite for thrills and technology that pushes boundaries to a dangerous degree. Brynner has little dialogue but brings a compelling physicality to his role of the robotic gunslinger, incorporating some eerie, blank expressions that Arnold Schwarzenegger would employ to a similar degree in \\"The Terminator\\" over a decade later.<br /><br />Shot in Panavision, \\"Westworld\\" has the look of quality even though it's clear the movie was shot with a modest budget. For that reason, it's hard to criticize first-time feature director Crichton too much here - this is an economical picture with a fast-moving second half and a premise that remains fascinating, so much so that it's surprising nobody has bothered to remake it (Crichton's own \\"remake\\" of sorts, \\"Jurassic Park,\\" notwithstanding).<br /><br />Making its Blu-Ray debut from Warner Home Video, \\"Westworld\\" looks a bit aged but delivers the HD goods thanks to a clear, crisp 1080p AVC encoded transfer. Little attempt was made here to hide the movie's grain structure, and that's a good thing, seeing as the transfer looks like real film and not a glossy DNR mess. The 5.1 DTS MA audio spreads out into full stereo when Fred Karlin's score kicks into gear, while extras include a vintage featurette, the trailer and - making its home video debut - the pilot for the (very) short-lived 1980 CBS series \\"Beyond Westworld.\\" Apparently only five episodes of the show - which picks up with the Delos Corporation now trying to take over the world - were produced, and even fewer aired, with Connie Selleca playing the series' heroine only after she replaced the original female lead in the pilot. With laughable performances and indifferent production values, it's easy to see why \\"Beyond Westworld\\" didn't last, but its inclusion here - as a Blu-Ray exclusive - is more than welcome. (Now, if only WB had found some of the deleted scenes that made their way into \\"Westworld\\"'s network TV broadcasts, we'd have a definitive package of the film!).
0226443221|4.0|It was amazing that a city the size of Chicago was not better prepared to activate a disaster plan as this event unfolded.

B00AB0Z88S|4.0|For its technical accomplishments alone, Ang Lee's LIFE OF PI is likely to rank at the top of the list of 2012's best for many viewers, and there's no doubt from an artistic standpoint, its visuals were unmatched by any other film last year.<br /><br />An adaptation of Yann Martel's seemingly impenetrable rumination on the triumph of the human spirit, man's place in the universe, and the role of religion in an individual's spiritual journey, \\"Life of Pi\\" is, first and foremost, a film for the senses. Working from a script by David Magee, director Lee's film follows \\"Pi\\" Patel (Suraj Sharma), a young man who learns of different religions growing up in the Puducherry region of what was once French India. His inquisitive nature, both encouraged by his mother (Tabu) and discouraged by a father (Adil Hussain) who operates a zoo in their town, is scuttled as he grows older and his family is eventually forced to immigrate to Canada. En route, the Japanese freighter carrying them, as well as their zoo animals, is wrecked in a storm, with only Pi escaping - alongside a zebra, orangutan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, who journeys with Pi on an ocean teeming with both peril and wonder, with florescent jellyfish lighting up the world beneath them and humpback whales catapulting through the air.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is so staggeringly, jaw-droppingly beautiful that Lee and cinematographer Claudia Miranda's effective use of the 3-D format is evident from the movie's first frames. Long before Pi and Richard Parker set out on a lifeboat of individual discovery, \\"Life of Pi\\" has already captivated the viewer with its fascinating portrait of young Pi's life in French India, with gorgeous landscapes, colors and animals filling each and every frame. Most of the movies we see using 3-D employ it merely as a gimmick to goose grosses, but much like Martin Scorsese's \\"Hugo,\\" Lee here frames so many sequences with depth-of-field dimension that its inclusion ranks as anabsolute necessity to appreciating the spellbinding images that Lee and Miranda - both of whom were deservedly honored with Oscars, alongside composer Mychael Danna and the visual effects team at Rhythm & Hues - generated here.<br /><br />The film's story is another matter; one can easily see why readers of Martel's book were drawn to the material, for its mostly ambiguous, take-out-what-you-put-in take on world religion and faith, in general, functions mostly as a byproduct of the individual reader. On-screen, Lee is able to invest the material with a similar cloudiness, though that ambiguity is harder to achieve in a medium like film. There's no outright sermonizing in the picture, but its ending is more forcefully tilted in one direction than the more hazy conclusion Martel originally wrote. Still, however obvious (or not) the film's metaphorical messages and spiritual philosophizing happen to be, there's no question \\"Life of Pi\\" is a film that's impossible to forget and easy to appreciate on a sheer artistic level. Whether or not you find it to be as enriching an emotional journey will be - much like its source material - up to the individual viewer.<br /><br />Fox's 3-D Blu-Ray presentation of \\"Life of Pi\\" is unquestionably a must-view for any 3-D home theaterphile. The images, composition and clarity of the 3-D are spectacular throughout, and as I wrote before, few films have demanded viewing in the 3-D format more than \\"Life of Pi.\\" The 3-D Blu-Ray also includes nearly 15 minutes of exclusive deleted scenes, plus the trailer in 3D and visual effects progressions (these exclusive extras can also be played in a standard BD player). Other supplements on the standard Blu (which features a dazzling 1080p AVC encoded transfer in its own right) boast several featurettes, an art gallery and storyboards, while a DVD and digital copy round out the disc. The DTS MA 7.1 audio is impressively mounted as well, highlighting another fine score written by Danna for his long-time cinematic collaborator.<br /><br />One final note on \\"Life of Pi\\": it's inconceivable to me that this picture generated a PG rating from the MPAA. With its marketing campaign dominated by images of Pi and the tiger together in the lifeboat, I have no doubt there were parents who took children to this film, only to be horrified by the animal violence that occurs in it - even if it's off-camera and isn't gratuitous, this isn't a film for young kids, and should've absolutely received a PG-13 for that and the generally intense tone of the picture. Of course, this isn't the first sign our ratings system is dysfunctional - merely the latest evidence of it.

B00BGDQNLU|4.0|Backed by a budget augmented by Warner Bros. and producer Joel Silver, the Coen Brothers' THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ranked as one of the biggest box-office disappointments of 1994. Despite impressive physical production design by Dennis Gassner and Roger Deakins' exceptional cinematography, mainstream viewers had scant interest in the Coens' admittedly offbeat, and lightweight, \\"big business fantasy\\" that still remains a must for the filmmakers' devotees.<br /><br />Set in 1958, \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" - scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen along with Sam Raimi - stars Tim Robbins as a midwestern college graduate who comes to the big city armed with large ambitions but no experience. He's able to nab a job in the mailroom of Hudsucker Industries, a company that's just seen its owner (Charles Durning) leap to his death from over 40 floors above, leaving the company in the hands of conniving Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman). Seeking to deplete the company's worth so its board members can purchase its stock for cheap, Mussburger puts Robbins' Norville Barnes in charge of the whole enterprise, not counting on Norville's grand plan - the hula hoop - becoming a worldwide sensation.<br /><br />Like many of the Coens' films, \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" is difficult to describe in terms of its genre classification. Its view of big-business comes off like a Coen riff on \\"Mad Men,\\" with corporate scheming viewed as an almost life-or-death struggle (quite literally in the film's climactic moments), while incorporating elements of a fairy tale and a romantic comedy for good measure. The latter is supplied by Jennifer Jason Leigh's newspaper reporter, who masquerades as a secretary for Norville but eventually falls for his irrepressibly naive charms. She sounds like she's out of a 1940s movie newsroom, and the Coens mix up the drawing-room machinations with memorable set-pieces that are eclectic and inventive (Norville's dream sequence with a tango dancer and a montage involving the hula hoop itself most notably among the latter).<br /><br />The movie doesn't entirely come together - and there are times it's not as funny as it would like to be - but it's such an endearing film that I've grown fonder of it with each viewing. The gently falling snow and brown-hued textures in Deakins' cinematography, the familiar supporting faces (Bruce Campbell, Steve Buscemi, Anna Nicole Smith and Jon Polito appear), and Carter Burwell's superb usage of Khachaturian compositions make for a movie that's a one-of-a-kind Coen experience through and through.<br /><br />Making its Blu-Ray debut exclusively from the Warner Archive, Warner's BD release is straightforward and satisfying. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer is as crisp as the film's visuals allow (its brown/greyish visual scheme will never make for an \\"eye popping\\" pallet), while the Dolby Stereo Spectral Recording soundtrack is encoded in a 2.0 DTS MA track. The movie's jaunty theatrical trailer, set to Danny Elfman's \\"Back to School,\\" does the best it can to sell the material to mainstream audiences, but the picture's most engaging elements are in its offbeat tone - one that's impossible to convey in a two-minute ad, much less a written review!
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Hand's down the best EVER Blake Shelton album he has put out.  Can't stop listening to it.  This is awesome!!
B00AO686MY|4.0|An iconic film that ushered in a whole new wave of animated blockbusters, Robert Zemeckis' box-office smash from the summer `88 was one of those movies -- much like \\"Terminator 2\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\" - that people rushed out to see repeated times for its landmark visual achievements alone.<br /><br />Live action and animation were combined in a seamless, almost three-dimensional manner by animator Richard Williams and ILM for Zemeckis' frothy 1988 \\"cartoon noir.\\" Based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, \\"Roger Rabbit\\" examines the craziness that ensues once alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant (the terrific Bob Hoskins) is hired to investigate the possible relationship between toon star Jessica Rabbit and cartoon guru Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). What Valiant finds is that Acme is murdered and all signs point to Jessica's husband -- cartoon star Roger Rabbit. With Roger in tow, pleading his innocence, Eddie reluctantly uncovers a seedy underworld buried beneath \\"Toontown,\\" where Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM stars hang out after hours at clubs and other secluded hideaways.<br /><br />An old-fashioned movie in more ways than one, \\"Roger Rabbit\\" was produced with hand-drawn animation and motion capture techniques that gave the animated characters a 3-D like appearance when set against live-action backdrops. That this process worked so much better here than in any prior attempt at mixing live-action and animation is entirely due to the craftsmanship of Zemeckis, Williams and particularly the ILM visual effects crew. Made in the pre-CGI era, the filmmakers relied on tried-and-true techniques in making their film come to life - they just did a more effective job than anyone else ever had, and their attention to detail still shines through in high-definition.<br /><br />\\"Roger Rabbit\\" rightly copped several Oscars for its technical wizardry, which help compensate for a somewhat over-praised script (credited to Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman), which is never as compelling as the visceral element of the film. Hoskins' performance, though, is the glue that holds the movie together, and is rightly singled out by director Zemeckis in his audio commentary.<br /><br />Disney's Blu-Ray boasts what certainly looks like an unadulterated 1080p AVC encoded transfer that preserves the sometimes varied appearance of the film. Dean Cundey's golden-hued cinematography is like a love letter to post-WWII Hollywood, but because of all the special effects processes, grain is predictably more visible in some sequences than others. Given all the technical challenges involved in bringing the film to life, it's understandable, and for the most part, the transfer is quite good (and either way, it's unlikely the film will ever look better than it does here). The 5.1 DTS MA audio is active throughout, boasting an energetic and at-times bittersweet score by Alan Silvestri that ranks as one of his best.<br /><br />Extra features are cobbled together from prior DVD releases of the film, though most fans will be thrilled to learn that the set includes three remastered Roger Rabbit shorts that were released with other Disney films in the late '80s (\\"Tummy Trouble,\\" \\"Trail Mix-Up,\\" and \\"Rollercoaster Rabbit\\"). These shorts - the release of which apparently irritated producer Spielberg at the time (he wanted one of them playing in front of his Amblin co-produced \\"Arachnophobia\\") - look spectacular here, with glorious detail and color that's absent from the film itself.<br /><br />In addition to a 10-minute \\"Making Of\\" hosted by Roger's voice Charles Fleischer and aimed at kids, the BD rehashes other supplements from the 2003 DVD, including a full group audio commentary by Zemeckis, Frank Marshall, the writers, and ILM supervisor Ken Ralston; a 40-minute documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew;  split-screen comparisons of before-and-after FX footage; and the infamous \\"Pig Head\\" sequence, which was deleted from the film but added to CBS' network TV broadcasts in the early '90s. An accompanying DVD in the package (the same Disc 1 from the 2003 DVD in fact) also includes \\"The Valiant Files,\\" which compiles still photos from various stages of production, as well as the original theatrical trailer via an easter egg (select \\"Movie Theater\\" on the on-screen menu and press down four times to access it).<br /><br />\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" is one of those dizzying, frantic Zemeckis films that pushed the technical boundaries of its day, remaining a favorite of both animation fans and fantasy aficionados. It's a shame that reported squabbles between Spielberg and Disney curtailed a long-in-development sequel (or prequel), which at one point was to have featured five original songs written by Alan Menken. While it's hard to think of another genre blockbuster to make as much money as \\"Roger Rabbit\\" and not generate a follow-up, the 1988 film is still a unique viewing experience that's lost none of its charm.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book. Great storyline!<br /><br />There were times (as in all the books) that I thought the story took an easy way out, but I just skipped over them and went with the story.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I enjoyed the active dog characters, they were as much a part of the story as the two legged ones were. Roberts is always a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great continuation of the first book.<br /><br />Non stop action. Just when you think everything will be ok there is another twist in the tale.<br /><br />I could not put it down. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B005K17RU0|1.0|why did they change the Gui? the new look is terrible! l'm mooving on to something else. used to be great.
B003QSJVTY|4.0|Absorbing story line, with one of the all-time classic car chases. Nicholas Cage at his best. Angelina Jolie, not so much.
B00136NSUO|2.0|I am a huge fan of Annie Lennox. She has this voice that's moody with tones of soul that I'm very drawn to. Unfortunately Songs Of Mass Destruction fail to live up to the expectations her previous solo works have set. I kept listening to this album hoping that repetition would make me at least begin to \\"like\\" if not love. It never happened. That being said Ghosts In My Machine stood out the most to me. If any comes out with something else I will gladly forget this ever happened.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This story bought me to tears. It proves that life can throw terrible things at you and this story is about overcoming life and moving on.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My daughter and I both LOVE this game! We take turns trying to beat each others time. Great twist on classic mahjong.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I have never seem forest gump until the other day it is a great movie.. It's a must see movie
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Easy to play, hard to put down. I play while waiting for the kids to get out of practice. Good time waster.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I hate the new screen. It's too busy and I liked the hour by hour temp and precipation info on the old one.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This novel kept me on the edge of my seat. It was reaslistically frightening. I found the characters and their situation earily believable.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|007 movies are always action packed and you never know what is next.<br />This proved to be true, the stunts were amazing and intrigue and storyline<br />excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book had romance and a little action and some other stuff which that's what mad it a good book.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is a great show. The characters are really fantastic. All three really play off each other tremendously.  I will be sad when I watch the last episode of the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.It is amazing It is fun mostly in creative.you can build.Me and my brother have survival marathons.I definitely recommend this game.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Ennio Morricone is a genious. I have never listened to a more beautiful, inspiring movie music as his music. It touches your heart and sould. I have listened to the cd over and over again and I never get tired of it. It makes me cry
B00969PR18|1.0|I'm sorry but, My husband nor I either one like this app! We have tried and tried to use it and figure it out, but to no use. It just won't go anywhere.  We use the iMap on our iPhone and it works great!!  Thought this map app would be the same because the app icon looks like our iMap app, but this is nothing like ours. We are really disappointed!
B0000069CT|5.0|Classical movie is my favorite and Bruch violin concerto is marvelous.Actually the whole cd is for the soul. Worth it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this app!  Works great! I enjoy playing it very much whether it be just because I want to or because I am having to wait on someone. Thank you for this app.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I really liked the first book and this is a great sequel to follow up Something Borrowed.  Wish theyed make a movie from this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Works great and returns to your unfinished game without any problems. Thank you for this app.  I enjoy it very much.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is an excellent book. For those who have had loved ones with Alzheimer's disease, it can be very emotional.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|good movie  ................... it was good , it was good , it was good , it was good , 17 word for review submitted ...
B008R9QAY6|3.0|This opera is like cotton candy: a little goes a long way. In typical Metastasian fashion, the libretto features an improbably complex plot with too many poorly fleshed out characters.<br /><br />But it's the lack of variety in the voices that finally got to me. Five countertenors! (Blessedly, plus one real tenor.) It eventually just became monotonous to me. Too many high voices, too little change in the tessitura. Just plain shrill at times.<br /><br />Clearly other listeners have enjoyed this piece a lot. It's not expensive. I'm not sorry I bought it. But, given the listening experience I have now, I would not have done so, and don't particularly recommend it to someone who shares my vanilla tastes.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Found this unwatchable after 40 minutes.  Seeing a couple fighting for that long is not what I consider a comedy.
B00BC0JI6O|4.0|A return to form (and formula), this CD sounds like earlier Spocks. Except for the songs penned solo by Ted Leonard, which sound like Enchant. Which is a good thing because I love Enchant! Adding Ted to SB was genius.<br /><br />And lo and behold, in the liner notes it lists Neal with writing credits with Alan!! And Afterthoughts has all his quirky layered counterpoint and Gentle Giant acapella vocals. And the return to the humor that you haven't seen since Kindness of Strangers. The lyrics are hilarious and I laugh each time I hear this song. \\"A sedative won't settle me, its all one big conspiracy\\" indeed.<br />And vocoder! What's not to like? Sure its formula, but who cares? OK, sometimes it is just slightly uneven, but overall this is a great CD!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love all the Harry Bosch books, but this one was underwhelming. I was hoping for a classic Bosch story, but this one seems a bit light. Glad I didn't pay hardcover price for it.
1476734941|4.0|Both my husband and I have been on the diet for 2 weeks and both have lost weight.  I recommend reading the entire book because it helps you to understand why it works.  Restricting our calories for 2 days a week and eating as usual the other 5 days really works for us.  Both of us have had a decrease in appetite and yet we can enjoy ourselves 5 days a week.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just like minecraft! My opinion is the creator did magnificent at this! It's worth the money! BUY THIS APP! If your a minecraft lover, BUY!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television.  Tony and Ridley Scott pay off with suspense and tension that keeps you coming back for  more.
1426209584|5.0|National Geographic and the photographers were very lucky.  They did the greatest photos and had the chance to actually see<br />the birds.  Being a birder myself, looking at these photos, I wish I could actually see them up close to add them to my list.<br />This book is excellent!  Just to look at the photos!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are Amazing! I love how its challenging and more exciting than the first one. It is really an aesome game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful!! Couldn't put the books down and was shocked, sad and happy in the end.  I'm not a sci-fi person but really enjoyed these books!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|he completly changes everything at about 1/2.  probably my favorite book ever.  it is just so well written and its almost like he planned it from day one
B000JRYOPG|1.0|Wish the sender would have communicated with me or write me back but he says its going to be 6 weeks to send? Lol so I learned my lesson to buy cheap, buy new and through someone that has credit, and like to ship their products.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Thank you Kenneth from amazon.com--this is just what I needed! Thanks for the advice, help, patience and good humor. Gracias.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Thank God mojang made minecraft it's fun to do and there aren't no rules and it's your world so do what ever you want .buy this awesome game for your self you will love it if you like minecraft and for a rope the seed android, are lava seeds
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like the game okay, but the language on the chat is not to my liking.  If I could turn off the chat so I could not see it I think I would play it more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game. It is so fun to play. Can't seem to put kindle down. I can't wait to expand and have more room to build.
1844256383|5.0|I like it so far.  Still working my way through, but it seems to be quite complete.  I look forward to getting more involved.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|So I got this app because I like gta and then after spending seven dollars on it I realized that it took about 1000 mb.  The check How much storage  u have before u buy it
B00164KYV4|5.0|I was a little devastated when I was looking through my collection of DVDs the other day and found the case for my copy, but not the physical DVD. I was so pleased to find this low cost, prime eligible copy! Thank you :)
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is an awesome game for all jurrasic park enthusiasts who enjoyed all 3 movies. I wish we would of seen some prehistoric water creatures in some of the movies. This game is truly addicting and fun to play.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack has plenty of space, a lot more than I thought it would. Plus, it seems to be well made for the price.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|it was a good movie.<br />I enjoyed kirk being receptive to his subordinates.<br />not sure what else to write or say
0762434279|1.0|I made the mistake of ordering the wrong version of this book.  Look at the details, this is not the actual full &#34;size&#34; or version of the famous book.
1881273377|5.0|I have shared this with several friends, This is something that can change all your relationships; from Family and friends
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Using as my primary music player for kindles and my other android devices. Great interface, all in the family use it. Prefer it over iTunes.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was a wonderful book to read. If you have already lived through middle school, you know how hard it is but R. J. Takes us on a trip through it again through her various characters' eyes.  I love the way we can learn from each other and kindness towards each other will win in the end.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|My girls three and five absolutely love this movie.  They don't even get all of the humor yet so it is fun for adults too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I actually bought this game on accident but have really come to enjoy it. Is one of those games you can play just for a couple of minutes if you are waiting then not play for quite a while. I also really like how i can still get rather far in the game without having to use money to progress or have it connected with social networking.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This was a nice light bit of entertainment.  Not deep or life changing but nice and relaxing for a Sunday afternoon.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very good. I was a little hesitant about reading<br />The book because I thought that it was going to be the typical standard Erotica story: girl meets boy and they have sex and on to the next story (the standard vanilla sex which is so cheesy you can imagine the corney porn music in your head playing in the background). Fifty Shades of Grey is Erotica but it has a great deal of Psychology behind. The characters are so interesting and a great deal of their decisions made in the book have to do with how they were raised and where they come from. The storyline just gets deeper and deeper and when you think it cannot get any deeper it goes even further. I just brought this book and read it in one day and I cannot wait to dive into the sequel. It has been a great page turner for me to read while recovering from my surgery.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|As in the first 2 seasons, the acting is supurb, but in season 3 the writers have lost their minds! If the closing episode plays out with out a &#34;save&#34; on killing off one of the most important main characters, I'm thru watching!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Hated, in order, gratuitous nudity at start and over use of drugs.  Cocaine to &#34;straighten out drunkeness&#34;?  I rate movies by &#34;would I watch it again?&#34;  No.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show on cable in years. watch it every week on Amazon. Can't wait for season 4! love it!!
B008M34INW|1.0|Watched this with friends - chose this over another movie because the other was in sub-titles.  Laughed our way through much of this because about half of this one is in sub-titles (no warning though).  Lots of blood.  Lots of gratuitous violence.  Some laughs though, although I suspect they aren't intended for laughs...
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Love this show! Didn't start watching it until about a year ago. I had heard it was good but the premise didn't sound all that funny, so never did watch it. I was on vacation with my son and he said you have to watch this show. Even then it took me several months to really get hooked on it. Now I love it!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|but more guy funny than girl funny.  Lots of crudity - mostly verbal.  Watched with friends, guys laughed often, women slightly less often, but nonetheless, there were some funny lines.
0307888681|5.0|A MUST READ for any zombie fan...try discussing zombie ideas with any educated human (still living) and they will make reference to this book...if you think the walking dead is cool you need to read WWZ
B0064QNS62|2.0|I tried the free version a long time ago, but I figured by now maybe they fixed the controls. They haven't. The buttons are way too small and close together, and some are even unecessary. Even if you manage to hit the exact right spot, the buttons are sluggish. it ruins the game.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a great story !! I laughed -- I cried -- I cheered --- and i told all my friends who love to read --- GO GET THIS BOOK !!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season might be the best season yet. Just when you think it can't get any better it does. Great buy.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I always liked this movie, of course best on Blu-ray.  Jim Carrey puts on a different mask on this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much fun! Even better than the first. Love how there's gems, only wish they came more often. Love how there's zip lines and cave areas
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|One of the most loved movie for the USMC.  Ask any marine and they will tell you that this is how it is.  I dont know if its still the same nowadays though
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I had already seen season 1 and 2 and so as soon as I could, I ordered season 3.  Am looking forward to next year when I can get season 4.
0810993139|4.0|I bought the first three books for my seven year old grandson and gave them to him on a recent visit to me.  He is a very intrested reader and I want to keep him reading for ever.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book.  I am not sure why.  It was a dark, depressing and scary book but I couldn't put it down as I was reading it.  I think a movie has been made of it and I plan to try to locate the movie.  I am now reading the second book which is a sequel and I am enjoying it although it is also dark and depressing.
0714844659|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the print in the book, it was faded and I found myself really straining to see the print.  The recipe for the Toffee Pudding had apricot instead of dates, which I found interesting.<br />I will try a couple of the recipes just for the fun of it.
B0085A9J18|5.0|The best action-packed movie I've ever seen.  An awful lot of blood shed, but still a very good movies.  If you like these types of movies, buy it.  Very good actors and martial arts.
0810994739|4.0|These books were purchased for my seven year old grandson who was visiting recently.  He was thrilled to receive them.
6300213714|5.0|The item was brand new and unopened. Owning one one of the best movies i've ever seen is worth the money
0810970686|4.0|I purchased the first three books for my 7 year old grandson and he was excited to receive them.  Good books for a young person.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun !I love this game so much !you want to play subway suffers again. and again!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Love the CD.  Parts are definitely Rated PG13 or Rated R so I can only play certain tracks in the car with the kids.
B007HC3LHS|2.0|I should not have bought his book.  I think it was well written and I recommended it to a friend who enjoys this type of book.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Love~! Love~! Love~! My kids love all these Hayao Miyazaki / Disney movies!  We plan to get the ones we are missing.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Nice to listen to if you're depressed or not motivated. It is an uplifting album with nice melodies and simple tones.
B007857FOO|5.0|love this copy of the movie .Just wish they would put out a whole set togther with all the extras.
B0013DCC72|5.0|It's refreshing that a band, such as Incubus, doesn't fit into the mold of pop rock by sounding similar to anything else.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|good movie  great show  a real feel good movie and shows you how life can be the same either side of the road you are on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best block game evr $699 SO WHAT !!!!  best block game ever totally buy it updates on its own as I said GET THIS GAME

B005K17RU0|4.0|It has always worked good on my kindle. I enjoy the ability to check on temps. anytime ...<br />As well as the possible weather for the next few days.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|This is what I should have loaded originally.  I loaded the lite, which only has 4 frames.  Should have notices this
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great show with an amazing cast of characters and and intriguing plot! a must watch show!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for your free video gift of the first series episode!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is for my wife to learn how to use the tablet which will translate to her using the laptop as well
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Adults to Children in my family loved this movie. It could be frightening for little children; make sure little one's have an adult near by for the scarier scenes.
B007EECSFA|5.0|do not want to put it down,very interesting, love the period, then & now, really feel for the characters...good, good mystery
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was enjoyable for adults as well as children. The strife between a teen and her mother is a little too old for little ones though.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very entertaining show. Touching stories, with life lessons. Characters are well developed. Doesn't take long to get hooked. Love the setting and the scenery. Great photography.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Constantly engaging.....getting up for a snack you must pause or miss something......caught up with first two seasons...will get to third before new one begins
B00632HWOG|3.0|Have to fiddle with the screens to get to &#34;compose&#34; a new message.  Difficult to delete, copy, paste items also.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|One of the rare programs that can be as simple or as complex as your needs demand.  Only have 2 wishes the ability to undo change while editing the text of a note and the ability to sent due dates independently of tags.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great story, uniquely told.  Holds your interest and is a fast read.  I've already downloaded the second in the series.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Pros:<br />The gift was loved.  The person this was bought for listens to this CD on a daily basis.<br /><br />Cons:<br />no complaints
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was an absolute page turner, twists and turns in every corner. Couldn't put it down, I loved it!
0062082353|5.0|Very good read pulled no punches not only about war but the toll on his family as well very open
B000KFB4PK|3.0|Alright. clean package not too shabby<br />Was expecting a little more i won't lie but that's ok. you win some you lose some
0061433063|5.0|Another in the Tiffany Aching series as she finds her potential with little outside help.  Another great story from the master of comedic fantasy.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is the best gett it now (and culd tue makers let you punch faster and giv yoilu more poshen agin thanks)
B005MMJ84K|2.0|Not what I was hoping for in an ending. I invested in these characters and I was hoping for answers.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love it!! The show is intriguing , enter training and smart.<br />Love it! Highly recommended .<br />Hope CBS is not going to stop it like he stopped Jericho series...
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I became even more invested in the characters. Was excited to see how it ended. Enjoyed it more than the first book.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Slightly addicted to these movies.  Love the story.  Eclipse is a dramatic continuation of the love story between Bella and Edward.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|In all fairness, I watched this on a plane so it may have been funnier in a theater setting.  I thought it was funny in parts but lacked any true type of resolution.  They fought and made up and fought an made up multiple times.  Not sure I would recommend beyond watching te funny close on YouTube.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I'm an adult, and accidently ordered this book. I'm not into teen novels, but it's a good story, if you're a teenager. It reminds me of a book I may have read in high school. :)
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Kept me rooting for the &#34;good guys&#34; but lacked any good character development.  In the end, I wasn't blown away!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally pick the most uninteresting books. I chose this book based on the reviews I read on Amazon. WOW! I can't put it down. Be prepared to be swallowed into the world of the Silo!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|great action scenes and depth, much better than 2d bluray, if you have a 3d tv add this movie to your collection, wont disappoint
B000FC1QQU|5.0|I loved these so much that I bought the HBO DVD.  Why did it not make it on TV- I really don't know.
B000003TSP|5.0|It would be wise to read to read my review of Dummy here prior to reading this review:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Dummy-Portishead/product-reviews/B002A32HTC/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R1AKIE0D8N8FMU<br /><br />In all likelihood it would also be wise to purchase (and enjoy) Dummy prior to moving onto this, the sophomore eponymous album by this highly experimental group of Avant Garde musicians, so innovative that 15 years after release of this album, the industry has yet to catch up to them!  [P]ortishead holds a position in a niche that exclusively belongs to them so far, and to dabble in this alchemy is to identify oneself as a unique kind of music fan.<br /><br />As DUMMY was dark and gothic, eerily film noir, The Twilight Zone of [P]ortishead, then PORTISHEAD, the second album, was full blown horror.  [P]ortishead stepped into The Outer Limits with this one.  DUMMY is frightening in a suspenseful sort of way, hallucinogenic, dark and mysterious.  PORTISHEAD is blood curdling frightening by comparison.  Beth Gibbons has moved her torch-song fiery vocals to the back of her throat on several of the songs, her lyrics are sardonic, scratching, cutlery with an attitude, gothic horror gone psycho.  She still manages to evoke the woefully heart damaging sultriness of Dummy on such songs as All Mine, Over, Only You, and maybe Western Eyes.  But these are interspersed as an occasional reprieve from the monstrous evil or mocking gestures of the larger palette that this album dishes up.  What were nightmares of grief and cruelty are now malevolent poltergeists demanding your attention, expecting you to react, compelling you to listen and be bent to Beth Gibbons will.  Adrian Utley's once subtle guitar work is brought more to the front in this outing, PORTISHEAD being a more \\"electric\\" album than DUMMY if you can conceive of that.  Any remote resemblance to the trip-hop of Bristol's Go Beat club (Massive Attack, Tricky, etc) was severed after DUMMY, there is nothing here even resembling that.  Yes it is still [P], that much is forced, but the bitter sweet has been swallowed and [P] took shape as an again renewed experiment, and this time they were after full thralldom.<br /><br />Songs like Cowboys, Half Day Closing, and Elysium are in your face violent attacks on your sensibilities, even though Elysium contains an almost slow jazz guitar middle section (enough time to collect your wits before the next assault).  Elysium is a direct assault from a woman scorned. Half Day Closing, dedicated to the United States of America, is a haunting wailing lament on the counter-culture generation selling out, and Cowboys an even more hellish indictment of a similar nature.<br /><br />The real apparitions which nip at your heels and jump out of the corners are the subtle ones.  Undenied sounds like it might be a torch song from Dummy but the ghostly vocal and ambience hide a very menacing goul.  Humming, with its theremin from a 40's or 50's gothic horror movie, embraces dark shadows in a demonic plead for understanding and consumption, a spirit trapped between worlds.  Seven Months sounds like a James Bond theme song, complete with big lung vocals, gone horribly wrong.  A coughing duck demon lingers in the background while the Shirley Bassey witch-woman laments \\"There's no time to rest, Or to reconsider, For this cruel unsaid, Won't concede...\\"<br /><br />[P]ortishead utilize some commonplace musical instruments (horns, percussion) in some very uncommon methods.  No Dummy here, gone are \\"samples\\" from classic music, and arrived are [P]-manufactured samples of their own creation, recording a tune, then sampling it back in spooky and convincing ways.<br /><br />Finally, the highlights which are no less eerie, but definitively less horrific, are as above so below.<br /><br />Only You might fit comfortably on Dummy as one of Beth's torchy odes, but the manufactured samples, spun and scratched on the turntable become an enigmatic drill to the brain.

Totally entertaining, loved the sarcasm/sense of humor, intrigued by the story, found that I cared about the main character.  This author did a great job building the story from start to end.  I have recommended this book to a lot of my friends.  I don't know whether all of the science and math are accurate, but I found I really didn't care.  I just thoroughly enjoyed this entire read.

Easily one of the essentials that everyone should pick up or at least listen to at least once in their lives.  Highly recommended!

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The only interesting thing about the film is how bad it is.  More precisely, what it says about the projected audience that this is what they decided to make with so much money and such a good franchise,  it is like a 2 hour trailer without a film.

My husband and I have watched it over and over. We have also invited friends to watch it with us. This movie is a classic which we will watch for years.
034580404X|2.0|As this is my first review of an erotica, I want to be on the generous side. Plus the fact that I borrowed the books from the library made it easier to be more forgiven. I also finished the whole series and try to keep an open mind before I write this review. As a whole, I gave it a 2 stars for an intriguing subject. I am a sucker for romance so the idea of \\"love can heal all things\\" has its merit. Other than that, there is nothing here to gush about. I won't repeat what other reviewers had already hashed through: the bad writing and the repetitiveness of boring sex scenes, dialogues and the incredulous plot lines.<br />What I found most disturbing with the books is how the author chose to portrait Anna. Gosh, does she have to be a klutz and so naive? A 21-yr old college virgin (I feel sorry for the English majors out there being stereotyped again)  who's never masturbated but when gets introduced to the \\"red room of pain\\" does not even flinch? She is OK with Christian dictating how she f.. but not how she dresses or eats? She is depicted to be brave and independent, but constantly worries about not being enough for him and does not understand what he sees in her? (even though the author makes sure that she is attractive enough to have several admirers) Talk about setting bad examples for young adult females about self-esteem and self-preservation.<br />I give her credit for being courageous enough to walk out on him at the end of book 1. But, frankly, I've never saw what she sees in him in the 1st place. Why would any sane girl want to have a relationship with a controlling, possessive, angry and jeolous guy? Of course, he's super hot and obscenely rich, but surely Anna is not that shallow. Oops, she is. Otherwise, would she take the debasement if the guy is old, ugly and poor?<br />She gets even worse in book 2. They broke up for 5 days and she succumbed when he said he wants her back. 5 freaking days? She even apologizes for not using the safe word to stop him. She admits to like the kinky sex they had, even though they consist of actions that are demeaning and objectifying to women. I know different strokes for different folks (and I'm certainly know nothing about BDSM), but why would you want to be whipped or spanked while strussed up like a piece of meat? Her continuous insecurity about how she can't fulfill his dominant needs and how she is not good enough for him makes me palm-twitching mad and want to spank her myself.<br />She thinks it's wrong for her to dominate Christian (in the scene when he knelt down when he thought she was leaving him), but is willing to go kneel in the playroom and enjoys punishment sex? She gets mad at him for giving her hickeys but OK with the marks from the handcuffs? What's wrong with this picture? She constantly does things he does not like, like riding a jet ski or  wanting to keep her maiden name, but then apologizes or gives in later. How does that make her an independent and strong woman? She is a weak, immature, confused, stupid, reckless and stubborn girl who loves unconditionally a freaky, domineering, damaged boy and that's her virtue?<br />The sad thing is that the book has some good bones and could have been a good entertaining read if the author has not been too lazy and some good editing has been done. If anybody deserves a good whipping, it's E.L. James. Do yourself a favor, only read it if you have nothing better to do and only if they are free. One final note, if she ever thinks about writing another book, please take some writing classes.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very cool game, works great on KF HD great controls, decent music<br />Recommended nice to see as the FAOTD.  Try it out
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|What can I say, I watched this picture mainly because I had already seen the first three and thought oh well might as well see this one too, in for a penny in for a pound as they say.  While less imaginative than the first couple of flicks in this series it was at least mildly entetaining.  I thought the movie did a poor job of explaining how it is that the baby from the original couple of films ended up adopted and the aunt that kidnapped him with a different strange kid.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Haven't listened to it on my own yet, just heard the music in the car and loved it. Amazing voice, great music.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This is a fun movie.  Michael Connelly wrote the book based on a throw-away scene in another one of his books.  The book setting up this story and this book are filed with detail that really make the characters and plot come to life.<br /><br />Nevertheless, even though the books have the bang, the movie sizzles.  Great fun.  Great characters.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie is so beautiful. The beginning is setting up the story and important to follow. The story is exceptionally awesome. My grandsons watched it with us and understood the entire theme. Emotionally very moving. The use of color and light is exceptionally beautiful. I would recommend this movie to all audiences.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I watched it and it was a huge dissapointment. The beginning was so slow me and my GF almost stopped it before it started to pick-up. In short, just wasn't good.<br /><br />Okay movie if you are looking for something to watch on cable and this happens to be starting, but to rent/purchase: save your money!
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Worth watching ... suspenseful ... good actors ... sometimes a bit on the dark side for my taste but still worth watching.

0307957837|3.0|Although it's 3 physical books for publishing reasons, His Dark Materials (HDM)is one continuous story (well... see below), so I'm reviewing the whole set. It isn't useful to review one part alone.<br /><br />HDM is a decent read with many great elements. On Orson Scott Card's \\"MICE\\" scale--Milieu, Idea, Character, and Event--it's mostly a Milieu story, so expect a tour of the world(s), focusing on the strangeness therein and the history thereof. It's a great setting with many fabulous ideas underlying the various worlds, so enjoy it. Put it in the same space as The Phantom Tollbooth or Gulliver's Travels.<br /><br />In fact, it is a direct descendant of Gulliver. Whereas Swift used Gulliver to compare and lambaste political groups of his day, Pullman uses HDM to address questions of morality, responsibility, and sacrifice. He isn't as successful as Swift, but very few are.<br /><br />Structurally, HDM is three stories, but they're intertwined from the very beginning. The foreground (and best-known) story is a classic milieu-as-character setup. Our two pre-adolescent protagonists, Lyra and Will, travel across worlds and regions of the worlds meeting different kinds of people (including the requisite cast of disposable, self-sacrificing allies) and facing episodic dangers; it's an adventure tale in the \\"come back more mature\\" mold and it works passably. The character development is slight, but the maturation element--Lyra slowly falling in first love with Will--is handled with delicacy and grace.<br /><br />The adventure story is marred by some very strange author intrusion--one particularly jarring section explaining that Lyra's skill at inventing stories and telling them is lying and therefor unrelated to imagination, which she doesn't have--and a strange and unbelievable detachment from any sense of loss in the children when friends and family are taken from them. Neither character is particularly likable or sympathetic, either.<br /><br />The second, and more successful, story--the Character story in Card's taxonomy--is off-camera in the first book and comes more and more to the forefront as the story continues. This involves the tension between Lyra's estranged parents, their individual world-shattering goals, and their love (or lack thereof) for Lyra. It's a redemption story and the only real weakness is not showing us any changes in her father until the very end when we learn that they must have happened. This isn't as bad as it seems since her father is extremely taciturn and hides his plans and goals even from his closest allies. If the books had focused on this story entirely, they would have been far more effective but probably far less popular.<br /><br />The third story is the Idea story and fails almost completely. There are rarely more than three pages in a row of non-narrative explanation of the author's moral and ethical beliefs and they are often couched in the fantasy metaphors of the main stories, at least, but Pullman's judgments of the main characters--unsupported by the events in the story and invalidating the value of the story if true--would disrupt any enjoyment the books had if they weren't so easily dismissed.<br /><br />The book also sets up a variety of elements it never follows up on: the process of moving from childhood to adulthood is a major question underlying the magic of the story and often discussed but is never actually probed, the nature of the soul is a recurring question that drives all of the characters but is never discussed in interesting real detail, the distinction between soul and spirit is raised--even referencing Aquinas by name--but its relation to the story is dropped immediately, and the relationship between free will and sin (including a threat to free will itself) underlies the character story but that either dissolves into a question of sentience or disappears altogether.<br /><br />Major plot holes, lost plot elements, and gracelessly dropped storylines also mar the books. The single item driving the \\"ticking clock\\" of the adventure story is every faction's belief that Lyra has a crucial choice to make that will determine the fate of the multiverse. If she ever makes that choice, it is completely unclear. A prophesy of Lyra committing a \\"great betrayal\\" that will \\"hurt her greatly\\" is tossed away on a small sacrifice that is not clearly a betrayal, does not hurt her any more than her companions (who make the same sacrifice), and leads to greater power and freedom for her and her dearest friend. The highest tension plot thread--an assassin tailing Lyra across multiple worlds, coming closer and following her friends to reach her, is resolved with--literally--a deus ex machina producing a small redemption plot element but leaving the assassin story--if you'll pardon the pun--bloodless.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cast of characters is fabulous. The mother's daemon (her soul in an externalized form, much like a familiar--every human character from Lyra's world has one)<br />is truly terrifying, and her mother and father are close behind. The random allies she meets--such a talking polar bear, a Texan aeronaut, a \\"gyptian\\" (sort of a gypsy) king(1) and the seer/scholar who attends him, and a pair of gay angels--are well-drawn and lovable characters with flaws and motives of their own, although a few--the queen of a witch clan and a scientist from our world--are less effective.<br /><br />The villains are deliciously evil, dripping in cold, fascist malice or driven by a hot and frightening hatred. The use of the daemons to show a person's character and mood is an excellent device. When a snake slithers out of one man's sleeve we know instantly that he is hiding things and is cold-blooded. The jackrabbit daemon of the Texan tells us that he is always aware and able to move instantly, despite his slow drawl and easy nature. And her father's regal snow leopard shows us his strength, his confidence, and his brutality. Not that we need the leopard to see that....<br /><br />So these are a fun enough read. Ignore the philosophizing; it doesn't go anywhere and it doesn't actually impact the other stories in the ways it seems like it should. In the end, none of the characters are as driven by faith, fear, or belief as they claim. Enjoy the adventurous tour of the multiverse with Lyra and her discovery of her burgeoning adolescence (really, that is very well handled). Watch the parents for their slow, secret changes and the real motivations behind their grandiose schemes; marvel at their audacity and confidence as well. Lament the dead, cheer in the bravery, and remember that this is a children's book above all; it should be larger-than-life and show decisions and consequences more clearly than they truly are.<br /><br />Fun read. Worth the time if you have it. But don't put down something else to read it first.<br /><br />The movie makes some interesting changes, btw, some of which are more successful that then book. See it for Sam Elliot, if nothing else.<br /><br />(1) Yes, we get the proverbial \\"King of the Gypsies.\\" Only he's not lying about it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|There are scenes in this movie that won't go away (Lincoln and Grant sitting on a porch in rockers and talking).<br /><br />Lincoln's explanation to his cabinet of his reasons to want to pass the Amendment eliminating slavery says in few words why he was a great President.<br /><br />But . . . this is a slow movie with lots and lots of details and conversations.<br /><br />Were this a Discovery production it would have been shown in less time, fewer scenes, and a  faster pace.<br /><br />I just got tired of the movie - too long, too slow.
B0000009SM|5.0|Melodic Jazz Hard Rock and all of Zappa's genius with the Dream Team band.<br /><br />If I were stuck on a desert island with a $50,000 stereo and one CD, this would be it. Seriously. Complete Bach would be second. Good company.<br /><br />&#34;Inca Roads&#34; is an ecstatic career high point. San Ber'dino is rockin' heaven, and Pojama People is a song you simply must have in your mind to survive modern times and modern people...

B001UGB1X8|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones is a much more convincing  Dave Robicheaux than Tom Cruise is in his Jack Reacher movie.  Great type casting by the director/ producer and great acting by Tommy Lee Jones.  It appears that Mr. Jones continues to perfect his craft of acting and providing entertainment and drama to his viewers.  Great work and I hope he makes another movie soon!
B00459EZLW|5.0|it gets canceled.  I was really starting to enjoy the show, especially the story arcs about the crew getting to meet the desendants of their alternates.  Very interesting and cool stuff.  Too bad the network didn't hav the stomach to stick things out another season or two to see if the audience grew, I think it would have.
0440539811|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars.<br /> - As science fiction it would get 2<br /> - As philosophy it would get 1 (the world-view it argues for is much better discussed in other books--some of them even by RAW)<br /> - As humor it would get 3. Maybe 4 on a good day<br /> - As conspiracy theory it would get 4<br /> - As research it doesn't even rate 1<br /> - As a good guide to things to research for yourself, it's a solid 4 (great game: open to a random page and pick 5 things to look up in a library)<br /><br />But it crosses the line on two things:<br /> * Cultural references that make points and explain things in the SF/geek/outcase/introvert subcultures. The Roberts nailed the experience of believing you're different and believing that what you want or experience is different and wanting to share it with the world. The terms and phrases that come out of this (fnord, illuminati, AUM, \\"You'll like it inside the apple,\\" All Hail Discordia, Law of Fives, Aneristic Illusion, Paratheoanametamystichood, etc.) may not all be original, but they have built a part of a culture. Much like it's worth seeing Monty Python even if you don't \\"get\\" the humor to understand the \\"code.\\"<br /><br /> It inspired two (excellent) card games and a wide variety of \\"bits\\" of other games, books, comics, and so forth.<br /><br />* This book is one of the best tools for an adolescent or young adult (not YA--young adult) colonostickectomy. A young person hiding their creativity and trying to be \\"serious\\" so they can make it through life will get a huge amount of value from this book. You have to forgive them for believing the viewpoint for a few years and then you have to forgive them for rejecting it for a few. In the end, they'll probably come to a happy medium, but they'll always be gratefull for getting that damned uncomfortable thing out of their butt.<br /><br />Oh yeah... the first 100 pages suck. Really. They're bad. But they're never referenced again (well, until the last 100 pages, which you really just skim looking for jokes), so skim them or skip them. You really don't need to start reading until the words \\"Egyptian Mouth-Breeder\\" appear on the page.<br /><br />Actually, that might be the simplest and best review of all:<br />You really don't need to start reading until the words \\"Egyptian Mouth-Breeder\\" appear on the page.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thoughtful and thought provoking.  I know there's been criticism of Sheryl, but what she says I can identify with on almost every point.  (And I've lived through the feminist movement!)  She has the data to back up what she is saying and I really respect that.  This isn't just opinion (tho she does share her opinions, but connects opinions to data.

B0054SMIH6|5.0|This is a very well done movie.  Great acting by the star and his driver especially.  Can't think of anything that I would change.  It's good enough that I will watch it a second time.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|Well, what can I say? How could I possibly give this DVD anything less than five stars? OK, here's a disclaimer: I'm a Ramones fan and have been ever since the \\"End of the Century\\" LP in 1978. Surely,  this is one of America's greatest rock 'n' roll band and there's relatively little info about them available, particularly in their formative years. They're monumentally  influential in the history of popular music. Their mere presence in England in the mid-70s started the whole Punk Rock/New Wave revolution with the Ramones getting little of the credit, at least at the  time. Now, here's a wonderful tribute in the form of their concert recordings from 1974-1996. It's a wonderful DVD. Note that 96 out of 105 rankings are five stars. Well, that's probably the effects of Ramones fans.<br /><br />Here's over 20 years of concerts. They're all pretty much alike. Joey Ramone stands in the middle and leans forward on his mike as he sings with his hair draped over his face. Johnny, the guitarist, is typically on his right and Dee Dee, the bassist, is to his left. Both are hyper-active in their playing. The drummer (variable) is behind the three. Their songs are short, fast, loud and simple. They all have a certain generic similarity. There usually is little break between songs. A concert is like a musical onslaught. It's repeated with only minor variations year after year and venue after venue. The DVD goes on and on and on and repeats and repeats and repeats the limited selection of songs. To a Ramones fan, it's wonderful. To  someone who doesn't care for the Ramones, it would probably be deadly. Well, what can I say? Who but a deep-dyed Ramones fan would ever order this DVD, or even know about it?<br /><br />The selections by the Ramones are the same, no matter what. But the quality of the video and sound recordings is highly variable. I prefer to listen to the Ramones loud, as it was meant to be. The sound quality on the DVD is not particularly good, however, and I seem  to end up with a headache after about 30 minutes. On some of the selections, the sound is just awful, on others fairly good. You might keep in mind that the recordings are a compilation from many different sources, not a planned project. As such, I'd have to give the compiler high marks and an excuse for  the variable quality. So, anyway, enjoy as best you can.

0765350386|4.0|Sanderson's first book, Elantris set a high bar for his storytelling: it mixed classic fantasy tropes without being easily summarized by cliches and it left a world begging for a sequel.<br /><br />Mistborn takes a different tack. It hides its fantasy tropes under the structure and language of other genres, especially political intrigue (a common fellow-traveler with fantasy) and heist stories, and this time the plot fits easily in to some of the most overdone cliches in the genre.<br /><br />It works out really well. The fantasy cliches--Apprentice Mage with Incredible Potential discovered, the One Truly Good Nobleman, Overthrowing the Dark Lord, the Survivor of the Unsurvivable Place/Event/Pudding, the Prophesied Hero, the Secret Society of Assassins (and Secret Society of Mages, in this case), etc.--are well-balanced by the procedural story. In addition, the plot plays out slowly, but the story never drags. Good set pieces keep up the energy while allowing time for the characters to reflect and form complex reactions and opinions.<br /><br />Mistborn is the first book in a trilogy, but it stands well on its own.<br /><br />Like with Elantris, it's the pacing that really shines. The story plays out over a year and almost entirely in one city; chapters frequently pick up weeks after the previous chapter. Our heroine, the aforementioned Discovered Powerful Mage in Training, has the time to voice the same concerns and questions that the reader has and, unusually for the genre, to discuss them with other characters and make decisions about them rather than simply dismiss them.<br /><br />As with Elantris, the world is the real star. It's a pre-renaissance type settings, with mercantile families serving as local governments and all national resources belonging to the monarch, in this case the Lord Ruler (no name given), the thousand-year-old hero whom official doctrine describes as a shard of God. The Lord Ruler ascended to godhood when he defeated the Darkness that would destroy the world, not that anyone really knows what that Darkness was or what he did to defeat it.<br /><br />For the thousand years since the defeat of this unknown evil, the world has changed: plants grow gray, strange ash falls from the sky, and eerie mists filled with strange creatures rise every night all across the empire. The defeat of the darkness also marks the rise of magic in the world, a kind of power called Allomancy which allows the wielder to consume metals to use one of 10 fairly clever powers (the powers are all pretty flexible utilities, like increasing or decreasing someone's emotions, limited telekinesis, increasing physical strength and endurance or perceptions, or detecting/hiding the presence of magic).<br /><br />The Lord Ruler is the most powerful Allomancer alive, of course, and he set his supporters' families up as nobles and declared everyone else \\"skaa,\\" serfs owned by the Lord Ruler himself and leased to noble houses as labor. This system is enforced by Allomancy: only nobles develop it (and only a small percentage of them) and allowing a half-noble/half-skaa to come to term--which could result in an Allomancer skaa--is a capital offense.<br /><br />Of course, half-skaa happen anyway, and our two main heroes are half-skaa Allomancers: Keisler, a gentleman thief with an inflated ego, and Vin, a street urchin raised in underworld thief groups. Keisler discovers Vin and realizes she is using Allomancy instinctively, so he sets out to release her from her life of lower-class crime, train her in magic, and introduce her to his life of upper-class crime.<br /><br />It's a great start: a classic setup, well-used cliches, and interesting characters. We have culture clash (skaa vs. nobles, underworld vs. productive member of society), an exciting world (strange, possibly undead, creatures in the mist, mages coming in the night as assassins, half-metal Allomancers with spikes for eyes to enforce religious dogma), a coming-of-age story (Vin is ~16 and has spent her life hiding from beatings and rapes, so she needs a chance to try to be adult), and a chance to delve into a very strange and creative magic system. The trilogy story promises to go deep into the history, structure, and philosophical impact of Allomancy, much as Elantris went into the magic of that world.<br /><br />The plot brings us the heist story. Keisler has been hired to steal something and he gathers his old friends, other specialists in the underworld, to form his plan, \\"Impossible Mission Force\\"-style. The heist takes place over a year of positioning, setbacks, investigation, and skullduggery, with--as the heist genre demands--plans falling apart towards the end, leaving the heroes to improvise.<br /><br />The fun part: They've been hired to steal the empire.<br /><br />Their client is a leader in the skaa resistance (it's been 1,000 years... the resistance is not especially effective) and wants the capital city, the palace, and the treasury placed in the hands of a skaa army. He also wants Keisler to get him a skaa army.<br /><br />It's a silly plan, but it gets broken down to manageable chunks that actually make sense: get a few thousand armed men inside he city, get the city guard and private guards outside, sieze the treasury, and hunker down for the nobles' infighting to destroy the empire. Not that it could go that simply, and everyone on the team admits they'll probably all die instead, but Kiesler is extremely charismatic (and written in a way that I'll believe people would follow him) and he's chosen allies, all half-skaa Allomancers, who both hate the empire and love a challenge.<br /><br />The heist elements work very well. Vin is trained My Fair Lady-style to move in noble society and spy on their alliances, the pragmatic matters of training men and moving weapons and armor are sorted out and adjusted, and nightly raids, assassinations, and rumor-mongering keep the noble houses at each others' throats.<br /><br />The magical training storyline is also good. The magic system is quite enjoyable. Most Allomancers, called Mistlings, can only use one of the 8 basic powers; the heist squad is led by a mix of Mistlings in the traditional \\"squad of specialists\\" style of heist stories everywhere. Keisler and Vin, however, are Mistborn, a rarer kind of Allomancer (we see maybe 10 others in the book?) who can use all 8 basic metals and the 2 \\"special\\" metals. Mistborn are extremely powerful (and respected in noble society), but it's a lot for Vin to learn while also hiding from the inquisition, learning to act like a noble, and finally growing up.<br /><br />With all this weighty and ponderous story, Mistborn needs some good light action to keep it moving. It gets this in a series of set pieces around Allomancy. Two of the powers of a Mistborn are Ironpulling and Steelpushing: the ability to push or pull on metal objects at a distance. It's a kind of limited telekinesis that can only affect metals and it can only operate directly towards or away from your center of mass. Mistborn use this to travel by throwing coins down and steelpushing off of them, launching themselves into the air. They steer by pulling or pushing on nearby metals and pull the coins back into their hand before they get out of range.<br /><br />Despite the limitations of this telekinesis, and every noble being prepared for it, it leads to some very exciting scenes. We have races and duels between Kiesler and Vin, Kiesler or Vin fighting armored guards or fighting specialist guards who wear no metal, or complex fights against other Allomancers, with metal objects flying around, impossible feats of strength and balance, and even a form of limited precognition. The bulk of the action involves the telekinesis; the mass of the anchor being pushed or pulled (relative to the Allomancer) and the angle to the object make these fights physics intensive, but they don't slow down and it's always easy to follow, even when Kiesler is simultaneously using his power to move himself around a safe and trying to get the safe out of the room so he can steal it.<br /><br />So what doesn't work well? The coming-of-age story. Of course Vin falls in love with a charming young noble, and of course none of the heist crew believe that he's a good man (most of them kill nobles whenever they can get away with it, regardless of who the noble is). Vin's growing feelings for the boy--the scion of the most powerful noble house (of course) and a noble who is \\"different\\" from the rests (of course)--are mostly left unexplored until it suddenly becomes relevant near the end of the book. It is used to explore why the major characters hate nobles (which is handled well) and to generate conflict between Vin and Kiesler.<br /><br />In general Vin's emotional growth is handled oddly. Sanderson uses a device with Vin where she ruminates on phrases her missing brother used to tell her in between beatings. These messages are inevitably on the themes of \\"trust no one\\" and \\"you will be alone all your life,\\" even including promises that her brother would betray her someday (which he appears to have done... foreshadowing alert). The device works well enough, although not spectacularly, but is overused and comes across as one-dimensional.<br /><br />There is also a half-hearted attempt for Kiesler to teach Vin lessons about friendship (in the face of her brother's advice), but that is treated very lightly when it should have been a major event. Disappointing, but not devastating. When it finally takes hold, the change seems sudden and uninteresting.<br /><br />Fortunately, the emotional front is the only place Mistborn stumbles, and even there it doesn't completely fall down. With two more books to come in the series, I'm hoping for continued improvement and I'm excited to see how the story plays out. It's a fun heist/action story with a great world and good characters. He still has time to do some real character development.

There are far to many f-words in it I would rate it for teans or older. It's a story about a man stuck on mars trying to survive long enough to be rescued.

B000001GS0|5.0|Every conductor of note has recorded the Brahms symphonies and there is no other set I find as satisfying. Jochum gets committed performances from his band, without imposing odd mannerisms or injecting himself into the mix. That said, these are rhapsodic accounts, never sterile or by-the-book, brimming over with life. From the early 50's, the recordings are in mono but the fidelity is excellent.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|the story just didn't say much to me, especially when they finally go to get Broomhilda and they feel the need to put on an act to purchase her.  It would of been so much easier in my opinion if he had left Django somewhere and just asked to purchase the slave that spoke German after talking with Mr Candy for a bit.  But that would of been a terrible story, so I digress.<br /><br />Anyway, a few other things didn't make sense such as the masked woman whom I am assuming was Zoe Bell as I saw her in the credits. What was the point?  Why was she looking at photos before Django came in and killed them all? Additionally.. why at the end did they send the three other newly purchased slaves to the mines?  Made no sense.<br /><br />All together though, the movie is a nice escapism flick albeit a bit long winded.

B009RH9FR6|4.0|A little on the thick side but provides good enough protection. The revolving panel is especially helpful in reading and watching movies.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|This is a solid, suspenseful film, with lots of interesting historical background. Most people are probably familiar with the premise by now - 6 Americans manage to escape the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in the 70s when it is taken over (which led to the Iranian hostage crises). Hiding out in the Canadian embassy, they have few options for escape. Ben Affleck's character plays the CIA agent who hatches a plan to extract them - they are scouting locations for a film to be shot there. To make it plausible they have to hire a real director and special effects coordinator in Hollywood, use a real script, and get some press. The premise is loosely based on an actual escape that took place, but the facts are much different than portrayed in this film - the Canadians did most of the work in the real case, with the CIA in a supporting role, and there wasn't as much drama involved in the actual escape.<br />But if you watch this as fiction, and don't get caught up in that, it's a good film. I thought the opening sequence, where the embassy is taken over, was masterful, really capturing the chaos and fear of the scene, as well as the time period. That is really the strength of the film throughout, as well as the building of suspense. Less successful for me were the attempts at character development, both Affleck's and the hostages. But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B00871C09S|5.0|Rear Window is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, and one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is tied with Silver Linings Playbook as my 7th favorite film of all time. It is a total masterpiece of film making, and it is one that must have been amazing to make from a directors point of view. Hitchcock has had a lot of films that I would have loved to experience from his point of view, but if I could go back in time and be him for the making of one of his films I would choose Rear Window because it must have been fascinating for him. I think that because it was fascinating just to watch the movie, because it felt like you were really there. It felt like you were spying on all of the neighbors that he was spying on. That is why it is such a remarkable movie, because you feel like you are there, and because it is original as it gets. I imagine that Hitchcock must have felt like he was watching real people going through their lives in one room the entire time.<br /><br />What is so remarkable about the film is how it all takes place in one mans apartment, and how you can only see inside of his home, and what he can see out of his rear window. The plot and character development is very unique and remarkable. A photographer with a broken leg cannot leave his apartment, and he must sit in a wheelchair and look out at the neighbors. Because of how hot it is nobody will close their windows so he can spy on everybody, and he gets to know all of his neighbors, and what they are up too. He even names certain people. There is one lady who he calls \\"Mr.'s lonely heart\\" because she is always pretending to have a man over and then starts to cry in the middle of it. There s also a ballet dancer who he spies on, who he calls \\"Ms. Torso\\". My favorite thing is the musician who lives up stairs. You hear his piano playing throughout the entire movie, and at one point Hitchcock makes a cameo and he is with the musician. He throws a party and you can tell he is trying to make it tothe radio. There are newly weds who have moved next door, and there are also two people who sleep on the fire escape stairs. Somehow the neighbors who are innocent seam like something would happen to them. Hitchcock made the things with the neighbors suspenseful, and you will know what I mean by that when you see it. Well the film is really slow, so it can develop the relationships between characters, and the lives of his neighbors.<br /><br />The man's name is L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart), and he is the peeping Tom who stares out the Rear Window all day. It starts off one the first day of his last week in a cast. He has a girlfriend named Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who is beautiful, sophisticated, and a bit of a celebrity. He doesn't think that she is right for him, because her high-class sophisticated life doesn't blend with his working class life. He doesn't think she will be able to be with him for that reason. It is actually more of a thing where he doesn't think that he is good enough for her. The develop that more as the story goes, and I didn't pick up on how they developed it the first time I saw it.<br /><br />He also has a nurse named Stella (Thelma Ritter) who comes in to take care of him everyday while he is recovering. He is so bored and all he can do is spy on the neighbors, and she makes fun of him for being a peeping tom. Lisa also makes fun of him for that, but she eventually begins to take an interest in the man that he is spying on and so does Stella.<br /><br />The man they are spying on in particular is a man who looks like he probably just murdered his wife, and looks very suspicious. He makes several trips in the middle of the night with a briefcase, and is using things like saws. All of this is causing Jeffries to get very suspicious, and he even contacts the police, but the won't do anything because that isn't convincing or good enough to get a warrant.<br /><br />The thing about the film is that you know the guy killed his wife, so the suspense isn't who did it, did he do it. It is how are they going to prove this, and how will it end. The ending is unpredictable until you get to it, and the suspense at the end is crazy, and tremendous. The first hour and twenty minutes were good, and interesting but the rets of the film is crazy and awesome. That is why I love the film so much. It is so fascinating. It is also beautiful and peaceful at first. The neighborhood is very nice and peaceful, and it is beautiful at sunset and at night. The film makes me feel happy, at peace, and it puts me on the edge of my seat. It is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film, and I love a lot of his films so that says a lot. What a genius, and I think that this film really shows how he was the master of suspense. The ending of the film was probably one of the most suspenseful, and on the edge of your seat endings of all time. Such a phenomenal movie. The only two Hitchcock films that challenged this one for being my favorite were \\"North By Northwest,\\" and \\"Psycho.\\" But they are entirely different. Also his best films always have James Stewart in them. Well the best ones usually either have James Stewart, Cary Grant, or Grace Kelly in them, so if you want to get into Hitchcock know that the ones you should watch always have one of those actors in it. There are only a few of his absolute most amazing films that don't have them in it like \\"Psycho,\\" \\"The Birds,\\" and \\"Strangers On A Train.\\"<br /><br />He was really good at having people in one small setting for the entire film. He did that with \\"Rope,\\" and \\"Lifeboat.\\" But he perfected the idea of having an entire movie in only one place with this film.

It did not make the book unreadable, only annoying. We are definitely a very long way from the singularity.

B00B7VPKMY|3.0|I purchased this set basically to upgrade my original release CDs to the remastered versions.  The price was right, and I'm mostly satisfied.  I like the picture sleeves, which match the front and back covers of the original LPs, though I would have liked the sleeves for the first album, Hotel California and The Long Run to be full reproductions of the LP gatefolds.  This also would have been a good opportunity to include a few non-album tracks, like \\"Get You in the Mood\\" (b-side to the original \\"Take it Easy\\" single) and \\"Please Come Home for Christmas/Funky New Year.\\"  My biggest disappointment, however, is that \\"The Long Run\\" is NOT the remastered version -- the levels and overall sound quality are very weak compared to the other five albums.

B008220DIC|4.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is a filmmaker with one of the strangest resumes in film; he made a decent splash with his quiet modern noir HARD EIGHT, then made arguably his biggest splash with the Scorsese-flavored and ingenious BOOGIE NIGHTS and soon people were expecting greater and greater things. Then came MAGNOLIA, which was another ensemble film, but with sequences just too bizarre for most audiences to connect with, but with the people it did connect with, they found a \\"cult\\" filmmaker who was ready to get major Hollywood stars on board with a film with decidedly independent sensibilities. After that came the impossibly charming and heartfelt PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, featuring Adam Sandler in what is a revelatory performance that should have been more career-defining than it turned out to be. It was another film that divided audiences because it showed Sandler as less of a clown and more of a deeply pained individual. After that was the critically-adored yet incredibly dark THERE WILL BE BLOOD, with another powerhouse performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Now, Anderson has created another film that will be his most divisive yet; a film that seems to be about the birth of Scientology, simply called THE MASTER.<br /><br />It's hard to rehash some of the things in this film, because, while there is something of a Point-A-to-Point-B narrative structure, it seems as fractured and fragile as this film's main character, Freddie (Joaquin Phoenix), the shell-shocked drunkard WWII veteran who finds some semblance of family in the presence of the astute and magnetic writer-academic Lancaster Dodd aka \\"The Master\\" (Anderson regular Philip Seymour Hoffman), and his demure yet powerful wife Peggy (Amy Adams). The Master's psuedo-science/psuedo-religious/psuedo-psychological group The Cause is small, but incredibly devoted, with Freddie at the center of what could be considered its triumpths on one day and its failures on another. Dodd sees science and elements of science fiction in all life, and appears one day to be a powerful voice in a new era of reason and then the next, a charlatan who is simply leeching off the rich and powerful. No matter what, though, Peggy remains firmly at his side, content to be almost Shakespearean in her duties to her husband.<br /><br />One of the things so polarizing about this film is that the \\"events\\" in the film are almost incidental when it comes to the performances and the dialogue. The film itself first and foremost serves as the return of Joaquin Phoenix, rising from the ashes of his bizarre self-parody, to his almost Brando-esque magnetism we had seen on display from many of his previous films like the severly underrated WE OWN THE NIGHT, RESERVATION ROAD and QUILLS. His performance is so raw and so incredibly impassioned that we feel that this is no longer a performance we're watching, but almost the subject of a documentary. Say what you will about Day-Lewis as Lincoln or any of the other nominees for Best Actor, but this may very well be the performance of the year. Hoffman is a wonderful blend of antiseptic intellectual and fiercely passionate in his performance, and again, totally magnetic. It's hard to feel who's a more mesmerizing on-screen presence when the two of them share the screen. While Adams is indelible and excellent as Peggy, she sadly doesn't get to give much of an impression since her screentime is relegated to almost a background player against the titans of character that Freddie and The Master are.<br /><br />Visually, the film, shot in 70mm, is incredibly beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (whose previous credits include the two most recent Francis Ford Coppola films TETRO and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH) gives the film such texture that you can see every line on the actors' faces and every grain of sand on a beach. Anderson has created a visually stunning film, if nothing else.<br /><br />And therein lies some of the problem. The film doesn't seem to have much of a narrative,which works both to its benefit and to its liabilities. It never makes a statement that this cult-like gathering of The Cause is either evil or good and leaves that to the audience to decide upon, which is a great benefit. But at the same time, there is no clear protagonist and no clear antagonist, unless you look at the film from a more philosophical point of view. That's all well and good, but anyone would have to admit that for a 2-plus hour film, it doesn't hurt to have a little bit of conflict. But again, the film's narrative can be viewed from a strictly philosophical and sociological point of view, and that is very much in the wheelhouse of the people who love this film.<br /><br />Think what you will about the film, but you can't really deny the raw power of the performances of Phoenix and Hoffman in THE MASTER, and based on the merits of that alone, this is a film worth seeing.which works both to its benefit and to its liabilities.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I bought this on my son's request because he liked the first Temple Run.  He says it is really fast paced.  They added a &#34;ton&#34; of new stuff.  I think a lot of people would enjoy playing it, I would recommend it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book because its funny and it talks about football a lot. This is a great book that really makes you happy and sad at the same time.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is outstanding, channeling Lincoln.  Sally Fields also does a fine job as Mary Todd Lincoln.  Nice view of legislative process.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|How can you go wrong with anything by Steven Wilson.  Yes, he's the master of Porc Tree and so many wonderful side projects, including this.<br /><br />What do you get here?  Top notch instrumentation, brilliant musicians working with him.  Many longer pieces for them to collaborate on.  Musically dense in spots, yet light in others with Steven singing on top.  Fascinating how this work really is a great combination of these warriors playing together.<br /><br />While others have compared it to jazz, King Crimson (early), Porcupine Tree, Steve's other solo works, hey, what do you expect?  Yes, there are a few &#34;jazz like&#34; spots, with rather mellow flute, or heavy duty sax.  But this is not really jazz, not even a jazz fusion.  Just some jazz elements.  King Crimson, yeah, I hear the references, but not really sure that it was that intentional.  Porcupine Tree--sure there are many aspects of that band in here but, afterall, Steve is PT.<br /><br />For me, one sign of well designed disc or piece of music is how quickly you can absorb it.  While some other folks produce tunes based around 3 chords, and they drill the melodies into your head, that's not Steven's direction.  It can take a few listening sessions before you can fully understand what's going on here.  That's a terrific thing.  You won't be bored with this work years later; it's that interesting, and so cleverly designed. Yes, you've got the crunching guitars, but, then, listen to the keyboard work and mellotron.  He's got an amazing group performing.  I'm already two times through the disc and hear something new everytime.  It's that good.<br /><br />Music should entertain, make you think (at least a little bit), be fun, challenge you, be a little different.  Steven's &#34;Raven&#34;: does all that.  Look at the long career paths of the 3 chord musicians and compare that to the quality being produced by this man.  He's produced a very long body of work, and &#34;Raven&#34; belongs right on the top ofit.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this bingo game a lot, especially being able to see the numbers called so I can check if I've missed something. But I don't want to connect to Facebook yet I still get the ongoing Chat Now down the left side of my screen. It is very distracting and sometimes the people can be rude or nasty, although most are friendly and kind. I would like the option to block this dialogue.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This dystopian novel is gripping and would make an outstanding movie.  The reader is pulled into this world he creates with vivid characters and action.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|With two narrators, one a black slave and one a white indentured servant, The Kitchen House explores the question of what constitutes family, complicated by the roles of place and dominance in the 18th Century American South. Kathleen Grissom's novel<br />has well-defined characters and a gripping plot.  Grissom does an excellent job of capturing the dialect of the various classes. This  was a good choice for the book discussion group I belong to.  What prevents me from rating it with a 5th star is the essential presumptuousness that is a part of any attempt by a white author to depict the black experience.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|My husband read this and said it was great. Learned a lot about what service men do for America.<br />Words used were sometime to much for the reader.

Daniel Craig is one of the top 3 Bonds. Sean Connery is number 1 Peirce Bronson number 2. I guess it is who you grew up with. ( Tom Baker is the best Dr. Who )

B004JM8X5E|5.0|\\"Powder\\" is a deeply moving film about the very difficult topic of what we humans do when someone different is in our midst and we have to deal with him or her. Some people have difficulty with 'difference', and this can be the cause of much pain and suffering.<br /><br />The movie is basically dealing with this topic, while also offering some quasi-spiritual/psychological insights into the nature of the Universe and who we really are, specifically something like: \\"All matter is energy. We are matter. Therefore, we are energy.\\" Whether or not you agree with this logic, it makes the premise of the 'difference' in the movie.<br /><br />Other reviewers discuss the plot and script, and their strong and weak points, but what I found outstanding in the movie was the character -- Sheriff Doug Barnum -- played brilliantly by Lance Henriksen.<br /><br />I think he has not received proper credit for the compelling job he has done in this film.<br /><br />Henriksen is mostly known for his roles in horror films (i.e. some of the Alien movie franchise, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, etc.) and he can certainly play a \\"baddie\\" with conviction. He's always fun to watch and brings a lot of energy and menace to his roles. But his acting ability far exceeds these roles, and he has a much greater depth than the villains he plays - entertaining as they are.<br /><br />In \\"Powder\\", we get to see more of that wonderful depth as Henriksen delivers a stellar performance that stands out. This is a real accomplishment when you consider he is working with other powerful actors, including Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenbergen, and Sean Patrick Flannery -- who also demand our attention. They are, of course, excellent. But Henriksen somehow brings something extra to his role, a spirit, an energy that compliments, yet rises above, these marvelous actors and their characters.<br /><br />The character that Henriksen plays, Sheriff Doug Barnum, is at heart a good and decent man, trying to honor his role as law officer and balance it with the tragedy in his personal life. As an officer, he must do what the law says, whether he agrees with it or not, but as a human being, he can do so with compassion and dignity. That is what Henriksen brings to the role and it is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />He is tough, no nonsense, strong, yet at times so compassionate and tender. Watch the scene between the Sheriff and his son as they reconcile their differences very carefully. Henriksen makes his character poignantly human, not just a part in a film. It is completely believable and heart wrenching. You really feel for the guy and what he is going through. This happens throughout the film.<br /><br />Of course, much of this is in the script, and is supported by the excellent musical score. The trick is to WATCH Henriksen closely, his facial expressions and his body language, the way he cocks his head, rolls his very expressive eyes. This is where his skills as an actor shine through. He delivers a beautiful performance filled with pathos and emotion, which is the strong point of the film.<br /><br />If you are a Lance Henriksen fan but are used to his horror roles, I think you will find this performance different and refreshing, and a tribute to his skill as an actor.<br /><br />And the movie is very good too.<br /><br />Enjoy!ficer and balance it with the tragedy in his personal life.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think that the show is really about how people react under extreme stress when the traditional rules of society disappear. We get to see the changes as some people succumb to a &#34;kill anyone who is different so you won't be killed&#34; and others manage to overcome it. What is it that makes some people able to maintain compassion? and Will it last? I'm ready NOW for Season 4!
B002AS466O|5.0|I love Bruce Willis' movies and this one didn't let me know.  Good story line from start to finish.  Damon Wayans does a good job portraying a disgraced NFL player.  Because of the language and some of the scenes, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children.
B000003N7K|5.0|I was fortunate to get into jazz @ a very early age, having an  aunt that loved music. Jazz from big bands to small combos were her focus and what I picked at 4 years of age, was what I heard and favored .Now I have owned this in LP when it was released, and think this is my second CD. I have no idea of how many CD's I own, in 2002 after selling off maybe a 100, I was left with about 300. In the past decade this may have doubled, the RVG series and SACD's played a large part in this expansion. In the near future I have to compile a list for insurance purposes, so I will get an idea.<br />The fact this is one of 200 CD's which I have culled for my \\"Best Album Series\\",or the fact it was in what was in my top 100, before I realized I had to expand beyond my original vision. Or maybe the fact I have pristine copies in both CD and SACD. I am retired from most everything except the arts in which dabbled in paint and photos but live in a world driven by music and sound equipment. Each day involved in equipment reviews, trying new equipment and in a constant battle with shaping sound.<br />My next thing will be putting music on to mini cards for travel and security, be tough to say which would be first to record but Dylan, Miles, Jobim, Santana, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Oscar Peterson, Ella, Willie, Colrane, Art Blakey, Clifford Brown, John Coltrane with Johnny Hartman. Will all be in the pile of the first to recorded on this new media.<br />This is the Ballad Album to own, if it is to be only one. And I am a big Ella fan ...
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This starts as a prequel to the legend of Robin Hood, Different from the Kevin Coustner version.  Still highly enjoyable to watch.<br />Maid Marrion played by Kate Blanchet did a great job. These are the roles that Russell Crowe is best at. ( 3:10 to Yuma, Gladiator,<br />and The Quick and the Dead.)
B00B1CGDTS|3.0|I was expecting a better picture. At times blurry washed out and poor. Not a good blu ray. Keep your dvd. Overpriced too

B0094BB4TW|3.0|first time to try facebook in years.  Everything was going fairly well (except can't get rid of cute relationships) and all the sudden in the middle of my relaxing afternoon I'm asked for a password I never had! No help from fbk except to erase my app and start over.  I think I turned in too many reports on that horrible &quot;cute relationships &quot; that keeps showing up. This was from the free app for my kindle fire and I wonder if that has anything to do with it.<br />If amazon is. concerned about things that are offensive and harrassing they should look into cute relationship that keeps showing up.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Have all on DVD Love the Underworld series an the twist an turns in the story line. Kate Beckinsale is proving she can be a good Female action lead. Good F/X and enough action to not be too much

B008HK3XOU|4.0|This is a great case for the Kidle Fire HD 7. I like the red because its easy to find in my cluttered house and after four months and three international trips, its held up nicely. Would be nice if it had a pocket but I guess you have to give something up for the kickstand display. Would recommend if you are considering buying.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie has returned with a terrific new body of work.<br /><br />I was skeptical, but the more I listen, the more these introspective songs grow on me. This is the mature work of an artist in his maturity. There's a lot of experience behind these songs. There's a ton of emotion behind the songs. I am very much enjoying listening to this fine release.<br /><br />The song, \\"Where Are We Now\\" pretty sums up how I personally feel right now in my life, at age 45. I grew up with Bowie's music. I matured with Bowie. At my age today, I am jaded, somewhat bitter, feeling older, grittier, and frustrated. I'm frustrated with the times we live in. Democracy is under attack, the economy stinks, workers are treated like cattle, I'm still working entry-level positions when I can even find work at all, and financially my future looks bleak indeed. Neoliberal economic policies have devastated me and my world. Maybe I'm guilty of reading too much into Bowie's new CD, but I really feel the solitude, the bitterness, and the pain in these songs. They speak to me.<br /><br />The title song, \\"The Next Day\\" is one of the best songs Bowie has recorded in many years, in my opinion. I really love this song! It has a catchy melody, something today's music lacks somewhat, and for which Bowie himself is famed for. \\"Valentine's Day\\" is a song that inspires the listener spiritually, whether intentional or not.<br /><br />What really struck me is the cover art. Leave it to Bowie to be the most provocative musical act of 2013! The concept to use a now iconic image of one of his past albums and cover it with a blank, empty white rectangle that simply states the title in stark sans-serif text is very brilliant. It makes a very bold statement. The designer in me LOVES this cover! Bravo! I am a professional Graphic Designer and I have to say, I absolutely adore the concept of Bowie's \\"Next Day\\" CD!!! What a great talking-point! To think, we can actually hold entire conversations about album-cover artwork again!<br /><br />Thank you, David Bowie. I love you!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game keeps me entertained.  i would like to see  more rooms which i think is in the  works.  would like some more direction on the missions.

B00BESM14U|5.0|I wish I'd known some of the things that were touched on in this movie when I was sixteen. It made me smile, and cry, and think. Just beautiful. Have to read the book now.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|the game was fun but it says free but it really isnt free. it was for a short time but now in order to play it anymore you need to buy pieces to continue to play
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Every song on this CD was great. I usually do not like every song I purchase on a CD<br />even if it is someone that I really enjoy listening to, but 21 by Adele did not disappoint.<br />If you like Adele, I would suggest purchasing this CD.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I want the blue ray versions so I bought the trilogy and it was great. I really love this trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it fun but it cost way to much to buy another game and now i have to do this just to buy another game kinds dumb like who would want to have to wait and rate things just to be able to play but its fun when u have money
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game.  It was easy to down load and I love the way it changes countriebuy.s with the different people to buy.  It keeps my neiece and nephews occupied when I need to do other things around the house.  Overall love the game.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is a rather simple game, but not as simplistic as one might think at first. There is alot going on, and there are many ways you can play.  It's not boringly predictable, there are surprises.  It is detailed enough to keep you thinking about what you are doing, but it is also possible to just go out and explore, or be a notorious pirate.  One thing to consider is that it is mostly text, there are no dramatic action graphics, so if you are one of those people who read a book and see a movie in your head, you'll like it, otherwise you might not.  I got the free version first, and after the first 3 days, I had to have the Elite version.  I'm not disappointed. If you like the free one, you need the Elite version, because there is so much more to it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great Book. Really glad I waited till the Second Book was already published to read it because the ending left you hanging.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This is the first time I ordere an online stream thru amazon this was a good episode. I'm hooked on this series.
B004RE29WW|5.0|Everyone always says Alien 3 was bad compared to the first two. I now realize these people saw the butchered R-rated version. I was astonished at how much was cut after seeing the special features on this blu ray. Scenes so integral to the movie and plot development are cut, also cut are important action sequences, as well as scenes of gore. This Unrated version is an unknown masterpiece. Alien 3 is unique from the first 2 in that there are no guns, and it takes place on a sci fi alcatraz instead of the usual space ship corridors. the characters are all likeable and extremely well acted just like the first two Alien films. This unrated version of Alien 3, is as every bit essential to a movie lovers collection as the unrated blu ray editions of Alien and Aliens.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was an interesting account of life during the Blitz and a mystery that I sat up late to finish.

B004D20JP2|5.0|Made with puppets filmed in stop-motion (with real-life backgrounds), this half-hour animated short is an absolute delight. It begins in a very bleak way: Peter lives in a very poor shack, and is forbidden to go out the fences that surround it, presumably because of the lurking wolf. We see his poor daily life depicted in almost complete silence. Only when he finds a way out of the fences does the familiar music, along with the familiar story, kick in. And all of a sudden, everything becomes joyous and playful. The duck, who looked miserably starved, finds a new life on the outside. The cat, which served as a vaguely menacing figure in the first part, becomes first-rate comedy material. Even the disabled crow starts oozing a glowing charm.<br /><br />The wolf was bound to appear sooner or later though, at which point the movie enters a more nuanced mood. I'm not going to spoil what happens next, in case you don't already know Prokofiev's tale, although even those who are familiar with it may be in for a couple of surprises.<br /><br />The animation itself is brilliant and I found it genuinely mesmerizing despite the fact that the stop-motion puppets usually are not my favourite animation technique. The puppets themselves are the stars of the show, being incredibly detailed and infused with personality. In fact, only Peter himself appears disappointingly generic. Is it because the director wanted every kid to be able to easily identify with him? If that is the reason, it was not worth the trade-off.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the music is completely faithful to Prokofiev's partition, and the animation does play with the music a lot. It sometimes makes the film appear a little too \\" literal\\", but this is a very minor complain and overall the interaction between music and action is very competent. For the sake of mentioning everything that was less than perfect, I have to add that I found the pacing of the last scene a bit too slow. Again, though, this is easilyforgiven in light of everything that is done right!<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone, no matter their preferences in animation techniques. Some might be rebutted by the beginning's grim mood, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with very delightful scenes. It's also very suitable for children, who will find this version less frightening than Disney's.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent well done movie. History, tense drama, excellent script, well paced this flick had it all. Even though the outcome is known from the beginning it was still incredibly gripping.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the first account I have read of a near death experience by someone in the scientific community.  The author, a neurosurgeon, had always been skeptical of other people's accounts, attributing them to brain activity.  And, even though I've wanted to believe, I've wondered about the same thing.  In his case he has data confirming that his brain was not functioning during that time.  His story is very powerful.

B0095P29EG|4.0|The movie is high energy, intriguing, and action packed. While the storyline is somewhat typical--son of a king with sense of entitlement eventually changes to humbled leader--it is well-written and well-acted.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|wonderful series loved the time period, I wish for more stories  what would happen to Laura, Dorcus  and others wish it didn't end
B008IJTFYW|5.0|When I first got this app it was as just another free app of the day that sounded interesting. Really I just forgot about it until a couple of weeks ago. Now I'm not sure I could sleep without it. Great sounds and being able to control how many and how loud they are is just great. I really love this product and hope you will too.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Is hard to say how much we waste our days without taking them for granted. We are always so ungrateful of what the universe gives us everyday. This book had made this ice cold heart of mine brake in to tears. The book has these young fighters of life fighting constantly not to died they learn how to love and appreciate  life to the fullest, they learn what love is in such a small period of time and they teach others about the universe.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I found him and he's alive and well on my bluray!  I waited so very long for this bluray and it does NOT disappoint.  I understand the 3D version is spectacular but that will have to wait until I buy a 3D TV. The picture is crystal clear - exactly what you've come to expect from Pixar. The surrounds definitely get a workout as well as the bass when Bruce arrives on the scene! I would absolutely recommend this movie as a reference, show-off bluray!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I won't spoil the ending for you, but suffice it to say it was a contrived and far fetched let down that didn't match up with the otherwise steady pace of the plot that lead up to it.  It left me feeling that the whole story was a wasted investment of my time - Boo!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I use this utility a lot to keep my apps organized and within easy reach. I appreciate the app alerting me to new apps that have not yet been classified.
B000002UAR|5.0|THIS DISC SOUNDS GREAT WITH EXCELLENT PACKAGING, IT'S JUST LIKE THE BEATLES ARE PERFORMING FOR YOU RIGHT IN YOUR LIVINGROOM
B008D36INE|3.0|Movie was good. Acting was good. Good plot but not all that great. The characters were believable but soft. OK
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|i really like this game it can get very addicting abd competitive if youre playing against your friends i am always trying to beat them
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I bought this really because its the best Disney cartoon ever but also to check out the long documentary that everybody is raving about &#34;Growing up with 9 guys&#34; I think is the title. Well it was OK or perhaps I wasn't in the mood to watch it. The movie of course looks spectacular and the intermission animations are awesome! Don't know what this is? Press pause on your movie and find out! Its yet another way of disney adding quality and value to an already excellent product!
1423140605|5.0|Our whole family is a fan of Percy Jackson books - and we enjoyed also this one. We can hardly wait for the release of the next 'episode'...
B009K0P10K|5.0|A friend told me about Revenge while I was recovering from foot surgery. I could NOT stop watching it even after my recovery week. I lost so much time watching it, but it's been worth it. Love this show & can't wait for the next episode!! Hoping it gets picked up for another season.
B003L77GGU|5.0|If you like anything with demons, angels, ghosts, vampires, or good looking hunters-this show is for you. If you're looking at the sixth season, you are probably already a fan. Great price and definitely worth the purchase.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this one,a good mix of puzzles and hidden object screens. Graphics are good, and the puzzles somewhat challenging.I recommend playing this one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am totally hooked on the series after watching Seasons 1 and 2.  It was so refreshing to watch a show that doesn't focus on crude humor, sex or violence.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|As usual, Disney/Pixar comes through with another amazing movie!  The blu-ray movie loaded very fast on my old blu-ray player - what a very pleasant surprise!  I don't mind waiting for disney movies to load because 99% of the time its a quality product that's worth the wait! The extra's were awesome to watch. The best surprise was pressing pause and being surprised by the intermission! No longer looking at a paused screen, there is something entertaining to watch while the youngsters have to take a bathroom break!  Get the movie, download it to itunes and enjoy!  Its worth the wait though with amazon prime there is hardly any wait!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a wonderful book!  Nicholas Sparks books are always good.  They also make good movies.  I saw the movie before I read the book.  Not a bad thing to do.  I could put faces to the characters.  He is such a good writer, if you like to cry while trying to read!<br />I totally recommend this book.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I've loved the series from the beginning, but they just keep getting better.  Can't wait to see what's next. :)
1401937519|5.0|Anita's amazing experience removes all fear of death and also pierces the veil of separation. Its such a joyful, inspiring account. Highly recommended.
B007NU54H4|5.0|It was what I expected.  It is fun and good family entertainment.  It has a good plot line and is designed for young girls.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I think the album is very creative and genuine. I found it a refreshing change to a lot of the GARBAGE that is out there nowadays. He definitely has style that goes along with substance...very 90's reminiscent of groups like Tribe Called Quest. It was money well spent!!!
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is devoted entirely to the &#34;game&#34; with very little background as to what happened or why, or how society had devolved so as to make 12 districts starve to death. It felt like an over long poorly written TV show. Not my cup of tea
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Amazing album, worth the buy. On rotation in my car and at work. Can't wait to catch her in concert.
0307454541|2.0|This morning when I woke up at approximately 7:30 it was unnaturally cold outside for spring. It seemed warmth was destined to come late to my city. I checked my e-mail on my ten inch 32 mb iPad 3, but the internet had a connection problem. I wondered if I should have gotten the 4g model after all. At 7:45 I put on faded blue jeans and a clean shirt that read &#34;The angels have the phone box&#34;. Walking down to the kitchen, I fixed myself a pot of coffee and two pieces of toast with jam and sat at the dining room table sipping the bitter beverage and contemplating my paper for English. I still had no original ideas. When my coffee was cold and my toast was naught but crumbs I put on my jacket and headed for school. My husband offered to drive me to class and I accepted. He dropped me off on high street; it was a twelve minute walk away from my Latin class. I used the walk to think about interesting ways to talk about utterly bored I was during The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.<br /><br />I didn't think it would be boring when I started reading it. I expected to be both horrified and entertained, but when the book opened with nearly twenty pages of dialogue about a financial scandal I knew I was in for it, or not in for it at all depending on your point of view. True to my assessment, this was followed by nearly 250 pages of nothing at all happening. Larsson uses these pages to give us his characters breakfast choices, tell us what people's t-shirts say, and give us detailed computer specs. This book makes topics I usually find interesting- sex, political scandals, and decades old mysteries- sound about as interesting as my breakfast food choices or upcoming essay topics. That is to say, like you most likely felt in the first paragraph of this review, I just wanted him to either shut up or get to the point.<br /><br />The characters aren't neccesarily uninteresting but there are a whole lot of them, many of which seem superfluous at best and downright useless at worst. Lisbeth Salandar, the eponymous character, is by far the most interesting. It is unfortunate that we hear very little from her in the first half of the novel. Instead we get stuck with Blomkvist, the mattress hopping journalist whose only real motivation (beyond sleeping with anything female) is saving his failing news magazine by proving he didn't commit libel against a guy named Wennerstr&ouml;m- the aforementioned financial/political scandal that creates several useless, boring chapters.<br /><br />All of monotony continued until I hit the fifty percent point and that's where Larsson starts to shine in a really creepy way. Anyone who has heard anything about this book has heard something about the infamous rape scene and I can testify that it is just as disturbing and squicky as you have heard. It's also the part of the books that puts you on the edge of your seat. I don't know how I feel about being so entertained by such a violent and cruel act. In any case Larsson milks it for all it's worth and, motivated by this, Salandar sets out to help Blomkvist put away a violent serial killer.<br /><br />The next third of the book is a fascinating plot with plenty of twists and turns even if the villains end up being a quite cardboard and a few plot lines get lost along the way. Perhaps I'm simply desperate to love this novel as much as everyone else did. Amazon tells me that nearly 4,000 people considered this book four or five star material. I'm giving it a two. For the critical hype alone, you may want to plow throw it, but it's simply not the masterful narrative I was sold.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book and disagree with me I would really like to hear why. Maybe I should shelve my reservations and slog through the next couple books...ight useless at worst. Lisbeth Salandar, the eponymous character, is by far the most interesting.

B007REV4YI|2.0|I really liked the Bond reboot in Casino Royale.  I enjoyed the more \\"realistic\\" Bond.  Quantum of Solace was not quite as good, but I still found it enjoyable to watch.  I saw all the positive reviews of Skyfall, so I was thinking that it was more like Casino Royale.  I don't know what movie the critics were watching, but I found this Bond to be the worst of the reboot.  The opening action scene was pretty good, but the rest of the movie was boring and contrived.  The main villain was one of the most unbelievable Bond villains ever.  The plot holes were numerous.  The final action scene felt more like Home Alone than a Bond film.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very chilling, but well put together.  Since I remember this event it was good to see our government doing the right thing - thank goodness for people who will take a chance and do what is right.  Lot's of action, good photography.  Will recommend this to my friends.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I got this app to review Microsoft Word and Excel documents while on the road for work.  It was easy to pull the documents from other apps and review/edit them as I had hoped.  If you need an app for your on the go work-life.  This is it.
B00AFEY354|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on the bestselling novel by Stephen Chbosky, follows high school freshman \\"Charlie,\\" the name being an alias to protect his identity.  Charlie narrates the film, much like he did in the novel, as though he were writing to an anonymous \\"friend.\\"  Without having read the book, I can see that parts of the film would be difficult to decipher, since a lot of the messages and themes portrayed in the book are through subtext.  In this way, if you watch the film once, then watch it again later, you start to pick up on elements you may be kicking yourself for not getting the first time.<br /><br />The film is about a boy, Charlie, who is a wallflower (see: loner).  Before the events of the film, he witnessed his best friend commit suicide.  In addition to that scarring incident, there are elements of his past that are unexplained to the viewer that shape his personality.  Before long, he meets Sam, Emma Watson's character.  She is a classic example of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl motif.  Essentially, she is a character that exists only to break the main character (generally a male) out of their shell by getting them to do things that are out of their comfort zone.  It is an overused but nevertheless popular characterization that wasn't as common when the novel was written in 1999, but is all too common today.  Regardless, Emma Watson played her part beautifully and the chemistry with Charlie (Logan Lerman) was palpable.<br /><br />Besides facets of the story being fairly generic, there are parts that are underrepresented in mainstream film.  Topics like homosexuality and abuse are explored in ways uncommon to films for the target age group.  I recommend this film to teens and twenty-somethings struggling with their identity and place in the world (so pretty much anyone age 13-29).
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a coworker who told me she read it in one night. Well. I just did the same thing. This book takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions from the first page. It was so well written, I just kept reading and reading. As soon as I'm done writing this review I'm going to download son  of her other books.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series took a couple of episodes to get introduced to the characters and plot, but after that, we were totally captured!  The series exemplify good family relationships and values.  We are already on season two, and are purposely limiting our viewing to one episode per day to make the series last longer.  Definitely worth watching!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was great. It took a very surprising turn but it also never looked back and I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game I have ever played and got it last month and improved my scores and got mare coins and sorry Temple Run you got to move out of the way.

0143034901|5.0|Once in a while, a book comes along that makes you believe there are still great stories to be told and authors who can make that story come to life before your eyes.  Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's The Shadow of the Wind is a book that will change you.  He made me believe in books and the power of the written word in a time when every story seemed to be about vampires or superficial teenage relationship woes.  The Shadow of the Wind is a novel for people who enjoy the act of reading with every fiber of their being.<br /><br />The story begins with young Daniel Sempere being led to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books by his father.  There, he picks out a book written by Juli&aacute;n Carax.  Soon, he discovers that someone is tracking down all of Carax's books and destroying them.  Daniel becomes obsessed with the elusive author of the novel he cherished, soon becoming entwined in events he never imagined possible.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a story about love, finding oneself, and any number of clich&eacute; reasons to write a book.  However, I have never read a book that described so vividly the feelings boiling over in the hearts of the characters.  Daniel became real to me within the first quarter of the novel, so that what he experienced, I felt I too experienced.  While the themes in the novel are nothing groundbreaking, the execution and story surrounding those themes is so well done, I found myself caring more about the message than I would have if I simply read a synopsis and analysis of the book.  It's a book you have to experience for yourself to understand what I mean.
B009S33I68|5.0|Coming of age in the Vietnam era made this book hard to re-read but after finishing it, I still feel this is the most important book about the Vietnam &#34;conflict&#34; written to date. Moore describes this history changing battle in very human terms from the lowest ranked soldier on up to President Lyndon Johnson. God Bless him and the soldiers and their families who were so easily sacrificed during this dark time in our history.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun,addictive,cool and amazing. It is relaxing and comfortable<br />To play. The game is made very well! Subway surfers is a game you play<br />If your  to do it.<br /><br />By Megan
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but every time it says update now I click on it and takes me to the app store and I open it and it doesn't give me the update
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's not only about winning. It's about seeing all the plays that are available to win. I know I need to use every possible avenue to keep my thinking sharp. I appreciate the simplicity of the game, and the way it provides a double-check for unused plays. I try other solitare games and keep coming back to this one.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Typically great Stephen King writing. Just the right amount of thrill. I wish it was longer as it grabbed you and held on for the entire story.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|This is one of the top love story movies ever! Told in &#34;non-linear&#34; fashion makes it more interesting and fun. South of France locations, Audrey Hepburn's stylish sophistication and Henry Mancini's soundtrack. Wow!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Perfect book, and highly recommended to gain an insight into the &#34;values&#34; of the mafia and also on the discussion of the hypocrisy of this world and its authorities, and how it affects societies and also inspires greatness in people by compelling them to rebel and create their own control spheres.<br /><br />Recommended for everyone,
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Moves along quickly. One of those books that is hard to put down. I would defintely recommend.
B0000062FL|5.0|Bought this album years ago when it was first released. Upgraded my audio system and thought it was time to start getting some of my favorite albums on cd. This is one that is and always will be a treasured favorite.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Whether you appreciate a well-written story that's been ongoing for years or simply enjoy jumping from one show to another, you would love this show from its intricacies to its \\"self-containedness\\" (not a word, I know)! If you loved Friends when you were in your late teens and early 20s, this is definitely something for you! This show has so many characters you can relate to as well as characters you want to live vicariously through. Season Eight is definitely the season where things are coming together and you almost dread that it'll be the last season since the story seems to be getting to the point of how he met his wife. But the writers are so good, I wouldn't be surprised if the story will go beyond meeting his partner for life. :-)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an autobiography of the life of and American hero. He recalls all the hardships and exhilarating moments that his choice of becoming a SEAL has brought to his life. If you are looking for a \\"shot-by-shot\\" account of every kill, this isn't it. This is a great book about the life of an American hero, and US Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle.
B00BYOEZTI|1.0|This was so boring.  I turned it off after the first 15 minutes, then since I had paid 5.00 for it, I tried to get my money's worth and watched the whole thing. It was painful.
B00C1E8E7E|5.0|Tyler's best work so far, genius lyrics as usual coming from him. Album is pretty good from front to back and kind of strays away from the darker songs Tyler wrote in Goblin/Bastard. Even if you dislike Tyler's past works I'd try giving some songs on this album a listen and see how you feel about Tyler's new style.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Graphics are amazing title says the rest<br />One of the best games I have .ever played<br />It is awesome and I highly recommend it for everyone
B004LWZW8I|5.0|Movie came to me in a fast manner and with no harm done. I was surprised because it was really a good movie.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|The updates throughout the years help. Gives this oldie but goodie a fresh look. Clarke bends your mind with out of this world concepts. The twist is exquisite! Gives one more pause about the essential questions we have been asking sine the beginning....who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going?
B003VVFGWC|4.0|Not as good as season 1 but still a great show. The main story line is interesting but just not as cool as the Lilly Kane murder
B007XNAQL0|5.0|Bought this on VHS when it came out, then DVD and now finally remastered from 16mm film on Blu Ray. Great picture and fantastic sound.
1603580557|5.0|There are 100 quotable parts of this work. Please, read it. Especially if your decisions effect other people. For the love of God, read it.<br /><br />I don't give 5 stars easily. I give them if I quote the work often, and it affects my life.<br /><br />Have I told you, you should read the book?
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|finally some new metal! I bought this and is very satisfied with this work compared to the last killswitch self titled album. 3 words for this album.. .melody and style!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I sure do love JT, always have. Great new CD that came to me in a timely manner with no harm done to it.
B001VS46DC|5.0|we are big fans, album great, she is terriffic  Saw her in concert and this dvd was like seeing her again
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album harks back to Queen in the 70's but with all the themes of now. It's very well done in every sense, from the songwriting to the singing to the production. I haven't found an album this interesting since some of Prince's, Queen's and Ben Fold's work. Kudos!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|In the middle of a game you get cut off or it doesn't register the awards u receive. Other people have been able to crash the site and r winners consistently
B00BF11STU|3.0|I thought the movie was interesting and it seemed pretty authentic.  Because it takes place over such a long time period, it was a little hard to follow and the script seemed rather choppy in places.  The military aspects were pretty authentically portrayed and the acting was better than average.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and I thought it was well worth the money spent to buy this season! I highly recommend this purchase.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|The CD came to me in brand new shape with no scratches. The CD also came to me in a timely fashion.
B003AKLFAG|4.0|I am not sure there is a spoiler alert for this - the whole movie is a ride through the victim's mind leading to the final confrontation with how absolute power can be used so casually.  In that we live the life of the person fighting back.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is tremendously well written and gripping. You will find yourself rooting for these characters at the same time that you scratch your head over the eccentricities of their mental illness. To be able to climb inside the mind of a deeply troubled person and feel not just compassion but genuine affection for him, with all his foibles, was a rare experience. This book is a page-turner and I was truly sad that there was not more to read when I finished it. I have not seen the movie but I can't imagine, for all its awards, that it be as beautiful as this book.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This is a solid game and loads of fun.  Pretty easy to earn (lots of swiping directions to run and move blocks).  Real challenge is beating the clock and collection of all the coins.  Quite addicting
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|The case is exactly what I needed to protect my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.  It fits perfectly and seems to be made well.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Pro: While the idea behind this feels like a classic mario Reboot and graphically it's well done, the levels are easy resolve until later into the game, give you a nice warm up. but even the harder levels are not impossible.<br /><br />Cons: some of the jumping mechanics feel rough, I'm having a difficult time making some jumps because it's not as smooth as I'd like. Some of the music is a bit annoying, but it can be turned off.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a bad game, but it could use some Tuning.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|This was an interesting match up. One of the legends of blues harmonica paired up with much younger musician of talent. Both artist will get expossed to each others fan base, Great concept. Very good stuff on here,
B000A3XY9Q|3.0|I love this series. Great combination of horror, gore, and comedy. If I could I'd give 3.5 or a 4. The only 2 annoying problems I have is that the book of the dead is very small and doesn't seem as cool as it does in the photos. Truthfully I thought it would be as big as a harry potter book or something. Also the package said push the eye and hear a scream. Doesn't work. Besides those things, the book is a cool thing to have and the movie looks great. I mean the movie itself. The dvd menu looks a bit suspicious. Like bootleg.... Price wise, I'll tell you guys to buy the regular edition or regular special edition or something. Book has cool drawings. That's all.Besides all these, I'm pretty satisfied.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Wow!  What a ride with the early life of Henry Chinaski. Bukowski gives an interesting and different view of growing up during the great depression and being poor during this time period. Henry didn't have much (except for a lot...A LOT...of boils) when he was growing up.  We get to witness and almost feel the beatings from Henry's father. Henry's discovery of fighting, women, and alcohol are shown in glorious detail.  Bukowski sure knew how to write and the details (no matter how private or gross at times) were always masterfully written.<br /><br />Ham On Rye isn't for everyone...The book is violent and perverse...but I sure did enjoy it.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I am a huge fan of Liane Moriarty and I have enjoyed every single one of her novels, most recently What Alice Forgot and The Hypnotist's Love Story. The Husband's Secret is her fifth adult fiction novel and for me, her best yet.<br /><br />\\"For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick<br />To be opened only in the event of my death\\"<br /><br />She found the envelope amongst a stack of old tax records and imagined it contained a sentimental message, given it was dated just a few days after the birth of their first child, fifteen years ago. Cecilia has no idea that the letter will blow her world apart.<br /><br />The story of The Husband's Secret unfolds from the third person perspectives of three women, Cecilia, Tess and Rachel. At first the connections between these women are peripheral but the secret Jon-Paul has been keeping for decades will change them all.<br /><br />Cecilia has been married to John-Paul for fifteen years, they have three bright and beautiful daughters and a busy, happy life. Cecilia is the P&C president, a successful Tupperware host and her neat and orderly world is shattered when her husband returns early from a business trip.<br />Tess is devastated when her husband announces he has fallen in love with her best friend, cousin and business partner, Felicity. Her only thought is to escape and she abandons her life in Sydney to return to her childhood home. Tess isn't interested in renewing old friendships but finds she can't resist the attentions of an old flame.<br />Every day is an effort for Rachel. It is only the presence of her toddler grandson that relieves the grief that has haunted her since her teenage daughter was murdered more than twenty years ago, and now her son and his wife are moving to New York. Bereft, Rachel renews her obsession with the man she suspects murdered her daughter, a man that teaches at the school where she is a secretary, a man she is convinced is really a monster.<br /><br />With consummate skill, Moriarty winds her way through a minefield of moral ambiguity as her story explores the very personal implications of choosing between right and wrong. I'm desperate to avoid spoilers so I can say little except that the author challenges the simplistic notions of guilt, of punishment, of justice and redemption.<br /><br />The Husband's Secret is so successful in large part because of Moriarty's wonderfully crafted characters. The everyday rhythms of their lives render these complex women familiar somehow and I quickly became invested in their fate. As a mother myself I understood each women's concerns about protecting their children and I empathised with them as they struggled to decide how best to do so.<br /><br />The Husband's Secret is a compelling, thought provoking novel, inspired by an article about real life deathbed confessions and their surprising consequences. An intriguing examination of conscience, love, betrayal and forgiveness this novel will stay with you well after the last page has been turned.ough a minefield of moral ambiguity as her story explores the very personal implications of choosing between right and wrong.

B003O86FMW|5.0|As with the first, this book kept me on edge all the way up the very end. I'm even more attached to the characters and am excited and terrified to see what happens next!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this for my son, and I am unable to tear him away from it. He is addicted to it.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|This is the same CD release in the 90's (-ish?). It has the same songs you heard on the radio, it is not live or a concert version.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|This album exceeded my expectations. I've listened to a grand majority of Olafur Arnalds' music prior to the release of the anticipated album and I saw him live at SXSW this year but this album left me floored and in a state of pure amazement at the musical brilliance this man holds in his compositions. If you have not bought this album already, I don't know what you're waiting for, but I can guarantee you it's well worth a pretty penny from your pocket.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This is a great 9-16 year old movie, but adults will love it too. Had no problem with down load and I can watch it on multiple devices,.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book was very interesting in that it did not attempt to preach about how to change our habits, it merely gave real life situations where these practices were successfully implemented and allowed us to better understand how our brains work with respect to habit-forming.
0345803485|1.0|First of all, the book was in my wish list and i inadvertently ordered it when i was ordering another good book.  In glancing through it, I have no idea why it has gained such popularity.<br />I would appreciate it if Amazon would refund the price and not bundle books and items together when purchasing:  ask clearly if each item is to be ordered.  Very annoying
0525953728|5.0|As stated under &#34;American Sniper&#34;, I'm a Navy veteran and my wife knows how much I value my Naval Service and she tries to pick the books that'll hold my interest.  This book did it!!
B00BI745AA|1.0|I really thought this movie would be completely awesome due to the actors cast in it and the great music.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I'm pretty sure Russell Crowe had the part of Javert just because he's Russell Crowe.  The guy can't sing his way out of a paper bag.  This movie is boring and moves at a snail's pace.  My girlfriend and I watched it for an hour, decided we would &#34;power through&#34; to the end, and realized we still had an hour and half to go.  At that point we bailed.  We really enjoyed The Phantom of the Opera with Gerard Butler and thought this production of Les Miserables would compare.  We were wrong.  If you want an entertaining production of Les Miserables, watch the 1998 production with Liam Neeson.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great tv show, special features are great. Very helpful to fans of the books and show alike.<br />In regards to amazon. Wish I could get season one so cheap.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game runs great on Kindle Fire and will keep you entertained for many hours. Highly recommended if you don't mind being sucked in for a long time.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|the first thing i noticed is that the game is a lot easier then what you would first expect, the graphics are good no matter what size screen you play on considering i hooked my phone up to my 50 inch hdtv and it still looked good maybe even better, the only thing i don't like is the controls are a bit sketchy at times but overall it's a good game
B001DF68MA|5.0|I went for my first ride on this today, will post pics later. I have a Schwinn Pink Cruiser with a dog basket on front and a rear view mirror even. This fits right in. I added a stroller, car seat bar when my 8 month old got upset at first. Turns out it was the helmet she didn't like, but the stroller bar toy is a nice addition for an infant. I am only 5'2 and this was a nice seat for me. I was prepared for it's tiny size since I read it in the reviews, I had read it would be hard for a short person, but I had no problems. I had also read I wouldnt be able to hop down off the seat like I was used to. I did that also. I made no new changes to my routine. My dog will still be able to come with us also when I get a little more able . My granddaughter is a chunk. She was 9'1/2 pounds at birth and weighs 23 pounds now and my husband came in after installing this seat and said. Dear. I'm afraid Dumpy isn't going to fit in this seat. I laughed. I said I\\"ve already had her in it the day it came. It just looks like a doll seat. It actually goes up to 40 pounds. I don't know why it says 18 months -4years on box. My grand. Is 8 months, but I guess some people don't put infants on bikes, Mine have all been on the bike with me, but after I was hit by a truck with my oldest, I'm scared of the back carriers. My hand was crushed and the mirror of the truck hit where my sons head was. Luckily the carrier he was in protected his head. YOu can't go wrong with this seat. Don't be scared off by it's size, you have to be able to reach around it comfortably. I will post pics later so watch for the pink , pink, bike.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book is not written as a chapter book, but rather has a compilation of letters written by a young teen.  Even though I know teenagers speak this way, I still am unaccustomed to reading fowl language.  This is the reason I gave an &#34;its okay&#34; rating.  It deals with real-life events that occur in relationships with other teens and with family.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is the most inspiring book I've read in a very long time! Anyone will love it and there's a children's version available too. Do not hesitate to pick this up and start reading now!!

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book explores the issues of Pat People's mental state in more depth than the movie.  The book is good reading but is more serious than the movie.

B00B23Z2IE|5.0|When Charles Bradley put out his debut album [[ASIN:B004D0YB4Y No Time for Dreaming]] in 2011,it made an enormous stir at least in my neck of the woods. And he seemed to be the most popular artist to come out of Daptone during 2011-2012. He is also one of those talents who could easily carbon copy his debut (a standard approach in pop music) on his follow up release and totally get away with it. But Bradley understood something. The same thing James Brown, who is very much a key vocal inspiration to him from the sound of it, realized during his heyday. And that is that with all of the burden of promotion,touring and distribution of ones music, an artist will be best off learning from their new experiences and using it to further develop their sound. Recorded with the same group,the Menahan Street Band, with whom he recorded his debut this approach of innovation through personal experience was how he elected to approach his second album.<br /><br />  The album starts out with \\"Strictly Reserved For You\\",\\"You Put The Flame On It\\",\\"Let's Give Love A Chance\\" and \\"Love Bug Blues\\" are much more romantic and slickly produced Vee Jay-styled Chicago soul/funk with a dancable shuffle to them. The title song is very interesting as it is built around what sounds like an acoustic guitar and is a unique combination between southern and acoustic soul. \\"Dusty Blue\\" is a potent uptempo instrumental with some fan-faring horns from the band. \\"Confusion\\",filled with psychedelic funk flourishes from heavy Afro-latin percussion and echoed chorus, is straight out of Curtis Mayfield's [[ASIN:B00004UDE9 Curtis]]-with clear musical references to \\"If There's A Hell Below,We're All Gonna Go\\". \\"Hurricane\\" is 100% out of the early 70's JB funk school-vocally and rhythmically whereas \\"Where Do We Go From Here\\" blends a little of that back with the Chicago style. \\"Crying In The Chapel\\" and the moving closer \\"Through The Storm\\" are sweeping, epic soul balladry.<br /><br />  From start to finish this album is quite a bit different than the debut. The production of the entire album is a lot cleaner-sounding much more in keeping with the early 70's production ethic than the creakier late 60's style of his first release. The uptempo numbers are heavier on the funk,and the slower ones are more elaborate and cinematic in their arrangements. All signs are is that, while continuing to be true to his intent on producing live instrumental soul/funk in the classic tradition of Daptone Records to which he remains signed, he is looking to progress within that spectrum as well. Just about any soul singer/songwriter/musician can have a retro sound. It takes a very special talent even for that to be able to expand that retro sound as their career evolves. I very seriously doubt Bradley will every embrace cliches such as big name pop producers or guest rappers and/or rock instrumentalists to make more money. He is definitely a true blue in what he does. And if he keeps this good progression forward, he's got one fine career in soul/funk still ahead of him.s album is quite a bit different than the debut.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Let's be honest.  Just about everyone has a facebook.  The fact that you can access it from your kindle only makes it all the more convenient.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these for my 4 year old when she got her big girl bed and we redecorated her room. She is obsessed with Disney princesses. We let her put them on the wall herself, and she loves looking at them all next to her bed every night. The decals are top quality, I have bought others before that fell right off the wall. These stick very well, we have had them up for almost 3 months and they are right where we put them, no falling off or lifting at all! But they do remove very easily when you want to, they peel right off. Can't say the same for the gems, half of those have fallen right off the wall. Great product at a great price!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Its cool to find any Pink Floyd record on sale,let alone one the of remastered ones.The sound is really great.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Once you get to a given point in the app, it's difficult if not impossible to get out of it.  Simple things like checking messages are not available.
B000YR3WUE|3.0|Just seem like each album gets a little softer and less interesting.  I love their sound, but a little more rock n roll would be nice once in awhile.
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|As with just about every soul legend he likely admired Charles Bradley's life has mostly been about dues paying to the nth degree. However in this day and age it isn't whether or not to work the R&B/Chitlin circuit anymore. Its a lot to do with a recording industry that doesn't have much of a place for genuine soul music of the heart. There are actually a good number of people out there. But they are often paired with big name producers and forced somehow to make...shall I say uncomplimentary commercial concessions. Charles Bradley was lucky enough to get discovered when a label like Daptone records existed to sign him up along with the Menahan Street Band. And all this having worked everywhere from Alaska and even Maine-which might explain a little of why he's so big in my area of that state. Nevertheless he recorded this album with this band that not only became critically but popularly acclaimed.<br /><br />  What happens on this album is that Bradley embraces a type of soul production and instrumental sound that was vital during the mid/late 1960's when southern,windy city and California soul were all merging with the African soul hybrids of boogaloo to form the basic elements of what would become funk.  \\"The World Is (Going Up In Flames)\\",\\"Golden Rule\\",\\"Since Our Last Goodbyes\\" and the two organ instrumentals \\"Trouble In The Land\\" and \\"Since Our Last Goodbye\\" by the Menahan Street Band are all superb examples of the percussive rhythms and the heavily reverbed sound of the overall production. On other songs such as \\"Lovin' You Baby\\",\\"Heartaches And Pain\\" and the closer \\"Stay Away\\" he's on the most dynamic end of southern soul balladry. His impassioned vocal cries and sustained harmonies really reveal themselves very strongly on these songs because of the vitality of the instrumentation and the strength of the compositions as well.<br /><br />  Another key element of this comes on numbers like the gospel led ballad \\"Why Is It So Hard?\\",as well as the first and third songs here. Here Bradley embraces the idea of the sociopolitical message songs of the \\"people music\\" era as I call it by rounding on his own experiences before he got a record deal-laboring at odd jobs in \\"Dick Chaney's America\\" as it were. He bemoans the fact that, with all the struggles in the past for civil rights and economic equality, why those same issues continue coming around again and making life overly difficult for those such as himself who do nothing but try and work hard. As in the best of soul,he will probably have you smiling or at the very least crying with joy at the end of these songs. I would not necessarily use the cliche of calling his songs \\"universal\\" because they ARE soul music: music with soul and of the soul. And if one has lived through any sort of struggles in life,and dreamed and hoped for triumph and got it in some form, than this music will probably feel as familiar to you as it did to me.ird songs here.

B0044RFT8S|4.0|I put this in my son's Easter basket, and he loves it!  You can't go wrong with a character like King Julien, lol.  Adorable movie with a great message & jokes even adults can enjoy.  Very well done!
0740748475|5.0|Thrilled to bits with the quality and presentation of these books.  They are stunning!  Very impressed with seller and my purchase :)
B0060FXBNM|4.0|Bought this on a deal, great visuals and audio, not the best plot or acting in the world but still entertaining!
0316743003|5.0|Comments by the &#34;HEAVY&#34; people involved in the Black Projects. Great insights into the mind of Kelly Johnson. Hard to put the book down! Ben Rich is a man of many talents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I HAVE FUN I love the mods .but,plz have a update .<br />Have endearment<br />Have nether<br />Have flint and steel powerful by bran things<br />Have buckets<br />:) buy now
B006VFLIYK|4.0|It was a good book but got a little unnecessarily complicated. Once you get about 2/3 in you can figure the end out pretty easily. Well written and good characters.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|My husband loves this game and plays it all the time.  It's kind of messed up.  The goal is to kill off the entire population of the world with a virus, but it's kind of cool in all the options it gives you.  Personally, I prefer a more active game.  This one seems boring to me.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this match 3 game and can not wait for the next one.... the game keeps my interest and doesn't bore me.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very interesting concept of post apocolyptic earth after an invasion. I really like the character driven storyline that has alot of action in it as well. Effects are well above par for a network television show. I would recommend this to anyone with any interest at all in sci-fi.
B00428CPUY|5.0|If you are a rock/blues fan this is a must for your collection.  This is an awesome<br />CD set with many guitar greats, from old timers (I mean some really old ones)<br />to ones I'd never heard of.  It's a great mix of styles too.  I could have done without<br />Bill Murray's introductions, but hey, that's just me.  The only thing glaringly missing<br />since there was a lot of bues played, was the lack of blues harp players.  When I<br />think of the giants that could have been there....(admittedly, I'm a harp player myself).<br />I know this is a guitar festival, but really, Eric, no blues harps, c'mon!
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Good movie, safe for most 4.5 yr olds and above.  Good action and animation.  Streamed product through ROKU and feed quality was good.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Fun, fast paced with great, colorful graphics.  User friendly and fun for all ages.<br />Older children may also like to play
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This is not your average chick flick.  How can it be ? - - it has Russell Crowe in it.  I loved the story and the middle part was my real favorite with Albert Finney.  Someone wrote that the scenery was the real star, and I think that, indeed, the scenery  was fabulous, but also I think Russell Crowe did a wonderful  job playing his character.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This is by far the best graphic novel I've ever picked up. I can't even imagine how the author came up with this whole story. It's filled with everything, it has adventure, it's sexy, action packed, and drama everywhere!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Overall this has been a great show but I wish the writers would allow Michonne to shine more.  Maybe now that Laurie is gone she will.
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|This sounds a lot like Neil's older stuff. In the world of Crazy Horse jams and great Neil Young licks this is a great fit. Enjoy it.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Good movie, continues the legacy of Bond.  I feel Craig makes a great Bond some friends disagree, that is what is great about it.  There is a bond for everyone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A game that is fun to play, quite colorful and very fast paced.<br />Good for those who like timed games.
B00B2TUKI0|4.0|A very good record, as usual. Not her best, not her worst (there is no bad record by Madeleine Peyroux). The voice is here, the arrangements too. It nearly seems that the successive records through the years come from the same session ! More, when sung by Madeleine Peyroux the songs sound as if they were designed just for her ! A good idea to put in our ears &#34;You Don't Me&#34; - a brilliant version.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I love this show. It's very interesting and the time period is fascinating. We are amazed at how interested we are in this fake family's lives.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great.  My Kindle has been charging just like it is suppose to charge. I have not had any more problems keeping it charged.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Remastered. Sounding great. Take out the headphones! If you haven't heard it you should, if you have you will love listening to it again.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie. Streamed through Roku with no problems.  5 yr old son loves the characters and the movie and the movie is smart enough to entertain parents as well.  If you are a gamer from the 80's as I am, the movie concept really works.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|I have read all of Child's books and I have to say.....I had this one figured out really quickly, which is unusual.  Plus the ending was so out there that I don't even know what to think.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I bought this book to understand how to take good pictures using my new camera and it didn't disappoint. Highly recommended!
B005H9B44A|3.0|Just overall not that good.  Even the ending was a let down. I think this is more than eight words
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Very intraicate and complex puzzles entertain your brain! Several puzzels in each mode makes this well worth the price. This is not a one day master (if you have a life or job!) another plus in my book. I love the colors and the designs and have had no game play issues thus far.
B000056HE9|5.0|one of the best moies of all time.  A wonderful classic especially at Christmas time.  It is a Christmas tradition with our family to watch this movie.  It's great!!  Cary Grant, David Niven, and Loretta Young are wonderful.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book - never suspected the ending. It really ignited many emotions though out book and even in the end if left me wondering.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Good movie.  Must see it on a cool environment to understand it.  Perhaps watched twice to see the small details to really appreciated it.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|perfect, all the vocal song that  are included in the game are in this CD, very happy with this product
B004NOH9LC|2.0|with such star power I expected a lot more . . . this is one of those movies where all of the best scenes are in the 30 second preview.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I really like Anna Kendrick! This movie is funny, has good music. The story is not anything special.  It is the music that makes this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun for kids i am 11 year old and love this game i love that it changes city i think all kids should try this
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This app is simply about graphics, and it's cool to look at it when you're trying to find which wireless networks are currently available in your current location.  This can also sniff out even those networks that are supposedly hiding its ID from broadcasting (like mine) so those networks better make sure they're secured.  Can't say I would recommend it, but it's free and maybe it will have a particular use to other people as well so go for it.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed the lessons in this movie as well as the numerous jokes pertaining to various games of days gone by.  Great movie for kids and adults.
B004K58GSO|5.0|One of my favorite John Wayne movies. Great cast and I can watch it over and over.  Always need good movies when I travel.
B007JMW46U|2.0|Kind of a silly book - I just could not get into it - finally set it down for good half finished.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed all of the various activities besides the search and find. The story was pretty cool too, and great graphics
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|this is a fun game managing the Sharks is a super long is sometimes hard when they're small and fast.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like this app because it gives a snapshot of the important news not only in the US but across the whole world as well.  Because of its global approach, I'm also aware of what's currently the pressing news on a particular continent.  The news wording are concise and easily understood, though the videos when played on my Kindle Fire HD are grainy.  This is the only downside so far when compared against other news apps.  Still recommended.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Tho I had some trouble at first trying to keep up with the families and felt there was more detail than necessary, the story kept my interest.  Hope it's not long before the conclusion.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Yes, the movies are fabulous. I am not going to review them but the quality of the conversion to Blu-ray is really poor.<br />I recently bought the remastered &#34;Jaws&#34; which is spectacular. This really is a disappointment considering it has supposedly restored! I have played the collection on 3 different high end BD players and the level of noise is unacceptable. I suspect the DVD version is probably of similar viewing quality.
0062014536|1.0|Why, why, why?  I mean this could have been good.  I feel like requesting Lauren Oliver write a fourth book just to make up for the hours I lost reading this one.<br />Let's see:<br /><br />1. Really bad language,(like the \\"F\\" word about 15 different times)....which just shows a lack of creative thought and effort by the author.<br />2.Poor character development.<br />3.Pathetic ending!  I think the author was trying to go for some deep, meaningful, \\"artistic\\" ending here, but sadly, all she produced was a cheap, unresolved, quick attempt at wrapping it all up.<br /><br />That's my 2 cents anyway! Too bad...why, Lauren Oliver, why????
B00BDRJ3Z2|5.0|I love, love, love Luke Bryan!!! Best album he has made to date!!!!! Can't wait for another one to be made!
031620157X|1.0|Fame does not equal writing ability.<br /><br />This book was written (and narrated, since I had the audio version) by Chris Colfer, who played Kurt on the show Glee. It sounded like a Fablehaven-esque story, and I was intrigued enough to give it a try. And while Colfer does an excellent job narrating the story - using different voices, etc. - the narration wasn't enough to keep me interested. The writing just isn't that good. He does a lot of telling and very little showing, and the story is peppered with gems like this: \\"Connor's mouth fell open like a broken glove compartment.\\" This type of simile would be perfectly appropriate, had it come from one of my seventh grade students during our young authors contest. In the context of a published work, however ... I just wasn't impressed.<br /><br />That being said, kids who enjoyed Fablehaven and have read every other fantasy book may also enjoy Colfer's work. But I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over the age of ten, and especially not for English teachers.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|remember when Robert Denero still worked at acting?  This was back then.  This movie had so many meanings and mini story lines...all about morality, redemption, and what is the meaning of penance.  How much penance do we give ourselves? GREAT MOVIE, GREAT MUSIC, GREAT ACTING
