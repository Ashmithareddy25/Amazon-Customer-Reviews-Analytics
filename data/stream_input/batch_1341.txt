B0068TJLSY|1.0|When the movie first started, I thought, \\"This is a great little movie.\\" I loved the interaction with the kids, and think if Abrams could have kept the focus on that storyline (with the sci fi monster), it might have been a nice little flick ala \\"Stand By Me.\\" Instead, it was a sappy, heavy-handed lecture on letting go and surviving through pain. It wasn't a big inspirational, the monster left a LOT to be desired. They could have easily chopped off 45 minutes in this movie and filled it with something else. The writing is poor, the special effects are stupid, and the story veers off in so many different directions it appears childish.<br /><br />One bright note was watching the \\"kids movie\\" at the very end. But don't bother watching the whole thing just to get there.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Refn, never disappoints, should have been nominated for, best film, best actor and supporting actor.<br />Under-appreciated director.<br />Not a film for most people, only if you are into the Genre.
B004G600A4|5.0|Loved it in the theater, so knew we'd want to buy the DVD.  Full of action, drama, music and humor.  Good casting, with an engaging story.
B006JXDXZG|5.0|I love Bones.  It is the only series that I plan to watch.  I own all six seasons and am looking forward to seasons 1-3 coming out on Blu-ray.  That is all the good news.  The picture is so bad that I will not buy anything I haven't already paid for.  Sometimes I had to hear the voice of a character to know who it was.  Ycch!!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you liked Grisly Manor, you'll love this one. Larger map and more (as well as more challenging) puzzles. My daughter and I played through the first one together, and she's been regularly asking me when another game from Fire Maple would be coming out. Well, it didn't disappoint! Keep these coming, please - we need more!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I enjoyed this quite a bit. Bought for the Kindle Fire and worked perfectly. Unlike all the silly hidden-object games available, this one requires logic and at least a little brain power. There may be something silly hidden in the cuckoo clock, but accessing the clock requires a series of logical things to happen.<br /><br />Yes, it is short, though, and not overly difficult. For 99 cents, however, it's well worth it. Anyone saying otherwise is a self-entitled dope.<br /><br />The Lost City, Fire Maple's latest game, is longer, harder, and better (that's what she said).
B005D81W5Q|2.0|I honestly thought this movie would be something really funny so I bought it thinking I would like it. WOW was I wrong. Cameron Diaz doesn't fit the role as well as other actresses would. Waste of time and money.. Thank god it was on sale..
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Some of my favorite games growing up were Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and Univited. These were relatively unknown NES games, but some of the best. I still play them every few years when nostalgia demands I dust off the old NES.<br /><br />The Myst series is probably the most popular of this kind of \\"point-and-click\\" game ever to come out. If you liked any of those games, you'll probably dig The Lost City.<br /><br />The Secret of Grisly Manor, Fire Maple's previous game, wasn't overly difficult and somewhat on the short side--though definitely worth the 99 cents. The Lost City is better all around. Better graphics, longer, the puzzles are more difficult. Good times!<br /><br />If you don't use any hints, you'll have a few solid hours of gameplay ahead of you. You could do much worse with $1.99.
B00650SSWG|4.0|I really like this movie.  It was endearing and just your basic romantic comedy.  Timberlake was charming and believable while Kunis is hot and spunky.  What's not to love?
B00009R86L|4.0|I have these on both my [[ASIN:B00009R884 Domke F-2]] and [[ASIN:B00009R8A1 Domke F-7]] and they make a huge difference in how luggable the bags are. I usually carry between 12 and 20 lbs of equipment when everything is in the bag. With this pad, I'm eager to start shooting; not eager to get the gear off my shoulder.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is a great box set containing the two Alien films, and then two strange films that seem to take place in another universe. Alien and Aliens need no introduction. One is a classic horror film relying on atmosphere over cheap jump scares. The other is a classic action film that manages to retain the dread of its predecessor. The third film destroys any hope of this franchise being taken seriously, and the fourth is a better smelling turd than the third. The box set contains 9 discs and will meet your Alien needs. It's simple. Buy this and enjoy two classic films, and learn how not to make films by watching the final two.
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|Besides better graphics, this one has nothing on the first version. The fact most pieces aren't symmetrical, thus won't &quot;spin&quot; defeasts the whole point of Gem Spinner
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case is perfect for the person that wants protection but not the \\"stickiness\\" of a silicone case.  I am a \\"pocket\\" carrier so those \\"semi-aquatic mammal\\" boxes just didn't cut it for me. They were also HUGE.  This case is not large at all and does not take away form the look of the phone.  I also love that the volume and power/lock buttons have access holes.  Wide lip around the face holds tight but does not take away functionality of the device. Get it you won't be disappointed!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best solitaire game on the market , I'm addicted, I like the winning hand game, smooth game play
B006T5FDLG|5.0|I strongly reccommend buying this EP you will not be sorry all tracks are absolute rockers especially \\"Rebel of Babylon\\", \\"Hell and Back\\" and \\"Just A Bullet Away\\"
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read both The Pillars of the Earth and A World Without End a couple of years ago and was engulfed in the characters and their life challenges.  They quickly became two of my favorite books.  I will say though, that for much of the books it seemed like I was just waiting for the next catastrophe to strike the lead characters and I still remember the pit in my stomach when I saw another hardship coming.  They may have seemed a little crude in some areas to readers, but they reflected reality of those times.  With \\"The Fall of Giants\\" however, the storyline was more positive, but of course with some enormous hardships and challenges to overcome. I was fascinated with the intertwining of historical events and fictional characters, and even more ingrained with a sense of hope for the underdog and justice.  The research that must have gone into this book would be daunting and his ability to bring together characters from all over the world to a common ending was superb.  Although not a goal in reading fiction, I also learned a lot about the politics and social viewpoints leading up to, and during WWI.  Ken Follet is now one of my all-time favorite authors and I look forward to reading more of his work.  I highly recommend this book for just about anybody who likes real people overcoming the odds, romance, history and the world as a whole.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I was at first not so convinced of the reviews because this case was for something else. I know others had been looking for a case for a \\"fragile\\" looking Samsung SGH-1777. This case fits and makes you comfortable. Will see how these works but makes you mind at \\"ease\\" and at \\"peace\\" with such an invetment. Will recommend it.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|-------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\\"<br />(20th Century Fox, 2011)<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Quite nice. The original \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" (and the series it spawned) was both serious science fiction and serious camp/kitsch, and this well-paced, well-written, well-realized prequel follows in that pathway, mixing humor with drama, as we see the genesis of the ape-dominated world that humbled Charleton Heston. In the original film, we were left to guess what made the primates evole so rapidly, with genetic mutation after a humans-only nuclear war as the apparent cause. I still prefer that explanation, but Cold War fears are less resonant today than the potential perils of genetic experimentation, and so the animal-research scenario shown here works just as well. I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and was eager at the end to see the next installment -- the real war between humans and apes! oh boy! -- as well as the character growth of the Caesar and his various followers. If you like good sci-fi, then by all means check this one out. It's good. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app it is the best app I ever had it tells you everything when its going to rain or snow or anything else and it also gives you shows to watch if you want to know if its going to rain or snow
B006W0QOF2|2.0|I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all the glowing critical reviews of this film.  I was really disappointed and find it hard to believe so many top critics felt this movie was a winner. The dialogue was either spartan or excessively verbose, feast or famine according to who was onscreen.  The scene where he drives the getaway car was enjoyable, but the remainder of the the film was senseless over the top violence or uncomfortable silence.  Not at all what I expected, and I am thankful I only rented the movie rather than buying it as I had originally planned. I'm not going to call it a \\"must miss\\" , but I feel most will be disappointed by this lackluster effort at filmmaking.
B004IZMQI2|2.0|I know and love this book dearly, and bought a Kindle edition so I'd never be far from it when I need a kick in the pants.  The Kindle edition is wretched; clearly one of the automated cut-and-paste jobs. For one thing, there are no spaces between paragraphs, which is kind of critical when a) there are also no paragraph indentations and b) the entire flow of the book is based on those spaces. You need a minute to breathe between items in a list, for example. Here's a section of the book taken as formatted from the Kindle edition:  The following is a list, in no particular order, of those  activities that most commonly elicit Resistance:  1)The pursuit of any calling in writing, painting, music, film,  dance, or any creative art, however marginal or  unconventional.  2)The launching of any entrepreneurial venture or  enterprise, for profit or otherwise.  3)Any diet or health regimen.  4)Any program of spiritual advancement.  I wish I could also include the line that is formatted directly above the first sentence in such a way as to crowd the letters. There is no sense of space in the Kindle edition whatsoever; all the lines are jammed together and it is uncomfortable to look at, much less read. The format is not only distracting but actually diminishes the effects of the writing for me - and I love this book, which makes it all the more unbearable.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is beautiful. The leather makes it look like an old vintage book. You can fold the front cover over and place it on a stand or hold it by hand. While holding, it does'nt feel heavy or awkard.I believe it is truly a quality product.

1932100660|5.0|As a qualified Clinical Herbalist and Nutritionist, I was naturally drawn to this Study.  However, I believe The China Study should be read by everyone.  It is an important book that is is breathtaking in it's scope as well as it's implications.  The weight of evidence is very impressive and the Authors are to be congratulated for presenting the facts and evidence in a very easy to understand format. What could have been a 'dry' content is very far from that! I now recommend this book to my patients as a 'must read'.
1741794609|4.0|Useful book, particularly when it comes to estimating the everyday prices for taxi's, hotels and merchandise. Tips for bargaing are quite good. Worth following. Prices and admissions for monuments are sometimes quite different but that may be always the case. Overall good travel companion.

B006NFKUF6|4.0|Graphics are awesome for a phone app. Some lag during the game and controls are something you have to get used to. The lag could be because I have an old phone? EVO 4 g.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I thought the acting was very well done, the story very engaging and moving, and the science fiction aspect was icing on the cake.  I hope the writers are working on a sequel!

B00005J6T0|5.0|True Blue is definitely one of Madonna's greatest albums.  Although not THE greatest, I consider it one of her greatest because it captures a moment in time.  That moment is the mid/latter part of the mid 1980s.  When I hear songs like Live to Tell, Papa Don't Preach, and Open Your Heart, I am immediately transported back to high school days.  Even the filler on this album is good.  While most will immediately think of Like a Virgin when they hear the name \\"Madonna,\\" I think of True Blue, Like a Prayer, and Ray of Light.  Those three albums, in reverse order, are not only her best works, they are arguably among the best works, pop music has to offer.  As for the cover photo, it is one of those shots that is burned in one's mind.  Herb Ritts, a master of photography, captured Madonna in a pose that is sensuous and erotic, without being obviously so.  Art lost a master when he died.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Honestly, I did not expect to like this album as much as I did. Lana's voice is haunting, her lyrics are poignant, and the beats sound amazing behind the orchestral music. My personal favorites are Born To Die, Video Games, National Anthem, Dark Paradise, and Radio. However, the rest of the album is really good too. Definitely worth picking up!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Not a dvd I should recomend to anyone, so don't waste money on this one, keep looking for something more entertainig

0061537969|1.0|The main problem with the book is that the device of using the dog as the narrator is just not compatible with the main plot, which is the illness and death of the main character's wife.  The death of one's spouse, especially when one has a relatively young child, is just screaming out for an in depth examination of the character's feelings and thoughts about life and death, about love, his relationship with his wife, his role as a parent, the impact of the death on his child, and about his life up to this point in general.  But because the novel is told from the POV of the dog, this type of examination is nearly impossible, and it is therefore not especially surprising that the author is not able to do it.  He really needed to decide whether he wanted to tell a story from a dog's perspective and give a dog's thoughts on what people seem to not realize about themselves, or tell a story about a man who loses his wife to a devastating illness.  In trying to do both, he does neither.  What's worse, the gimmick of using the dog's POV becomes a convenient excuse to leave out key aspects of the story he has written.  The author even acknowledges this directly, when he cannot describe what happened during Denny's criminal prosecution.  One of the axioms of fiction writing that I have heard again and again is to write what you know.  Don't write about New York City if you've never been there and your knowledge comes solely from television and the movies.  People not from New York will think your description sounds simply like what they also have seen on Law & Order, and people who are from New York will find it rings false.  So what does Stein do?  He outright states that he (or the dog-narrator) knows nothing about the criminal process and that all of his knowledge comes from his having watched Law & Order.  He goes on to give a fairly vague and familiar treatment of Denny's legal woes disappearing quickly and easily when the main witness for the prosecution suddenly recants her testimony.  He attempts to explain this sudden recantation by having Denny stumble upon her having coffee and appealing to her not to ruin his life, but there is never a full explanation as to why she pursued her accusations in the first place, and even the event that led to why she pursued her accusations in the first place, and even the event that led to the prosecution of them is fairly vague.  I suppose I have to give him some kudos for acknowledging this problem in the story, but the author's acknowledgement of the problem does not mean that he has fixed it.  The reader is still cheated out of a full explanation for the resolution of the issue, which again, is partly caused by the fact that the narrator is a dog, but could have been rectified by, for example, having a newspaper account of the story lying around the house, or some such other device of allowing the dog to see or read a full account of the resolution of this other major plot point.  The book alternates between on the one hand, being trite, shallow, and unbelievable and then changing to mind-numbingly dull passages of narrative, mostly about race car driving, which the author seems to feel that themselves give us life lessons and insight into the human condition and I guess he thinks relate to and enhance the overall theme of the book.  They don't.  They're just boring facts about race car driving and I have no greater interest in race car driving having finished this book than I had at the beginning, which shouldn't be the end result of reading a book about a character who has a great passion about it.  There are several other problems with the book as well.  Most of the characters are not developed well.  Even the protagonist needs further development.  We don't really understand a lot of his thoughts, feelings and motivations for much of what he does.  Although again, this partially stems from the fact that the protagonist is not the narrator, but instead the dog is the narrator, we should be able to get more of an idea of his thoughts and feelings through his actions and dialogue, but we don't.  There is some attempt to get information to the reader when the characters will outright state or explain something to the dog, and those passages are among the least believable in the book.  No matter how much you love your dog, or even attribute human levels of understanding to him, would you really explain to him some of the finer points of your job or hobby?  Points that don't really give information about why you love the hobby, but matter of fact points that you would otherwise tell someone who was considering pursuing the same hobby?  The rest of the characters are not developed at all.  We meet his wife early in the book, which is a year after the narrator acquired his dog, Enzo.  We immediately know that she is going to die, and more than the first half of the book is spent just waiting for her to die so we can get on with it.  I never really felt bad for the wife dying, because we really never got to know her very well.  His in-laws from Hell are never fully explored, and the fact that they scheme to deprive him of being with his wife for the last days of his life, and then attempt to deprive him of his daughter for the rest of time are just not very believable.  There is some mention that they do this purely because they are \\"evil,\\" but there is then an attempt to soften them a little by having his mother in law try to say that Denny is not all bad.  Then they refuse to allow Denny to even attend his wife's funeral.  Yeah, so they never liked him, but Jeez -- what kind of people would be so unbelievably and inexplicably cruel?  And then they kick him while he is down by demanding child support payments from him that they don't need, prevent him from earning a living, cause him to be arrested, deplete his savings, make him sell his house, and attempt to take his daughter from him and send him to jail.  We don't see the main character meaningfullyinteract with other people.  A couple friends make some appearances in the novel and help him out with things like taking care of the dog, but they are never developed either.  We  don't really get a good sense of what the other people in Denny's life are like or really think of him.  We don't even really get a good sense of Denny's relationship with Enzo.  Well, we get a better sense of it than his interaction with almost anyone else, but for what is allegedly the main relationship in the book, we don't really see enough of his deep emotional attachment to or thoughts about his dog.  They don't really seem to be that different from what most people's relationship might be to their dog, with the exception of the in depth explanations to the dog of things that the dog wouldn't need to know.  Lastly, how do I really feel about Enzo?  That's one of the main selling points of this book.  I never felt any particularly deep affection toward him.  If anything, I found him to be a bit annoying.  There were times when he as a dog knew too much and times when he didn't know enough.  Overall, the book is like a bad Lifetime movie.  A continual string of misfortune heaped upon undeveloped characters and an attempt to be meaningful and philosophical by making random statements about life or race car driving instead of showing us these ideas through rich characters and a believable plot.  Overall, just a complete failure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had this on my Blackberry &amp; now my Kindle Fire. I love the reading plans. I also love how easily I can switch between translations. If your goal is to spend more time in God's Word, this is the perfect app for you!

0439023513|5.0|The end of the story was the most beautiful work of writing I have ever read. It made me cry while reading it. I was so relieved that everything was mostly resolved. This book was very different from the first two novels, but it kept me reading. It is a good thing it was different because the characters and story must grow together to make a resolution. By far my favorite trilogy I have read. Thank you, Suzanne Collins for being such a beautiful story teller and writer. Brilliant.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|What else needs to be said? The music is amazing; her message is wonderful. Thinking of buying this? Just do it, you won't regret it. Even the DJ mixes on the second disk are pretty cool. One features Marilyn Manson.  GREAT CD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. You can download the version you prefer and read it any time, even off-line. The reading plans are great for helping me stay in God's Word every day.
0525478817|5.0|Let me unashamedly state that I am 32 years old and this was one of the best books I've read in years. With precise thought and deep respect, Green plumbs the human spirit, routes the inaneness of our failing theories (such as the stupid theory that we should hold ourselves back from love, or the stupid theories of Maslow in general), and presents insights that have shaped how I the see loves in my life. I know now what a privilege it is to love the people that I know, and I know that from the privilege of reading this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've played solitaire on other devices.  I actually like the look and feel of others better.  That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  But this version of the classic card game is much harder.  I have to select &quot;winning deal&quot; and still I don't always win.
B005DMNS4A|4.0|During my high school and college years, i Loved Rock, and i missed a LoT of great albums....as ni have gotten older, i've looked back and picked some up....this \\"one\\" is my latest purchase. I'm not disappointed! First, I want to say the CDs sound GREAT....its so Clear....it is like the WHO are right there, wherever you happen to be. I don't know about originakl recordings...the details some complain of. I don't care. As a Who fan....from way back....this is a nice reiisue to purchase. I never had it on vinyl. The classic tunes are all here...nice photos are included of a Fun era..that I wish I could have lived and appreciated more. If you love the Who all they were and are....its a nice set to give a listen to. For a quick listen...not! Then I might recommend \\"Who's Next\\"....after listening to a lot of crap over the years, this CD reminds the listener of a truly Great Era of Rock!<br />\\"Long Live Rock....Be it Dead or alive\\"!

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I think it's become pretty clear that this whole \\"LuLu\\" thing was just a big troll all along. Lou Reed has been trolling the music business for decades, since way back before anyone even called it trolling. I assume Metallica is in on the joke with him, although with those guys you just don't know. It certainly sounds like they're kidding: three or four semi-decent riffs that just go on forever (like ten minutes-plus forever) without any variation whatsoever. There are drum parts that literally made me laugh out loud, plus the occasional Hetfield yodels, it basically sounds like some leftover riffs they had lying around and never got around to using. Then you have the \\"spoken word poetry\\" from the man who collaborated with Kiss on \\"Music From The Elder\\" (the previous worst release by a high-profile metal band ever). If the demented babbling of a tired old \\"art-rock\\" hack is \\"spoken word poetry\\", I'm glad I don't attend too many readings. The overall effect is so horrifically terrible that there's absolutely no way these guys could have possibly been serious. I have to believe this is an elaborate troll and the joke is on anyone dumb enough to take the whole thing seriously.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|For five glorious seasons \\"Lost\\" was one of the greatest television serial dramas of all time. The twists, the turns, the big reveals, the attention to detail: it was totally engrossing. The show had built itself an entire mythology and it seemed that something utterly mind-blowing was behind its many deeply-intertwined mysteries. Then came season six. Since that infamous final episode aired, there are two kinds of \\"Lost\\" fans: the ones who insist that people like myself are wrong for \\"demanding that every little thing be explained and spelled-out for us\\" and the ones who know they got jobbed and jobbed big time by that bogus season six. The Hanso Foundation? The Dharma Initiative? Electromagnetism anomalies? Vanishing land masses? Time travel? Widmore vs. Linus? Forget that: it's a cork and all you need to know is that everyone will be dancing and smiling and hugging again together someday, except for certain cast members. Oh, I see.<br /><br />What I'd like to do is take season six and throw it into that pool at the \\"temple\\", fish it out and replay it to see if maybe the magical island waters turned it into something non-stupid instead of the nonsensical, supposedly \\"character-driven\\" piece of claptrap that originally aired. I mean seriously, no one expected EVERY mystery to be fully explained by the end, but come on. They just flat-out blew off five years of awesome sci-fi mythology and back story and instead delivered a bunch of contrived, nonsensical hooey. The \\"sideways flashes\\" were mostly pointless time-killers full of \\"hey, remember him/her?\\" gimmickry designed as a cheap swerve and the Jacob/MIB stuff was simplistic, boring faux-profoundity masquerading as good storytelling. It was a massive disappointment.<br /><br />The problem wasn't that people like me wanted answers we didn't get. The problem was that the show dropped five excellent seasons of narrative because its creators couldn't find a satisfactory way to bring that narrative to some sort of logical (or fantastical) conclusion and instead resorted to a bunch of silly claptrap and flimsy metaphors designed to paint over those five previous seasons with a big broad brush. I hated it and I'd give it zero stars if I could.conclusion and instead resorted to a bunch of silly claptrap and flimsy metaphors designed to paint over those five previous seasons with a big broad brush.

B002ZG99TK|4.0|As an action movie fan I could be expected to enjoy Unstoppable, but to our surprise, my wife, who is not usually an action movie fan, enjoyed it too. The movie gets off to a fast start and picks up speed from there; by the time the movie is over your ready for a rest.<br /><br />Both Denzel Washington and Chris Pine turn in effective performances drawing the viewer into the action. This is a worthy addition to the collection of any action movie fan. I recommend it highly.

B000A2IPP0|5.0|What can I say about this film? It captures the height of sci-fi/fantasy cinema during the late 1970s/early 1980s in all of its glory. The three kids all pull off their parts wonderfully (this movie was easily Drew Barrymore's best role). E.T. comes across as extremely convincing, largely due to the excellent puppet used.<br /><br />And about that puppet - in 2002, Spielberg made a few CG enhancements to the movie. I think most of the changes were for the better. Sometimes the CG E.T. looks a bit too C.G., but other times CG does enable him to exhibit a greater range of facial expressions. I think much of it still works because the actors used the original C.G. puppet, so they were able to give better performances than would have been possible otherwise.<br /><br />I also think replacing the guns with walkie-talkies was an acceptable move. While I don't care much for being politically correct, it always did seem a bit odd to me that NASA agents were chasing a bunch of kids while brandishing rifles. They obviously didn't plan to shoot the kids, otherwise they would have. Either way, Spielberg includes the 1982 original version - unlike Lucas - so you can enjoy the movie either way.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the U.S. showed Soviet defectors this movie to introduce them to the potential and imagination of the American way of life. Nowadays, I wish more producers would revisit this movie to try to recapture some of that movie magic we kids enjoyed during there 1980s.<br /><br />UPDATE (1/7/12): I finally had a chance to watch the blu-ray version. The movie looks great in blu-ray. Not a dramatic change, but I also bet most kids would never believe the movie was made 30 years ago. However, the set only includes the original release, not the 2002 special edition. I'm personally indifferent between the two, but there are changes in the 2002 version I liked and was sad to see them go (particularly the bathtub scene). I think Spielberg saw what happened to Lucas and Star Wars and decided to play it a bit too safe. However, the movie as is is still wonderful.
1439153663|1.0|This text failed to capture my interest or engage me intellectually. The writing was subpar and the characters, setting and timeline were horribly undeveloped. The plot suffered from a lack of flow  and felt highly contrived.  I found this text to be ridden with stereotypes and historical inaccuracy, not to mention tragedy after ill-conceived tragedy. Overall, it was a total disaster.  Would highly discourage any one from picking this novel up - It was so cringe-inducing that I was unable to finish it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm afraid to say this, but I don't like HP or Twilight. I am more interested in books with no popularity or almost none. When people recommended this, I was reading The Midnight Twins series. I said, however, what the hey! I got the book at the library. The beginning was a little slow, until the Reaping. I can still remember the pages in which Prim was reaped (20), Katniss volunteered (22), and when Peeta was chosen (25).  If you remember stuff like that, then you're reading a really good book. The action comes a bit after Peers makes his famous quote. I am not going to spoil anything or even give a summary (As though I am sure there are thousands below me and soon to be above mine)! Since I am most horrible when it comes to those, I will just give you some advice, parents. Even though I read this book a year ago when I was younger than... I am just going to say 12, this is not all about bloodbaths. Katniss wants to help her family, friends (Gale & Madge... still unsure to put Peeta in this section.), and people who have supported her along the way.  My favorite pages:  20  22  25  72  130  260.  *Those pages are if you have the real book, not a Kindle version.

B0000AUHOH|3.0|The Star Trek franchise was on a winning streak in the 1980's. The winning streak started to end with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier(1989). Sybok(a renegade Vulcan played by Laurence Luckinbill) steals the USS Enterprise and forces its crew to search for God. Also, a hostile Klingon wants to hunt Captain Kirk for sport. Star Trek V has plot holes and forced storytelling. Kirk is forced to command a malfunctioning Starship Enterprise instead of taking command of a starship that's in better shape.<br />Nichelle Nicols(Uhura) is a good singer, yet a pop singer's voice is still looped over her.<br />There's a pop version of the song A Moon is a Window to Heaven on the Star Trek V soundtrack album.<br />Star Trek V tries to emulate Star Wars(1977) with a bar and a colony in the desert on planet Nimbus III. ILM was busy working on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989) and the special effects for this film are very cheesy and unrefined. I can't say anything bad about Jerry Goldsmith's music score for the movie. It sounds good. Roger Ebert didn't like this film and even Mad Magazine poked fun of it. I bought it on VHS when I was 13 years old at a shopping center. At the time, I had no idea it was a \\"flop\\". William Shatner did a decent job directing Star Trek V, but the film's lack of success didn't give him more opportunities to direct more TV shows and movies. At one time, the producers wanted Sean Connery to play Sybok, but he was busy working on The Hunt for Red October(1990). David Warner plays a Federation officer who is barely developed in the story. Warner was given a better role in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country(1991). The film does have some good character moments. Sybok shows Spock and McCoy's traumatic memories in vivid detail. There's some awkward slapstick with Scotty bumping his head on a door. There's another scene where Spock uses rocket boots to fly in a broken turboshaft. There are some continuity problems in the scene. William Shatner's real life daughter plays a yeoman in the film. The special edition DVD for Star Trek V makes up for the film's flaws. It's loaded with extra features. Star Trek V is a weak Star Trek film, but it is still worth watching.

It doesnt give you a step by step set of instructions but it explains why that's never going to be possible and what an amazing opportunity it is.

B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Star Trek Insurrection(1998) is a solid Star Trek movie starring the cast from Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994). It's not as dark and violent as Star Trek First Contact(1996) and it is fun to watch. There are some gags that fall flat. The scene where Picard, Worf and Data sang Gilbert and Sullivan songs took a lot of criticism. The crew of the USS Enterprise rebel against Starfleet Command in order to save the peaceful Ba'ku from the corrupt, violent So'na. F. Murray Abraham(Amadeus, Last Action Hero) plays So'na villain Ru'afo and lovely Donna Murphy(Spiderman 2, World Trade Center) plays Ba'ku woman Anij. The So'na plan on using \\"a collector\\" to steal the \\"metaphasic radiation\\" from the Ba'ku homeworld. This film borrows some ideas from Lifeforce(1985), Seven Samurai(1954), and The Magnificent Seven(1960). The Ba'ku have a \\"fountain of youth\\" on their homeworld. Star Trek Insurrection has social commentary on the crimes and atrocities that human beings are willing to do to eachother.<br /> ILM was busy working on Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace(1999) and Deep Impact(1998) at the time. Paramount Pictures hired a different company to do the visual effects for the film. The late Jerry Goldsmith wrote a solid music score for the film. His fans claim his Capricorn One music score is flavored in some scenes. As in the original Star Trek(1966-1969), this Star Trek movie never takes place on or near Earth. The scene with the subspace tear was rehashed in the 2009 reboot of Star Trek. The humor in this film is a hit or miss affair. Riker pilots the USS Enterprise with a video game joystick! This is the kind of sight gag that we'd see in The Naked Gun(1987). The So'na constantly get plastic surgery to preserve their youthful appearance. The make up artists and producers actually did research on plastic surgery. Jonathan Frakes directed the film and he has little screen time as Will Riker. Patrick Stewart is superb as Captain Jean Luc Picard; in the Star Trekmovies, he's more impulsive and reckless. In the TV show, Picard was a calm, focused intellectual. This film ends on the right note with Goldsmith's Star Trek The Motion Picture theme music playing over the ending credits. Star Trek Insurrection had an \\"ironic\\" alternate ending. Ru'afo is stuck in the planet's rings and he ages backwards into a fetus and into nothing! This ending was left on the cutting room floor. Star Trek Insurrection(1998) is a solid adventure made when Star Trek showed its tired blood.

B0059XTUVI|2.0|There is a magnificent tale to be told about Mrs Thatcher and the pivotal role she played in her times, using her own words, but sadly this is not the film that tells it. Astounding liberties are taken with the ordering of the historical record, and despite some fine moments (the first meeting with the public image consultant stands out, and the final scene) the script's dialogue consistently fails to rise to the challenge of convincingly conveying the ideological texture and trajectory of the times. I don't think any 16 year-old could watch this and leave the cinema feeling truly enlightened about the achievements brought about in the 1980s by Mrs Thatcher's ideas and personality, other than a vague memory that Thatcher was a strong woman. Because of this key failure in the script, the movie has to fall back on confusing jumbles of over-strident music and aggressive TV news footage to try to convey the mood. It simply fails in this, often painfully so. Having recently re-read Mrs Thatcher's two autobiographies, I felt the film failed very badly in conveying her core philosophy. The scene where she challenges Al Haig is a good example in this - it comes across as very weak tea, if you've heard the powerful and convincing way it's dealt with in _The Falklands Play_. At other times the film becomes, frankly, a little boring. It's perhaps visually that the film is most excellent, with very strong costuming and hair, set off with excellent lighting. But that's just not enough to make a great film. Despite all the polish and the fine performance from Streep, and workmanlike performance from Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret, _The Iron Lady_ really can't compare to other depictions. I'm thinking here of the excellence of the radio version of _The Falklands Play_ (in terms of the power of the dialogue to fuse ideas and drama), or _The Long Walk to Finchley_ (in terms of conveying the complex combination of human personality and political ideals). I really wanted to like _The Iron Lady_, but it won't be on my list of movies to watch again.

B0068RHGJM|5.0|I LOVE it!  I will not break it all down and analyze it, we already very graciously have several wonderful reviews, but I might have an insight and a suggestion.  I was concerned when I initally read some of the negative commentary, even knowing full well how some fans do not like for their favorite artists to change and progress much.  When I listened to this recording for the first time I understood how nostalgic fans could be disappointed.  It's very a-typical.  I believe the mistake, however, is the approach in listening to Imaginaerum.  Do not listen to it for a Nightwish recording, but for essentially what it is - a soundtrack!  Much of the music is related to imagery.  (Which we do not yet have!)  I believe when we are able to watch the film, those of us who love the music will appreciate it even more, and our fellow fans who have been disappointed just might gain a new appreciation.

Picture was grainy worse than watching this on instant streaming on my wireless.. SO disappointed in the quality of this recording and wish I would have bought a used blue ray instead. Save your money and buy a better quality recording.. Unless your watching this on an old tv and your not used to crystal clear HD. I don't know how the sound would be.

0439813786|5.0|This book defies categories. It won a Caldecott medal (awarded to distinguished picture books), but boasts a solid girth on the shelf at over 500 pages. The story has the flow of a children's novel, but the narration breaks off at particularly descriptive or intense moments and is replaced with beautiful black and white illustrations. This book embodies the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words.<br /><br />The story itself is engaging and compelling. We grow to love the young orphan Hugo Cabret, with his knack for fixing machinery and his obsession with a broken down automaton -- a strange mechanical man who (when repaired) might write Hugo a message that he hopes will unlock mysteries in his past. The motif of clocks and mechanisms wends its way through this delightful and unusual story.<br /><br />Behind the near magical elements of this story, we find children's historical fiction at its best. The setting is Paris during the 1930s. We interact with the fantastical world of early French film -- its shining moments, its luminous directors -- without feeling \\"taught\\" or scholarly at all. Hugo's story is gripping, the blend of text and illustration is original, and the historical setting blends into the background, giving a rootedness to a tale as unexpected as a fantasy.

And if you plan to just make your router discoverable when using the device, good luck.  As with my receiver the process of logging into services such as Pandora and Sirius is clumsy and the software doesn't save what you entered on the last session.

This happened to me when I was shooting graduation handshakes though so it's to be expected.  Usually use my Sb:600 though which although not as good could handle a bit more abuse.....  The other problem I have had with my flash which makes me a bit angrier is that right after the warranty was up the flash locked preventing me from being able to swivel the flash making it impossible to bounce the flash when in vertical position.  Would have been 5 stars if not for this issue but overall very good.  Hopefully not an issue with the SB:910...

B004K4IZ54|4.0|So truthfully, I'm not crazy about this movie. Saw it in the theater and didn't like it, but I like the first one quite a bit. I bought it strictly because it's a 3D release.  As far as visuals, it's a crystal clear looking 3D movie. Stuff definitely doesn't pop out at you, it's more depth that you will experience. The sound is my favorite part of the release. It sounds awesome.  Legends of the Guardians rocks it as fars as 3D goes, if you are looking for something specifically for 3D.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Oddly this movie portrays itself as something it's not.  The setting is modern (i.e. current time), the theme is 80s (both musically and the tone of the film), but the plot is straight from the 70s.  So you end up with a mishmash of schlock from 2 decades set in a 3rd.  If you haven't watched or won't watch those 70s and 80s b-movies you probably won't get this movie either.
6304712944|5.0|This film is one of the reasons I don't pay that much attention to critics! Even though Richard Burton and Julie Andrews starred in the original Broadway production, after seeing this I can't imagine anyone better than Richard Harris! He IS King Arthur and he gives a wonderful and very moving performance! He is spot on in conveying his deep love for Guenivere, who's beautifully played by a radiant, Vanessa Redgrave. She gives an almost \\"other worldly\\" quality to the role. His devotion to her and her genuine affection for him makes her eventual betrayal all the more poignant. Franco Nero is visually perfect as Lancelot and he and Redgrave have a lot of chemistry together. They were really lovers off screen and it shows. In fact after all of these years, the two of them are back together again in real life, so there's a fairy tale aspect to their own lives.<br />The sets and costumes are terrific and of course the Lerner and Lowe score is one of their best. I don't think that team ever wrote a bad score! A lot of credit also goes to legendary composer, Alfred Newman, for his outstanding arrangements! One of the special features of this DVD is the ability to listen to just the music if you want.<br />If you see this film, just go with the flow and you'll be very entertained!

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This has been a process for me, my first build. I play online games and this took all the NPC's off coffee break (the tome it took my old PC to load the surrounding area).

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt (2008, directed by John Patrick Shanley)<br /><br />Everyone needs to see Doubt. There's no room for rebuttal. You need to see it. Over the last decade, headlines have scandalized the Catholic Church alleging priestly relations with choir boys, but it's not cultural relevance alone that asserts my reasons. Doubt isn't about problems with celibacy so much as the hidden biases we carry with us in a handbag wherever we go. We refer to it unknowingly whenever emotional issues arise, and it's usually our bias that wins, not truth.<br /><br />Read no further if you don't want the ending of this movie ruined......still here? There is no ending. Well, there is, but then again there isn't. What we're left with is our handbag of biases. Was Meryl Streep correct in her assertion that Philip Seymour Hoffman molested a boy at St. Nicholas, or was he innocent? We'll never know.<br /><br />I watched this movie with different audiences, each group asserting swaying judgments, depending mostly on their methods of interpretation. Personally, I think he's innocent. But here's the ultimate lesson to be learned. Gossip destroys. If you want to take down the reputation of any man, claim him to be a sex offender. Even if innocent, his established life is exiled.<br /><br />-Noel J Hadley (200 Word Reviews)

B0059XTUEK|4.0|How is it that one film could dodder from enthralling to mediocre and back again, repeat cycle, so many times? It's what happens when you mix a so-so movie with an incredible performance by its leading actor. Michelle Williams sparkles like diamonds as iconic legend Marilyn Monroe. I've seen a good assortment of Monroe's films, and I can tell you, hands down, that Williams was Monroe, perhaps a little thinner, but she was Monroe. She's that good. I found myself gazing at the clock whenever Williams was off screen yet magically transfixed upon her return.<br /><br />In My Week, we follow a young, mostly innocent movie entrepreneur, Colin Clark, who falls under Marilyn's spell during the production of The Prince and the Showgirl. Her marriage to Arthur Miller has begun to unravel, and things aren't going well on set. See, acting royalty Laurence Olivier is a great performer attempting to become a movie star and Marilyn is an icon seeking out her great performance. Problems ensue, and soon Clark is requested to spend a week's hiatus with the paranoid, pill popping Monroe. The rest is a gift for Clark, but more so for us, who welcome Monroe's triumphant return on film.<br /><br />-Noel J Hadley

B004W2UBYW|4.0|As a huge fan of Jobs, I had to read this the day it came out. I didn't realize how big it would be, but it should come as no surprise given the subject.<br /><br />First off I should say the writing itself is superb. It is very smooth and natural, and the descriptive style really keeps you hooked. After a taste of Isaacson's style I'm inclined to pick up some of his other works. It's exciting reading, i think even a bio Steve Jobs could be boring in the wrong hands. But this is far from boring, and structured well. I don't like bios that bounce around the timeline a lot, and this one does not do that, only to make small references to future events that are relevant.<br /><br />What I didn't like was that it seemed like the author was trying to hard to prove it wasn't a fluff piece. He states right away that Steve didn't have creative control over the book and encouraged Isaacson to put in everything regardless of how it made him look. Knowing Steve's passion of art and creating things I am inclined to believe this is true, I also believe he wanted to leave a legacy for his children that may help them understand him, and why he was the way was. But I think it went a little too far. It seemed to focus a lot on his personal problems and explosive personality. Didn't Steve have any friends who enjoyed being around him? Weren't there times he was jovial, relaxed and happy? Of course, but it's minimized heavily in the book.<br /><br />I also felt like it was a bit too 3rd person, like something that would be written by someone who never knew him. I wanted to hear more of Steve's point of view, and his reasoning for things. More voice from Steve would have been great, but may not have been possible. Also there are times when the book gets into a negative funk and sticks with it a while. He was a jerk, we get it. Let's hear more about why he did some of the things he did?<br /><br />Overall it's a great book and a must read for fans of biographies, or Steve Jobs himself. He's easily one of the largest figures of our lifetime, and this book does a great job of describing why. I would recommend it to others.our lifetime, and this book does a great job of describing why. I would recommend it to others.

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|The scenery was beautiful...  ...but the acting was poor, the story contrived, and the message was typical Hollywood dehumanizing, misguided, eco claptrap that insults and debilitates all.  When I saw this mess with my wife, I wondered what the big fuss was all about (getting an Oscar Nomination).  None of the acting elicited any emotional response or real enjoyment from me because the story line was obviously contrived that made this movie little more than a political statement... or rather misstatement.  Examples:  * Fortunately, the wife was an adulterer, an idiot, and a fool who had a tragic, fatal accident (all needed); or the main character, Matt King (played by Clooney), would have no opportunity to bond with his estranged (or was it really typical teen-age rebellion with that cancelling any credibility of story) eldest daughter, or there would be no story.  * Fortunately, the main character is named \\"King\\", so that we would give this character added, but unearned credibility.  * Fortunately, King is a howlie, so that we, evil Whites, can empathize with \\"King\\".  * Fortunately, King has a connection to part own AND solely manager a large piece of abandoned Hawaiian property.  * Fortunately, King is allowed to say his piece, but stopped others from having their deserved and needed ones to keep the sole focus on King and his upcoming eco decision.  * Fortunately, his wife's adulterer partner was stereo-typical, i.e. sniveling, spineless, married man; who may or may not have had the affair to make millions off of the clueless husband.  * Fortunately, the rat was a businessman so that we can hate him to help support King's emotional eco decision.  * Fortunately, the rat had a ridiculously forgiving wife.  * Fortunately, King is a lawyer, i.e. not a business man, like all of the others that King betrayed with his eco decision.  * Fortunately, all of King's relatives (whose lives King greatly affected with his eco decision) were wasteful sponges so we wouldn't feelsorry for their losses.  * Fortunately for comedy relief, the producers added a clueless, drug taking, moronic boyfriend of the estranged daughter who was allowed to tag along on this severely emotional journey.  * Unfortunately, Hollywood's (read, the Left) used this contrived, poorly acted movie to forward their agenda of dehumanizing the world by showcasing the premise that it is better to abandon the land rather than being good stewards of it - like promoting that it is better to let all trees rot into fertilizer than have them changed into something of lasting beauty (or use) that can be admired (or used) by many, for generations.  I'd rather watch Avatar... oh wait, that one is promoting an agenda, also... but, the scenery is beautiful!
B005HSL626|2.0|At first I thought this game was great! Then after a while actually only after a few days this game got really boring really fast.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|I will not repeat the accolades others have mentioned. THE ARTIST delivers pathos, humor and romance in so many surprising ways, I find it difficult to compare to other films this year. Bejo and Dujardin are both superb, and Cromwell's supporting performance is deeply satisfying. The entire undertaking was daring, given the fickle tastes of the viewing public, but here's where it succeeds for me:  1. Although the story takes place in another era, the situations its characters endure, and the many universal themes of its screenplay are so timely to those who feel obsolete, to those who struggle, it's simply remarkable.  2. The film overflows with great romance without seedy overtones or skin. The protagonists are also quite decent.  3. Direction.  Take all the elements that coalesce to make a great film.  I'm hard-pressed to find any missing here.  Brilliant performances, eye-candy cinematography, warmth and humor, expert pacing, and a fine musical score which reflects so accurately the cultural domain of the film.  4. What you take away:  Hope, pure and simple. Who among us wouldn't benefit from that.  The last independent film which affected me this way was CINEMA PARADISO. Now, in the throes of the award season, there are fine international competitors, but this film crosses the line by a head because of the director's love of his subject, period and theme.  Deeply moving, gripping, and wonderfully funny. (Great dog, too!)  Ten stars.

1594630844|5.0|At 20, I wouldn't have read it.  I was in a hurry - learning, climbing.  Mortality? Huh?  At 30, it's family, career and it's obligations - no time to contemplate.  Little time to read.  At 40, I'm beginning to settle, mind is opening - I might have given this book a glance.  But I'm wary.  At x0, (I can't believe it or say it or type it).  Where did the years go?  My eyes are WIDE OPEN.  I'm locked in on this book.  Not sure how I tripped into the book.  (Coincidence?  Deepak Sharma would say Not.)  I read an Amazon review where the reviewer described the book as \\"Profound.\\"  Really?  How many top-10-list self-help books have I read?  Not sure I can recall one lesson from these books.  I was skeptical.  (Highly).  And I was wrong. (Again)<br /><br />There is an estimated $1 billion spent each year on self-improvements books in the U.S.  And more advice columns, television experts, and websites - all preaching advice of one sort or another.  Yet none of them speak from experience of having lived and learned.  Karl Pillemer, the author and a gerontologist at Cornell, interviewed more than 1,000 older Americans between the ages of 70 to 100 in search of lessons for living.  He spent over 5 years on the project and summarized his findings in this book. Lessons range from:<br /><br />* Lessons for a Happy Marriage (Marry Someone a Lot Like You; Friendship is Important; Don't Keep Score; Talk to Each Other; Commit to Marriage not just your Partner)<br /><br />* Lessons for a Successful and Fulfilling Career (Seek Intrinsic Rewards, not financial ones; Don't give up looking for a job you love; Make the Most of a Bad Job, Emotional Intelligence Trumps all; Everyone needs autonomy)<br /><br />* Lessons for Parenting (It's all about time; It's normal to have favorites but don't show it; Don't Hit Your Kids; Avoid A Rift At All Costs; Take A Lifelong View of Relationships with Children)<br /><br />* Lessons For Aging Fearlessly and Well (Being Old is Much Better than you think; Act Now Like You will need your body for 100 years; Don't Worry About Dying; Stay Connected to others; Plan ahead where you will live)<br /><br />* Lessons For Living a Life Without Regrets (Always be honest; Say Yes to Opportunities; Travel More; Choose a Mate with Extreme Care; Say It Now before it is too late)<br /><br />* Lessons for Living Like an Expert (Choose Happiness; Time is of the Essence; Happiness is a Choice, not a condition; Time Spent Worrying is Wasted; Think Small; Have Faith; Live by the Golden Rule)<br /><br />I was deeply moved by this book.  I found myself being pulled along - with skepticism being stripped down to bare bones of belief as I turned the pages.  He's on to something.  The power of this book is in the stories and the anecdotes of the \\"experts\\" (the term he uses to describe the elders who are interviewed for his research).  The voices of experts are calm...peaceful...learned...zen-like.  The author weaves lessons and stories gently throughout - - a slow moving stream making its way south.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

B005F96UNM|3.0|Can style triumph over substance?  Well...no, it can't.  But it can make a jolly good effort, as BUNRAKU goes to show.  The film follows a nameless drifter (Josh Hartnett) and Yoshi (Gackt) as they seek to dethrone the tyrant Nicola (Ron Perlman), who oversees a post-apocalyptic town with barely-constrained fury.  Their story is told by our Narrator, singer Mike Patton doing his best David Carradine. And a simple story it is: Yoshi seeks honor, the drifter's motives remained unknown until the end, and on the way they find out that they are stronger together, and that they are fighting for a cause other than their own.  Story doesn't matter here: what's important to writer/director Guy Moshe is style, the fight scenes arranged like dance numbers, the use of color and imagery and music and shadow.  Moshe has truly created a film to be SEEN, as obvious as that may sound.<br /><br />The problem is, it's not quite a successful experiment.  Sure, the film is enjoyable, edgy, and not quite like anything else you've seen.  But it's still a bit too derivative of its influences.  Plus, the two leads are unfortunately miscast: Hartnett isn't emotive enough, and Gackt is too much so.  Oddly, both actors truly come alive in the fight sequences: they bring a level of physicality to their roles that is enrapturing.  Watching them fight remains a highlight of the film, especially their scene against each other, where they learn their respective strengths and weaknesses.  (Kudos to Hartnett, for actually coming off as a tough guy...when he doesn't have to speak, at least.)<br /><br />The supporting cast is rounded out well (with the exception of Demi Moore, who is wasted here; her role is unnecessary to the plot, and she knows it).  Ron Perlman gives one of his better performances lately; he is utterly intimidating in what little screen time he has.  Woody Harrelson provides some comic relief; he doesn't even bother acting, really--this is probably one of his worst performances of late--but he knows how to twist his face at the right moment.  He's along for the indie cred, but at least he's honest about it (and hilarious).  The true standout of the film, cast-wise, is Kevin McKidd as Killer No. 2, Nicola's chief lieutenant.  He's suave and deadly, with just enough rugged Scottish fury to make him come off as truly unstable, even when he's dispassionately staving off an entire army single-handedly.  It's rare that you find a villain so deliciously charming.<br /><br />Ultimately, BUNRAKU is a film for people interested in artsy action films; it's not as successful as, say, KUNG FU HUSTLE, but it gets credit for effort, and it's certainly interesting to watch.  Few films has such an interesting premise, or so such promise; unfortunately, that means its failure is all the more noticeable, but with a film such as this, you take the good with the bad, and just have a good time.w to twist his face at the right moment.

B0053B347M|4.0|I purchased a pair of these to place on the back of my two monitors in an effort to ease eye fatigue from long coding sessions.  The lighting itself is excellent, creating a soft white light reflecting off the wall that certainly helps with they eye strain.  My issues are with the design of the kit itself.  The adhesive seems to be holding well after weeks of use on both monitors, one with a matte finish and the other being very glossy.  The problem is the adhesive near the end that has failed to hold up to the weight of the USB cable after the first few minutes of installation.  I have been forced to place a bit of tape on both units to hold the end of the lighting strip down.  Antec needs to address this issue in future versions of the product.  The second problem is with the length of the USB cable itself.  On one monitor I have built-in USB ports and the cord is more than long enough.  On the other monitor however, the cable is not long enough to reach a USB port and I had to use a USB extension cable in order to get it to length.  It seems that Antec has designed this product solely for monitors with USB ports.  The lack of an off switch is evidence of this.  On my Dell UltraSharp, it is not problematic since the ports lose power after turning the monitor off and the light goes out accordingly.  On my other monitor, the lights stay on when plugged into an always on port and have to be manually unplugged.  I have instead had to run my second monitors cable to my UltraSharp in order to not have to plug and unplug constantly.  Overall, the lighting performance of this kit is more than adequate.  However, Antec needs to redesign this kit to address a pair of glaring deficiencies in their design.  Having to supplement the adhesive with additional tape is inexcusable and the lack of an off switch and a cable of suitable length makes using this on monitors without built in ports a hassle.  A new version of this kit is warranted and hopefully Antec will address the design problems.

0525478817|5.0|Love, Life, and Its Imperial Affliction (NO SPOILERS)<br /><br /> \\"Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.)\\" This is how, by page one, John Green had me hooked. Green, author of young adult novels such as Paper Towns, An Abundance of Katherines, and Looking for Alaska, released his newest novel, The Fault in Our Stars, on January 10, 2012. The novel follows sixteen-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster through her battle with, not only cancer, but the challenge of living a \\"meaningful\\" life. Whatever that means.<br /><br /> One of the things that connecting me to the text, more so than any of Green's other novels, is the biting and witty realism of Hazel. All of Green's major previous works have been told from the perspective of a teenaged (usually nerdy) male. To read something of his written from the female perspective was a breath of fresh air. Like many of Green's other protagonists, Hazel and her love interest Augustus Waters converse is a fashion that makes me green with envy. Their intellectual quips and humor make me yearn for a generation of teenagers who are more interested in literary debate than the newest edition of Call of Duty.<br /><br /> This novel is a roller coaster of emotion. In the five hours I spent devouring it, I giggled, guffawed, screamed in frustration, bawled my eyes out, and laughed through the tears. This myriad of reactions is the sign of a meaningful text. There is no point in experiencing something which gives you nothing in return. Jonathan Franzen once said that \\"The reader is a friend, not an adversary, not a spectator.\\"  Just as friends make each other feel a variety of different emotions, not always positive, if one is being realistic, the reader shares that roller coaster ride with Green with relish and appreciation. Although he writes from the perspective of teenagers and theirs thoughts and feelings, Green's words are universal (speaking to different types of people has become a strong suit of John's, having posted videos for nearly 646,000 \\"Nerdfighter\\" subscribers on the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel he shares with his brother Hank). The special connection I feel to The Fault in Our Stars, however, is not limited to the beauty of Green's language and character development. This literary journey made me consider and appreciate those I love so much more. The day following my completion of The Fault in Our Stars, I felt the incessant need to hug all my friends for extended periods of time, just to try to convey to them, in some small way, how deeply I value them. The Fault in Our Stars will be more than just a beautiful diversion of your time; it will force you to examine your relationships with other people, as well as your relationship to the world itself. It the best possible way. Happy page-turning, and DFTBA.<br /><br />Disclaimer: The Fault in Our Stars contains some depictions of a sexual nature, as well as some mild language, and dark themes concerning death that may not be suitable for some younger bibliophiles.ough he writes from the perspective of teenagers and theirs thoughts and feelings, Green's words are universal (speaking to different types of people has become a strong suit of John's, having posted videos for nearly 646,000 \\"Nerdfighter\\" subscribers on the Vlogbrothers YouTube channel he shares with his brother Hank).

0380725398|4.0|Watch out for a five-star review entitled \\"A beautiful story\\" by Iman, a young woman from the Netherlands.  The review gives away a major plot point.  Do not read that review if you have not yet read the book.<br /><br />Jamaica Inn is a very well written gothic novel.  Our heroine finds herself in a situation that is really terrible, and for me the book would have been intolerable if it were not for the fact that the main character, Mary Yellen, is a plucky, courageous and smart woman. The situation she finds herself in is terrible to think about, and makes the stakes very high. The characters are are well formed and interesting, and the setting is Cornwall, which becomes a character in itself; a brooding presence.<br /><br />Although sometimes referred to as a romance, Jamaica Inn has very little of the usual romance novel trappings.  It's more about how women can be strong and intelligent and not give in to their situations, written at a time when women were still being looked down upon as helpless beings who were not very smart.<br /><br />Spooky, thought-provoking and sometimes infuriating, this book seems like the spunky younger sister of the novel Rebecca.  If you haven't read Rebecca, you'll definitely want to after reading Jamaica Inn.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|I bought this set for a friend as a gift. She is an avid reader and I kept wondering why she hadn't reported back to me about how much she loved the books. Evidently, the Kindle edition was one huge book that she had trouble navigating, some trouble with the formatting, and she finally gave up.<br /><br />I had bought a few of the books as Singles for my own reading device and noted no problems. So I feel I've wasted quite a bit of money and given no gift at all. Surely with as much money as this series has made, they could have done better than this !
B004XZR63M|5.0|The \\"let your money work for you\\" idea is simple to understand. I no longer want to manage my financial passively. It is not just so i can be rich but can be \\"free\\"
B005VCL4PW|5.0|Probably my favorite of the whole series, and yet the most \\"unbelievable\\". So why did I like it so much? No idea. Perhaps because it let me suspend disbelief for awhile, shed my old skin and slip into the world of teenagers where anything is possible and everything is believable.<br /><br />If you're looking for Hemingway, this really isn't it. But if you're looking for an escape, some light reading and fantasy fun, its worth reading the whole series.
B006PERRMY|5.0|I downloaded this some time ago. Had it sitting there for weeks. I love sci-fi but thought this would suck as I am not a timberlake fan. But glad I finally watched it because it was an amazing piece of sci-fi. Very cool, very stylish, great concept, one of those cool dystopian future movies. See Hollywood, without piracy I never would have seen this. Because of it I downloaded this, watched it, and ended up buying it on here. Thats a sale you would not have had otherwise.
0553582038|2.0|As I've said in my other SoIaF reviews, this is my second reading. I wanted to make sure I just hadn't missed something. Books 1 and 2 got five stars from me, Book 3 got 4, and I still can't read this one. In comparison, it isn't the total epic fail that DwD is, but in retrospect, I can see where this is headed clearly on the second reading (or skimming, as it were). On the first read, I was reluctant to review it because I thought, \\"well, this will all be taken care of in the next book\\". All authors run into this type of slog in an epic series, it seems. So I waited until Book 5 came out to review Book 4.<br /><br />I don't know most of the characters introduced in this book, and I find I don't care. I didn't care the first time, and don't care the second. And after re-reading #4, I really do think I'm going to skip trying to re-read #5. I just have better things to do with my time. Evidently, GRRM has better things to do with his time, too. And it's not writing or finishing this series.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Outside of England, to my knowledge, Australia where I live, is the only other country to Have Love Never Dies currently showing, that finished in Melbourne Just before Christmas and is about to open In Sydney. I have seen the show twice now, The Phantom of the Opera I saw 5 times and it is my favourite Musical. In Love Never Dies the story continues with the Phantom Fleeing to Coney Island. 10 years has past and this is where the story takes up.<br /><br />I do not want to give too much away, but Christine is lured to Coney Island with her drunken husband and 10 year old son, to sing for a large sum of money which she really needs after her husband Raul has become an alcoholic, and lost all their money and wealth over the years, so this is Christine's chance to get back to the life she once enjoyed all those years ago.<br /><br />There is Drama, love and sadness as there was in the original Phantom of the opera and throughout Love Never Dies there are afew subtle references back to the original show through the music score, When Christine sings her signature song the scene too my breath away. If you loved Phantom of the Opera, you will love, Love never dies, Keep and open mind as the story unfolds as you follow this musical and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I too had read negative reviews when the show opened in London, perhaps us Aussies do not pay much attention to other's views and would rather see it for ourselves before passing Judgement, I have no regrets spending my money to see this show, it was fantastic. Enjoy the dvd, feel the beautiful music score and enjoy the show.
055357342X|4.0|I've had to wait a bit after reading this entire series to go back and try to adequately absorb each book. I'm not going to outline plot twists, as so many have done that, but Storm of Swords, while still very good reading, did start to drag a bit in places. But with a world this big and vivid and full of well-fleshed-out characters, it is still a book I'm enjoying on a second read. I don't believe anyone could read the first two books and not want to read the third, but that's just me. In retrospect, I'm still classifying this among the greats of fantasy fiction.
1932735410|5.0|Rita's books have gotten a bad rap due to some language contained within. From my perspective, I passed the exam on my 1st try, and this book is the thing that tied it all together for me. Best resource by far. Read the PMBOK first, and then this one will tie it all together. Thank you to the authors of this!
0553381695|5.0|Many months after finishing this whole series and being so disappointed in the last book, I went back to re-read numbers one and two, and found even more things to love about this book. There is simply no way to absorb all the detail and plot intricasies on a first read. The world is real, the characters amazing; and if you are a visceral reader, you will actually see this played out in your mind as you read. After reading thousands of books in my life, Book 1 and 2 of this series remain my favorite fantasy books of all time. Even if you've read the bad reviews on the last book, you truly owe it to yourself to see how this series started.
0307957934|4.0|Robert Harris has taken the concept of computer technology, financial wizardry, market manipulation and thrown it into a mixer with high adventure and mystery and out of the mix emerges a high energy concept of a novel. \\"The Fear Index\\" is a challenging book to read with some of the technical mumbo jumbo that can easily fly over the reader's head unless they are somewhat of a financial wizard. But he does a very good job of trying to explain it all without insulting the reader's intelligence.  Alex Hoffman is the head of a hedge fund which uses algorithms combined with artificial intelligence to manipulate investments based upon fear that drives the markets around the world by individual investors and large financial funds. His results entice extremely rich financiers to sink millions into his hedge fund.  When Hoffman begins to experience some frightening and mysterious intrusions in his personal life, he wonders about his own safety and sanity.  A break-in to his heavily fortified home, a series of emails sent from his own personal accounts that he claims he never sent and some violent physical attacks cause Hoffman to raise his own personal fear index as he pursues his demons through Geneva, Switzerland.  The story introduces a diverse set of characters both within the company and outside investors along with a determined Swiss police inspector.  Just when the book begins to get technically overwhelming, Harris throws in an adventurous set piece which grabs the reader by the throat.  Unlike too many books today which are simply slight copies of other plot lines, this one is well thought out and a unique story which deserves to be read by anyone looking for something new and thrilling.  This is a story about the power of technology and the danger presented by it. Readers will be reminded of many movies and books of the past which questioned whether computers present as much negative consequences as potential benefits. But Harris has thrown in just enough high drama, violent confrontation and thrilling action to provide a great read and eventually a superb concept movie. Pick it up, take your time and read this book.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I used to love this app, but it's become so clunky I don't want to use it anymore. Tried loading it on my Kindle Fire, but it wouldn't connect to the servers. Not being able to sign in, I can't download any version to read offline.
B0067QPVD2|1.0|We already have two amazing versions of this film from 1951 and 1982. There didn't need to be another, and we certainly don't need any more remakes.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|Yet, another case of the movie trailers leading you to believe one thing and it turning out to be something else.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The best way I can describe this movie is a romantic version of GTA with lots of 80's style music.
B006JSXYPA|1.0|Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity.

B005COO1X6|3.0|I really enjoyed this short story. It pulled me in and made me not want to put it down. The downside is i kept looking for something deeper. Something more intense.. I was a bit disappointed by the ending but i still had a blast reading it. Nothing life changing because it didnt. The characters are interesting but never fully develop.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is the most riveting series I've ever read. There is a lot of brutality, violence and death but without it, the theme wouldn't have been so strong. Ms. Collins will have you holding your breath from page one all the way to the end. I consider myself a slow reader but I devoured all 3 books in less than a week.<br /><br />The protagonist, Katniss, is self-absored, and selfish and yet we find ourselves completely rooting for her because of her ultimate sacrifice of her life for her sisters. There are so many truths in this book. I love the way this author shows the horrors of war, yet also shows that there are some things worth fighting for. In today's society, we see many parallels to the world she created. I hope this fantastic story jolts some folks out of their comfort zones and has them considering the cost of war and of turning a blind eye to what we know is wrong.<br /><br />Kudos Ms. Collins. Highly recommend this series to teens and adults.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This series is fabulous and if you haven't checked it out, it's time you did. It's not for the faint of heart and put your kids to bed first!
0439023513|5.0|I loved this series and thought this final installment wrapped it up perfectly. The tension remained high throughout the novel. The theme was fantastically woven in and gave me so much to think about. It's no small feat to write novels that have such a great balance of conflict and introspection. I love books that leave me changed, and this series definitely did. I thought this was the perfect wrap up to a wonderful series. Great ending, Miss Collins. Kudos. The success of this series is well warranted.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is a fantastic and drastically underrated film that once one wathces they will want to watch over and over and over.
0439023491|5.0|This series was the most riveting I've ever read. I thought Miss Collins did a nice job with book 2, though I would have liked to see \\"on stage\\" a few things that were summarized and without giving a spoiler, a certain repeat of book 1 made me cringe for the characters. I thought Miss Collins did an absolutely fantastic job of keeping the conflict at the nail biting level throughout. Highly recommend this series for adults and teens.

B0070Z4M4I|1.0|Admit I never saw the Carpenter pre-The Thing because of the trailers.  Admit I had no interest in The Thing 2011 because of the trailers.  When 2011 became available for a couple of bucks on Amazon Instant Video, I figured I'd give it a chance.  What a disappointment from start to finish.  Call me old school but the Arness original still rules!
B004SMDJ9U|1.0|I opened the box set for the first time today, and unfortunately, every disc is scratched and will not play.  I am outside of my 30 day return, so I am unable to exchange for an undamaged box set.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|Saw the trailer for Dream House before another flick and was expecting it to be a horror movie based upon one tag line (please don't quote me):  Everyone who lives in this house dies.  Never got around to seeing it on the big screen but did sign up once offered by Amazon Instant Videos.  Granted, it's not the horror flick I expected but it is a suspense film ala Hitchcock and really creepy.  I enjoyed it and have recommended it.
1419702238|5.0|Such a great enstallment! an easy, fun read that is captivating for kids and teens alike! one of my personal favourites in the series. big page-turner! this is such a great read for reluctannt kids with laughs, drama and more!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It had such a great ending I was suprised.  I can't wait to see the movie.
B006T5FDLG|1.0|Songs are long and monotonous. I really can't understand why some reviewers gave this thing 5 stars. Take Megadeth for example, Mustaine writes songs which are approx. 4 minutes long, but there is no wasted time in his music. Here everything is around 7 minutes, but it's plain boring. I get tired after a minute or so... Not recommended, if you're a die-hard fan from the early days. These days are over, and they are not coming back. I'd rather listen to any of the albums from the 80s, or even 90s. These guys are definitely burned out now. Don't buy, unless you think that Death Magnetic is a great record... Sad but true
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Here's the deal. Drive opens with a nearly silent (and nerve-wracking) opening sequence in which we are introduced to Ryan Gosling's \\"Driver\\" driving the getaway car for some small time crooks. I like to view this movie as one that people who can appreciate great cinematography and film making. The reason people are so upset by the movie is because their expectations were of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" car movie variety. Drive goes the opposite direction. It's not a high octane car chase film, it's a slow burn, then explode character driven movie. It's an excellent movie if you know what you are getting in to.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This show is probably my favorite TV series ever. I discovered it years after it ran, but have watched the whole series plus the finale, Serenity, which was released as a full-length feature film, several times. I like to watch the series in order, from beginning to end, occasionally repeating my favorite episodes.<br /><br />This series has it all: action, adventure, excitement, and more than a little humor. The acting is outstanding; the cast is five-star and manages to create characters that draw you in and make you love them. I especially like the Tams, and watch scenes with Summer Glau again and again. (Too much snow on the roof can cause the ceiling to cave in. His brains are in grave danger!)<br /><br />If Firefly has a down side it is its brevity. One season plus a full-length feature do not do this cast justice, and, to paraphrase the show's preacher Shepard Book, there is a special corner in Hell reserved for the people who decided to cancel this series! I just finished watching the whole thing again (for at least the fourth time, which is not typical for me) and am depressed all over again at the loss. If this show failed to get rating then it is not the fault of the cast or the writers; blame the studio's marketing department. (As I mentioned, I never even heard of this show until years after it was canceled, and SciFi is my favorite genre! You can't blame that on Nathan Fillion and probably not on Joss Whedon either!)<br /><br />If you like Westerns, you'll like this series. If you like SciFi, you'll like this series. If you like Gina Torres (and how can't you?) then you'll like this series. Just give the first episode a try, and you'll be hooked.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was delightful.  Lots of historical points, with travel to places like France and insight into a completely different world of creatures and their customs over the centuries.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next book in this series.
B00004SVID|5.0|pink floyd the wall, just saying those words brings chills to my spine i love this album so much, this live recording is just over the top though, the little extra things that it has made it oh so better, longer songs, the last few bricks, this is by far my favorite piece of music at its best. ordered it in 'good' condition but came in pretty bad condition but i dont care, the cds and booklests with pictures of the concert were in great shape. the best.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|I first saw this movie at the South by South West Film Festival, and ever since then I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD so that I could own it! It is still as funny and awesome with the 5th, or 20th, viewing as with the first. If you love classic horror films and love to laugh at them also, this movie is for you.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|This is a beautiful watch at a very reasonable price.  The fact that it is a lefty watch takes some getting used to, but no big deal.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend this watch to anyone.  Although I live in Canada, the price including the shipping and duties still made it worthwhile for me to purchase.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was simply a waste of my family's time and even made my younger relatives have nightmares about penguins. Do not buy.

B001B56ITU|4.0|Supertramp has been unfortunate all these years suffering the unjust fate of other great bands like Styx and to some extent Queen as their music defies clear categorisation frustrating people who have the irrational hangup of just having to be able to neatly compartmentalise music. As Supertramp doesn't clearly fit into the Rock genre for some given their clearly thearetical/musical/operatic leanings they must be bad or a rotten band in some \\"experts'\\" eyes. Thankfully for those of us who just enjoy great music irrespective of whether or not it comfortably fits into any genre can still enjoy great songwriting ala Roger Hodgson as well as Rick Davies in the same album without feeling we have to apologise for it; we can just enjoy the great band that is Supertramp.<br /><br />Fans are in for a treat with this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version as the sound quality here is among the best that I've ever heard on a cd!  It's clear that the master tapes have been very well preserved and the producer Ken Scott deserves a lot of credit for doing an excellent job from the start lest we mistakenly give all the credit to the SHM-CD treatment just for allegedly improving the reflective plastic surface; let's just say that the \\"technology\\" sounds extremely dubious to me.  Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese and a paper square replicating the original vinyl lyrics sheet.  As far as the cardboard sleeve goes though, it's not the best mlps design and assembly that I've ever seen and in fact, my copy already looks like it will come apart soon as the glue holding it together gets old.<br /><br />Everyone talks about \\"Breakfast In America\\" and rightly so but \\"Crime of the Century\\" is also very, very good and I feel comes in a close second to the former as Supertramp's best ever album.  Excellent tracks like fan favourite \\"School\\", my favourite \\"Bloody Well Right\\" and \\"Dreamer\\" are mingled together with excellent album tracks that don't remotely resemble filler; in fact it could even be a best of compilation album of Supertramp tracks.<br /><br />Good but not great mlps design, excellent content and brilliant sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!ller; in fact it could even be a best of compilation album of Supertramp tracks.

B0067QPVD2|4.0|I knew coming into this movie that it was a prequel to John Carpenter's classic and I thought what a cool idea for a movie...instead of remaking it of course!  No one liked John Carpenter's Thing when that came out and no one likes this one as well!  Time cures all I guess!  Almost everyone considers John's to be a horror classic now!  I actually liked the new version and was thinking they should make a prequel to this one to tell the tail of the alien and why he crashed on our planet in the first place?!?  I'm also wondering if Kurt Russell would be interested in doing a sequel...him and Keith David...the two survivors!  Sure they have aged but beards and all cover that!  Ok, just wanted to get the word out to give the new film a chance!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I know people think Justin is a lightweight, and maybe he is, but for this role he is a good enough actor to carry it off.  Sure the plot and premise are not entirely realistic, but it is good sci fi - There are some serious economic, sociological and political ideas and criticism here to think about well after the movie is over.  You can view it as a \\"what if\\", but you can also ask yourself how much society is already a lot like that of \\"in time\\"  -- rich and poor and the distribution of wealth, etc, etc.  See? - I can write a positive review!

B0067LY4WG|3.0|I'm a big admirer of the life and work of Leonard Cohen and it's hard to fully accept this, but...his best songs and his best music are buried deep in the past. Though, this is no shock or surprise.  Leonard found a very effective musical niche in the late 60's (in the wake of Dylan) and rode the wave through the better part of the 70's...and has struggled with 'musical' integrity ever since - though his writing prowess has never much wavered.  He's never been an inclined 'musical ear' or an 'album crafter'. He's just a gifted, graceful and endowed writer. His immersion in the musical realm is relatively shallow compared to long-time devoted musical journeymen like Dylan, Neil Young and Tom Waits. Cohen stumbled upon a few basic European patterns and took them as far as he could.  Nevertheless,  LC is head-and-shoulders above the rest of the pop music/culture scene...because of his grace, love and essentially...his enlightenment. This makes him worth listening to...but still not so worthy of being coddled for an effort that is so flawed.  'Old Ideas' is a fine collection of thoughtful, lyrical meditations...but musically it sounds schmaltzy, stale and cheap - too much run-of-the-mill sequencing and an enormous lack of inspired spontaneous musicianship.  I would rather hear LC with his weathered thunderous voice alone with his clangy classical Ovation guitar...rather than with cheap music-in-a-can programming with too much female background treatment. This does not support and/or enhance the deep, raw and naked message of love and truth Leonard is delivering in his poetry. He could still make a great album, only with a genuine music-making approach in the production. On 'Old Ideas' the production integrity is poor and very high on the schmaltz meter!    I will say - sometimes it works well-enough not to detract from the marvel of the man's insight.  The best songs here are (in my humble opinion)  'Amen', 'Crazy To Love You' and 'Going Home' the rest are overdone or lacking cohesive inspiration.  These are 'Old Ideas' indeed,  but still worth considering... but not blindly buying into because of one's artistic stature or reputation.   To you Cohen newbies - if you want LC's best albums,  check out: 'Songs of Leonard Cohen,''Songs From a Room,' 'New Skin for The Old Ceremony' and 'Various Positions'

B0067QPVD2|3.0|Some spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I am a fan of John Carpenter's The Thing, and I had read all the conflicting messages about whether this was a sequel, remake, prequel, re-imagining, redux, etc.  Essentially, this movie provides the backstory of what happened at the abandoned Norwegian base camp that is explored by characters during Carpenter's film.  A 0.5 to Carpenter's 1.0?  Anyway, no matter how you slice it, it is a valiant effort with passable acting and an attempt to marry the CGI of today with the practical effects of Carpenter's effort.<br /><br />Unfortunately, fans are so strongly supportive of Carpenter's movie, that this movie received a lot of flack and felt unnecessary.  The strongest acting is crafted by the Norwegian cast and Joel Edgerton who balances out Winstead's heroine.  The CGI lacks the depth of the practical effects burned into our consciousness by the 80's film.  And you can't help to feel that this movie lacks SOMETHING!  It successfully leads right into Carpenter's story, even borrowing the theme from that film for the end credits.  But it misses the mark somehow.  Again, another argument for the reviews and message boards.  If this was an attempt to mine a franchise out of The Thing, it should be left dead and burning in the snow.

B005LAIIS0|1.0|I took my girlfriend to see this (I know, big mistake).  She's generally skeptical of these movies, but after watching the previews she was game for a boy-flick.  This genre is right up my alley so I was really looking forward to it.  The trailer spins it at sort of a man vs wild primal thriller a bit like Anthony Hopkins' \\"The Edge\\" meets LOST.  It's not.  It's contrived, over-acted, cliched and full of \\"why's\\" such as:  Why don't they just stay with the plane;  Why don't they make spears to defend themselves;  Why don't they build shelters to keep out the wolves;  Why are they trying to out run wolves;  Why is he taping airplane bottles to his fingers;  Why aren't the animated wolves convincing;  SPOILER ALERT:  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  The ending was really dumb--think Sopranos series fanale.

Should have gone to my collection and watched the James Arness version, followed by the Kurt Russell(Carpenter)film.<br /><br />What this movie lacks in \\"suspense.\\" Both of the earlier versions managed to keep you interested in the both the creature and the characters. And who didn't see the woman as the last one standing?<br /><br />What they had alot of was special effects, which became boring quickly. And finally, the ending, which is the beginning of Carpenter's version. Too bad. Sometimes prequels work. This one stands alone as a real muck up.<br /><br />I hope this version doesn't turn anyone off to seeing Kurt Russell's excellent acting, and if you want a real treat, get the original. It's a movie buff's joy to behold.<br /><br />Again this version of \\"The Thing\\" is \\"NO-THING.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game it passes time well.  the games are fun to play and they never get old. I would recommend it for anyone
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the fact that it is one app but it has tons of games. I cant wait until I play them all
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The many and varied reading plans are very motivating. I am reading the New Testament in a year and love being able to choose the Bible version I desire and also have it read to me.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I found all the 4 and 5 stars reviews truly correct. It's true that you could expect a different movie, because of the trailers and title (it's not the first \\"drive\\" movie) and I agree how beautiful and amazing this movie is, with mind blowing music and sound, excellent pictures. Watch it and most likely you will listen again and again the music and play the entire movie once more. This movie is close to perfection and I am delighted by the actors and director, a genius. Also agree with who wrote the awards are meaningless if this movie won't win any of them. This movie at time can be quite violent and has little dialog. Communication is mostly achieved by other means like pictures, actors expressions and contextual situation, leaving space for your own creation/imagination of feelings. In this sense it is more like reading a book. I think the absence of dialog is what may turn off most of the people who gave a bad review. If you know you don't like this kind of movies I am not surprised you will find this movie boring or not that good. If I have to find a flaw in this movie I can only think I wished there were either more driving scenes or longer ones or better ones: the chase on the curvy roads with the ford mustang was played at 40mph at most! no stunt drivers out there to make it look a bit better ? but still realistic without going over the edge and look like a video game like in fast and the furious. Maybe too much computer effects these days and there are really no more stunt drivers! However the end of the chase with close up on the vixen on the back seat and slow motion was Really Good!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games came highly recommended to me by a friend with similar reading tastes, so I got into it with high expectations and it delivered far beyond my expectations.  The dialog and pacing are excellent and the plot has many layers to be enjoyed as a light entertainment read, or at a much deeper level.  It is a very hard series of books to put down, and each book transitions into the next very nicely.  The Author makes the characters pop off the page, and I quickly became interested in Katniss and what direction the plot would take her in next.  My recommendation is that anyone interested in the \\"The Hunger Games\\" save themselves some trouble and go ahead and get all three books at once.  Enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game that seems to like making me overlook the obvious. Trying to complete the puzzles in the minimum number of moves is where both the funand frustration take hold. Play this game!
0061433047|5.0|A big, fat 5/5 for this, the final Tiffany Aching book from me.<br /><br />As she does for my friends, Nathan and Courtney, the young Miss Aching appeals no end; she is moral, caring, a thinker and understands that while she has a place in the world, it is often complicated by difficult or potentially unpopular decisions.<br /><br />Though Pratchett originally wrote this subset of the Discworld novels for a younger audience, there's absolutely no reason they ought not be on the reading list of any Discworld fan. Nay, any fantasy fan.<br /><br />With the Tiffany Aching books, Pratchett has moved beyond the (very excellent, mind you) silliness and satire present in many of his earlier pieces to a more profound, gentle humor laced with more than a condiment level of humanity.<br /><br />It's a great read, no matter whether you're a fan of the author or genre.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great. Fun I am having a blast ..Have not got tired of it so far ....I would give it 5 Stars
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun to play just before bed time.  Requires thought and concentration to get the day's problems out of your head.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love it. one of the most perfect games I gave ever played. there's no problem with it at all.

B006HH5ZQY|5.0|This is by far the best sounding version of this album. You can finally hear the bass and drums. Not just vocals and guitar. The double tracked lead solos are also more defined. You can actually hear each solo in this mix. The fidelity of the album is not any better than any previous release. However, everything does have much better detail. That in itself makes the album more listenable. This release is well worth it if you like this album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing. It reads the bible with you in certain languages which helps your understanding by intergrating senses. There are so many different Bible versions. in just this one app which allows you to compare and obtain a deeper understandidng of what you're reading. Another thing I love are the Bible reading plans. I use this app on my aneroid whitlch allows me to have is as a widget. Its the first thing I see when I look at my phone, and if that's Not enough motivation the phone sends you reminders if you haven't read the reading for that day(if you set it that way).  All around great app, doesn't crash too much. I love it and il pretty sure I haven't even used it for all its worth. Hands down best Bible app yet
B004LWZWBU|1.0|I don't know what the previous reviewers were smoking.  This film was painful. Not even an all star cast can rescue a poorly written film about bird watching. The one star ranking is being generous. Save your money.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the cards move fast and has never had any delays.  on my kindle fire and never has any problem. will be downloading to my android
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This was the first game I bought for my kindle. I play with it everyday. I reccomend this game to everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find myself going to this app a lot.  It's a classic.  I like the option to auto finish once you know you've won the round.
0439023513|5.0|Like the first two, I found the third book impossible to put down. My husband and I read all three books at the same time using the kindle editions....and we both were so entertained.  It was the first time we've ever read a series together because our tastes are usually pretty different when it comes to novels.  But we both ended up enjoying this series very much.  I completely agree with the review by David O'Tootle from Chicago.  The book ended about as well as it could have, given what the characters went through.  I am a little glad that I saw some of the bad reviews (without spoilers) before reading the book, because I expected the worst.  But ultimately, I found the book to be gory at times (as if the first two books weren't!), emotionally draining at times, sweet/funny at times, and overall pretty realistic.  I was very satisfied with the ending and am glad I read the series.  Thanks to Suzanne Collins for making such a consuming page-turner. My husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|I bought these as a gift for my mom after she saw my son wearing the same pair. She always makes fun saying they look spacy, little did she know she would fall in love. After she felt how light and wearable they were she was sold. They are very well insolated, great for NY winters, and very easy to walk and drive with. If you're thinking about buying these, don't hesitate; these are a great buy.
0307352145|3.0|After reading this book, I feel I must say, Yes, I admit I am an extrovert and I like it.  I have moments where I need to take a break from it all and hibernate, but in my heart, I love to be out and around people.  I am surrounded by introverts on a daily basis and maybe I don't quite understand what makes them tick and what they need on a daily basis.<br /><br />This book not only shows what introverts need in relationships, but also at the workplace.  The final chapter is a complete source for parents and teachers on how to interact with introverted children.  I think the author does a great job of making valid points and using interesting research to back up and explain each point.  Although this is non-fiction and has a little bit of an academic approach, it reads much easier than a textbook and is a worthy read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts.  I think the extroverts need to learn how to adapt around introverts, while the introverts need to find the confidence in their own personality traits.
1423136802|5.0|While many people think that the Percy Jackson books are just a rip-off of the Harry Potter series, think again. My son loved these books and so do I. These books are great for ages 8 to 98. Great storytelling and characters.
8497597931|2.0|Someone recommends me to read this book with the purpose to understand the taurus holliday, but I got disappointed because Mr. Hemingway just explain in a detailed way his experience, but I continue thinking that I cannot bear this \\"Fiesta\\" is a wild, absurd tradition, completely out of logic. Besides, the arrival of the package was late.
B0058VA2TU|5.0|This being my very first Anthrax vinyl disc, I am so very pleased. I have the CD mix and the mp3s, but the vinyl mix is 100% better than both. You can hear things that you would never be able to hear on the CD.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|My son is a toy story fanatic and when i opened that box and pointed out that it was andy's toy box holding the dvds, he flipped! super cute, super personal, love the digital copies and my son was one happy camper! this is a must for toy story fans (which we all are)!
0345528581|5.0|I purchased this book for my son whom has been into body building for most of his adult life. He is now incarcerated in a place with no gym equipment available. Of course he never stopped working out but since receiving this book has learned a whole new approach and now more than ever wants to pursue his dream of being a personal trainer. He even has other inmates trying the routines and the guards watching with interest. I would say it was an excellent choice. Enjoy!
B006H3MIV8|1.0|If enjoy a well-crafted CD, do not buy this item. The songs are arranged in a musicly unappealing order and most of them are uninteresting non-interpretations. There is no energy. Best use: Set of coasters.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Newer TV's have fiber optic for audio out and my wireless speakers are RCA  this was a quick, easy way to get them both to work together. Seller sent out very quickly too.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|This app was confusing at first, but now I got the hang of it. I would recommend this app to anyone who is not organized. it helped me get organized.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No more multiple button pushes to complete one move. It is easy. Just tap and go, and it also rotates to landscape. Cool!
B005V1WZ10|4.0|Not what I expected but very good. There are a few tracks Im hitting over and over. For me, Korn's definitely been my go-to past Tool though yes, more poppy. I hope they keep experimenting like this. I don't know Jack about dub step but this is fun.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Great Doc.  You will be happy you took the time to view \\"Man on Wire.  Highly recommend the view.  I don't like spoilers myself so I won't leave any in my reviews.  I am the best movie critic - a non-critic.  Watch this joint.  It's a good one.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Sequels are never good and this was no exception. Animation was as poor as the voice acting. Don't waste you money on the MPAA.
B001NA6096|4.0|Make sure you view \\"Before Sunset\\" right after watching \\"Before Sunrise\\".  Same actors 9 years later.  These are a couple nice date night joints.  Pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy.
1567184855|5.0|This book is valuable for the transcripts of those regressed. I had to skip through most of the author's comments as inane and beside the point. I kept wanting to yell at him \\"shut up and just listen!\\" as he tried to analyze and compartmentalize information from a spiritual realm. I am hoping author acquires spiritual wisdom in next two volUmes.  The regressions are wonderful material, so read for this if nothing else.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a nice variety of games that are fun simple and easy to play. Its easy to lose track of time while playing these games.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|This film is a great watch. This motion picture is a great representation of the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. This film contains beautiful shots, and the cast is extremely lively, staying true to Foer's characters. Everything Is Illuminated is a premium film that contains all the elements any film-goer could desire.
B000Q67876|4.0|Sent fast! Go it fast in the mail. Will love to do business with these guys again! It's also an AWESOME movie.
B005FITIGO|1.0|This is supposedly 24-hours in the 'life' of Lehman Brothers. It fails to explain the investments that got Lehman into trouble, the firm's reaction to the news that it was in trouble is nonsensical, the original scenes are unbelievable, etc., etc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an enjoyable game as it is almost like the real deal.  The only difference is you don't have the feel of the cards in your hand.
1933633867|5.0|What is most striking about Debt is the overwhelming power of its numerous ideas. It is so rare that a book can hit the reader over the head with even one major new idea. I mean a world-shaking idea that upsets one's entire value system and causes the reader to reframe everything going forward. David Graeber seems to be able to do it at will.<br /><br />Here are a few small points that have changed my way of thinking:<br /><br />-Graeber begins by debunking the sacred Adam Smith, which he admits threatens the very foundation of economics, and that economics itself rests on the completely false foundations of Smith's unfounded and unprovable assumptions. The first clop up the side of the head is the destruction of the notion that money preceded markets and credit. He shows definitively and with total certainty that it was completely the other way around. Credit came first because there was no coinage. Markets and money, on the other hand, are side effects of governments. They cannot exist without institutional structures in place. And countries didn't appear until late in the human game. Ultimately, he says Smith was describing an ideal state, not anything that has ever existed anywhere.<br /><br />-Next, Graeber swings a punch for honor. All debt seems to stem from honor. Medieval Ireland for example, was structured on a monetary system that valued the honor of various classes of people, and assigned hard goods to value them - right in law. So honor was \\"monetized\\" in hard goods. Coins had no place beside eggs and cows and slave girls. Too abstract. Too remote. Similar official valuations of honor to commodities occurred elsewhere in history too. Tellingly, the Greek word for honor is the same word for price. In other words, the very human condition of honor is possibly the single most important driver of economics. This is a delightfully radically different viewpoint.<br /><br />-About the earliest evidence of the knowledge of structured debt that we have comes from 2402 BC. Money itself only appears around 600 BC, and most interestingly, it disappears again around 600 AD. Medieval societies existed without cash. Cash came back, obviously. But the question remains: is it cyclical? This gets short shrift, and only at the very end of the book.<br /><br />-Money itself seems to have come into play all over the world at about the same time, and for about the same reason: to pay armies. Alexander the Great alone required half a ton of silver a day to keep his men his men. This of course became a vicious circle. More need of silver meant wider conquests, more mines, more slaves to work them, and larger armies to oversee the expanding empire. In very many ways, little has changed.<br /><br />-For centuries, peasant uprisings have focused not on equality, not on an end to slavery, but the destruction of debt records. From medieval India to modern Chiapas, it is debt that causes violent dissatisfaction with life.<br /><br />-Market economies and capitalist economies are not (necessarily) the same thing, or even compatible. Market economies seek to trade goods for money in order to obtain more goods. Capitalist economies use money to buy goods to make more money. Put that way, it's two different universes.<br /><br />-and finally, \\"Capitalism cannot really operate in a world where people believe it will be around forever.\\"  I don't think I've seen a more highly charged statement in a rational context - ever.<br /><br />David Winebergears around 600 BC, and most interestingly, it disappears again around 600 AD.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|really awesome game some really easy games but overall really fun has a game for everyone. brother loved playing it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome.there is some bad games but the majority of them are pretty good. the quality of the games are pretty good. my favorite is the.game bouncer
B005KJZDXK|1.0|Gave as gifts to two couples who thought it was a joke, the singing was so terribly amateurish? In other words a big mistake
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is so awesome! I really love it! It even keeps my baby cousin busy while I do other things. I love this app bacauae it keeps and records my favorite thing&ndash;DRAWING!!! I highly recommend this app; it's so AWESOME!
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Found out about it a few months ago on itunes.<br />4 songs that didn't make the cut on there last album death magnetic.<br />Those leftovers are pretty good.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like Fruit Ninja; however this game was all too easy! I unlocked most of the blades and backgrounds within about 3 days. I really do love Fruit Ninja&mdash;but if there was a way to make it more challenging I'm all ears!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Great romantic/action movie, and great story told about D Day. It gets kids intrested in history in an action movie.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This app is great! I don't know what I could have done without it. It works great on my kindle. I can keep my schedules in there, and so on. It's a good app.
B001BPJJ1E|2.0|The reason why I didn't like this product was that the copy of the film was bad to watch. The film starts with a bad picture that has lines down it and what I can describe has green burn marks flickering. To be fair it does get better has the film goes on but then it does happen later in the film.  With the quality so poor I had to buy the product from another seller has I'd originally brought the 1st copy has a birthday present. I wouldn't have been happy to have given this to anyone.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I love this app.  It is almost perfect.  It requires a good system,  otherwise the video streaming is choppy.  It also keeps changing my color setting on my Windows 7.  And finally, it doesn't work through a VPN.  Other than that,  I use it quite often to work on my computer around the house.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm judlst beginning but its solid so far. quality game. reminds me of Braid. that's high praise. looking forward to the rest.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|This is really just \\"The Thing\\" remade, it really does not interject much new, I did not finish it, I want a scifi movie to make me think and not be utterly predictable, the effects and all were decent, it is solid, but if you have seen the previous version, I think you will be left flat.
B006546EPA|5.0|(a frequent admonition from Frau Strauss)... And so he did, and most of it is here in this neat little box. There are a few omissions (i.e. \\"Arabella\\" and \\"Capriccio\\"). But that aside, the quality of the recordings (a good portion of which were licensed from EMI and DG), make this latest Brilliant release a winner. Kempe's classic 9 CD EMI set of the complete orchestral works is worth the price alone! There are also many Lieder, Choral and Chamber works to explore. Although not a \\"complete edition\\", it is the most comprehensive set available anywhere.
B004D2CPO0|2.0|The movie was tedious, convoluted and boring on the overall. A Mob movie without the dynamics. Save your money and re-watch Good Fellas.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|One of the best films I've seen.  Artistic, vicious, dark and trippy.  Tom Hardy is a star.  Windig Refn is one of the few visionary directors who still makes art.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I downloaded this app on my Fire and it is much better than any other weather app.  I highly recommend!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I sign out after each game and never have it freeze on my kindle fire or ipad.  fun game and maybe they fixed the bugs?
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game on the computer now it is even more portable &lt;3 I think everyone should have this game it is the best ever!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. it passes the time fairly quickly. every game is different and has a different skill level. I recommend it
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is awesome and the app is great! it hasn't froze on me yet, hopefully it won't. you can pick your own background and deck.
1933308087|5.0|This book is SO inspiring!  I spend a lot of time just browsing all the wonderful blocks and fabrics.  Jinny's fabric usage makes such a difference in the block appearance, and really gets the creative juices flowing.  What a wonderful collection of blocks and such a great book to have in my quilting library.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great way to start the day by reading one of the daily reading plans. truly appreciate the knowledge and insight it provides and gives clear direction on how to improve.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Great game. Wish it was longer.  But for the price, it's hard to complain. Would pay more for a bigger/ longer game. Hope they make more of these.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is clearly the standard by which all others should/will be judged. How nice to see a truly bonny Lizzy rather than Keira Knightly's \\"heroin chic\\" anorexic body, sunken eyes and prison matron wardrobe. Her flat chest is laughable. Jennifer Ehle is quite perfect, especially the quality of her laugh. The only downside is that in the scene of Lizzy and Darcy walking after his proposal, they are not arm-in-arm. An unabashed Darcy smile as he tucks Elizabeth's hand in his elbow would have had me swooning. In the special features, even the screen writer admits the final proposal could have been more intimately staged. Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle, and Crispin Bonham-Carter as Bingly are all brilliant.
B0068TL23G|4.0|I love this game. I do agree with others on edit options and having a menu for replay or advance.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I needed some new utensils to replace the old ones I had. Simply put...they do what there supposed to and look better than most others. The \\"kickstand\\" on the bottom of the utensils mean no more using a paper towel or plate so the food doesn't mess up the counter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazingly awesome and very exciting I love it and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is easily addicted to games!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I just tried it and when trying my first game it closed. Then again. and again. Do not get this just find these games on the Internet!!!!!
B006MMVV7Q|1.0|I took the kids to see this, I wished I had waited to see it on video. I thought it was painful to watch, I can't remember being so irritated at a movie I just couldn't wait for it to end. I liked the smurfs as a kid but these smurfs were strange and not what i remembered. I'd let the kids watch it for free, but don't pay for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its soo fun to play. I play it everyday. I like to unlock new games and get more coins. Yay
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I saw this with my 10 and 12 year old daughters, and they hated it. Honestly, this is just a waste of time definately a no buy, maybe a rent...
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game makes you work for a win.  and it challenges you til the end.  it definitely weaves a web of a challenge.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You Version Bible app is very convient. I have it on my kindle and on my phone so where ever I go I have the Bible with me. They have every version you could imagine, and daily reading plans to suite any life style.  They have a reminder setting where they will send me a reminder to read the plan I have chosen everyday at the time I want tobe reminded, kinds like setting an alarm for reading the word, its good discipline. And has helped me grow stronger and closer To God.
0545123275|4.0|This was a very easy read. I wasn't obsessed with finishing it, but I did enjoy it very much. Sams love for her was sweet to read about. And I smiled a lot during this read. I recommend it for anyone looking for a nice easy read on a relaxing day.
B004ZNB12O|3.0|With the exception of \\"See Emily Play\\", all the songs on this album are after Dark Side or on Dark Side. The whole \\"WHY PINK FLOYD?\\" concept colud have been made much better:<br /><br />1. A sequel to \\"A Foot in The Door\\" with their early stuff<br />2. An Immersion version of \\"Piper\\" w/ \\"Vegtable Man\\" and \\"Scream Thy Last Scream\\"<br />3. Remastered versions of \\"Music From The Body\\", \\"Zabriske Point\\", \\"Works\\", \\"Relics\\", and \\"The Early Singles\\"<br />4. One Song: \\"Point Me At The Sky\\"<br />5. Make an offical bootleg series, like Bob Dylan and Miles Davis<br />6. Digitally restored \\"Live At Pompeii\\" W/ all the songs that were put on its many incarnations<br />7. Tour (Ok, I know its a long shot, but its worth a try)<br />8. Immersion version of MEDDLE, which is by far the best floyd album ever
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun game with lots of game in side it. I play it every day and earn more points.
B001RPC8B6|2.0|It looks like Jason is becoming the new Steven Segal. A new movie every 3 months good or bad!!! Glad this was a free rental  or I would have been ticked.  Since it was free I didn't expect a whole lot and I wasn't disappointed. There was barely an excuse to get Jason in the car a 3rd time{hopefully the last} and some very poorly filmed  martial arts scenes. The film is speeded up so fast it's hard to see what's going on, and people complain about Hong Kong  fights??? I like Jason in some movies but the last 2 Transporter movies were dumb to me . Blitz wasn't very good either. Jason is getting by on his early films for now but that won't go on much longer. Pretty soon it will be straight to cable.
B0000C8AVX|2.0|Columbia did such a mediocre job of recording Dylan and other great musicians in the early days (most painfully for me, Laura Nyro...) that an SACD version of the original crappy sound is just pointless.  I have three of these reissues and basically I'd just as soon listen to my scratchy LPs.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TuneIn Radio is on all of my mobile devices and has quickly become a favorite.  Just added it to my Kindle Fire.  I really like the ability to record a show and listen later.  Best radio app out there and worth installing!

159514188X|2.0|I read this book along time ago when i was depressed and then i loved it. Now, reading it again, i don't see why i loved it to begin with.<br />I'm going to start with the positives.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-the way Jay was creative enough to use tapes.<br />  why: who uses tapes anymore? i really liked the idea.<br />-the map to use on Hannah's point of view.<br />  why: when she told them to go somewhere and described how she felt.<br />-Clay, himself.<br />  why: his character was so real to me. his reactions were realistic. i loved him.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-Hannah.<br />  why: she was so whiny and constantly complaining. her \\"reasons\\" were just simple things, (spoiler) being set up at a date, a pepping tom. these are just high school things. and not other that -Hannah's tone of voice.<br />  what i mean is: while recording her voice on the tapes, she was trying to be funny. (some-what spoiler) Example: \\"'Hey! That sounds like a joke. Why would a dead girl lie? Answer: Because she cant stand up.' Is this some kind of twisted suicide note? 'Go ahead. Laugh. Oh well. I thought it was funny.'\\"<br />-the way Jay made Hannah.<br />  why: he made her sound like some whiny, 12 year old girl. which (to me) came off as stupid and irritating. just because of the simple things to \\"end her life.\\" were really no big deal. so it was really like saying \\"hahahah. you're why i killed my self. nada-nada-nada-nada.\\"<br /><br />so don't waste your time.

Steve took the road less taken and hit the jackpot and persevered.  He worked everyone to death, (like jeff bezos) and was successful.  I am doing this review on my mac laptop and there are no issues with this.  I think I will miss steve jobs as he made a huge impact on the entire planet
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Listening to this in Dolby TrueHD is just incredible.  I wish more music was available in such a high quality format.  It really puts mp3 and CD to shame!

1439153663|3.0|The Kitchen House is the story of two women,one black and the other white.  Each take a turn at telling her story and Belle the (black woman) is a much more interesting character than Lavinia who, although having been brought up with the slaves seems to have no understanding of their plight.  But, the story moves along thanks to Belle and her family of slaves whom you can feel a real connection to.  The character of Lavinia comes off as a real dope!

B001E25MBK|1.0|Already owned and viewed this collection on dvd and believed it would be  considerably better on blu-ray....WRONG!  In fact, playing blu-ray on  one input and dvd on another, ceteris paribus, none of us could discern  any difference between the two.  The blu-ray and dvd images were identical.  Why pay more money for blu-ray when the digital copy is identical to what  is put on dvd?
B0064J6P8W|1.0|The trailer for this movie doesn't even slightly hint at the filth it contains. I never write reviews but I felt obligated to with this one. The f-bomb is dropped what seems like every five seconds and the nudity and sex should have given this film a rating of X. I am far from a prude and this was over the line even for me. The sad thing is, this had the potential to be a really solid comedy, but they ruined it. I wanted to watch a funny movie with my family, not a porn.
B00009Z576|4.0|In Hindsight, Drama proves to be absolutely the bridge between the 70's archetypal Yes and a precursor for the resurgence of the 90125 era of the group. After the indifference of 1978's Tormato, Yes were under fire from their record company to be more commercial friendly and the band were rehearsing material with assigned producer Roy Thomas Baker(Queen, The Cars) in the south of France in mid '79. Apparently, things were not well with band or producer, and in an uneventful moment of happenstance, drummer Alan White had broken his foot during a night off from the studios, and effectively, put the project on ice. Anderson and Wakeman, in particular, were questioning the validity of what material was being written, and subsquently left the band. Once the remaining trio of Squire, White and Howe reconvened, the option of moving forward seemed to be the only solution for the welfare of its existing members. Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes were a pop/new wave duo that had just had success with the single Video Killed the Radio Star and happened to be under the same management as Yes were. While Horn's vocals were a bit thin at times, compared to that of Jon Anderson, Downes proved to be a sound choice of musician and brought Yes into the 80's most prominently with his use of newer keyboard techniques and a fresher approach musically, as well. Alot of Yes fans felt betrayed by the addition of the Buggles to this record, but really, once one listens to the disc, the results are stunningly paramount and ultimately, boosted the group's collective musical morale on the wider scale of things.  Machine Messiah opens with a brooding ambience, and once the track begins, there's a sense of earnestness and a revitalized approach is apparent, esp. in Steve Howe's snarling guitar performances, coupled with Alan's powerhouse drumming, Squire's prolific and reliable bass lines and the emergence of Downes' keyboard style which truly offers tons of textures to accentuate the growth of thistrack. Vocally, Horn echoes a lot of Anderson's phrasings, helped by the harmonies from Squire which gives this track a solid amount of creedence in its overall presentation. White Car is an odd interlude that features the new guys' style intermeshing with that of the core trio; it predominantly features Trevor's vocals and Downes' keyboards most significantly. Does it Really Happen was reconstructed from the previous Tormato sessions and is a very strong track that has elements of pop/new wave interspersed within its core that exemplifies the freshness and vitalities of this new version of the group.  Into the Lens(aka I Am A Camera) is a contribution from Horn and Downes and is yet another fine example of strong songcrafts and performance that adds to the appeal of this version of the band. Built largely around the keyboard arrangement from Downes, Howe's guitar playing is direct and brisk, White's drumming is persistent and Squire's bass lines are inventive and compelling. Once again, the vocals strengthen the track successfully and Lens justifiably, remains the gem of the record. Run Through the Light has a bit of a Police influence in its rhythm attack and song arrangement, culminating in a solid track that brings a consistently satisfying entry to the record. Closing with the ambitiously performed Tempus Fugit, which features some of Howe's most breathtaking guitar pyrotechnics coupled in tandem with the marvelous performance from Downes complimenting Howe, Drama is realized as a powerful and viable entry within the Yes catalogue, despite the rushed influx of personnel changes. The remaster reveals some of the abortive French sessions with Anderson and Wakeman in the ranks, and its easy to see why things were going wrong with the group at that particular time. Dancing Through the Light is most significant as it features a very cold/machine-like synth arrangement which is extremely new wave-ish, and has a textured, \\"guide vocal\\" which sounds as though a droid is singing the tune! Golden Age, In the Tower and Friend of a Friend continue in similar vein to the Tormato style and are rightly substandard and almost stubborn in attempting to meld new elements to the group, while still hanging onto the Yes style of old. Some people are divided, perhaps, as to the validity of Drama, but I find it as absolutely an essential and satisfying piece of work in order for Yes to carry on and survive within their career. It is the perfect catalyst for what would be the Trevor Rabin era in the next few years, which completely turned the band's fortunes around in the process. 4 solid Stars

B00009Z574|3.0|Yes' Tormato is something of a transitional record which searches for diversity and attempts to update Yes' style of music striving for relevancy within the punk and new wave explosion of the time period. Thus Tormato becomes a victim of circumstance within its own era, yet, certainly opened a door for the next release, Drama, which came off more successfully in its intents of updating Yes for the impending decade to come. Future Times/Rejoice opens the record and contains all of the essential elements within the ensemble to make this a strong opener; Wakeman's keyboards and Howe's guitar lines drive the song along with the guidance of singer Jon Anderson and harmonies from Chris Squire and Howe and is a pleasant enough and competent song that recalls familiar ground. Don't Kill the Whale would be chosen as the single for the record and is another Anderson/Squire number which, again, has all of the elements of familiar Yes trademarks with a lyric that is a bit more eco-conscious in its message. Madrigal is an Anderson/Wakeman collaboration that is carried by Wakeman's harpsichord accompaniment flavored by Spanish guitar from Howe and is a pretty number, although Anderson's vocal delivery seems haphazard and rushed within the tracks duration and lacks conviction.  Release, Release is a fine example of Tormato's unbalance in musical quality and this number fails to break through the typical conventions of Yes music in its intents to bring something fresh to the record; what's with the short Alan White drum flourish and overdubbed crowd banter in the middle of this track? I'm at a loss on this one as this track is basically useless and has no relevancy or continuity whatsoever. Arriving UFO is a bit cheeky lyric wise, although musically is interesting in certain parts, it hints at some unique possibilities for the group, but never quite makes it there, unfortunately. Circus of Heaven is also another track that stands out amongst many Yes fans as a complete turn off andwhile the idea from Anderson for this track is novel and cutesy(Jon's young son is featured towards the end of the number in a strange spoken section of the tracks duration), ultimately fails as well within its attempts to bring a continuity to the record, and throws consistency to the wind here.  Thankfully, the last 2 numbers touch back down and offer up some of the old Yes magic in Squire's beautiful track Onward, which features one of Anderson's best vocals on here, and the album's closer, On the Silent Wings of Freedom which is a brisk and to the fore, solid Anderson/Squire number that features all of the Yes trademark sounds: Squire's Bass propels the track, while Howe and Wakeman's perspective roles add just the right amount of musical quality along with Alan White's solid and prolific drumming skills. The bonus cuts are interesting for serious fans and some tracks could have been reworked into stronger material for the group to draw from when selecting the final tracklisting for the album; songs like Countryside, High and Picasso could have certainly added more depth and consistency to Tormato's eventual lack of cohesion, had they been refined and given the proper arrangements. But, overall, Tormato remains, for me, a time marking Yes release, and while its not a terrible record, it certainly could have been so much more than it really is. 3 stars

B000LV63SQ|4.0|Rough Mix was recorded during downtime for Townshend as the Who had commenced a year's vacation away from the road and the studio. Ronnie Lane's career since he left the Faces in '73, was floundering as his Slim Chance band had all but split by '76 and despite a brief reunion rehearsal with his old mates in the Small Faces, Lane found himself contractually bound by Atlantic records to provide product for the label, and in joining forces with Townshend, this seemed an opportune chance for Lane to boost his flagging musical career. It couldn't have happened at a better time, as it turns out, and the musical bond between Townshend and Lane proved to be a fruitful and interesting collaboration. My Baby Gives it Away leads off the record featuring Charlie Watts behind the kit on this upbeat and melodic Townshend original which provides the impetus of the modernized sound of Townshend's future Empty Glass solo album; Pete's playing is inspired as he riffs and solos his way through this excitingly bouncy upbeat number. Nowhere to Run features Lane's first contribution and is a laid-back mellow song that is complimented by John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick's delightful organ playing and Peter Hope Evans' stately harmonica accompaniment; one can hear the use of mandolin and ukelele cutting through this number and provides a humbling aspect to the album's varied musical landscapes.  Eric Clapton appears on the title track, which is a jaunty, rockin' instrumental that boogies along with some nice organ playing again from Rabbit, along with the solid bass lines of Lane underlying throughout as the pulse. Annie is a melancholic folk ballad written by Lane, which is peppered with violin and string bass adding another texture to the contemplative mood from this somber, yet touching track. Keep Me Turning is a very strong Townshend original that gives an equal amount of artistic creedence to this collection thus far and is a personal favorite of mine as this number represents Townshend, the writer, as opposed to his customary role as the leading light of the Who and gives him a chance to show a simpler more delicate side to his songcraft. Catmelody is a fun little ditty from Lane and features Watts' again on drums, along with the wild sax playing of Mel Collins(ex-King Crimson) and the boogie woogie piano playing of Ian \\"Stu\\" Stewart, that justifiably renders this number as freewheeling fun.  Misunderstood by Townshend follows and adds more fun to the proceedings as its a quirky little number which gives the odd credit to Bijou Drains-Gulp; as there is an odd effect(and if the credit is an indication, it sounds as though one's throat was miked specifically for the desired percussion effect) that gives a percussive downbeat kick in place of a conga or bass drum; a very playful number which adds to the fun that Lane and Townshend had in recording this record. April Fool is absolutely one of Ronnie Lane's best songs written and is duly one of the main tracks contained within Rough Mix's tracklist. Clapton plays dobro on this majestic track and Lane accordingly delivers one of his best vocals ever to adorn vinyl. Townshend's Street in the City is another major track as well that features a string section which broadens the depth and beauty to this masterful number and adds yet another reason as to the validity of this record.  Heart to Hang Onto features Lane and Townshend trading vocals on this Townshend original and features a track that is earthy and has a strong presence which builds upon the song's upbeat bridge section and also features a Brass arrangement from John Entwistle which compliments Rabbit's eloquent electric piano arrangement. Till All The Rivers Run Dry ends the album in a typically, wistful and laid-back country/folk manner, coupled with excellent harmonies on the song's beautiful chorus, featuring Clapton again on Dobro, complimenting Townshend's stately electric guitar breaks wonderfully. I like Rough Mix and feel it is an overlooked masterful recording from two mates whom were instrumental in the construction of British Rock and managed to create something that added further creedence to both of their separate careers. 4 and a Half stars...

B000002JSR|3.0|Coda achieves exactly what it is intended to be: a posthumous collection of selected outtakes spanning various points of Zep's 12 year career. 3 cuts are featured from the previous In Through the Out Door release; and of the 3 tracks, Wearing and Tearing is the most volatile and of interest to die-hard Zeppelin fans as its hyper-tempo is driven by the powerhouse drumming of John Bonham, with some tasty riffs and leads from Jimmy Page coupled with Robert Plant's energetic vocal delivery. Ozone Baby has a nice tempo and could've been included on the final tracklisting of Door as its main melody is attractive enough to warrant merit; while Darlene is rightfully rendered as an outtake, as its a loose and jamming type of studio-run through, but does contain some wonderful piano playing from John Paul Jones, respectively. A soundcheck performance of I Can't Quit You Baby is absolutely smoldering and eclipses the first album's version by a long mile, making Coda an almost must have simply for this track alone as Page rips through the lead breaks with absolute power and fluidity.  Poor Tom is a possible outtake from the III album sessions and is acoustically driven with the uncannny percussion backing of Bonzo that adds power and strength to this cutting-room floor number. We're Gonna Groove roars its way through as the opener of the album and makes for a fantastic beginning to this anomalous disc; although its obvious that Page took the time and care in mixing these tracks and adding subsquent overdubs, its another testament to his many talents as an arranger, musician, songwriter and producer. Some may not care for the studio wizardry of Coda, but if one considers Zeppelin's discography, one of Page's trademarks was the multi-layering of guitars which added depth to the musical repetoire of Led Zeppelin's entire studio catalogue. The next song of mention is the heavy and swift track Walter's Walk which originates from the Stargroves sessions which would later produce 73'sHouses of the Holy. Page's sinewy guitar lines are accentuated courtesy of Bonham's powerhouse kit playing and makes for an interesting track. Page paid homage to Bonham in a drumtrack John had worked on post-Presence entitled Bonzo's Montreux, which was sequenced, edited and adds some additional electronic effects in tandem with Bonham's rhythm beats. I like Coda as a posthumous collection and I feel is of interest to more serious fans of Zeppelin, if nothing, but for the curiosity factor in the unearthing of unknown tracks. 3 and a half stars
B005ZUR724|1.0|At first glance this seems like a game that has promise.  After hitting level 60 in facebook I realized that it isn't. This game is simply a port from iOS to the Kindle Fire.  There were several thousand users on facebook who leveled up their characters to 60. When the facebook app of this game was suddenly closed for unknown reasons Gameloft sent all of the users a basic \\"Oh well, so sorry\\" message and refused to provide any compensation or discount to people who wanted to migrate accounts or get SOMETHING for being dedicated to their game. Nope. All they want is for people to subscribe and then they forget about you. There are no upgrades or expansions, just a very basic MMO world.  If you get this game don't expect much in the way of developer support. It could've been a great game, but with such poor care for their dedicated customers all it deserves is 1 star.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|As I'm a guitar player, I have a special affinity for this record and highly regard Mark Knopfler as a very innovative and talented guitarist. Released at a time when the muscial climate was very trendy and disposable, Dire Straits' debut release is a breath of fresh air for a stagnating time in popular music. Don't get me wrong, I love the punk explosion that was evident at the time and I feel it gave the industry a much needed kick in arse, as far as bringing the excitement of rock and roll back to its roots in that respect, but musically, it was a movement that couldn't last. The lineup of Straits features Knopfler's brother David on rhythm guitar, bassist John Illsley and drummer Pick Withers; the album was produced by Muff Winwood and I think he captures the group in a very accomodating and comfortable setting here, within Knopfler's talents as a driving force for the band from his songwriting merits and prodigious guitar style. Down to the Waterline is the first track to introduce what would be the defining sound of the group as a whole and the ensemble performance is very tight and dexeterous, while Mark's lead vocals echo a bit of Bob Dylan in his phrasings and tonality. His guitar playing, of course, is really what drives the track and his thumb-picking style brings a warm tone with a sense of musicality that is the opposite of most virtuosos; the less is more syndrome is used to dramatic effect here and is an important aspect when regarding Knopfler's overall style.  Water of Love begins quietly with the clinking of claves and a spanish style guitar arrangement to accentuate the construction of this quiet, brooding track; its very subtle, yet also powerful in its simplicities. Setting Me Up and Southbound Again share a similar jaunty, bouncy arrangement quality within their interpretations and one can almost feel a James Burton style of influence through Knopfler's playing qualities exposed here, to a most profund effect. Six Blade Knife is a very jazz-like track that is also very subtle in its delivery, and like Water of Love before it, contains a quiet power and strength to its composition. Sultans of Swing, of course, is what propelled this record into becoming a top 10 hit and making the debut a huge success in the process. It features a very sharp driving tempo accentuated once again, by the delectable guitar passages of Knopfler's lead melodies, coupled with his song-speak style which is one of his significant trademarks; it certainly wasn't too terrible that the song hit the upper inside of the top ten in the States! In the Gallery follows and has an upbeat, steadiness in its tempo and the melody line seems to predate Communique's Once Upon A Time in the West which was the subsquent follow-up to this record; all the same, the general feel of this track is quirky and comfty in its laid-back appeal.  Wild West End has qualities of a country/folk nature introducing the beginning chords on Knopfler's 1937 National Steel guitar, giving it a touch of authenticity in its ballad-like arrangement and makes for a beauty of a recording with the back-up harmonies in the chorus, bringing everything together wonderfully in this stately written number. As the record ends on a strong note with the casual and contemplative number Lions, Dire Straits' debut record achieves nothing short of brillance and originality within its 42 min. duration and stands as a seminal album for its day and time period, that goes against the grain of the trends in music and comes out on top most successfully realized as an innovative and important artistic release. 5 stars
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|This recording is living proof that however much you polish a turd it will always remain a turd. Flat dull mundane lyrics, sung in a robotic monotone only the dreaded autotune saves it from complete disaster. If you prefer glitter and gloop to real artistry you will love it!

B0036TGSRG|4.0|This was one of my favorite films from 2010 but this is my first revisit in 2 years.  I had forgotten some of the key plot points so I was surprised to find myself caught up again in the twists and turns of the terrific political thriller.  Former British prime minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is vacationing on an unspecified island off the Massachusetts coast.  It is here that he had been writing his memoirs.  Needing help, he hires a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) to rewrite the manuscript.<br /><br />Two events conspire to complicate what appeared to be a mundane chore.  First, the initial ghost writer and friend of Lang's has turned up mysteriously drowned on the beach.  Second, a scandal has broken regarding the former PM being involved in torturing prisoners found in Pakistan.  As \\"The Ghost\\" (his only name as near as I can determine) begins his rewrite he finds a handful of clues that contradict the initial biography given to him.  There is some evidence that Lang had been recruited into politics by an American professor teaching in England who has ties to the C.I.A.  In other words, Lang may have been a puppet of the U. S. government and their war in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />Director and co-writer Roman Polanski proves he still has it.  The tension is there and of course there is a surprise at the end.  While the movie has a few unlikely threads, it is overall very well done.  This excellent Blu ray transfer came with a DVD on the flip side instead of 2 separate discs.  There are 3 special features including an interview with Polanski.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio on the Blu ray.  Both versions are in 2.35:1 aspect ratio.
0439023513|2.0|Warning: Spoilers ahead, though I tried to be as unspecific as possible regarding names and situations.<br /><br />I felt \\"Mockingjay\\" was a shadow of its predecessors in so many ways. It was cold and remote, not to mention filled with so much war talk that I, at times, found myself zoning out and skipping paragraphs of exposition, particularly in the heat of Team 451's infiltration of the Capitol. This should have been a thrilling and fast-paced section of the book, yet I found it to be some of the author's most dull and meandering writing. The first two books, despite being a complete blood bath, had tiny shreds of warmth and love and hope to propel the reader through their many horrors. We, as readers of Katniss's innermost thoughts, buy into the idea that she (and Peeta, by extension) has the drive and fortitude to do anything, overcome any obstacle. \\"Mockingjay,\\" while equally as violent, lacks all of these other elements -- we become so distanced from the characters that the story loses its momentum. We see Katniss become a pliable and pathetic character, incapable of even supporting herself let alone leading a revolution. Peeta's absence throughout most of the book lies heavy on our hearts, but when he does finally return, changed and broken, we are repulsed. Why are we repulsed, when we could be strong and believe in his inherent goodness? Because Katniss is repulsed. Even when she finally does reach out to him in Tigress's shop, it's too little too late and we've lost all hope that they will ever become special to one another in the way they once were. By the end of the story we wonder what has become of the characters we grew so attached to in the first two books -- Katniss, Peeta, Gale, even Haymitch. Not one of them propels the story significantly forward in \\"Mockingjay,\\" this being particularly noticeable during the final rebel assault on the Capitol. Why exactly did we follow Team 451 for so many pages? And what exactly did they accomplish? We read through 300-some pages of the book without Katniss doing much of anything productive, and when she does finally grab the bull by its horns at Snow's execution, it's chalked up to madness and we are whisked far away from the action to a morphling-induced finale involving Katniss's complete transformation into, of all people, her mother -- broken, empty, drifting. We are given a happy ending or at least what should pass as a happy ending, except that we've seen every one of our favourite characters either destroyed, conveniently relocated without much of an explanation, or whittled into almost nothingness. We are left with no confidence that the country has found long-lasting peace. We are dissatisfied.<br /><br />I am very relieved to know that there are others who disliked this book, too. I find myself wondering if I will bother to see \\"Mockingjay\\" in the theatre. Looking back on the book, there isn't a single moment that I care to revisit. Even Finnick's wedding, which I found to be very touching, would be horribly depressing in hindsight.<br /><br />Oh Suzanne Collins, what have you done and why on earth did your editors let you do it?ome pages of the book without Katniss doing much of anything productive, and when she does finally grab the bull by its horns at Snow's execution, it's chalked up to madness and we are whisked far away from the action to a morphling-induced finale involving Katniss's complete transformation into, of all people, her mother -- broken, empty, drifting.

There is some evidence that Lang had been recruited into politics by an American professor teaching in England who has ties to the C.I.A.  In other words, Lang may have been a puppet of the U. S. government and their war in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />Director and co-writer Roman Polanski proves he still has it.  The tension is there and of course there is a surprise at the end.  While the movie has a few unlikely threads, it is overall very well done.  This excellent Blu ray transfer came with a DVD on the flip side instead of 2 separate discs.  There are 3 special features including an interview with Polanski.  The soundtrack is DTS-HD Master Audio on the Blu ray.  Both versions are in 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

This edition of Frankenstein fits the bill perfectly. I am very pleased with the product and recommend it to anyone looking to save money while reading great literature. BHogWild
B005OK721G|5.0|This is a action filled movie with lots of drama from beginning to end. Zoe Saldana as meant to play the leading role. This movie will definitely open up many doors to come for future productions for her. Michael Vartan also is in the movie, did a excellent job. Log on & buy it!! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I saw it while visiting my beautician's salon @ an appointment & decided I had to buy it!!
B003QTUQGU|1.0|The movie kept getting blurry off and on during the movie-- we thought it was our connection but I suspect it had to do with Amazon.  We've rented from them before with good results, but this really wasted our time and money and detracted from being able to focus on the movie.  Also, we could barely make out most of what jibirish Jonny Depp was saying-- we kept saying \\"What'd he say!?!?\\"
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this to go with a helmet camera, but wanted to also use it for narration on my video editing program. Like most reviewers, I had to play with the sound processing settings to get it dialed in. And plugged into the computer, it doesn't matter whether the power switch is on or off (?). I made the mistake of ordering spare batteries based on the product description. The mike DOES NOT use CR2 batteries. It takes an L44  button battery.
1607053551|5.0|I have spent a number of years reading about various aspects of design, whether it be ceramic, typographic, or graphic in nature. Quite a number of these books are intended to give an overview of the industry and how to grasp an understanding of how to begin your own exploration. This is one of the few books that I have come across that offers a wealth of information in an easily comprehensible fashion.  The author, Kimberly Kight does an exceptional job of helping you understand the following:  *  The foundations of design and color for fabric  * The printing process for both traditional and contemporary methods  * The overall applications of fabric design and  * (Most importantly) how to go about doing it yourself, by including  tutorials and advice from practicing designers  I wish more DIY books were like this one. She leaves you with an enthusiasm to begin you're own designs and to share what you've learned. I highly recommend A Field Guide to Fabric Design.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I'm a pretty huge rush fan and have been since about 1974. I've also been around enough to realize Rush is as fantastic at marketing themselves as they are musicians. They are notorious at generating revenue by making a DVD of every concert, interview, etc. they do. Which doesn't make them evil, just good business men. However it has to be very good quaility any more for me to spring for their \\"latest\\" tour on DVD.  With that being said I've owned so many rush concerts on DVD to understand that they all start to look and sound the same.  I was able to see them twice live during the Snakes and Arrows tour and also during the latest Time Machine tour. I received both DVD's in Blueray as Christmas presents just because I'm known as Rush junky among family and friends. I was especially looking forward to the Time Machine disk and I was very happy to receive it as it was every bit as good as I expected and in my opinion the best Rush concert I had seen.  However I then watched the Snakes and Arrows disk and was completly blown away! The audio and video quality of the both concerts were excellent but, Snakes and Arrows was just superior in my opinion. The content is very long! It actually is so long that I've watched in a couple of times and both times I had to break it up because there is so much content. If I had to throw away all of my Rush concerts and keep just one it would be Snakes and Arrows on Blueray!

B006GHA9VQ|3.0|I saw this production in Melbourne in December. Not the best thing I've ever seen, but, certainly not the worst thing I've ever seen either ( That's reserved for The Little Mermaid and Spamalot ). The costumes and sets were amazing and there were some decent musical numbers, but my 2 complaints are 1) Although Love Never Dies is a good song, ALW totally ripped himself off by taking this exact song from his musical The Beautiful Game and changing the title and lyrics, which in turn, he took from a song that was sung at his 50th birthday concert that at the time he proclaimed was something he wrote for what he hoped would be a sequel to The Phantom of the Opera. Come on, Man! You couldn't have come up with a new song? It might have made it back to where you had originally intended, but, you've already used it! And 2) This is a needless sequel that never should nor needed to be written! With that being said I will be adding this BluRay to my collection because it's a nice keepsake of my trip to AU and it wasn't terrible. It just won't get many repeat viewings. And this is one show we probably will never see here in the States.
0374275637|5.0|Kahneman provides tremendously informative and accessible explanations of how we behave and make decisions that are, truly, startling.  He uses simple analogies and examples that illustrate what drives our behavior---ranging from why we are so quick to judge to why we hate to lose money.  His ideas and theories are developed and organized for anyone who has an interest in understanding how we go about making every choice in our lives.  Most of the chapters are quite well-written and easy, I would think, for most anyone to appreciate.  I will re-read this book many times because, as he describes it, our brains are literally 'hard-wired' to (often) lead us to faulty or less than ideal conclusions and choices. The frameworks he provides will have application and utility for a reader in every aspect of their life. One of the most insightful books that I have picked up in quite some time.  I highly recommend reading it!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've been looking for a puzzle game like this and it's finally here! So much fun!

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Given how comic book films seem to be hit or miss, I was a little nervous when I went to see this for the first time, afraid that I would come away disappointed. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This story delves into the origins of the X-Men, and how Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr, two men with extraordinary abilities but differing philosophies on mutants' roles in the world, form an uneasy alliance and start up a school for other \\"gifted\\" ones like them. Opposing them is Sebastian Shaw, played by Kevin Bacon, who seeks to pit humans against each other and have them wipe each other out, freeing himself and mutants like him to rule the world. All the performances here are pretty solid, but James McAvoy, as Xavier, and Michael Fassbender, as Lehnsherr, are absolutely brilliant, and Bacon shines as their main nemesis. And a movie featuring people with a wide range of special abilities makes for a lot of very cool effects, all of which are very well done(I highly recommend getting this on Blu-Ray if you can). The story ends leaving you wanting more, for good reason; there are two more movies coming in this story arc, and if this first one is any indication, they will be great as well. Whether you're a long-time X-Men fan like me, or are new to the saga, this is a great add to your movie collection and is a good starting point for newbies. Buy it!
B000I0QM0E|4.0|I've long been a fan of the Sleepy Hollow story as well as Tim Burton's films, so this was a must-get for me. Johnny Depp shines as the eccentric Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci is great as the beautiful, mysterious Katrina Van Tassel. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Ian McDiarmid(of Star Wars fame) in a supporting role, as well as a cameo by Christopher Lee. As for the story, Burton does take a few liberties with it, but still makes it very enjoyable. And of course, he adds his own brand of twisted, zany happenings that make the hour and 45 minutes a very fun ride (and if you can get this in Blu-Ray, I highly recommend it!). If you're a fan of the Sleepy Hollow story and/or a fan of Tim Burton's work, add this movie to your collection. You won't regret it!

161293028X|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, A. Conan Doyle<br /><br />These are the first twelve short stories about the most famous detective in fiction. They were written in the 1890s when illumination came from fire (candles, oil lamps, and gas). Local travel was by horse or foot. No telephones. Technology has advanced but human nature remains the same. The character of `Sherlock Holmes' was inspired by Doctor Joseph Bell, the famous medical professor in Edinburgh Scotland. Reading the original stories reminds you how good they are, much better than the many imitators. Greed is the motive for most of these stories. I wonder how many were adapted from long forgotten true crime cases?<br /><br />A Scandal in Bohemia. A big, tall man visits Holmes on a secret mission. This nobleman is in a photograph with an actress, and this can endanger an arranged dynastic marriage. Holmes is given £1,000 for expenses [a small fortune then]. Holmes uses a trick to find a hidden valuable object.<br />The Red-Headed League. A man with blazing red hair visits Holmes with his problem of a lost well-paying job. Holmes visits his shop on a side street. A watch at night catches the burglar and saves the bank its fortune in French gold. Holmes explains his deductions. A man who works for half-wages?<br />A Case of Identity. A young woman wants to find a missing fianc&eacute; who disappeared before their wedding. Holmes figures out the fraud and why it was done. The law can't touch this scoundrel. [The impressions of a typewriter can identify each unique machine.]<br /><br />The Boscombe Valley Mystery. Charles McCarthy was found dead by a lake, his son James was arrested as a suspect. Holmes thinks the son is innocent, but has a secret. Holmes studies the crime scene and collects the clues, then identifies the murderer. James was acquitted, a confession did not have to be used. Justice was served, not the law.<br />The Five Orange Pips. A young man visits Holmes for advice. He tells what happened to his uncle and father. Now he received the same message. Can Holmes save him and catch those responsible. Or will they answer to a higher power?<br />The Man With the Twisted Lip. Kate Whitney visits Dr. Watson about her missing husband, an opium addict. Watson finds her husband, then joins Holmes in a search for Neville St. Clair. Only a professional beggar could know what happened to him! Holmes succeeds in locating the missing man.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. A man lost his hat and a goose in a street fight. Can the owner be found? The goose was cooked, the rightful owner received a replacement. Will an innocent man be convicted for a theft? No. Holmes shows mercy.<br />The Adventure of the Speckled Band. A young woman consults Holmes about her fears, her older sister died earlier. Why was her bedroom changed? What makes her stepfather so fierce? [Mad as a hatter?] Helen's life is saved, the guilty person falls into his own trap.<br />The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb. A murderous attack severed the thumb of a young hydraulic engineer. He tells his story to Holmes. He was offered high pay for a few hours of work in secret. He had a narrow escape! Holmes takes him to Scotland Yard and they go to Eyford. But it is too late, the criminals escaped capture.<br /><br />The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor. Lord St. Simon asks Holmes for advice on a runaway bride. Was there anything in her past to cause this? Holmes solves this mystery by following a back trail. [What does this say about the nobility?]<br />The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet. A tall, portly man visits Holmes. This banker loaned £50,000 to a nobleman who gave a beryl coronet as security. After it partly disappeared a relative was arrested. Can Holmes recover the lost gems and solve the crime? Yes, he explains what was overlooked. The guilty party will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.<br />The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. A young woman asks for advice on changing jobs, she is offered very good pay. But she must cut her long hair short. Weeks later she sent a telegram to Holmes asking for help. Holmes arrives to solve the mystery. There is a happy ending.er she sent a telegram to Holmes asking for help. Holmes arrives to solve the mystery. There is a happy ending.

0525478817|5.0|Yeah, this one pretty much bowled me over, almost from the get-go.  I've read all three of Green's other books, and enjoyed them all in slightly varying degrees, but I can say right up front that this work takes his actual writing, the poetic crafting of his sentences, the unforced gravity and feeling of his ideas, to an entirely different plateau.  I have to admit, in the previous three books, it's sometimes been tempting to write off his characters (especially the male narrators) as unrealistic \\"prodigies,\\" thinly-veiled externalizations of Green's very developed, adult mind into a young adult framework.  In this book, however, both Hazel (Green's refreshing first attempt at a female narrator) and Augustus are amazingly developed.  Their high-concept banter and well-turned inner thoughts come off as honest, engaging reflections, not impositions on believability; they make you have hope for the ability of today's youth to, as Green wonderfully say it, \\"imagine people more complexly.\\" This is even more admirable for the fact that every line and event works towards establishing solid themes of death, loss of self, and the need to \\"matter\\"/leave a legacy for the living.  Even just from reading the book jacket, we know how all of this is going to end; into this scenario rife with despair and pain, Green throws in love like a time bomb, and we watch how these characters pass it back and forth, keeping it aloft until the very end; and it's both totally expected and totally devastating whose hands it goes off in.  The characters resist all cliched tropes about love overcoming death, instead using it to propel the living forward into making greater realizations about themselves and their place in the world.  Augustus's letter to van Houten about Hazel at the end of the book is tear-jerking and unmercifully good.  This book also seems like it has a smaller focus of characters than the other books, and that's all to the better.  The stuff with Peter van Houten and his assistant is great; I love how Green has no pride in making the only author in the book a slovenly, drunken ass (as if cautioning his fans not to equate love of books with love of their authors).  Isaac is a great character, with all the things that his blindness allows us to explore.  The trophy-smashing scene, making out in Anne Frank's house...all of it with a sheen of hard-won honesty (through revision, I expect) and efficiency; not a word, or thought, is wasted.  Just a beautiful book, one that I think could transcend its genre into the \\"classic\\" realm.  Thank you, John Green, and as always...  DFTBA!
0307269752|1.0|Where was Larsson's editor? A good editor would have tossed about 50% or more of this book's verbiage. It's not a bad story, with a few interesting characters. The central plot, about an apparent murder and the oddball characters who advance and impede its solution, is mildly interesting. But that plot is sandwiched by a boring, pointless framing story about a libel lawsuit, a magazine, revenge for the lawsuit, and dozens of unanswered phone calls. (Why doesn't anyone ever pick up the phone when this guy calls?)<br /><br />I don't know if the Reader's Digest still publishes condensed versions of popular books, but this novel is ideal for their treatment: Toss the first 100 and the last 100 pages into the trash. Pencil out the tedious product placements (BMW cars! I-Books! Coca-Cola! IKEA!). Slice away the details of the central character's every meal, shopping trip, neighborhood stroll and unanswered phone call. Finally, expunge the characters who do nothing to advance the plot (I'm talkin' to you, Cecilia). Now, the book might be worth reading. Until then, not so much.
B003Y5H51K|1.0|The underwater cave setting of this film couldn't obscure the fact that it contains just about every movie cliche known to Hollywood. (Thank you James Cameron). About 10 minutes into this drama, you'll get the feeling that you've seen it all before. You have - just above ground. The dialogue is silly, the acting is poor, and the character's actions throughout the film defy all semblance of logic. Everyone dies in the end, and by the time you get there, you really won't care.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|This is an engrossing read - I can't wait for the author's next book. It's a sensual and rich tapestry of a book -  it feels like a luxurious pleasure to read - and while it's witches and vampires, it's not dark or depressing, it will leave you cheering for the main characters -

B004WCTLNY|1.0|This movie  was astonishingly dumb.  It was a lot like Inception in that it really thinks it's clever and deep, which it is if you're 12 years old.  If it had been marketed as a comedy, I would have given it three stars, but sadly everyone in the movie isn't kidding.  Movies this bad make you question the intelligence of the people who agree to make them, which is too bad, because I really like the cast, particularly Emily Blunt.

B00417HV14|5.0|First of all, my Yamaha receiver says this is DTS-HD Master Audio sent from my Sony Blu ray player.  Previous reviewers have suggested it is not.  The booklet and the disc label says DTS 5.1 Surround but it sounds uncompressed to me and I'll believe the decoded electrical signal as displayed.  In any case it sounds great.<br /><br />While I've heard and read about this 34 year old guy, to my knowledge I've not heard or seen him play until now.  That will change.  He's terrific.  Bonamassa is a Californian who started playing professionally at about 13.  He had always dreamed of playing with his idol, Eric Clapton and playing Albert Hall.  He does both here in this 2009 concert.  Backed by 2 killer drummers, a bass guitarist, a keyboard player and a 3 man horn section, Bonamassa rocks the house with his mostly blues-rock sound.  He plays about 8 or 9 different guitars and puts his stamp on each one.<br /><br />While it's all good a demo combo selection is \\"Just Got Paid\\" and one on the \\"extras\\" called \\"Woke Up Dreaming.\\"  The later is a solo acoustic guitar selection opposed to the hard rocking end to his show (before encore).  Both are guitar shredding at its best.  While the crowds at Albert Hall always seem sedate compared to American audiences, they listen in their seats then roar to approval at the end of each number.  The direction in this concert film is first rate.  No quick cuts or edits.  The focus is on the instruments and the musicians.  The DTS-HD Master Audio is thunderous when cranked up.  And you will want to crank it up.

B005TUD2BK|4.0|This review is for the DVD itself and not the movie (5 stars) I bought this item for Christmas, having been disappointed that WB didn't offer a nice Deathly Hallows part 1 and part 2 combo boxset. (I waited to buy both movies for just a Gringotts slipcover?!) While I am happy to have the movie in 3 different formats, this set offers nothing in extras/bonus features. I also bought this copy for the digital copy. HOWEVER, when I went to redeem my code, I was hit with an error code all 10 times I tried to download it. Long story short, iTunes admitted there was a glitch with the file and has removed it from their store. I was sent a new redemption code when the movie become available. As of 2/4/2012, the file was still not available for purchase or download.

0345505387|3.0|This is my first time reading a graphic novel and although the art work is beautiful I'm not sure if the quality of the story is the fault of the writer or just what's possible in such a form. I found it a bit flat emotionally. I did not believe their relationship. The books are ten times the quality of story telling. Perhaps it's because Diana writes fascinating details about the lives of her characters and that's what her readers love. The smells, the tastes, the emotion, the historical facts. All contribute to make her books so popular.

B006P0FD4W|4.0|There are only two ways you can feel about this movie; you will either really like it or you will want your money/time back - I'm of the former camp but I do understand why some have not liked this movie.  Basically you have to be invested in the story and it's a good one.  In PA #1 and PA #2 we have two sisters who slowly come to realize that there is something supernatural going on in their homes.  It's alluded that something happened in their childhood, something they seem to have forgotten about or buried in their memories that might be linked to what is going on in their homes.  Each installment of the Paranormal series has a reason why their homes are being video taped and PA #3 is no exception.  In PA #3, we are taken back to the sisters as little girls, living with their Mom and stepfather.  In short time, strange things start to happen, loud unexplained noises, movement, and Toby, who is Kristi's imaginary playmate.  The stepfather videos weddings for a living and knows a lot about cameras so he sets up a 24/7 surveillance of the house in all rooms.  In the kitchen having a camera panning left to right you might think the most horrifying reveal might be dirty dishes in the sink but you get much more than that.  As always this PA movie has it's viewers trained to always be on guard.  This is one of those movies that you might have to watch  through little spaces between your fingers as you peek through your hands as they cover your eyes.  I've glad I don't remember the trailer for this movie because I understand many viewers were upset that most of these scenes were not included in the actual movie.  Where this movie fails is that it's way too short and even though this is a horror film it's also a mystery and it sort of cheapens #3 in that you know so much is left out so they can make PA #4.  All in all, this movie delivered in making me sleep with the lights on and steering clear of kids who introduce me to a playmate I can't see.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Before you purchase anything else for your Nikon, before you buy expensive lenses, before you buy your next memory card...buy this speedlight.  Sure, it's a lot of money, but it's not as much as the SB900/910, and it has better controls.  I said it, better controls.  Don't waste your time or money with another speedlight out there, whether it by from Metz, Vivitar, Yongnuo, or any other maker.  The way this one talks to your CLS capable Nikon DSLR make it worth every penny.  I spent nearly $1300 USD on my [[ASIN:B0042X9LCO Nikon D7000 16.2MP DX-Format CMOS Digital SLR with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens]], another $700 on another lens, and the addition of this [[ASIN:B0042X9L6A Nikon SB-700 AF Speedlight]] made that setup shine.  I could have bought better glass, but it wouldn't have the performance boost that this speedlight gave me.  The two units talk to each other in ways that will improve your shots tremendously.  The flash shuts down with the camera, and comes alive when the camera does.  Overall, the best accessory you can buy for your Nikon.
B005DESVPO|4.0|Enjoyed the short CD but am looking forward to new work by this artist. It is definitely worth a listen to and hopefully there will be more to come in the near future.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|When I fist saw a promo for Boardwalk Empire on Foxtel cable TV, I knew I had to await the arrival of the DVD on Amazon,as I didn't have the movie channel designated to showing it, in my package. It was obvious this would be something special. The total \\"look\\" of the series, the clean cut clear camera shots,the wonderful detailed backdrops, the lighting,and superb costuming are all the ingredients that made the BBC peerless with their period dramas. HBO series' are proving to be every bit as alluring,and entertaining. The Sopranos was testament to that.  Now Director Martin Scorcese - the man who made so many unforgettable movies with DeNiro in the 70's, and many others after that - is back doing what he knows best, a study of American life,this time in the magical prohibition era.  Steve Buscemi dominates Boardwalk Empire in Series 1, portraying the lead character Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson who runs Atlantic city with a firm hand.  Nucky is part gangster,part politician who overseers speakeasies, gambling,men's clubs and prostitution. He also takes care of the the battlers upon whose vote at election time he calls in to support the candidates of his choosing. Nothing happens without him knowing about it, and he is backed up by an odd collection of men. His own brother,Elias (Eli) - played by Shea Wigham -  is a surly character who has a high position in the police department,and keeps his brother informed with what is going on within the department - giving Nucky an inside edge on his competitors.  Unfortunately, Eli is suffering from the chronic disease of jealousy, and this eats away at him, especially when he has to rely on Nucky to get him reelected as Eli doesn't have the leadership qualities,character,and charisma of his brother. This is the wound that festers throughout series 1 and will no doubt be dealt with at some level in Series 2.  There are some outstanding performances in Boardwalk Empire that deserve being noted. Michael Pitt (always with the same haircut regardless of the role he is playing) is Jimmy Darmody, a dangerous character who can change from being gentle,kind,vulnerable, to a vicious cruel mobster in the blink of eye. He has returned from WW1 an emotionally broken man, and his behaviour becomes more erratic as the story progresses.  Michael Shannon plays Agent Nelson Van Alden,a taxation officer who crosses the line by thinking the wrath of God should be brought down on the heads of these people involved in speakeasies,flop houses,and prostitution. He believes he has been designated by God to see they are all punished. Despite being pulled into line more than once by his superiors,Van Alden is obsessed with the evil he sees and becomes fixated on Mrs Schroeder, a widow with two small children,who is befriended by Nucky Thompson and later becomes his mistress.  Kelly Macdonald,a Glaswegian born actor, gives an excellent performance as Mrs Schroeder. Gretchen Mol shines as Gillian Darmody - Jimmy's mother and a woman who has been around enough powerful men in her life to know how they think.  And finally, Paz de la Huerta who is outstanding as Lucy Danziger,a prostitute who loves the good life, which her man Nucky Thompson can easily provide. Her confusion at being replaced by Mrs Schroeder was superbly enacted by de la Huerta, as she tries to regain her former standing.  Gangsters from Chicago and New York are eyeing off Atlantic city as being the next place for them to expand their own business interests. The young, fearless newcomers with names such as Capone,Luciano and Rothstein realise that Nucky runs Atlantic city and he is too smart for them to topple - yet. The next series promises some interesting confrontations. I look forward to it.

B0070Z4M4I|2.0|Don't waste your time on this dumbed down teen version of a great classic movie, the original Black & White version was a masterpiece but not for everyone as it is dated and most of the action is actually off screen as it was impossible to do the special effects in those days.<br /><br />The 80's remake by John Carpenter was a sci-fi masterpiece, acting, casting,special effects, brilliant music score, and next to the chest-burster scene in the first Alien movie probably some of the scariest & original scenes ever shot. Carpenter's script is much closer to the book too, Carpenter is a bit like James Cameron, he knows how to tell a really good story as well as scare the bejesus out of us at the same time.<br /><br />This version is dreck, it looks like they took the Stepford cast from a Macy's clothing sale catalogue, pretty, but dumb as rocks with dialalogue to match.
B005T87QCI|5.0|five stars for its amazing high def and its cool robots and places its cool exiting and fun ad funky

B0000C83YJ|5.0|Boy George is a highly underrated singer (In my opinion). He's has a very soulful voice. Which makes his songs just as appealing on top 40 rock/pop and R&B stations. He was part of the New Jack Swing (mentioned by name in the song about NJS). He's a singular talent, and unfortunately because of his lifestyle he tends to be sidelined unnecessarily. The 80's were a different time, and someone like Boy George embodied the times very well. He was different, in a weird way, stylish and of course he has that great voice. I know some people  may object to the fact that he's gay, but if you think about it, he's never hidden the fact, he's always been upfront about it. So it's not like there were deep dark secrets that were revealed, it's just because of intolerance that people tend to look at the lifestyle over the quality of his music. Unfortunately though, it was his drug usage that caused the most problems in his life, and has at times threatened to take him out of the game. So really, his being gay has never been an issue for me, but the drug issues worried me. He has too much talent to waste that way. Now on to the music.With a slew of top 40 hits, such as Karma Chameleon (great lyrics) It's a miracle, Church of a Poison Mind, and Miss me Blind, it seemed he took the radio by storm. But upon closer listen to the album there was even more great songs (that may or may not have been radio hits) such as \\"that's the way (I'm only trying to help you) which is one of my all time favorites and the starkly beautiful \\"Victims\\". This version also has five bonus songs, and unlike other remastered series, these songs are welcome and do not weigh down the album with overdone remixes or third party versions of their famous songs. I am really quite impressed with the quality of the sound of this cd. Having owned this album on Vinyl (yes, I am that old) and cassette (for my Walkman...remember those?) I am very grateful to have found this cd, it actually was released right around the time I went looking for their albums on cd. A Wonderful Coincidence. Anyone who is a fan of the 80s or of great r&b/pop vocalists will love this album. I Highly recommend it.
B004I744AS|4.0|great free app for kindle. fun too. I check out the matchup every day. the horiscope is a bit much though.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|don't want this game to end, challenges you puzzle skills and memory! I recommend this game for older kids to adults, best game app I ever got

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Premise: Sophia Parsons is a young women in  who has to deal with diversity because she is a Wiccan. Not only that, but she also has a constant static in her head that drives her to distraction. To try and stop this static Sophia does a ritual. However, all it does is release the skeletons in the family closet and introduce her to the supernatural world hidden beneath the mortal one.  The Good:  Wicca: A book with  Wiccans. There need to be more of these!  Style: Rebecca seamlessly combines Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance with Literary elements into a new genre called Paranormal Fantasy. Well, at least I felt there were Lit qualities, but I don't read a whole lot of Literary Fiction.  Worldbuilding: Rebecca is brilliantly twisted the myths of already existing creatures and created her own critters that have me intrigued. I love the use the five elements in relation to creatures. Her world pulled me in to the point I regretted having to leave when the book ended.  Characters: I loved Sophia. She was intelligent and strong willed. Even though she had a lot to be afraid of, she didn't give in to her fear. Also she had this humorous voice that wasn't over the top. Lately, in a lot Urban Fantasy books I am seeing a trend with a overly snarky first person voice. Sophia did not have this. She was funny but it didn't saturate the story. Also, I was drawn into Sophia and her emotions. The supporting characters are well rounded and multidimensional. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses.  The Bad: I only have one small nitpick. There are points in the story I felt could have been elaborated, but for the pacing and length's sake, I can understand why they weren't.  Overall: I loved this book. For a while I have been struggling to find books in Urban Fantasy that have kept me interested. I have stopped reading  several novels from the major publishing houses because I felt they were bland and overdone. The Forever Girl kept me hooked until the very end.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|In mono form, this musical set is still the best.  Quite fascinating is the detailed packaging involved.  Emphasis seems to be placed on the minimalist design espoused by the great artisits of Japan, where this set was made, and quite notably by the late, leading co-founder and former CEO of Apple Computer, Steve Jobs. Inside the near-perfect, almost cubic container are the CD's of Beatles recordings done in mono. Individually, the package of each CD is tightly wrapped in plastic film. Within is a miniature replica of the original albums issued back in the 1960's but in digital, not vinyl, format.  The many, fine layers containing the contents are quite exquisite, and if one were to choose a CD-boxed set solely on the basis of the proverbial cover, The Beatles in Mono would be a bestseller.  However, more important than what's on the outside is the substance of the inside material. And that is the best part of the deal.  Whether it's lo-fi, hi-fi, or WI-FI, it's The Beatles!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Features a clean, minimal interface; no ads; easy sharing; great shortcuts; and more. I've used several feed reader apps and this by far is the best.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|Moving, funny, tearjerker, awesome. We need more movies like this one. I loved it. Wish more men would stand up and be accountable, Faith filled leaders. It inspired me to strive for a deeper walk and more accountability in my life. We have a serious Father vaccume in this world and we all are suffering for it, especialy our children. I also love how The movie shows God's provision in miraculous ways.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|This documentary, narrated by Matt Damon, is a hard hitting look at who, and not just what, caused the economic collapse of 2008. This is not a democrat hack job. Members of both parties are equally skewered for their part of the crisis. The film shows that the crisis was no accident, that many players in the top echelons of major banking, academia and government were quite aware of what was happening or what could happen, but were more then enthusiastic to endorse dangerous and unethical policies as long as they benefited from them financially or ideologically. And benefit they did, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars of which the American Taxpayer, and millions of unemployed, have to pay the price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game....101 in 1...great game that keeps me playing... and they tease you by because you have beat games to play other games.
0060873027|1.0|Count me among those who did not finish this very weak novel. I got to around page 180, doggedly plowing through the cliches and preposterous plot elements. I kept hoping that it would improve, because I like others have read and enjoyed many Crichton novels. I then came here and started perusing the other readers' reviews, and realized that my hopes for this book salvaging itself in the second half were in vain.<br /><br />I felt obligated to post yet another caution to stay away from this book, since I myself benefited from others' negative views of it. I won't go into detail other than to say this: the basic premise of people being shrunk down to a half inch tall is so ridiculous that it needs to be couched in either a lot of enjoyable whimsy, or in very strong and compelling writing. This book has neither. You've been warned.
B005HSL626|2.0|when I first got the app it was working perfectly but after a little while I would try to play it and it would crashe in the middle of my game. I recomend saving up some money and getting the full version.
B004ZN9ERI|2.0|Most of this is mid-to-late 60's pretentious garbage to my ears. Sorry. As unenjoyable as venereal disease, except less catchy. At this time the Beatles, Stones, Hollies, Kinks & The Who, and seriously hundreds of other rock and pop acts were putting out material so far more imaginative and superior to this. It makes me cringe to realize that PINK FLOYD (or 'The Pink Floyd' as they appear to be calling themselves at this point) would evolve into one of the greatest band of the 1970s and early 1980s, once they morphed out of what ever this was supposed to be. How could the All Music Guide scribes anoint this terrible album as the place to start for Floyd newbies and high light of Pink Floyd's storied arsenal of ground breaking records? Most of the \\"Piper\\" LP is barely tuneful and so rarely hits any mark. It is trippy, excessive and void of any semblance of songwriting control. I love many of the things the post-Barrett Floyd would come out with up until Gilmore departed, but can not recommend this even as a historical relic.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played in my life stop talking about ads all games have flaws

B000FC0V3E|5.0|I have come across wide and varied responses to this novel.  Some positive, some indecisive & some negative.  Those who criticize this particular work, say things like: \\"But it's not about anything.\\"  Or \\"Nothing actually happens in the story.\\"  This is not cheap escapism for mindless hacks, this literature at its finest.  This novel reveals Hemingway's sublime gift as writer.  If you cannot recognize the beauty and skill in this work, then I suggest you do not attempt to read his other books either, you won't like them.

0312576463|2.0|I listened to Freedom in its Audible format.I agree with the reviewer who characterized this novel as like The Corrections, but without the humor which saved that book. These characters were so tiresome. They were like bad, boring houseguests who won't leave. Yet I plowed through to the end. I truly can't say why.  The best part of the book, and the reason I bought it, was the initial chapter which had been an enjoyable short story in The New Yorker. Unfortunately, it's downhill from there.  Mr. Franzen has published some excellent, interesting, thoughtful essays (also in The New Yorker)in which he speaks of friends and acquaintances with warmth and sympathy. Alas, his novels are far too long and I can't think of a single character in them about whom he actually seems to care.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|To remember a movie this bad, you would have to go back to Con Air staring Nicolas Cage.  There were so many ackward silences, and weird cinematics... I could not wait for this movie to end.. I wish i could get a refund.. I would rather have watched 2 hours of CSPAN looking an a empty conference room...  You would not want to be friends with anyone who liked this movie as there would be something seriously wrong with them.  If i could, i would banish the producer, the writer, etc.. everyone involved in this movie from ever releasing another movie.
B0006J28BO|5.0|And that is the good Quality of Animated Moves. Whis this item you can have this. A story for the Old and Joung ho have never stopt Dreaming and ready for a Fantasy. If you somewone like that then you can risk a peek.
B00026WU82|5.0|For those interested in Bob Dylan, the history of rock music, US history in the 1960's this record is an excellent reference. It is an innovative masterpiece for a few reasons: (1) to my ear it invents a modern rock music sound that fused folk, blues and rock 'n' roll with an intensity, density and texture that can't be found prior to the record's release in July/August 1965. The Beatles, Rolling Stones, later the Who, the Band and Bruce Springsteen would all change their sounds (the Beatles and Rolling Stones becoming more bluesy and less poppy) or adopt the sound that comes out of this record; and, (2) it fuses lyrical sophistication with a rock'n'roll beat. Bob Dylan's singing is expressive, the music is vibrant and the playing excellent.
B003F3FJQO|1.0|I am crushed.<br />I really loved the Maze Runner.<br />The Scorch Trials was nothing to rave about.<br />I grew tired of the \\"trials\\" and the mystery went further down the rabbit hole. The book added up to nothing.<br />There is no answer and this book did nothing but make me mad for being hoodwinked by the first book.<br />Buyer beware.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Absolutely Great CD.  I love it from beginning to end.  I actually went back and purchased Back to Black which is fabulous too.  Fran S.
B00005JPO1|2.0|I decided to write this review while looking for the blu-ray versions of the first three movies of the Indiana Jones series. That said I almost bought all four movies on regular DVD, but then I thought, \\"Wait? I never want to see Crystal Skull again.\\"  There are a few reasons why the most recent, and hopefully last, installment of the Indiana Jones series is not good. First, the antagonists in this movie (Russians? c'mon people) were not hateable. I know that's not a word, but they were pretty lukewarm villains let's be honest. Kate Blanchett's accent was really bad so her credibility as a bad guy was gone. Basically, you did not have the sort of evil that you had in the first three movies. In the first three you had Nazis (how can you get more evil than that?) and Amrish Puri as Mola Ram who plays a crazy cult leader who rips peoples hearts out. The fourth movie just failed to capture the good versus evil, david v. goliath matchup of the previous films.  Second, and most important in my mind, the ending of the movie was completely absurd. Aliens? Really? Indiana Jones does not deal with aliens. He's an archeologist that runs into some spiritual/mythic forces that allow for no scientific explanation. Up until the end the movie was watchable and could have had some value had the ending not involved aliens. Of course, it's a Spielberg film and that's all that interests him apparently. This ending was as big a flop ending as the ending in A.I. in that it was so bad it was almost funny.  I will not ever watch this movie again voluntarily, and I only rated the movie two starts because I liked the dynamic between Indy and Mutt.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I swapped the stock cooler on my AMD Phenom II X4 960T Zosma with this and it great. My cpu idles around 30c even after unlocking 2 extra cores and overclocking to 3.6GHz.  Pros:  -Keeps your CPU cooled.  -Great price.  Cons:  -Confusing instructions. Just throw away the paper that comes in the box and look on youtube for a tutorial.  -It's huge, so make sure your case can hold it.
B001CZVVVE|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD.  Others have commented on the details so I will not duplicate.  It is a performance you will want to watch over and over again.  Anna Netrebko is the star of the evening but the other 3 are top notch singers so I give them all 5 stars and it is always a pleasure to have Marco Armiliato conducting.  He does an excellent job without making a spectacle of himself like some other conductors do.  Great selection of music with some unknowns to me which have now become favourites.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have to say that I probably bought the FiiO E5 for a slightly different purpose than most people ordering this. I have been using it as a line out MP3 ampflier to hook directly into a couple of my old hardware music samplers through the use of a [[ASIN:B000068O3C Hosa CMP153 Y Cable 1/8 Inch TRS to Dual 1/4 Inch TS Cable - 3 Foot]] cables. My primary use is because I wanted to find a convenient way to sample from my MP3 player without having to run it through a clunky mixer or preamp. So far the FiiO does an admirable job. It doesn't make the music overwhelmingly loud but it does boost the signal enough so that the balanced inputs of my MPC and Yamaha sampler don't have any noticeable grounding noise (humm) that usually comes from going from an unbalanced (mp3 player, cd, etc) output to a balanced line (professional mixer, keyboard, other gear). As far as a general headphone Amplifier, I have used it with my [[ASIN:B001RB24R8 Sony MDR-XB300 Extra Bass Headphones]] and in this department it does a pretty good job as well, I've used it with an old 2nd gen Ipod Nano and a new [[ASIN:B005FVNGRS SanDisk SDMX22-004G-A57K Sansa Clip Zip 4 GB (Black)]] and so far so good, it kind of adds a little bit of analog warmth to the music coming out of the MP3 players (in my opinion). Anyway I've only had it for about 2 weeks or so and so far no issues others have reported on, I'll keep updates posted and add pictures soon....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this helps to pass time especially because of the wide variety of games and unlocking new games makes me.feel like I'm achieving something in life.
B0063T12RM|5.0|Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost!<br /><br /> PINA (2011) WIN Winders:<br /><br /> The great people transmuted simple action into art. Who said that Midas was a man? Wasn't she Phillipa \\"Pina\\" Bausch?<br />  I invite you to see this film, a poem in motion, and if you're like me, that when you get excited, you cry, take enough tissue napkins, or clean socks, adsorbent gloves, all of that because  the scenes of Pina are sublime, and when the epiphany bursts, usually target to the tear glands.<br />  The choreographic capacity of Pina Bausch was unusual. She agglomerates the dancers, in one being with legs, bodies and arms in perfect synchronicity, sometimes it is a binary being, men and women, spilling emotions though their bodies.  Her love of painting, leads to choreographic design like canvas, with brushstrokes perfectly designed, and time to rehearsal, which use to create elements of surprise, with shades of wonder and uncertainty.<br />Pina passed away five days after being diagnosed with cancer at age 68, Win Winders, the director of this film in 3D, was about to stop all the production. But Pina`s companions, dancers, and family, at least his son Solomon, and the people who admired her  \\"Tanstheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch\\" fans', asked for to keep the project on, that did not stop the work of this dream-maker film director Win Winders. The result of adding two geniuses in one film, this two wonderful human beings that were born around Dresden, in East Germany, is a masterpiece of art, with the only cualification of superlatively emotional.<br />  From the time I saw the movie \\"Nosthalgia\\" of my admired Andrei Tarkovsky, I had not felt so excited and ecstatic, for a film of any genre, until now. This movie produces inside me a sense of epiphany. Because it is full of synthetic visions of the contemporary world, that of course is not new.<br />  Dancers participating in the documentary - although hard to circumscribe this film only in a work of this genre -. Describes Pina Bausch in their words, sad and excited, they felt already nostalgia for her.  I got the impression that those professionals dancers, they were depicted a kind of goddess of body movement, sets and themes linked to superb choreography poems, which implies an amazing level of cognitive complexity.<br />  Their scenarios were unusual, for example in \\"Vollmond\\", the performance was develop on brown earth, in there a group of women have a horror and attraction as well, for a red nightie, while the men leader claims, that to be part of the dowry of the woman who will choose.<br />  In another work of Pina: \\"Caf&eacute; M&uuml;ller\\", that she used to be part of, Pina dance with her eyes closed, while a man is removing the tables and chairs. Pina tell us, in an off narration, that this scene, when she opened his eyes at the end of the work, she was transformed.<br />  The choreographer also participated as an actress with film director Federico Fellini in his movie \\"And the Ship Sails?\\" As the Princess Lherimia.<br />  Pina Bausch received several awards throughout her career, such as the \\"Laurence Oliver\\" in Britain, in the prize \\"Kyoto\\" in Japan and the Goethe Prize in Frankfurt Germany<br /> This year the film on Pina, is already nominated for several awards, and at least four of his works will be on stage in celebration of the \\"Olympics\\" in London, 2012.<br />  The use of basic elements, women and old men, the dynamic law of gravity, as the antagonistic natural element of the flying dancers, abundant water, earth, wind and sun. In addition to the narrative themes that humans have told us from the caves to the mobile chat and what follows, are a proof that Pina was a woman that knew to tune the limbic system of human emotions and read into her dancers and know what kind of personal stories they have and what kind of goals they would like to achieve.<br />  Win Winders, developed an unconventional documentary, without concessions or sentimentalisms. His intention is to make us partakers of the wonderful woman who Pina Busch was, and perhaps with that improve, even slightly, the pain of his departure.<br />  Winders is the director of \\"The American Friend\\", \\"Paris Texas\\", \\"Wings of Desire,\\" \\"The End of the Violence\\" also the documentary about the Cuban orchestra of olds musicians,  \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\". He was born in Dresden, close to town where Pina was born, studied medicine and philosophy, but he did not completed them.  He try entering several times to formally study film, however like François Truffaut in France, it was by being a regular assistant to films and work on the drafting of Der Spiegel, that generated the basic knowledge that allow him to make his films.<br /> Installed more from the position of an emotional and observational cinema, his films are about unusual situations of estrange people. In the film, \\"Paris, Texas\\", for instance, Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis Henderson, a subject in a state of dromomania (less intense than the one that we saw in Forest Gump, because he runs tirelessly for moths and grown beards and hair). Travis enters from the desert to a small restaurant and drink what is in the refrigerator.

In the film, \\"Paris, Texas\\", for instance, Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis Henderson, a subject in a state of dromomania (less intense than the one that we saw in Forest Gump, because he runs tirelessly for moths and grown beards and hair).

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is really awesome. I think it is great addition to any family collection. Even if you are not a Christian I think you'd enjoy this movie. As a woman it makes me want a man of courage. This would be a great gift as well as a good movie to open the conversation for what kind of family you'd like to have. I love it and I hope those who have not seen it will love it too!!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|This app is kinda fun... if your stupid.  Haha its pretty stupid. it has many glitches. I wouldn't recommend it!!!!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|I had high hopes for the movie and was not disappointed. The film was beautiful, exciting, and sweet. The acting was amazing, the settings interesting and vibrant, and the music added to the scenes immensely. The cast was well chosen and the story line was never too little or too much.  The only lie was in Hanna's line \\"I just missed your heart\\" because, cheesy at it is, the film did not miss my heart at all. In fact, it was spot on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the veriaty of games. can spend hours playing. esay my kids even like it. easy yo make points ti okay more games.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie. I felt like at times the previous movies by these producers could be a bit preachy. This movie takes a different approach and it seemed more natural. I don't mean to knock either Fireproof or Facing the Giants...they are both great movies. This one is definitely the best though. It is a great reminder to me as a father to take the time with my boys to enjoy them and lead them in the best intentional way that I can.
B0045HCJQW|4.0|this is a classic movie. Still comes on tv every now and then, but will always be worth purchasing. Katherine plays a great role, which by itself is worth the price.
0741470314|4.0|This in-depth description of Michael Jackson's life, especially his last years, gives insight into his personal and professional life.  Chapters written with the input of Jackson's bodyguards let the reader see his love for his children and his careful attempts to keep them safe.  The stories of the bodyguards show Jackson's love of reading too.  They transported \\"hundreds of books\\" from stores to Neverland for their boss; he read the classics, a wide variety of sciences, and biographies.  These and other interesting facts about Michael Jackson will paint a vivid picture of the \\"King of Pop\\", the man that his fans may not have known.  While reading, I was surprised at the number of charities and people he helped; I was shocked by the many people who took advantage of him.<br /><br />The author, a self-described huge fan of Michael Jackson, includes explanations for his \\"bizarre\\" behaviors that may not sound plausible to some readers.  Some of the day-to-day accounts of his actions and movements may be too much information.  Despite the overly reported minutiae, readers, like me, disinterested one-time fans will appreciate learning more about Jackson, an entertainer who added to our lives with his terrific entertainment.  We, who may have always doubted the extent of the crimes and idiosyncrasies that Michael Jackson was accused of in the entertainment news and mainstream media, appreciate this deeper look at the man.  Author Moriarty gives, almost too much, background and explanation for many circumstances in Jackson's life and death.<br /><br />Adult readers who have loved his music may want to know more about the Michael Jackson.  They will enjoy reading/skimming this book.<br /><br />Three and a half stars<br /><br />*Complimentary copy received for this review, does not affect my opinion in any way*

B005ZUR724|5.0|Probably one of the best games on the app store. I'm a big fan of MMORPGs and this game is well worth the money and low, low cost of subscription once your 3 free months runs out. Graphics are smooth and pretty decent for a tablet device, and the gameplay is pretty in depth. The game is really entertaining and a great time killer. I highly recommend purchasing this app.

B005LAIGOQ|1.0|How many times is the same plot going to be used over and over again?<br /><br />This is the same old story of a crazy woman spirit seeking revenge.  The main character in these types of stories does some research, finds a body, and gives it a proper burial, only to have the spirit remain at unrest.  Remind you of any other movies???<br /><br />The movie was very slow and featured things moving in front of the camera followed by a loud noise.  No chances taken and very few interesting story elements make this movie run-of-the mill.  The settings were amazing, but don't seem to be fully utilized to make this a really thought-provoking film.<br /><br />Overall, it's just the same thing we've seen before and offers nothing new or exciting.  What a let down.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted in a cover.  I really like to use my Kindle with no cover, but I do want some protection for the times that I have it in my bag.  This case offers the best of both worlds.  My Fire is plenty protected, yet the case is sleek rather than clunky.  I especially like how it does not cover any of the screen/face.  The stand works very well.  Right now I am typing with my Fire on my bed, using the stand.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|Exactly what I wanted and paid for at a decent price. Every disk worked perfect, love the casing for the series. Excellent delivery time and packaging.

0439023513|4.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy is a departure from typical Young Adult (YA) fantasy fiction and I think that departure is the source of some of the criticism and disappointment about Mockingjay.  Many of the adults who have read the first book in the series comment on how disturbing it is and I think if you are part of that group, you are reading the series from the perspective of how emotionally difficult and traumatizing the events of the books are for Katniss and the other main characters.  If you are only focused on the action (will they crush the Capital?) and the romance (who will Katniss pick?) then I could see how the final book is a disappointment:  it doesn't present a clean Happily Ever After.  For this reason, Mockingjay is really the most emotionally mature book in the series.  There is one part (the destruction of the pods) that seems to drag on, but other than that I couldn't have thought of a better or more realistic ending to the series.  Collins focuses on the nuances of power, the casualties of war, and how war and violence affects people differently.  I think it is important to understand, as well, that Katniss is never a willing participant from the very beginning of the series in the revolution against the Capital.  At a very young age she is forced to make difficult choices that always seem to result in terrible consequences.  In a normal YA fantasy novel, she would sweep in, conquer the bad guy, marry the guy, and live HEA with no major emotional damage occurring from all the violence, killing, and terror she experienced.  Moreover, the final novel doesn't subscribe to the idea that all characters fall into the categories of good and bad;  instead, we are presented with characters whose actions are riddled with moral ambiguity and sometime selfishness, which is unfortunately far more realistic than the dichotomy of good versus evil.  I think Collins is offering us something with a little more depth in Mockingjay.  Part of the appeal of the very first book is the gritty realism of the districts and the actual games.  The painful conclusion continues this tradition albeit with a focus on the emotions of the main characters, who after all, are fragile, damaged teenagers that have been forced to kill innocent people and who have had their lives torn apart.  Really, how could this end well for any of them?

B0034G4P4O|4.0|Let me state upfront that I grew up in Belgium (home country of Tintin-creator Herge), and that in my youth I read all of the original Tintin comics, and they were simply amazing, taking me in my imagination to the wonderful world of Tintin's many adventures. Over the years there have been a number of attempts to bring the comics to the screen, and the cartoon series that appeared on HBO a number of years ago did a pretty great job of it, in my opinion, staying true to the origins of the Tintin comics. When I heard that none other than Steven Spielberg and Steve Jackson were planning to make a Tintin movie, I was very excited. Then I saw the trailer in the theatre last year, and I have to admit I cringed a bit. This did not feel like the \\"original\\" Tintin I grew up with. But I finally gave in this past weekend and went to see the movie in the theatre.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" (107 min.) is not a live action movie nor is it a cartoon, but instead somewhere in the middle, an animated movie using live actors in the filming who then get \\"digitized\\" for the final result. Why, oh why? As I watched the movie, as entertaining as it was at times, I kept thinking to myself it felt \\"fake\\". I simply do not understand why Spielberg didn't chose to make this a live action movie, as the movie feels pretty much a cross between \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\". Not that the movie is bad, but it could've been so much better. The highlight of the movie is actually the opening credits, where we see the cartoon Tintin and his dog Snowy dodge a number of dangerous situations (not unlike, say, the opening cartoon credits of the Peter Sellers-era Pink Panther movies), just tremedous. The movie did do just okay but not great in the US, although it earned bunches more in overseas markets. Peter Jackson supposedly will direct the next Tintin movie (if there is one).<br /><br />As an aside, the movie's plot is based on 3 Tintin books originally published in the 1940s, The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944). I reread those comics the other day, and frankly, they are tons better than the movie. I bought most of the Tintin books in English for my kids when they were younger, and they loved them too. But I couldn't interest them in watching this movie with me.with the Golden Claws (1941), The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), and Red Rackham's Treasure (1944).

B006IGZWB2|4.0|People complained about yet another movie with Black characters as servants and a too good to be true White saviour.  This isn't that movie.  Its about the maids and the women who give them life in this film truly give them life.  Yes, the novel is a piece of fiction, but the feelings of these women felt true to me as a film watcher and the granddaughter of a Mississippi maid.  I liked it.  I didn't love it, but I did really enjoy the help and the performances are worthy of the awards they are receiving.

B0064MT1LM|5.0|I am thankful for Lionsgate picking up these Miramax releases for blu ray! Cold Mountain and English Patient FINALLY get an official US blu ray release. And these are stunning transfers. Cold Mountain looks so much better than the over compressed DVD. The image is softer than what we come to expect from the blu ray format, but the softness is intentional while still bringing out the detail of this beautiful picture. This version blows away the cruddy looking DVD. Unlike the cheaply made import blu rays of this title, this version is true 1080p (where the imports are 1080i). And this version is full of special features.<br />This is definately an upgrade of the DVD and is worth the purchase (especially under ten bucks!).<br />I am very happy to have this and Lionsgate version of The English Patient in my blu ray collection.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Simply a surreal film. Really a maddening film...if it weren't for Altamont, this would be nothing more than a low budget fan-based Stones cult classic, but the events of December 6th, 1969 make it an historical icon. Presented under the guise of following the Stones late in their Gimme Shelter tour of 1969, this disjointed account follows the band as they complete a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and begin negotiations for a `Woodstock' like free concert in the San Francisco area late in 1969. Interspersed with recording studio drug induced sound checks for, among other things, an early recording of `Wild Horses', the film meanders towards the inevitable outcome at Altamont and the absolutely phenomenal occurrences of that day and concert.  Really following no rhyme nor reason, this movie moves at a somewhat languid pace with snippets of concert footage and backstage coverage of the band...this Criterion Collection has performed an amazing service by digitally remastering these recordings to sound absolutely rich and astounding. The New York shows and Altamont shows all have a drive and depth with the bass and lead/rhythm guitars brought out and integrated with Jagger's vocals that really stand out. My only complaint about this `tour' film is that after the tragedy at Altamont, the Stones play some of their best live concert music and this film, unbelievably, does not present it.  The highlight of this movie, obviously, is the Altamont concert and these events cover almost the entire last half of the film. Showing the rushed attempts at staging this show and the behind the scenes negotiating in the rush up to it, we're then propelled out to the raceway where we're suddenly a part of the concert scene. A `Woodstock' like affect then takes place as we see hippie after hippie take his place in the crowd and the ever present drug-like aura pervades. Suddenly, motorcycle-like rumbles override the crowd noise and the Hell's Angels make a ceremonial like entrance and the inextricable shift to violence begins as does the concert. Among the classic footage is a confrontational trash talk exchange between Jefferson Airplane's Grace Slick and the Hell's Angels frontmen over the clubbing into unconsciousness of one of its band members. Also, the Grateful Dead arrive and then soon depart, without playing, as they learn of the unrelenting violence associated with this concert.  The Stones, meanwhile, purposely wait for nightfall, angering, according to Angels frontman Sonny Barger, the crowd even further and take the stage under an immense and violent aura. This is where the film gets hypnotic as the band breaks into their set while the Angels continue beating the crowd into submission. Pause after violent pause in the music is offset by Mick's pensive outlook as the environment is clearly out of control. It is amazing to see the concert aesthetics of the sixties as the Angels walk about onstage and even talk with Jagger between vocal sets. A large dog even walks across the stage and the motorcyclists wrestle with a large naked drugged out woman before we see Meredith Hunter in his lime green suit rush the stage before he's beaten back. It's not until it's presented to the Mick and the viewer in the ever present backdrop of editing this film that we see in slow motion the real horror of Hunter's and the Angel's actions. Carrying a gun in an apparent drug induced haze while rushing the stage, Hunter is beaten back, stabbed and killed while Jagger tries to control the crowd. Helicoptored out amidst loud sobbing from his girlfriend and under a blood soaked gurney, the band continues, but the viewer only gets to see Mick reviewing the `awful' footage on a small film screen in a studio and then walking out. This is where the film ends.  While important from an historical perspective, this film was very revealing as a `you are there' anchor. The close proximity to the band as the violence was occurring and the abundance of concert footage earlier that day gives the viewer a solid view of Altamont and the absurdity of that day. Weak in its point of coverage of the Stones on Tour, it more than makes up for it with the melancholy and surrealism associated with the death and violence that equates to the epithet Altamont.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Amazon Customers, please join with me in this simple, yet worthy cause. You are here because you are an intelligent, sensitive music listener who recognizes that Beck's album Sea Change was one of the most exceptional music experiences of the 2000s. Going on ten years now after its release, it still holds aural magic. Countless sources lauded the release as one of the best of the past decade, with Rolling Stone Magazine placing it on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.<br /><br />Why then must it continue to have Kim Hughes' horrible review placed on it, Amazon? She seems quite upset at the somber mood to the music, as if to say, \\"C'mon, Beck [pats Beck on head], make songs I can dance to and feel happy about.\\" Ms. Hughes has since gone on to greater accomplishments as a self-described relationship expert where she no doubt gives great advice. Let her have her cheery world among the couples of Lavalife.com, but please, Amazon, PLEASE - take down her review! Every time I happen by this page and see her dismissive, snarky little criticism, I have to go outside and run around the block just to avoid throwing my laptop against the wall.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's hard to put in words how much I enjoyed this novel. Stephen King is a genius at storytelling and 11/22/63 is one of his best, if not his best.<br /><br />I was a senior in high school when JFK was assassinated and I still remember that awful gut-wrenching feeling when the principal announced over the PA system that he had died. And along with him, it seemed, the innocence of the country died with him.  From that day on the 60's degraded into one of the worst decades in my life time, and as a veteran of the Vietnam era, one I would like to forget.<br /><br />All of us, I'm sure, think about what It would be like to go back in time. And who knows, one day it might happen. But in this book, it did happen and for this one make-believe reading experience it was heartwarming to think that awful day could be reversed and the young Kennedy would serve out his term. But I was unaware of the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" where one change can have such a drastic exponential change down the line and is irreversible. Throughout the book I was hoping Kennedy would be spared but in the end, that \\"change\\" in the past resulted in so many devastating changes down the line, those hopes turned to despair.<br /><br />Well done Mr. King. I wish had 1/1000 of your talent when it comes to storytelling and writing.

0439023513|4.0|The Hunger Games is on our middle school reading list, so I thought I'd give them a read to see if they were acceptable for a 12 year old. I would say that they are too violent for tweens and young teens. That being said, however, I find the way that war and human frailty and our ability to numb ourselves to violence extremely worthy. So thank you Susanne Collins for pointing this out in an accessible way.  I do find that books to be very dark and depressing, finally. But I also couldn't put any of the books down. I was routing for Katness and her family the whole journey and hoped for a happy ending, just like in real life.

B005IZLPME|4.0|So I finally got round to watching the last of my superhero movies from last year (I refuse to acknowledge Green Lantern). The short version is I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It's not dark and gritty a la Batman which may disappoint some I suppose. Nor does it have the sheer joy that the first Iron Man offered. What it is, is solid and adding some of the war movie trappings onto a superhero story was a refreshing change.<br /><br />As befits the character of Captain America/Steve Rogers (effectively captured by Chris Evans) there wasn't much in the way of self doubt or shades of grey. Cap does what he does because he believes it is the right thing to do. Plain and simple.<br /><br />The supporting cast was good too. Hugo Weaving gave us the over the top two dimensional Red Skull that that particular character demands and Tommy Lee Jones was... well Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is that the material was a little rushed. There were at least two movies to be had out of this story, but the need to get Cap frozen in ice and ready for the Avengers film made for a very rushed last few minutes.<br /><br />Still it had everything I want in my superhero action movies. I was happy if not blown away.

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />'Drive' is directed by Nicholas Winding Refn, a Danish director known for films with a violent bent. 'Drive' is no exception, as it emulates some of the darker film noirs of the 40s and 50s as well as the neo-noirs of later years. Refn shot 'Drive' in a contemporary Los Angeles but due to the use of an 80s, synth pop score, the story feels like it's more from the 80s rather than today (sounds like some of those synth tracks with the choppy bass parts were 'borrowed' from one of Hall and Oates' more popular hits).<br /><br />For women who might be drawn to the film due to the casting of Ryan ('The Hunk') Gosling in the lead role, be forewarned that 'Drive' is anything but a 'chick flick'. Gosling, in an unnamed part, moonlights as a getaway driver but has more respectable jobs as a part-time stunt driver and auto mechanic. Unfortunately, Gosling has little dialogue and speaks mostly in a monotone. Even worse is Carey Mulligan who plays Irene, the Driver's next door neighbor and mother of a five year old, who appears to drift about in a perpetual stupor (I seem to recall that when Driver crushes the hit man's head in the elevator, Irene backs off in shock but later never discusses or alludes to the incident at all).<br /><br />Things pick up in terms of action when Irene's husband, Standard, is released from prison but is being forced to commit another robbery by a brute named Cook, who claims Standard still owes a debt to former inmate associates who 'protected' him while incarcerated. A normal guy might feel some jealousy when another man encroaches on his territory, but 'Knight-in-Shining Armor' Gosling is ready to help Standard simply because he's taken a real liking to Irene and the kid.<br /><br />'Drive' soon begins to shine through some neat twists and turns in the plot as well as the introduction of cool supporting players who overshadow both Mr. Gosling and Ms. Mulligan. Some critics have argued that the violence in 'Drive' is gratuitous, but I beg to differ. It might be a bit over the top, but is never cartoonish. In fact, the violence underscores the menacing, ruthless character of the antagonists Gosling's Driver must face.<br /><br />Cook beats Standard to a bloody pulp and the shocks are just beginning. There's the big double cross at the pawn shop, where Standard is shot in the back and later Cook's moll, Blanche, is gunned down at the motel room (there was a significant gasp that could be heard throughout the theater from a taken aback audience when the moll is dispatched). Gosling also gets the chance to be ruthless when he works Cook over. Later Bernie (a mobster played by Albert Brooks, who earlier backed the Driver and Shannon, the owner of the auto body shop where the Driver worked, in a joint stock car racing venture) kills Cook by stabbing him in the face. In addition to the aforementioned 'stomping in the elevator' scene, Bernie eliminates Shannon 'mercifully' by slicing his artery, causing the Driver's former pal, to slowly bleed to death.<br /><br />Who would have thought that comedian Albert Brooks, could actually be so good as an amoral crime boss? Bryan Cranston is also excellent as the Driver's seedy employer. Ron Perlman is always great playing the heavy but I would have liked to have seen more of him, as his character Nino's declaration of his Jewishness, remains wholly underdeveloped.<br /><br />The film's climax, where the Driver cuts off Nino's car on the highway, leading to his death by drowning at the hands of the Driver, was quite exciting. Less exciting and more awkward was the Driver's agreement to meet Bernie in public and return the money. For a person as crafty as the driver, didn't he anticipate that Bernie would try and hurt him at the scene of their meeting place? Or is it that he just didn't care? One other thing I wondered about at film's end. If the loot belonged to the east coast Mafia, even though Bernie and Nino were now dead, wouldn't the Mafioso still come looking for the Driver as well as Irene, who they would have discovered was affiliated with him? Thus, how could the Driver ride off into the sunset, knowing full well that Irene was still vulnerable?<br /><br />When I saw the title 'Drive', I expected the film to have many more chase scenes. Fortunately, director Refn took the story in a different direction, emphasizing the rivalry between the Driver and his criminal antagonists. 'Drive' is a film which doesn't have a lot to say. In other words, if you're looking for great 'meaning', you will not find it here. With the exception of the more complex Bernie, its characters are pretty much one-dimensional caricatures, especially the main protagonists, played by Gosling and Mulligan. Nonetheless, in the tradition of some of the great noirs and neo-noirs of the past, 'Drive' manages to be highly entertaining, due to a dynamic plot, that will keep you on the edge of your seat.who they would have discovered was affiliated with him?

B006H3MIV8|3.0|Sorry I bothered.  I don't expect artists to copy the original songwriters style or arrangements necessarily, but many of these songs were unrecognizable. Others were done very well.  But I could have done with one CD (possibly 2) of the best songs.  Wouldn't spend the money if I had it to do over.
B0059XTUMC|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The Weinstein Brothers strike again by bringing French director Michael Hazanavicius' silent film tribute, 'The Artist', to the United States, now in the running for possible Oscar Gold. To my recollection, silent films wore out their welcome way back in 1927, and only something strikingly original, should be considered for the Academy's highest honor. While Hazanavicius does his best at technically putting together the kind of film they made in the silent era (and he certainly doesn't get 'everything' right), story wise, his narrative is completely derivative. There's nary a single original idea in the entire picture.<br /><br />Hazanavicius' protagonist is George Valentin, obviously named after silent screen legend himself, Rudolph Valentino. Valentin's character, a heartthrob before the advent of the talkies, is modeled historically more on silent screen star, John Gilbert, than Valentino. After the introduction of the talkies, Gilbert's career fell apart, not because the sound of his voice didn't sit well with audiences now accustomed to 'talking pictures', but because he was saddled with inferior scripts and the one or two good pictures he was in, did not find wide favor with the public. Like Valentin in 'The Artist', Gilbert also proceeded to self-destruct by embracing the bottle.<br /><br />The Artist's narrative is based both on films from the silent era as well some classic sound pictures. 'The Count of Monte Cristo', one of Gilbert's well-known silent era films as well as Douglas Fairbanks' 'The Three Musketeers\\" are alluded to when Valentin is seen in one of the 'pictures within a picture', playing an action hero swordsman. Silent era melodrama is also referenced when Valentin's dog, Jack, alerts a policeman on the beat, who runs into the fading screen star's home, and saves him from a raging fire. I can't help being reminded of the early sound serial, 'The Little Rascals', where dogs are used to a more comic effect. Early in 'The Artist', Jack is featured in an amusing bit, running to and fro, on stage.<br /><br />While there are many allusions to actual silent films and very early talkies in 'The Artist', the basic plot is derived from two later classic 'sound' films. In 'The Artist', Valentin, a once successful actor, now in sad decline after a successful career, finds himself supplanted by a love interest, who has gone on to a successful career of her own as a celebrity actor, but offers to rescue him out of both feelings of love and guilt. This in essence is the story of 'A Star Is Born', made in the 30s and later revived in the 50s, as a Judy Garland vehicle. One also cannot ignore the parallels to 'Sunset Boulevard', which features a story that in part revolves around the movie studio system. 'The Artist' even has its own chauffeur, Clifton, played by James Cromwell, that echos the chauffeur role in 'Sunset Boulevard', famously played by Erich Von Stroheim. Should I also mention how Mr. Hazanavicius can't help himself throw in a bit from 'Citizen Kane'? When Valentin uncovers all his auctioned effects which Peppy had purchased for him, it's a scene completely reminiscent from 'Citizen Kane', where all of Kane's property sits in storage, covered by similar white cloths. And what of Hazanavicius' lazy use of music composed by Bernard Hermann, associated with both Orson Welles and Hitchcock? It seems that Ludovic Bource simply ran out of ideas and perhaps was unable to complete the score. A more likely scenario is that Hazanavicius simply wanted to save money by licensing Hermann's Hitchcock soundtrack.<br /><br />There is little point in rehashing the details of Hazanvicius' derivative and pointless plot. Suffice it to say, it's Valentin who ironically discovers kindly Peppy Martin, after she accidentally crashes through a roped off area of Valentin groupies, and is photographed by paparazzi. After sad sack Valentin feels sorry for himself after falling from grace as a silent screen star and Peppy becomes famous in the talkies, he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself. Leave it to Jack to save him along with Peppy, who recalls that Valentin is actually a talented dancer, and suggests to the Kinograph studio honcho, that they could make a great pair, as the next Rogers and Astaire-like dance team.<br /><br />If 'The Artist' has any value, is in its fairly faithful recreation of a bygone era. It's fun watching how director Hazanavicius utilizes the costumes, makeup and set design, as well as the many techniques of silent film era cinematography to create the final product, which best can be described as a 'loving tribute'. Nonetheless, Hazanavicius has chosen merely to emulate the traditional conventions of the silent film era than create an original, final product. One is reminded more of a 'B' melodrama from that era than one of the classics, such as the kind proffered up by a Chaplin or Keaton.<br /><br />It's a sad state of affairs when a less than mediocre story, created in a now defunct style of filmmaking (which was put to rest over seventy years ago), garners some of the top awards from the chief pundits in today's film industry. It only goes to show how hard up the film industry is, in its ability to discover and promote quality scripts, instead resorting to the dubious tactic of reaching back to yesteryear, for ill-advised inspiration.ous in the talkies, he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself.

B005LAIIS0|1.0|When I saw Liam was starring in this movie, I was so excited.Terrible reference to God.. Movie had you on edge no doubt..very disappointing ending!
B000GOVK8Q|2.0|the film moved really slow. so much that I got up to bake cookies during the boring scenes, which, by the way lasted way to long.i would have rather spent that time watching \\"Far and Away\\" with both stars in that.

B000SKNIWE|5.0|This 5 disc set with a total view time of around 10 hrs is a  must have for any one with bluray and HD media.  A must have for any nature enthusiasist.  The set arrived ahead of time in a good condition.  It covers everything from water marshes deep waters wildlife polar life in seperate discs narrated by David Attenborough who is equally fascinated by nature unlike the US version of narration which is more like bedtime story for kids. Again this is my perception.. Individual preferences may change.  This disc set is imported from UK and is region free. So u need not worry of regions when u travel around.it works on any blu ray player around the world.  One of the best productions by BBC and it truly paid off.  It is not a tru HD as all the portions r not shot in HD and it is not 1080i but u will never be disappointed anytime
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|If you totally dig SOA then you are now prepared to read or watch Hamlet because you know the story. Young, reflective prince unsure of the foundations of his life's order. Gets a visit by his father's ghost, Hamlet Senior, who helpfully tells him he was murdered by his brother Claudius (probably). The Queen cares more for status and power than doing what's right, so she stands by her (current) man. She worries about her unhappy son: \\"It's like his father is speaking to him from beyond the grave.\\" Then of course there's the title of the manuscript: \\"How SAMCRO Lost Its Way.\\" Truly something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  Agent Stahl, our duplicitous, spying Polonius of this tale, helpfully calls Jax and Gemma the \\"prince\\" and the \\"queen.\\" She gets the Polonius treatment, too, meeting her demise at the end of season 3. And if Stumpy and Half Sack aren't Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, they're Falstaff.  Just in case you weren't clued in by the show's obvious references, Maureen Ashby helps us out from Ireland, by sending more of our ghost's writings so we can hear the voice of John Teller saying \\"Murder most foul...\\"  If the creators of SOA are to be true to the origins of their story, they will acknowledge its greatness by killing Jax Teller at the hands of someone, probably from SOA Belfast Charter or the IRA whose own father suffered years ago at the hands of John Teller, avenging his own father's death. We don't really have an Ophelia here though. Jax's old lady is a strong and intelligent woman who chooses to jump in to the mayhem rather than simply being swept along by it. She may be the one, at the end of the story, who acts as Horatio's voice, telling us the sadness of it, what can be learned from it and why we should care as she soldiers on without her best friend.  I sincerely hope we see a full dramatic end to the story, that the characters we love will die bloody or triumph and all will be tied up in a most Shakespearean way.  SOA is by far the best thing I've found in current television production. If you have missed it, get Amazon Prime or Netflix and stream the first three seasons. Do that and I'll bet you'll be back here to buy the fourth.  This is a series to own on Blu-Ray.

B005PTQPU0|4.0|Every snowflake is unique, at least that was the story when I was a kid. The idea seems absurd when you're watching the snow fall during a blizzard. Every one of those snowflakes is different? How can that be possible?  Go to an airport or a concert or a big game of some sort. Any where that there are thousands of people gathered together. All of those people are different. They each have their own story, their own dreams, hopes, desires. These people have gathered together in a huge drift of humanity, but how many of them feel alone in the middle of this giant crowd?  I feel like a lonely, drifting snowflake after listening to this album. It makes me want to grab my wife and my children and never let them go. But more than that physical connection, that sense that they're real and here, the melancholy tone of this album, with it's simple, almost muffled sound, makes me yearn for a deeper, emotional connection. I need to feel that I have a lasting connection to somebody, that I'm not all alone in this cold, harsh world.  Sure, Kate gives us 50 words for snow, but after all of those words, do we know anymore about what it IS. Of course we do. She's been telling us all about snow for the entire album. Snow coats, obscures, and hides. How can we find one unique \\"Snowflake\\" among the million that fall during a winter? Snow makes the ordinary alien and beautiful. It's like the man who uses his charm to lure in that beautiful woman, only to leave her feeling cold and alone. Those feelings are beautifully rendered in \\"Misty.\\" Snow is fleeting. It melts and leaves behind rivulets of water that can build and build into a beautiful mountain lake. The heartache of lose is embodied in the melted snow that is \\"Lake Tahoe.\\" Snow remembers. It records footsteps that hint at something big and scary without giving away all of its secrets. What leaves the tracks in \\"Wild Man?\\" Everything stops when it snows. Snow is the pause button of life. Only snow has the power to trap two loversin place long enough to fleetingly connect when they're snowed in at Wheeler Street. Snow melts in the heat of summer. It joins the angels.  The words of each of those songs make me feel lonely. The performance of those words, much more than merely singing, express the same longing and heartache. The simple arrangements echo the suggestion of being alone and cold, walking through a cold winter landscape. Searching.

0307346617|5.0|If it weren't for the fact that the central theme of this book is Zombies then it would probably be receiving far more plaudits and recognition than it already has. So yes, it is about zombies but this is no minor work of pulp-fiction. Brooks explores the full implications- personal, emotional, societal, through a slowly unfolding narrative of 'survivor accounts'. Through these vignettes the reader slowly builds up a full picture of the horror of the Zombie war. Brooks separates these accounts, some long, some short and punchy, into broad sections that chart the crisis- from the outbreaks of a pandemic through the haunting \\"Great Panic\\" and finally through to a sort of salvation. Intriguingly the interview notes and setting of the survivor's accounts also provides cookie-crumbs of information about the post-war world that builds up the creeping conclusion that every-thing is not going to be ok.  Along the way Brooks provides the reader with so many haunting images that the book lingers long in the mind and (unfortunately) also in sleep. This is where the real strength of the book lies- zombies might have been well explored on the screen but here Brooks really considers the full horrific implications of the undead- for instance: the fact that they don't drown leads to huge swarms of under-water zombies roaming the ocean floors, infesting wrecks and occasionally finding a once-safe beach. The only comparison in my mind is the BBC drama \\"Threads\\" in which a post-nuclear war world is documented in a series of horrific episodes that burn into the mind. The fact that World War Z also includes an account of a \\"limited\\" nuclear exchange only re-enforces that feeling.  It's imagination, emotional punch and the fact that zombies appear utterly believable that make this book completely unmissable and unputdownable. Brilliant.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|I'm reading a lot of whining from old school Korn fans. Get over it. I loved Korn, Life Is Peachy, and Follow the Leader but Korn III and Take A Look In The Mirror were terrible. They needed a revival. Dubstep is the new up-and-coming sound that is gaining momentum. I think this was a great collaboration. This Korn fan admires your effort and willingness to step outside of the box.

If you're into movies with a deep meaning, this isn't it for you, but for those of you that just love action like me, it'll be awesome! Blu-ray definitely makes this movie pop out and you'll love it if you have a huge awesome HDTV.

I understand what they wanted to do with their new album, but in my opinion, it failed. It just sounds the same, to many songs don't have that 'Nightwish feel' as the older songs did.  I was hoping this album would be better that Dark Passion Play, but it fell short.

1402760663|5.0|[[ASIN:1402760663 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition: An Indian History of the American West]]<br /><br />This is by far the most detailed history of America from a personal and painful perspective than I have ever read. The author has provided a must read history book for every American. I found myself in disbelief as to how we as a country could open our arms so wide to every nationality but yet be no better than the orchestrator(s) of genocide we read about in Nazi Germany. This book will cause the reader to wonder why we can't learn from history and perhaps question why we continue to change others culture when perhaps tolerance of various other cultures would be a proper answer. Have your children read this book at least once in their life. I did find myself putting this book down from time to time to allow me time to process what I had read. Very disturbing.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I loved this movie, but I would think you would have to have an interest in art to love it. What was wonderful to me was to pick out the artists by the makeup they did for the movie and the way they talked. Salvador Dali was easy to spot, and Toulouse Lautrec by his size and clothes and artwork. It was fun thinking about the way they lived and the way they interacted with each other. The story of the outside relationship was just ok, and I'm sure that's why it didn't get better reviews (by someone not interested in art).

B006IGZWB2|5.0|When I rented this, I hadn't heard how popular it was. I'm a product of the 60's and thought the clothes looked like fun to see again. It was so accurate about the relationships between whites and blacks back then. I had never talked to a black person in our town until I was 23 years old and went to work for a hotel that hired a black person because of the 10% law. You had to have 10% blacks in your business. I am so glad for that law, because my life is so much richer now. Our lives are so entwined now here in the South! Watching this reminded me of how things were then. I think this is supposed to be a comedy, but it was serious to me.

Now it's up to the CDC to find out where the problem came from and if they can stop it before it wipes out civilization.<br /><br />There are a lot of famous and infamous actors in this presentation for the most part we're rooting that they will make it to the end of the film. However there is the occasional character that you just waiting for him/or her to catch it.<br /><br />Lots of books and lots of movies focus on the standard contagious disaster. In this one we were spared the evil done guy that doesn't listen to people or in general the defrocked scientist who turns out to be the only one that knows the true answer. Yeah there might've been a fraud tried to make a few million in the self-sacrificing individual to try to cut corners; but they are shadows of the exaggerated personalities most disaster movies. All in all it's quite intriguing to watch. There was not a lot of gratuitous vomiting. I'm not sure what their purpose of this movie was as there was nothing unique other than making another movie for people who like to watch disasters.<br /><br />As you watch this presentation ask yourself what would you do in that situation?

B005QUQRE2|4.0|Sometime in the future astronomers discover a planet that is Earth's identical twin in every way.  The size, shape, land forms, etc., are all identical.  The same day this discovery is made a brilliant 17 yr old HS student is accepted to MIT.  While driving home from a celebration party she hears the news about Earth II.  She looks up at the night sky to try to spot it.  She does, but then tragedy strikes in the form of an accident.<br /><br />This accident changes the lives of many people.  This young woman later decides to find the survivor whose life was impacted most by the accident she caused, but she loses courage and instead finds herself possibly making a difference in another way.<br /><br />This movie has all of the earmarks of an independent film.  It was filmed obviously on a small budget, and the actual filming has an edginess to it that adds to this increasingly tense film.  The acting is commendable, and the story line is engaging.<br /><br />The initial impression is that this is going to be a heavy-duty sci-fi movie about going to another world, but the real thing could not be farther from the truth.  This film is about hope, pain, hurt, recovery, and, if possible...restitution.  It is also about what you might say to yourself if you could have a conversation with \\"you\\".  Of course, we do this all of the time, but it is an interesting premise.<br /><br />I liked the film well enough, but I didn't love it, and I don't feel the need to watch it more than once.<br /><br />All in all 3.5 - 4 stars. So I'll go with four.

B005UBNL0A|5.0|Now, I myself, am just an average user of computers. By that, I mean, I don't have ALL too much knowledge with them, as towards overclocking and such. BUT! I did build my most recent computer, and was excited to get this for a nice price! Initially, I got this off newegg. It came with a finger print sized area of broken pins, not my doing. They were too bent to even be fixed at that point, and I'm only 14, also, so I didn't feel comfortable doing it on my own. Now, on newegg, it was more expensive, but I got a 20 dollar gift card sent to my email with it. I tried to return it, and they said they wouldn't even do an exchange because of \\"damage by user\\" even though I told them it came damaged.  Therefore, I hopped over to amazon, got this, and next day shipping, for the same price of the processor on newegg with 3-5 day shipping. It was delivered in a wonderful box for the size of it, and I did get it the next day! Compared to my old 2.8 ghz dual core amd processor in my old computer, this runs like a dream! I can run multiple games (I know that most of that is behind my gpu, not my cpu, but still) on ultra with this only going up to 60 percent at the most! Running my daily things, such as many tabs in google chrome, many messengers, a game here and there, and some porgrams to draw with.. this only gets around 20 percent at most. And by many tabs in google chrome, I mean at least 20ish. :l All in all, I really enjoy this processor for the price.  I have heard bad things about bulldozer, and I don't doubt them. It was overhyped, especially the 8core processors. Not saying they're bad, just overhyped.  Pros:  Cheap  Quad core  Turbo of 3.8 ghz!  Decent heatsink along with it  Cons:  The heatsink, to an extent. But hey, it does the job, so it's fine.  Fragile and have had this come broken before (then again, all amd processors are, and it didn't come broken through amazon's site, so fine by me to amazon)

B0011TNVLY|2.0|The more I have seen of this movie the less I like it. My 3.5yr old likes it so I have seen it, or parts of it, quite a few times recently.  The graphics are very good, with amazing attention to details. In some cases it is absolutely brilliant with the reflections or expressions being very accurate or the body movements as the kids run along a squashy conveyor belt. But a scene where hot chocolate it being handed out and, more importantly, Santa are pretty poorly illustrated. The elves also look awful. The graphics is the reason for adding 2 stars. I have deducted stars for:  -The storyline is all about a boy who has started to doubt the existence of Santa and boards a magical train to the North Pole to see him. There is nothing about kindness or love or any of the real messages of xmas, it is all about presents and proving Santa exists.  -The train conductor is unneccesarily stern and intimidating.  -All the employees are incompetent, the train drivers who break and lose parts, lose control of the train and endanger the passengers, the elves who fail to lift the sack of presents high enough and nearly kill someone.  -What is with the spooky hobo/angel? He is mean and sarcastic but then helpful. But the way he gets hit by a low bridge and shatters into thousands of shards of ice is just scary for kids.  -There is just a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Why is the train so long when there is only one carriage of kids, one of toys and presumably one of hot chocolate servers? When they stop to pick up the last boy another boy comments on that being strange because he thought Hero Boy was the last pick up. How does he know who is last? What is the significance of this last minute addition? Nothing, as it turns out. Once at the North Pole the conductor asks all the kids to line up in two rows, odd birthdates on one side, evens on the other or some such. Why? If believing in Santa is so important why are such a small group of kids chosen to see him? When the main girl character loses her ticket the conductor takes her away, out the back carriage to walk across the train roof to the front and puts her in chanrge of driving th train while the driver changes a lightbulb. Why? And why is it when she is removed from the kids' carriage there is discussion and panic about her being thrown off the train for not having a ticket? The Boy From The Poor Neighbourhood has never received a present and understandably does not believe in Santa so why bring him to show him Santa is real and has, what, just chosen to never give him a present? Why do they all keep walking around on top of a moving train in a blizzard in only PJs and slippers? I wear a down filled coat anytime it is below 50F/10C even if sunny!  -The whole movie just seems to be building up suspense and questions that go unfulfilled. Near the end the conductor calls out something to Hero Boy who doesn't hear him and replies \\"What?\\" so the conductor calls out louder \\"Merry Christmas!\\". But there is the uneccessary suspense that the conductor has called out something significant and Hero Boy might miss the message.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love this game! It has always been fun and challenging for me. Works great &amp; is awesome on my kindle fire!

0571283578|1.0|An admirer of P.D.James other works, I found this quite disappointing. Most of the book is a tedious recap of plot elements from Pride and Predjudice, which we already know, so why tell it all over again? The tone is uninteresting, the characters colorless ~ only because the author is who she is did I even keep reading. She would have done much better to create completely fresh characters and setting to present the same plot idea, if she wanted to do a historical mystery.

0307352145|4.0|A number of blurbs on Susan Cain's book \\"Quiet\\" describe it as \\"exhaustively researched\\", and they are correct. Cain, true to her introverted nature, digs deep and takes nothing at face value. Just when you think a question has been answered, she comes at it again from yet another angle, and another, gently but persistently coaxing every drop of knowledge she can from her impressive cache of resources.     \\"Quiet\\" covers an incredible breadth of territory, exploring in-depth the cultural, historical, and biochemical basis of introversion. But what I found most interesting about the book was its examination of how deeply ingrained the ideal of extroversion is in American society, and how our blindness to the gifts that introverts bring has enormous, if mostly unseen, costs. As an introvert who has often felt misunderstood and devalued in a culture where the loud and loquacious prevail, \\"Quiet\\" was very reassuring. Like most introverts, I have frequently been told to:    Learn to be outgoing  \\"Put myself out there\\" more  Come out of my shell  Stop thinking about things so much  Let my \\"real personality\\" come through    ...and other helpful suggestions. Cain has a much different perspective on introversion, framing it as a strength rather than a pathology, and citing the hidden powers inherent in the trait. One of the most compelling parts of the book for me was the opening story, where Cain described an introverted attorney trying to broker a negotiation between two high-powered, dogged, and extroverted forces. At first, she struggles, but because she does not feel a need to shout and posture, she goes silent and deep, listening to carefully to both sides, taking the time to think, analyze, and ask meaningful questions. Eventually her quiet, listening-based approach yields a huge win-win for both parties, and a job offer from her company's competitor. Such stories are peppered throughout the book, culminating in several chapters in which she provides excellent adviceabout the proper care of introverted children. (Hint--there is nothing \\"wrong\\" with your introverted child. Let them be themselves, and give them time and space to be alone and explore their interests. Left to be themselves, introverted children can eventually become strong and respected leaders among their peers.)    I also found the research in the first part of the book to be fascinating and eye-opening. Cain describes in detail numerous long-term studies showing that introversion is not a personality flaw, but an inherent, biochemically-based trait that cannot be changed. The neural pathways and chemical make-up of introverts is profoundly different from that of extroverts, making introverts much more sensitive to external stimuli. This trait is present at birth, and does not change. In one long-term study, babies were presented with array of loud, colorful, and frequently changing stimulus. Some of the babies cried, kicked, and became very agitated in the face of stimulus, while the other babies watched calmly and were \\"low-reactive\\". The high-reactive babies became introverted children and introverted adults, and remained that way throughout their lives. The low-reactive babies became extroverted adults, and described themselves as needing a great deal of external stimulus to feel pleasure and excitement. (I won't go into the details of the how's and why's of the brain-chemistry differences here, but you can find that information in the book or by looking up the studies.)    I immediately recognized introverted traits in myself--easily overstimulated and tired by too much novelty, needing long expanses of quiet and alone-time to recharge, and needing to keep my external environment serene and free of chaos in order to thrive. Although I understand intellectually that my introversion is not a disorder, but an inherent part of my make-up, it can be very hard not see it as a personality flaw in the face of constant pressure to be loud, outgoing, hyper-sociable, and gregarious. In American society, the garrulous are rewarded and complimented, while the quiet are often dismissed or overlooked. Reading about the unseen gifts of introversion (among them listening skills, deep powers of concentration and analysis, creativity, a keen sense of observation, and empathy), reminded me that I don't have to change who I am in order to succeed, but that I can be successful in my high-visibility, people-intensive career because of--not in spite of--my introversion. In fact, Cain cites several samples of introverts who have thrived in unlikely professions like sales and public speaking.    However, Cain's goal is not to knock extroverts or create a society of all-introverts. She is generous in giving credit where credit is due, even citing an all-introvert conference on high sensitivity she attended as part of her book research. She describes feeling that without the extroverts to \\"get things going\\" and facilitate socializing, the conference was almost too quiet; a little lackluster. Cain is only asking that we all occasionally quiet down a little, step out of the spotlight, and give the floor to that soft-spoken person in the back of the room who has been listening carefully, and has raised her hand because she something meaningful to say.

B003L77GG0|5.0|For 10 years Smallville was a show I looked forward to and tried never to miss.  Some of the years were better than others; years 5 and 6 are particular standouts for me.  Some of the episodes were better than others.  All-in-all this last season did not disappoint.  The closer the end came, the harder the episodes must have been to write.  There are few instances in these last years of TV Dramas which showcase the development of a strong,young repertoire of characters.  The final season was a fitting prequel  to the original concept of SUPERMAN.  Adios, amigos, SMALLVILLE's conclusion as left a hole in my TV schedule, but I can revisit the series at will with the dvds.
0440246016|5.0|Bad Luck and Trouble is the 11th book in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, and this one is rip-roaring exciting from start to finish!<br /><br />Nomad Jack Reacher used to travel with just the clothes on his back, some spare cash, and a portable toothbrush.  But post-9/11, he now carries personal ID and an ATM card.  When he goes to take some money out of his bank account at an ATM machine, he discovers that there is $1030 more than there should be.  10-30 is the universal code for immediate help needed, and he knows that this is a signal from one of his former MP-buddies.  He traces the deposit for Frances Neagley (also in Without Fail) and meets up with her in California.  There were originally 9 members in their former army investigative unit and one of them, Carl Franz, has been found dead.  As Neagley and Reacher try to put the old team together, they have trouble finding most of their former colleagues.  Finally, they do catch up with two more and the team tries to find out what happened to Franz.  But as they dig, they not only find more murdered MPs, but the common denominator seems to be Tony Swan and his employer, New Age.  New Age makes air missiles and they have been \\"destroying\\" missiles that they claim are defective.  Yet, they've actually been selling them to a Syrian terrorist.  New Age's management knows that Swan is on to them and has asked some of his former investigative colleagues for help.  So they attempt to wipe out the entire unit including Reacher and Neagley.<br /><br />This novel is full of suspense from start to finish, and how Reacher deals with the bad guys is perhaps Child's most satisfying ending to date.  We listened to this as an audiobook, and Dick Hill does his usual stellar job in bringing this novel to life.
1451627289|3.0|I really wanted this to be worthy of the author.  The writing is not up to his usual standards. Nor is the subject. When I read a SK novel I want to be talking about it as I go.....not happening.  Is he now reaching out to his 70's supporters who are now in their 60's and he think's we can't stand the excitement?  Slow start that never quite catches up.  I was really excited that this was the name of your next novel. but to my disappointment it never catches up to his usual mega hits.  It is hard for me to write this and it is taking me about as long as it did for me to read.  Maybe SK should go back and read some of his earlier works. Please return to your familiar genre and leave these mediocre books for someone else.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion has always been great. However, now with the ability to save versions of the Bible offline its improved even more if wifi isn't available. Love it installed on my Kindle Fire. It was one of the first apps I installed. The integrated reading plans are also great.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I really enjoyed this romance between the ultimate bad boy and the perfect, golden girl. It had a bit of a West Side story/Romeo and Juliet feel to it, and the writing had me engrossed all the way through. It's a fun, fast and very enjoyable read and I recommend it for readers who enjoy steamy YA contemporary romance books.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I love this app because it  is  so flexible!  From quickly showing the graph of a function to looking up the price of aluminum per ton.  Highly recommended.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun at first, some of the games are ridiculous, but it is strangely additive. lots of free points to help you along
B0068TJLSY|3.0|Not bad.  A zombie movie wrapped in an alien movie.  The plot line was a little corny at times and the subplot was kind of predictable, but in all, it was pretty well done.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|Well, the acting was great, but the story was just plain boring.  Certainly not a movie that was entertaining, or even that interesting.  Glad I had a free pass to the movies for this one.  Wait for it to be free on tv.  And don't buy it cause you would never want to watch it more than once.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The best Ive played on kindle! They need to produce more games like this. Games like this really challenge a persons intelligence in my opinion Go G5 games!

B004EPYZQ2|3.0|My son and I saw this movie when it was in the theatre and we both loved the movie. This blu-ray was my wife and my mother's first chance to see the movie and they loved it too. However these Digital Copy offers are getting ridiculous. We like to buy the Blu-ray & DVD plus Digital Copy sets because I typically have a backup on the desktop and download a copy for itunes for travel. I thought finally had figured out this system with downloading the Windows Media copy first then loading the iTunes copy using the code provided. These Paramount disks are a pain only allowing one copy of the didgital copy to be loaded so I am glad I accidentally loaded the iTunes copy first because I was only given the one download and the Windows Media copy didn't work.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. What I would like to say is read the book see the movie. What courage of spirit the Black maids had, and what courage of spirit one white women had in writing their story. It brought tears to my eyes laughter to my heart. Set in the south, the story though fiction, hits at the truth of non-fiction.

1401937519|5.0|If Anita Moorjani's book had been written two years ago, or earlier, I probably would have passed it by.  But, through my own long struggle with grief and my encounter with \\"super normal\\" experiences, I've been launched onto a path of discovery for over two years now.  It's been quite a circuitous route, and the very first book I read on NDEs was, thankfully, \\"Life After Life,\\" written by Dr. Raymond Moody.  If I had ventured into the world of the many books written about NDEs, I would have chalked off the entire phenomenon.<br /><br />Part of my journey also included finding Bob Olsen, who, as a result of his own grief process, began his mission to discover the truth behind psychic mediumship.  He is now producing a wonderful on-line series of interviews called, \\"Afterlife TV, With Bob Olsen.\\"  One of his recent interviewees included Anita Moorjani and her interview was broadcast on December 7, 2011.  There's a word the British use to describe being dumb-founded -- gobsmacked.  I was completely and totally gobsmacked and in a state of awe when I heard her account of her \\"visit\\" to the other side.  If that were not enough of a miracle, Anita came back into her cancer-wracked body with a new knowledge that put her into total remission.  She fought cancer for four long years and was completely wasted physically, only to recover completely in a matter of weeks following her NDE.<br /><br />In both her writing style and her personal verbal accounting, Anita has a skill and dexterity with the English language that I admire and am grateful for, and even somewhat envious of.  That may sound frivolous, but I have respect for people who respect me as a reading audience.  Her prose descriptions of her super-real, heightened state of awareness, while she was completely unconscious in a coma, just transfixed me; like good poetry or philosophy.  Her vocabulary to explain her experiences is simply the most refined, observant and sentient I have ever read.  What was completely newto me was how she described the \\"other side\\" as being liminal and not really another place. It is a state of being, a feeling of magnificence, as she called it.  I have taken her lessons learned to heart, myself.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is it's emotional honesty.  I loved reading about her family - how supportive they were to the very effective end.  I know that I'll probably read this book again many times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire,  and this is a good one. moves well, looks good, like the backgrounds and card choices. this app is great.
1594202842|3.0|This story is about ONE mother and ONE family.  I am glad I got an inside look at how this particular Chinese mother thinks.  She is brave not only for exposing herself to us Westerners but also for not allowing Westerner culture to dictate how she should parent her children.  Yes, she is mean to her kids.  She says things to them that are appalling to me.  \\"You are garbage\\".  I don't agree with some (ok, many) of the things she does to her girls but I found myself thinking \\"wow, if only I had more of a backbone when it came to raising my own two daughters\\".  I wish I had the stamina to push my children to study more and to make them do things they don't want to do for their own good.  One of the lines in the book rang true with me.  Her daughter Lulu didn't want to eat cavier in red square in Moscow on a family vacation and made a huge scene.  Her mother said to her, \\"We're in Russia, and you refuse to try caviar!  You're like a barbarian.  And in case you think you're a big rebel, you are completely ordinary.  There is nothing more typical, more predictable, more common and low, than an American teenage who won't try things.  You're boring, Lulu - boring.\\"  I agree with her 100%  We raise our kids on chicken nuggets and fries, give in to their every whim and then wonder why their test scores are so low, why there are so many high school drop outs, etc. Just try the CAVIAR!!!  I am an elementary school teacher and a parent of one of my 7 year old \\"gifted\\" students complained to the principal that I gave her son a D for behavior and told him that it wasn't cool to act like a clown in class. She asked the principal for a clean copy of the report card without my comments.  She backed that up by saying she wanted him to be proud to put his A's and B's report card on the refrigerator and not feel bad because of a bad comment his teacher made.  What is this mother protecting him from?  Our kids don't know what it feels like to fail and consequently, what real triumph feels like.  This is what Amy Chua is talking about.  It's a good message.  One we should take to heart. However, in many ways, she comes off as a neurotic lunatic.  Examples of this abound...the notes she takes on Lulu's violin playing, the '10 minute' practice session in Greece, the audition for Julliard, the rediculous amount of money she spends driving to see Almita Vamos, the famous violin teacher.  In Amy's mind, these are examples of the sacrifices of a committed mother.  What it did was alienate me.  I couldn't relate to her.  I found myself relating to her daughters.  The book itself reads a bit superficially.  She uses her family as a vehicle for her message which is \\"Chinese parenting is better than Western parenting\\".  I think in many ways it is. But there are also many ways that this same result can be reached in another way.  I have to thank Amy Chua for allowing me into her world.  It inspired me to try a little harder when it comes to raising my kids. Just take an extra 30 minutes a day with your child.  Go to battle and celebrate when their success is a result of  honest, hard work.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|Why I like Wi-Fi Analyzer. The plain reason is that it is so easy to use. Another reason is for the easy measuring tools.
1423136802|5.0|I own the series myself and I love them. I finally read them when I finally caught up with Erin Hunter with her Warriors series (about 30 books)! I loved them so much that I was distracted from electonics for a while, though it only lasted about a week since I would stay up late reading it (that good). Rick Riordan creates a new scene that to me creates a clear image. So exciting! I was so upset when it ended (loved it that much), but luckily was quickly made happy when I found the continuing of it (Heroes of Olympus). The series is a must read (still trying to get my sister to read it)! Love this series and you'll love \\"Heroes of Olympus\\" and \\"The Kane Chronicles.\\" I absolutely love how Riordan brought in myths of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian to his series. Highly recommend them.<br /><br />So great it left me hungry for more and laughing my head off. And so great I don't know what else to say without giving away Percy's thrilling adventures. So for more information on the books if you are still unsure about getting the series (you better not be unsure) go to rickriordan.com for more info on any of the books, including the layout of Camp Half-Blood and a daily activity sample of their day. (Even Percy's grades if you can find them.) Hope you love the series (all of them) as much as I did! 101% and higher!
B005FITIGO|5.0|Apparently reviewers (found here) critical of this film were looking for a Gordon Gecko \\"Wall Street\\" redux in \\"Margin Call\\". Instead of the fantasy which is \\"Wall Street\\" they got the reality which is this film - and they prefer to be bamboozled.<br /><br />Having worked on Wall Street and for Lehman Brothers, I can assure the prospective viewer that \\"Margin Call\\" is a realistic depiction of reality. The film probably is frustrating for viewers who have no idea what an \\"MBS\\" is (mortgage-backed-security), or a \\"sub-prime mortgage\\", nor what was at stake in the crisis 24 hour period that this film treats. So let me help those of you thinking about viewing this film...<br /><br />\\"Margin Call\\" attempts to deal with the first 24 hours wherein Lehman Brothers, Inc. came to grips with the reality that their massive holdings in mortgage backed securities was a house of cards about to topple. At stake here is not piddling issues like the bankruptcy of a mere car company like General Motors, but an investment brokerage company whose default could precipitate a world wide financial collapse. Ignorant reviewers who find this film \\"dull\\" and \\"boring\\" have no idea there are watching actors portray persons - just a tiny handful of persons - who are aware that their decisions and actions within a 24 hour period could make or break Western Civilization. The persons portrayed had no idea that the United States government would eventually intercede with billions in bail out money (not to save Lehman Brothers, but with the purpose to contain further damage).<br /><br /> Someone describing this film as dull, is like someone describing as dull the decision making and dialogue within the White House during the Cuban Missile crisis.<br /><br />Buy this movie and enjoy it. If you don't grasp what's going on, then educate youself about the facts before viewing it. Don't make a fool of youself by blaming the film producers.

B0002DSUEI|4.0|Very well recorded with amazing musicianship. The instruments are well defined and the SACD multi-channel spatial feel is excellent. The only negative comment is that Diana's vocal has so much reverb in the mix it's to the point of overkill and detracts from the natural beauty of her voice. Now I know what Mr. Costello must hear when she's singing in the shower. Would have loved a drier more intimate up front vocal mix. She certainly has the talent, no need to bury it. Overall though highly recommended and a great listen.
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is a superb book on many levels.  Adventure - escaping pirots - going sailing to a tropical island- escapig pirots again - winning out through courage and hardiness.  What could be better all done in the comfort of home.<br />It also explores a deeper level:  Good friend - bad pirot; trust under extremely difficult conditions; never giving up; loyalty; the sorrow of parting; the ultimate triumph of good.  I believe it helped me to become a better man.  I first read this book over 55 years ago and have rererd it many times since.  I envy you if you have still to explore this clasic tale.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I saw it and really didn't care for it.  Not very original and certainly not as good as the first.
0307949486|1.0|The book is almost always better than the movie.  I'm positive that can't be possible, after plodding through this inexplicably overhyped book. I was extremely disappointed.  I expected Thomas Harris and I got a mediocre, cliche ridden book.  Kept waiting to gripped, and it just never happened.  Maybe something got lost in the translation, ( used to happen with Dostoevsky).  I couldn't believe how many times the characters drank coffee, and ate sandwiches.  There wasn't one character you could care about.  Everyone of them was selfish and uninteresting, despite \\"a dragon tatoo\\" which while intriguing never materialized into anything remotely memorable, just like the book.  Trust me, there are better ways to spend your time.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|They were five in their first concert: four vocalists (Lisa Kelly, Chloë Agnew, Méav Ni Mhaolchatha and Olga Falon) plus a small blonde angel, fallen straight from Heaven for our utmost felicity: Máiréad Nesbitt, an outstanding violinist.  They were six in their second one: \\"A New Journey\\" (their masterpiece in my opinion, for which I wrote a long review in Amazon on February 4, 2007) when Hayley Westenra joined them for that unique concert.  But they are only four in their fifth concert: only three vocalists instead of four and the violinist.  Lisa Kelly is still there, Chloë Agnew is also still there, as same as Máiréad, the soul of the group, mastering her fiddle like Paganini, jumping and dancing like \\"Les Nymphes des Bois\\" (\\"The Nymphs of the Woods\\") depicted by French poets of \\"La Pléiade\\" in the XVIth century.  But Méav and Olga are no longer with the group.  We miss their charm and Olga's harp.  In fact, they had already disappeared from the fourth concert (\\"Songs from the Heart\\"), where they had been replaced by two other girls called Alex and Lynn, who have also disappeared in the meantime.  The third girl in this fifth concert is called Lisa Lambe, a charming young woman with long curly reddish hair and her voice harmonizes very well with those of Lisa Kelly and Chloë.  In fact, you will see plenty of new faces in this DVD, not only in the choir but also in the orchestra.  Unlike Adre Rieu's concerts, where the numbers are separated by endless jokes and explanations, sometimes in Dutch, which only a handful of people understand, there is no dead time in Celtic concerts.  As it was already the case in the four previous shows, the public is still applauding that the next number is already rolling.  The whole concert is thus only 1h30 long, but there is an extra chapter showing its preparation.  Like the first and third concerts (\\"Celtic Woman\\" and \\"A Christmas Celebration\\"), this one is staged indoors.  This time, it is at the legendary FOX Theater on Peachtree Street in Atlanta.  Maybe the bad souvenir of their fourth concert (\\"Songs from the Heart\\", staged in the gardens of the Powerscourt House in Ireland), where it was raining one hour before the show started, dissuaded the group from giving another outdoor show!  How about a \\"Christmas Concert\\" 2012 in Miami Beach, where it is bright, warm and sunny all year round?  I'm sure that would be a big hit!  Better do it before December 21st, just in case...  If the first four concerts contained mostly well known songs from several countries and epochs, this new one has very few of those immortal numbers and contains many songs that I had never heard before.  Like in all previous shows, this DVD opens with the presentation of the now only three vocalists, angel Máiréad and composer David Downes, Musical Director.  The first number is \\"Awakening\\".  It starts with a few notes from a flute followed by Máiréad and her violin.  Then Chloë, Lisa and Lisa sing with drums in the background during the whole song.  As it was the case in all their concerts, this show combines music, songs and dances, and instead of standing still, our vocalists move and dance continuously in almost every number, fulfilling the goal of French Symbolist playwrights at the end of the XIXth century: \\"Le Spectacle Total\\" (\\"Total Show\\").  \\"Follow On\\", the second number, starts with a choir followed by Lisa Kelly singing a sweet song, contrasting with all the movement of the first one.  \\"The Foxhunter\\" is an instrumental number with Máiréad and her violin at the beginning, joined later by the drums in a very fast melody where she is at her best: she jumps, she dances, she turns like a spinning top, earning a well deserved standing ovation.  The fourth number is \\"Nocturne\\".  Máiréad opens slowly with her violin and Chloë soon arrives singing alone a melancholic song after all the movement from the previous one.  This is followed by \\"Sailing\\", a sweet song interpreted by all three girls,ending with a standing ovation.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", which was a great success in 1969 during the Viet Nam war, is one of the few well known songs in this concert.  Each girl sings a few verses before singing all three together. Then a children's choir jumps in, creating a magic moment, as it is always the case with women's or children's choirs, greater yet when they both join their voices.  This number alone would justify the purchase of this DVD!  Naturally, this was followed by a well deserved standing ovation.  Unlike the audience of Andre Rieu's concert in Ireland, where everybody seemed to be screwed to the chair, the Atlanta public kept going up and down most all the time!  The following number is \\"Black is the Colour\\" (NO misprint: this is the British spelling...), interpreted by Lisa Lambe  \\"The World Falls Away\\", song number 8, opens with a bagpipe; then, all three girls jump in, singing and dancing with drums in the background.  Number 9 is \\"My Heart Was Home Again\\".  Lisa Kelly starts alone, joined later by Lisa Lambe.  \\"A Tribute to Broadway\\" opens with a few words by Lisa Kelly who starts singing the song, soon joined by Chloë.  After a few notes of flute, Kelly Lambe sings alone in the lower stage while the two others climb to the upper stage where the choir is waiting.  After a drums intervention, the choir goes down to the lower stage and all girls sing together the end of the song.  This is followed by another standing ovation.  \\"Téir Abhaile Riú\\" is a fast song favoring dances by the three vocalists and the women's choir.  Four male choristers join them in the upper stage.  Once again, Máiréad plays, runs, jumps and turns around.  A tap dancer does some steps towards the end.  Once again, the public gives a standing ovation.  The following number is \\"A Woman's Heart\\", interpreted by all three vocalists.  This is a nice melancholic song.  \\"The Water is Wide\\", song number 12, is interpreted by Lisa Kelly.  Towards the middle of the song, a bagpipe appears on the upper stage, greeted by applauses as if they were in Scotland!  A choir first, then Chloë Agnew, start \\"Green Grow the Rushes\\" and she is joined by Lisa Kelly and a choir, that keeps them company during the rest of this nice sweet song.  \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\", another well known song, groups all three vocalists, each as a soloist at the beginning and Máiréad behind them; later, the adults and children's choirs jump in, creating another magic moment in this great concert.  As you would expect, this number was followed by an extensive standing ovation.  \\"Smile\\", a famous song composed in the 1950s on a musical theme of Charlie Chaplin's \\"Modern Times\\" (1936) is interpreted by all vocalists, who start a cappella, soon joined discretely by Máiréad.  If you missed \\"A Second Journey\\", rush to your local store, buy it and see the outstanding a cappella interpretation of the immortal \\"Over The Raimbow\\", created by Judy Garland in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" in 1939 and wonderfully interpreted by Suzan Erens in André Rieu's \\"The Flying Dutchman\\".  Once again, this number was followed by a standing ovation.  After \\"Smile\\", \\"Walking the Night\\" is a languorous song.  Lisa Lambe opens it, followed by Chloë.  \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" starts with drums and is interpreted by Lisa Lambe with a choir.  Lots of drums and dancing fill this song full of movement.  \\"Ave Maria\\", Schubert's immortal melody, is mostly interpreted by Chloë as a soloist in the original Latin version.  Hard core opera aficionados will argue that Chloë does not have (yet) the power of Maria Callas, Jessye Norman, Barbara Hendricks, Carmen Monarca, Carla Mafioletti, Renée Fleming or Sarah Brightman, to name just a few among the best known sopranos.  So what?  When the adults and children's choirs jump in from time to time, they create a great atmosphere and the audience gave a well deserved standing ovation at the end.  Máiréad plays \\"Mná Na Héirean\\" with David at the piano.  This starts very slowly but soon becomes a fast melody with the tap dancer we previously saw.  If you like tap dancing, you may see Arthur Duncan, one of the masters in this field, during \\"The Lawrence Welk Show\\", which is broadcasted every Sunday at 7 pm on PBS Channel 2 in Miami.  \\"The Parting Glass\\" is the last number, interpreted by all three vocalists.  They start a cappella, then Máiréad joins them, then the orchestra starts discretely, joined later by bagpipes and the movement goes crescendo to the end.  I was disappointed to see that their usual last number, a masterpiece written by Rolf Loveland and Brendan Graham and made famous by Josh Groban titled \\"You Raise Me Up\\", which concluded their first, second and fourth concerts, was no longer there:  \\"I am strong when I am on your shoulders, you raise me up to more than I can be\\" is the leitmotiv of this great composition.  This song \\"You Raise Me Up\\", which rightfully concluded all of Celtic Woman's previous concerts except for \\"A Christmas Celebration\\", always reminds me of \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde, which I studied with my French students in the \\"Grand Paris\\" during several years:  Our French translation said:  \\"Aimer, c'est se surpasser\\".  \\"Loving, is transcending oneself\\"  Although I still think that \\"A New Journey\\" is Celtic Woman's masterpiece (how could you get any better after you have attained perfection?), I don't regret the purchase of this excellent DVD which contains 21 very good songs, most of which I had never heard in any of the languages that I speak, with several magic moments that I already pointed out in the above synopsis.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. the memory it uses is so worth it. one of my favorite games. a great time waster.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Hello  I watched this movie for the very first time today...yes, my first time with the movie. I held off for numerous reasons, one we had to get a new TV to replace our 2009 Sony LCD. That ended up being a Pansonic 55\\" GT30 Plasma with new Panasonic BDT210 BR player and 3Active 3D glasses. I started out with the 3D movie and thenwtched the normal BR after it.  3D Movie.... as with most 3D movies you have to del with a slightly darker or toned down version from the normal BR due to the tint in the glasses. I changed my sets setting to \\"Vivid\\" with a some tweaks. Now some look at 3D as objects need to move forward and back to exprience it or enjoy it. If you're looking for a movie throwing things at you to make you jump and grab don't bother. It is there to add depth overall and not just motion. In some cases it's better with some scenes than others. Think of Transformers and you think action and this movie doen't disappoint in either action, sound and even 3D. There's penty of standout scenes that provides the viewer with more \\"depth\\" than others. I for one did enjoy the 3D disc.  For the normal BR I consider it almost reference quality ll the way around. You name it, it has it. For someone wanting to know how their TV or a set handles action and motion this BR will put it to the test. For anyone who has a calibrated TV this will also put the set to test in contrast, sharpness, color, details, texture and skin tones. The movie pretty much covers all the bases visually. For audio the True_HD 7.1 track is simply wicked and impressive with excellent surround, good center stage and solid low end. nothing short of a WOW factor.  For some CGI can be either not enough or too much. It needs to be a happy balance of being real and not real yet make believers out of the viewers. If this has too much CGI, not real looking, or unbelievable or fake looking I can only imagine what they call Avatar. With any series of movies one has to expect upping the ante to outdo the previousone. Dark of the Moon does exactlly that by increasing the size, scope, scale of the battle, location, participants. You have real people, real locations, real items, real buildings, real interaction of surroundings with a good balance of CGI thrown in. The camera work and angles is quite impressive. And the detail of the Auto_Bots is simply stunning with the complex machinery and parts. It's not like 75-80% of the film is all CGI. Storyline is in line with the other Transformers movies with the main plot around good and bad Auto-Bots, national security on line with love and family issues in the mix. Overal a fun ride and a sight to behold.  TV...Panasonic 55\\" GT30 (calibrated with custom setting)  BR Player...Panasonic BDT210  3D Galasses....3Active  AVR...Yamaha RX-V671  Speakers....

B003YL4L0W|2.0|Summary of book didn't reveal the true subject matter, which is gay rights. She is a terrific writer, but the issues central to this book just weren't enjoyable reading for me, personally. It would be fine if the summary was honest, but it deceptive to the core!
B001HUHBAE|4.0|How do you make a movie about an unsolved serial murder case? Knowing that the Zodiac killer was never arrested, I was especially curious how they would end the movie. It was revealed gradually that the police did have some intriguing evidence and at least one possible suspect. Though still inconclusive, the movie makes an interesting case and provides an ending which was satisfying enough. As a whole, the movie was a decent mystery brought to life by some interesting characters. Fincher put together a great cast who all turn in good performances, though none are particularly memorable. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the cast as Robert Graysmith, the cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle who develops an obsession with the case. Mark Ruffalo plays Inspector David Toschi, who is kept on the case the longest. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery, the Chronicle reporter who originally covered the case and even received a letter from the Zodiac.  The movie starts with the crimes and the initial investigations. The letters with messages written in code sent by the killer to the newspapers were particularly intriguing. Even when the killer seems to disappear for awhile, the case still has a lasting effect on those involved. Avery turns to drinking and loses his job. Toschi loses his position within the police force when he is incriminated for possibly forging one of the letters. Graysmith's family life is strained by his obsession with the case. The story picks up more speed when Graysmith starts to connect some of the clues on his own while working on a book. The ending comes as close as it can to fingering the killer without conclusively doing so.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|the movie had good specail effect but rating it to the one that had kurt russel this one really stunk the story was lack lustered and not really that good,i would definately not recommend this to someone else ,i would recommend the earlier version alot better written and special affects wre alot better in that version
1400034779|5.0|Compelling story written with insight and great humor on how a woman copes with challening attitudes and gains acceptance, and respect in Botzwana. Very enjoyable and worth reading. One of the cable pay channels created a few shows by the same name that were fantastic...hope they air more episodes soon.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|the movie was good but the fact that there might have been aliens back in the old west are hard to fathun.the movie itself was well written and the plot went along well
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think 101-in,-one games is a really cool. I cant find one like it. it is one of my most used games
B000E97X66|5.0|This record is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of the mid-70s phase of Bruce's career. You get everything from passionate renditions of his FM staples (Born To Run, 4th of July), to reinterpretations of classic album tracks (a soul-infused E Street Shuffle, For You as a moody piano epic), and even a few versions that may, depending on my mood, easily trump their respective album versions (Spirit In The Night, in particular, blows my mind every time). Throw in some great early 60s r&r covers, and you've got a truly amazing set.  One of the best live albums I've ever purchased, and a heck of a listen.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|love the game. stuck though. journal. will not open any suggestions? I have played. grisley manor so not new in playing.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|They did an excellent job with the storyline.  Action sequences are great. The flow of the movie was great-made sense and no awkward jumps from original
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The MicroShell is very elegant and does the job in protecting the Kindle Fire. The elastic band seems like it will last as well as the other parts. I recommend it for that price.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Ok.  I did like the movie more so for the action sequences than anything else.  I never thought Harrison Ford would play a part in a movie like this.  I did enjoy it though.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|Initially, based purely on the app's description, it not only sounded good, but interesting.  Then, based in the reviews of other people, it sounded even better.  Now its time for me to &quot;chime in&quot;, so-to-speak.  To start with, I have the feeling that a large portion of the 5* reviews were written by the developer(s), friends of said developer(s), family of said developer(s) and/or &quot;bloated&quot; reviews written through false accounts, designed to do nothing more than give the app a higher rating, which it, most definitely, does NOT deserve.  While the app is (very) small in size, it takes up valuable space that would be better utilized by better apps.  Even worse is the fact that, for no apparent reason, it can't be moved to a phone's SD card, requiring it to be installed on the phone's even more valuable, and (typically) limited, internal storage.<br /><br />Enough of the app's installation-related problems.  As for the app, itself, it's worthless, &amp; pointless.  As a free app, it's would have been bad enough, but as a paid app, it's purely idiotic.  As pointed out by countless others (some of which put the app down in their review, yet still gave it an undeserved 4* &amp; 5* rating, which makes even less sense), if one could use the app to create a live wallpaper, that would be one thing...but the app has NO purpose, other than to exist.  My time would be better spent sidling on a piece of paper, if for no other reason than, once I'm finished, I, at least, have a hard-copy of what I did.<br /><br />With Gravilux, it's nothing more than a useless, pointless, waste of time...and one that (unless you got it as the &quot;free app of the day&quot;) you actually have to pay for.  In regards to Gravilux, I have but two regrets - first, that I actually wasted the time to download/install it, and second, that I can't give out a 0* (or negative) rating.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I love playing with this app and have made some cool pictures.  just wish app would let me save them.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|Film fanboys tend to think that just because a director is an unlikable, non-populist whackjob, that somehow, he must be a genius. Drive was just awful. Does the guy have a mental disability? What is going on? Why does he act so abnormal towards other people? If the movie admitted that the guy had some sort of mental disability, this might have been a better movie. I don't quite buy the psychopath angle or whatnot. Despite what the fanboys like to claim, this was not a very complicated, deep movie. It is on par with your average Nick Cage, Vin Diesel Fast and Furious movie, in every way. This is a good rental if you're open-minded. If you are a thick person with a movie IQ of a 10 year old, please avoid it. I thought this was an ok movie, but not the greatest film ever made like what some people think.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Ansca Mobile suggested downloading. As a new developer, I see whats possible, cant wait to get better at it. I'm glad I downloaded; this was a great game. I beat it pretty quickly but even with that its still a 5 star game.  Thank you all at Fire Maple &amp; Ansca mobile (Peach Pellen suggestion via FB).
B0034G4P7G|4.0|This movie is fantastic and offers great insight into the genius of Mark Zuckerburg. It is said not to be an entirely accurate tale of the situation, but thats Hollywood.

B000SEGHT6|5.0|Vonnegut marries science fiction and war in Slaughterhouse-Five, creating a world where unimaginable suffering coexists with infinite life. Billy Pilgrim is the clownish, unlikely hero who surmounts death not through extraordinary physical prowess but through madness. His enlightenment on Tralfamadore may be a figment of his imagination, but it is crucial to creating a sense of purpose in his life. It is both a blessing and a curse, giving him the wherewithal to endure trauma, but also ostracizing him from others. As the self-professed sole human being with the key to understanding the secrets of space-time, Billy Pilgrim can finally cope with the tremendous loss he endured in Dresden, but at the expense of his humanity. Though Billy Pilgrim has in reality lost his sanity, his discovery of Tralfamadorian fatalism is his salvation from suicide. With his new view of life comes a rationalization of suffering, pain, and death.  Billy Pilgrim's becoming unstuck in time is a triumphant, albeit imaginary, feat. He is the runt of a survivor turned glorious man. Billy's madness takes him to a magical place where captivity is safe, the universe has already ended, and time warping is possible. Though it leads him to being estranged by society, his insanity saves his life. Had he not found a way to rationalize his memories of suffering, he may as well have given up hope to live. His fatalistic philosophy lets him cope with absurdity, making him a hero who can see the beauty of existence despite being aware of its meaninglessness. He has seen corpses being disintegrated by flame throwers and lived through a plane crash, yet he can make peace with death simply by believing, \\"so it goes.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the graphics are great on the fire. some of the games are harder than others but an all around great game

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game, ally of the games are simple enough for my daughter to use. i also like the concept of having to earn points to unlock more games, it gives me something to look forward to. and some of the games are quite challenging. great app especially cause its a free app :)
B00511PTWM|4.0|I picked this up prior to a 1200 mile drive home (and back) for the holidays for powering a GPS and charging phones. It worked very well, and I have no complaints with regards to its functionality. However, the fit into the 12V socket was very tight, and it required a good bit of force to insert, and care to remove without damaging the outet.

0062082353|4.0|It is a good story.  I thought he was a little into himself but it was real but not well written even though he tried.  It read more like a journal.  Not sure why he wrote it but it is always interesting in knowing more about the military.  These men do deserve all the accolades for serving in Iraq etc.
B0002S94BG|5.0|Wonderful album! I buoght this remastered version to hear the new sound and I think it's very good! The second album doesn't add anything! Grace is the arrival point of Buckley, an album out of time, deep,sad, full of passion and feeling! Everybody should own this album!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|I could spend hours at a time playing Missile Defender. It's a perfect game for the Kindle Fire or an Android-based tablet.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|Thank goodness I only wasted a few bucks renting this nightmare but I am trying to save someone from actually buying this mess.  To say it is a \\"deep\\" \\"layered\\" film is absurd.  It is a painfully slow paced, attempt at a movie along the lines of Pulp Fiction but it never gets close.  Ryan Gosling is void of any acting talent or facial expressions.  I have seen reviews that say his eyes tell the story...uhhh..no.  The lead actress is simply boring.  The graphic violence is meaningless.  There are a couple boobies in one scene but I had to laugh that even there no one in the entire scene has a facial expression.  Just a huge waste.  Run away from the \\"buy\\" button...you will thank me later.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|With four CD's, it should come as no surprise that not every song is a home run.  But overall, this is a FANTASTIC CD that showcases beautifully the astonishing range of Dylan's songwriting.  Each of the four CD's has songs that are fantastic interpretations of timeless songs, and I recommend \\"Chimes of Freedom\\" without hesitation.
B00632HWOG|2.0|either its my kindle or everybodies kindle but every time I get an email my kindle just beeps really loud
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This film is an absolute smash hit with my two kids and four nieces/nephews, aged 5 - 10.  None of them were muppet or Sesame fans before they saw this movie.  They all saw it in the theater twice, to rave reviews.  The key to unlocking the great joy of this movie is in the soundtrack.  We all listened the soundtrack after seeing the movie the first time.  The original music is written by one of those Flight of the Conchords guys, so works on many levels (clever, catchy, funny).  Reminds me of the way that my contemporaries enjoyed Grease back in the day: 1) see the movie, 2) sing the songs, 3) lather rinse repeat.  My first ever DVD pre-order.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The app is good, you get lots of games and points.  Ya only doing this for more points so how u doing?
B004A8ZWW4|2.0|Positive:  Good robot CGI and stand in robots; although this robot image stereotype has been done before especially with the typical toy/cartoon like anatomical features, lights, decals and gestures.  Negatives:  Storyline was made for that big demographic of young males, believers of gimmicky pro-wrestling, closet techie futurists and those needing their umpteenth fix of heartwarming. The recurrent problem is that producers don't want intelligent, creative, thought provoking, challenging movies because they'll lose audience share which means investors won't be happy. So they have the final \\"no\\" if there isn't enough formula story bits and actor marketability.  Thus, acting was bland, read the short lines and stand around looking photogenic. Jackman in his narcissistic body hugging t-shirts was just script acting. Lilly was totally unbelievable as a salvage robot repairman; cast only an an attractive romantic interest for Jackman. Goyo also photogenic cast for mass marketing reasons.  The script writing both dialogue and scene construction were just inane, stupid, dumb. Unless your'e under the age of 13 and haven't seen more than a small number of movies by which to compare. The dialogue sounded like it came from \\"The Dummies Guide to Formulaic Scriptwriting\\" book. Practically every line has been heard so many times in movies you could say them before the actors. Unimaginative storyline: Son is forced to live with uncaring, never seen, dad. They form a bond based on shared fantasy of game playing. Bad Eastern European foes supported by bad Japanese techies - stereotyping! Boy finally changes dad by his more adult like behavior. Feel good happy ending.  Main ethical points of the movie were:  (1.) Challenging a parent for a payoff.  (2.) Stealing is OK, just be sneaky about it.  (3.) Fighting is OK, as long as you win.  (4.) Winning, usually at whatever the cost, is what's important. Of all the other ways to build understanding and compassion the movie chose sellingthe American way.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|As I type this, I've got the book sitting in my house. I'd purchased it before the movie came out, but held off because I knew how much of a literary purist I am when it comes to book to film adaptations. So here's a warning: I'm not sure how true this is to the book, but I know enough about the book to know that they did change things here and there. OK, now with that disclaimer, on with the review.<br /><br />I loved this movie, but it helped that I saw it with a good audience. (Sometimes screaming teenagers can really help bring the tension up.) Radcliffe does a pretty good job in this movie. I was a little afraid that I'd spend much of the movie unable to distance him from the character of Harry Potter and also unable to see him as someone who had a kid, but he did pretty well in this and was able to carry the film. (Which he'd have to since a huge bulk of the movie is Radcliffe by himself.)<br /><br />The real gem to the movie are the costumes and surroundings. I hate to say that I was more enchanted with the house and \\"island\\" that the Woman in Black haunted as well as with the excellent costumes. Someone put a lot of time and thought into these and it shows. Everyone looks fantastic here. If you're a costume or setting fan, you'll undoubtedly love this movie.<br /><br />If you're a horror fan? Well, you'll probably enjoy the film for the gothic atmosphere and the jump scares (ie, the scenes where a ghost jumps out at someone). It's not the greatest gothic horror film ever made, but it's still good enough to where you'll probably walk out of the theater loving it and wanting to see it again at some point in time. The only thing that disappointed me is that I just got the feeling that there could have been a little more to it and that it relied a little overly much on the jump scares to push the tension along. Even the screaming teenagers eventually got a little quiet after a while. They were drawn into the movie but after a while they, just like everyone else in the theater, got somewhat used to the Woman In Black jumping out at people.<br /><br />Overall though, this movie does what it set out to do: entertain. It's incredibly entertaining and I have no doubt that it'll end up getting various fan awards because of it. It's also just enough to push Radcliffe out of his Harry Potter box to where it'll make it more likely that people can see him as someone other than \\"that Potter kid\\". This is a great little film and I had a blast watching it. (I'll probably buy it when it comes out on DVD.) In my opinion, it's worth going to see in the theaters.sed to the Woman In Black jumping out at people.  Overall though, this movie does what it set out to do: entertain.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|The 2006 movie \\"Inside Man\\" would appear to have a lot going for it: a tense plot built around a hostage situation in a New York City bank, a handful of first rate actors, and an accomplished director with a real feel for his native city.  However, this movie might be too clever for its own good.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bank heist that gets interrupted by the police, turning into a hostage situation.  NYPD Detective Frazer (Denzel Washington) gets tagged to be the on-scene negotiator, and runs into trouble dealing with a senior uniformed cop (Willem Dafoe), the leader of the heist crew (Clive Owen), and a high-level New York City fixer (Jodie Foster in serious high heels) dispatched by the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer).  Frazer patiently works the hostage problem while increasingly becoming aware that he is being played.<br /><br />This movie is strongest in its presentation of \\"how things get done\\" in NYC, with overtones of racial prejudice, official corruption, and deal-making everywhere.  Every principal character is potentially flawed in his or her motivations.  Meanwhile, the tension builds relentlessly toward a crisis point in the hostage negotiations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie undermines its own suspense by telling the story backwards and forwards; the audience knows early on who survives.  The secret at the heart of an admittedly clever heist plot is poorly handled, leading to an ending without much fizz.  The movie's moral punch line is muddied by all the deal-making, including by the supposed good guys.  \\"Inside Man\\" isn't a bad movie; it just isn't all it could have been.

Slowly the suspense builds and soon you find you can't put the book down as it hurdles towards the climax. I had to read the last 1/4 of the book in one night just to get to the end of the story.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I think Suzanne Collins watched Star Wars quite a bit when she was writing this series.  Nowhere is it more apparent to me than in \\"Catching Fire\\"  The entire book reeks of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".  The darkness...the hopelessness...even the ending reminds me of the 2nd George Lucas masterpiece.  And it was full of twists that i did not expect.  It was definitely an entertaining read, can't wait to begin the 3rd book to see how it all ends!
B005NQ94KS|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as I enjoy watching Anne Hathaway and love a good romance. From the start it looked pretty good and the premise of their first (remembered) encounter in July 15 1988 and peeking in on the same date through the years was a an interesting idea.  Somehow, the movie seemed likable but disjointed, as you only had a bit of insight into what had happened the entire year before.  I found it especially hard at the end to feel anything but disappointed.  My husband and I both looked at each other, shook our heads and said nearly in unison \\"Worst movie, EVER\\".<br /><br />Overall, I am not quite sure who may like this movie, like I said I enjoy a good romance, but this just isn't one I could recommend.

0446573019|3.0|I really liked the book but being a Lee Child fan for many years I got distracted several times by the obvious similarities of the main characters that made me laugh. So you reach or pull? You are John or Jack? Same physical type, still a loner. Yes, it is an interesting read, very fast paced but Baldacci should have been less obvious on the parallels. One of our friends even suggested that the author's name should have been \\"Levy Kid\\" ... get the joke? Instead of \\"Lee Child\\"?

140120841X|5.0|V for Vendetta is a classic. It is Orwellian and done for a modern audience. What else can I say. They don't come along like this one often.    Just saw this being offered for sale this Spring on Amazon. The graphic novel NEVSKY. A timeless story of the battle for freedom through patriotism is retold in a vibrant new form this Spring with Nevsky, an original graphic novel adaptation of Sergei Eisenstein's classic film \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" (1938). Written by Ben McCool (Memoir, Pigs) with art by rising star Mario Guevara (Solomon Kane, Victorian Undead) and edited by Scott Dunbier, this full-length graphic novel is a stunning re-imagination of Eisenstein's famed film. What a great idea for a new modern audience. Here is a link I found for the graphic novel: [...]. I did a little research and found some of Eisenstein's other pictures as well. Orson Wells used many of the techniques of montage in CITIZEN KANE that was pioneered by Eisenstein. All the great directors have studied Eisenstein's work and we see the result in film being made today.    The battle for people to be free resonates in the graphic novel, NEVSKY and in the film by Sergei Eisenstein also a classic.
B004P52NP6|4.0|Clearly this band trys hard to be the Snake of old, but they fall a touch short here.  Don't get me wrong, there are some very, very good songs on here and to each their own.  \\"Forevermore\\", is one of the best Whitesnake songs I've ever heard - superb, and worth buying the whole record.  There are other good tracks on here.  My slight disappointment is in their sound..  The recording sounds a bit scooped to me (less midrange than normal Snake).  Oh well, I still dig D. Aldrich and Reb Beach from the older days they still tear it up nice on this record.  Perhaps, my mp3 download is why mine sounds a little scooped..??  The truth is this.. how can any Snake album compare to their 1987 days..  Still of the night etc.  Hard to raise the bar from that.  4 stars.
0618918248|2.0|Richard Dawkins starts his book out with an excellent explanation for the points of view of many atheists, their beliefs, and some confusion around phrases they use and what they mean.  His explanation was lucid and believable.  If the entire book was like that, I'd give it 4 stars, leaving off one star because the title would not fit the content.  However, he afterwards dives straight into an analysis of sorts of Judeo-Christian beliefs (especially Christianity) and a critique of them.  This critique he does poorly.  He certainly seems to be an excellent authority in his field, but he is an amateur in the field of Christian and Jewish theology.  Throughout the book he takes many Biblical passages out of context, completely misses the concept of the Jewish perspective of God, and even commits quite a few logical fallacies, such as trying to indicate a religion is somehow immoral based on sinful actions that some religious figures commit that the Bible, Torah, and Koran all condemn.  If theists were allowed to commit this fallacy, they could determine that atheism is illogical and immoral by finding some examples of illogical and immoral atheists.  At one point in the book he specifically mentions what he finds to be his most powerful reason for believing God does not exist, that is that God is \\"improbable\\" because of the infinite regression argument--that is, if the universe is so complex it is highly improbable it would exist without a Designer, God must be so much more complex and would be even less probable to exist without a greater designer, into infinite regression, so existence without God is the most probable answer.  This poor argument against God, which Mr. Dawkins says is his best one, is one large reason why I find this book so disappointing.  Mr. Dawkins believes in an uncreated universe.  Well, Jews and Christians believe in an uncreated God.  To assert that the Judeo-Christian God is created would be a straw-man argument, which is, of course, fallacious.  Even leaving that aside, Mr. Dawkins is claiming probability with respect to God; unfortunately, I don't think he realizes how probability works.  For probability, you have to have an idea of possibilities.  For example:  If I have a coin with a heads side and a tails side, I know I have 2 possible outcomes if I flip it.  I can calculate the possibilities.  Mr. Dawkins, however, can't actually show that the state of \\"no God\\" is even a valid option.  If, hypothetically, the universe existed without God, it doesn't prove God doesn't exist.  If that were the case, \\"God\\" and \\"no God\\" could be possible options.  If, however, God created the universe, the universe is evidence that God exists and \\"no God\\" is not an option.  The latter example would be the equivalent of having a coin with heads on both sides and Mr. Dawkins claims that the \\"tails\\" side of the coin is more probable.  Unless Mr. Dawkins proves either that the universe existed without God's help or can somehow prove some other nature of God, he does not know the possibilities of the existence of God or gods and cannot know the probability, making his argument entirely based on opinion.  So, the beginning of the book enlightened me about atheists and their perspectives.  The rest of the book disappointed me with lack of logic and reason.  For a eloquent and less inaccurate discussion of God, try Christopher Hitchens.  If you want a good argument against God, you will not find it here.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|It's simple... If you love great Rock-N-Roll, this record is for you.  All of these guys are studio quality musicans (they are better than professional musicans) and all of them make a contribution herein.  I'm so happy to have stumbled into this group.  I recently heard Joe Bonamassa' solo stuff and liked some of it, but lamented about it being too blues-redundant.  Joe B, goes off into rock-roots here, and also on the follow up record BCC2.  If you dig Zeplin, AC/DC, Clapton and Deep Purple this is a new era version of the all.  Truly outstanding!! And, some of the better music that I've heard in the last 20 years.  Where has this been????  Buy it you'll love it (get the second one too).

B006QPVH6O|5.0|First off I must say that any movie that sheds a negative light (fictitious or not) on America's Apollo missions is going to get a lot of one star reviews. When the director of the film is a non-American you can then double the one star reviews. With the recent cancellation of America's Apollo missions you can then double again the one star reviews. I'm not sure if there is any other topic that most Americans are so hyper sensitive about than the Apollo moon landings. It's so extreme to be bordering on maniacal. The mere mention to someone that the moon landings might have been staged sends most Americans into a hyper frenzy to the point that the topic can't be discussed or debated without Apollo supporters throwing barbs and punches. So you know a movie such as this is going to get most people writing a negative review whether the movie deserves one or not. Sure the reviewer will claim the film is implausible or boring or what have you, but the heart of it is that they don't like America's most storied historical achievement (assuming of course that it actually happened) being tarnished in any way, shape or form - especially by a non-American.<br /><br />As for the movie itself I found it very entertaining and very suspenseful. I liked the hand held cam and the \\"file footage\\" style to the \\"documentary.\\" I thought it worked well in this film. The pace of the film was good too - leading up to a dramatic and suspenseful though not entirely unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />FINAL GRADE: A
B004MC8CA2|3.0|its sorta rude to God.don't you think that you should have a real Bible and not a virtual one? i really think that if any Bible.i don't know what to rate it so i put it in the middle and gave it a 3
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|To the point: This action/horror hybrid was filmed using Red Epic 3D cameras on the set for most of the film, and the result? Good 3D in Underworld Awakening. When the movie starts, it's in 2D highlighting the previous films, but then it switches to 3D and wow. For 3D, I consider it great when the foreground, mid ground and background pop very clearly from one another in depth so there's no mistake it's 3D. This is clearly the case with Underworld Awakening during many scenes, but sometimes, the 3D pales and looks a bit flat during non action moments. The 3D is comparable to Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, which used the Fusion Cameras as Avatar 1 did.<br /><br />Underworld Awakening 3D: Top notch 3D that has excellent depth and pop, as well as some 'pop out' moments with Selene's famous throwing stars and the Lycans attacking the screen. Very slick and stylish action throughout and Kate Beckinsale is fun to watch. The main storyline takes place 12 years after the 2nd film, Underworld Evolution.<br /><br />Movie: 8/10 Story was basic, but reveals unanswered questions.<br />Action: 9/10 Plenty of stunts, blazing guns, martial arts and monsters. Nicely done.<br />3D: 8/10 This was filmed in 3D using 3D cameras and looks GREAT at times.<br />Recommended: YES, if you like this genre of movies. Don't pass this one up.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Absolutely Amazing - This book was Fifty Shades of Awesomeness !!! Oh , what a fantastic and epic conclusion to such an awe filled series . E.L James , you are definitely a wonder woman . Honestly , i was like - ' Oh my god , fifty is no longer gonna be around * Sob * * sob * , but the feeling that this book leaves you with , oh so everlasting .  So many good points to mention , and many new shades of Christian and surprisingly Ana too , phew this book was a nerve racking ride . Wow , wow and just wow . Words cannot comply the after effects of this book .  The Fifty Shades Trilogy has definitely been an emotional rollercoaster ride . Starting from 'Fifty Shades of Grey ' where we meet the uber handsome controlling godlike Christian Grey and extremely shy and nervous Anastasia Steele to 'Fifty Shades Darker ' where we meet the torn yet still controlling Christian and the head-strong but madly in love Anastasia to ' Fifty Shades Freed' where me meet the obsessed and very much in love but still controlling Christian and his beautiful , petite , still head strong but brave and a little arrogant at times Anastasia . Thats quite a transition , atleast that's how i saw it . What i really loved about the trilogy was that we could see the characters , transform or grow as the series drew its end . Man i'm seriously going to miss it .  Although i loved everything about the book , i felt some points needed special mentioning . Christain Grey being of grave importance , oh man i cant get enough of him can i ?? .. He moved me with his ways in the first and second book , and he manages to do it again in this book too . And Anastasia , oh my god !! She had me completely speechless stunned . Defying fifty's instructions , orders and pleas all the freaking time , i loved her ... Very warrior like .  A very important thing that i need to mention , and i've been wanting to say it for a really long time - I have never read any book that is so high on style and sophistication as the Fifty Trilogy . GAWD , the clothes , the cars , the leisurely activities , the high life of the rich and famous its all here baby and the kinky funkery ... * super jealous * !  One important lesson that i have learnt fron this book - LOVE CONQUERS ALL ! It makes past experiences forgettable , present worth living and future something to look forward to . Christain Grey had it all , but had never experienced love . Anastasia gave him what he always longed for . Relationships are always about understanding each others needs . At times it needs compromising , sometimes it needs sacrifices . But the most important of all is being unconditional . Ana's love was unconditional . She loved her Fifty for everyrthing he is , was and will be . Fifty on the other hand , changed his ways for Ana . He wanted to be the man Ana wanted him to be . He was ready to go from a control freak to a cool dude for her . Oh what love !! * Wipes away happy tears* Reading Fifty trilogy - best experience of my life .  E.L James , you rock !!

B000002VRZ|4.0|The Outlaws<br />Best of The Outlaws / Green Grass and High Tides<br /><br />This is a very good hits CD from a very good band.  As others have pointed out, this is no substitute for having the original albums, but that is true of any Hits CD for any group.  This exists for those of us who aren't interested in owning All of their albums.  We just want the best songs that The Outlaws have produced, in a single and inexpensive disc.  This CD does just that.  This CD covers the band over the five albums they made in their first five years (from 1975 to 1980) and does a wonderful job of picking the right songs to represent their early (and best) period.  This not only shows their strengths but their weaknesses as all of these songs have high energy, but not all the songs are memorable.  Overall, this is a very entertaining album and a great representation of the group, which earns it a very solid Four Stars.

B0038W0OHQ|2.0|Ive had these for about half a year before i had to send them in for repairs  due to the cord breaking inside the cable plug, at very carefull use.  Hoping it was a solitary incident i got my replacement. These can loose connection to the  left ear if held at wierd angle (for example while the headbuckle is resting on the back of your neck).  In geneal every now and then the sound fades over to the right ear, which can only be resolved  by removing and reinserting the plug and tapping the left ear shell. I am pretty sure this is due to loose cables/bad soldering inside the headset. The sound quality is great, they sit well  but are a bit tight on the ears, which can become uncomofortable after prolonged use.  Overall i dont recommend this ,as they should be free of all the above mentioned issues at such a price.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first DVD that I had purchased in my Jillian Michaels collection. What drew me to it, was the fact that it claimed to be only 20 minutes long(its actually like 27 with the warm up and cool down) and I thought, \\"Who doesnt have 20 minutes a day to exercise?\\" So I bought it. I was not disappointed. It kicked my butt at first!! I was sore, but kept on it and did each level for about 10 days each, before moving onto the next. That was in January of 2011 and I am down 18 lbs! I have, of course, since than, bought most of Jillians other DVDs and done them. I alternate most of them and the levels to keep my workouts from getting stale, and sometimes do even go back to Shred when Im getting bored with the other workouts. It will be one that I keep for sure. It's short but intense and it's a great beginner DVD. Her others since, seem to get more intense, which I love, but like I said earlier, who doesn't have a half hour a day to work towards better health? I would highly recommend this as a great starter DVD and I do recommend it to all my friends. I have never watched Jillian on The Biggest Loser, but I love her in her workout DVDs. She is bossy, no nonsense, let's get down to business and I like that. Great DVD!!
B001KQIRGW|5.0|\\"Back in the day\\" I liked Genesis but paid more attention to \\"prog rock\\" bands that were a little more flashy, or more pompous or perhaps darker and bluesier.  As an adult I have a new found appreciation for their slightly more subtle music.  There is a huge amount going on and perhaps my 15-year-old mind didn't catch it.  I don't know, all I know is that these days I enjoy Genesis more than Yes or ELP or King Crimson or Pink Floyd or.....  well, pretty much any or the bands from that era.<br /><br />And if I had to choose one album I think Foxtrot would have to be it.<br /><br />From the opening chords of Watcher of the Skies you know there is something special happening.  Of course you have Genesis at it's most theatric in Get 'Em Out by Friday - a mini play in music with Gabriel doing different voices for different characters. And Supper's Ready is perhaps the greatest creation of the band - not as slick as The Lamb, but more tightly composed.<br /><br />Oh, I do love other Genesis almost as much.  Selling England by the Pound is wonderful and I even like the post Gabriel albums, even Duke.But there is just something special about Foxtrot that places it at the top of my list.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This is a book by a relatively new author, the first in a series, and I loved it! I was looking for something new to read and came across this one- wasn't sure if I would be interested as I'm not a big vampire junkie, with the exception of Buffy and Angel. I do enjoy some supernatural books and this appeared to be more than just another vampire story- and sure enough- it is absolutely not just another vampire story. It is absent a weak, whimpering female character, and each character in the book has some depth. The story unfolds well, without a lot of unnecessary descriptions- but the necessary stuff is there. The ending is not what one would suspect, and I am looking forward to the next book in the series. Although this book could easily stand alone, knowing there is a sequel makes me hungry for more. If you enjoy Kay Hooper, Tolkien, J.K. Rowling or Stephanie Meyer, you'll likely enjoy this book. (Though for the record, I'm not a fan of Twilight so if you aren't either, don't let that stop you from reading this book.)
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|This was a good can't-put-down book , though I was disappointed with the ending.  It was well written and flowed well.  I felt like it ended really abruptly and wish the author had put in as much effort with the ending as he did with the rest of the content.

For the Season 2 box set we are treating to three episodes featuring the tribbles: the original Star Trek episode, the episode from the animated Stark Trek series, and the Deep Space Nine episode that ties into the original Star Trek episode.  My only two complaints would be that the top right corner of the Season 2 box set was shattered.  Fortunately I noticed this before pulled off the security seal tape and slit the tape down the middle.  The tape is holding the broken bits together.  The second complaint is that Disc 5 in the Season 3 box set wouldn't play in my Blu-ray player.  When you load the disc you see the CBS splash screen and then you see the screen showing it downloading updates, and then at the seventeen second mark the playback stops.  I will have to check into getting a replacement disc.

B005LAIGPA|5.0|The Chronicle creators (writer Max Landis, Director Josh Trank) have cleverly melded three common plot devices used individually for multiple other films: finding a mysterious object that affects characters (Green Lantern, etc.), the achievement of super powers through circumstance (Fantastic Four, etc.), and telekinesis (Zapped, Firestarter, Carrie, Phenomenon, Push, etc.).<br /><br />In this hodge-podge, three unlikely friends - Andrew (DeHaan), Matt (Russell), Steve (Jordan) - find themselves with amazing powers, abilities that at first are used for fun and pranks but later turn to darker purposes.  Thought of as a muscle to be strengthened, the powers develop as the trio experiment more and more.  They soon find out, however, that excessive or strenuous use causes nosebleeds.  What's more, they learn the powers are dangerous when the fun and games end.<br /><br />Filmed primarily through a hand-held camera, Chronicle manages to embrace newer techniques and fresh perspective without causing epileptic seizures (looking at you, Cloverfield).  Driven by Andrew's desire to document everything he's experiencing in life, in high school, at home with his drunken father, the hand-held camera holds purpose but is somewhat superfluous.  Especially since later scenes exploit the superpower angle to use the handheld camera at lengths far enough away to fully grasp scenes with action.  Very rarely do I truly enjoy this style of filmmaking, but the usage is sparse enough and unique enough to transcend inherent flaws.<br /><br />Despite the recycled troubled teenagers angle and tired lessons about the dangers of power, the script is crisp.  Dialogue is witty, engaging, and realistic.  Like teens of today talk.  Not at all a forced hip, unrealistic, inauthentic, or self righteous like everything Diablo Cody writes.  Each member of the young cast shows talent, making the most of their lines at least enough to convince viewers of their status on the High School food chain.<br /><br />Overall the effort is exciting and enticing, enough to draw in viewers emotionally while still providing enough FX action to terrorize the Seattle landscape with familiar yet fresh mutant vs. mortal X-Men themes.  This film soars high and overdelivers the entire time.nticing, enough to draw in viewers emotionally while still providing enough FX action to terrorize the Seattle landscape with familiar yet fresh mutant vs. mortal X-Men themes.

1609611543|5.0|I am 62 years old and I had long thought something must be wrong with me as no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not lose weight.  Not only that, but I had for over 20 years suffered with severe GERD, using up to 2 prilosec a day.  Within two days of eliminating wheat from my diet, I no longer had any GERD and have not had it for the past 11 months I have been wheat free.  In addition, without dieting, I have lost 23 pounds and feel so much better with lots of energy!  I highly recommend this book!  I guarantee it will change your life!

B005EHILV4|1.0|I've recently bought this mixer/soundcard.  It's highly interesting with phantom powered mic in, clip/signal LED's, EQ etc in a small form factor.  Unfortunately it turns out that:  1: MIC input is not horrible with very loud signals, but it will sound noisy like a (bad)cassette recording if you record \\"quiet\\" sources like speech 10-15\\" away.  2: Clip/signal indicator is not related to the USB recording clipping level.  3: MIC in is always routed to mix out  4: Some condensor mics sound more noisy than others on it. That could be due to the 15V phantom power.  Other comments:  The mixer looks and feels like a quality device.  The Ipad can NOT power it.  Headphone out can be loud if needed, and sounds OK when NOT fed from the mic in.  Some guy has made a very noisy youtube review of it. I can confirm the noise level.  Unfortunately I didn't keep the box, so I'll have to keep the mixer.

George RR Martin paints a fantastic landscape using his words and they create an environment that immerses the reader in a mythical landscape from the opening prologue of the very first book. I will continue to wait eagerly for the final installments in this epic series of books

B004EPYZOO|3.0|Even as I was watching this movie, I was having quite the time trying to process what I was seeing.  Without all the noisy distractions, the story is surprisingly basic, I've actually seen similar: good and bad.  The plot: a crazy cult leader kills the daughter of Milton (Nicolas Cage), kidnaps his infant granddaughter, AND plans to sacrifice the baby to herald in a new world order.  Seen it.  What makes this one a tad different is Milton is already dead and has to escape from hell in order to rescue his granddaughter.  Mayhem ensues, on a grand scale; it doesn't help that Nicolas also has to evade The Accountant (William Fichtner), sent by you-know-who, to capture and send Milton back to hell.  It's actually just a real long chase movie, a case of follow the crazy leader.  There are no real surprises along the way, a few shocks, a few bumps in the road, but nothing truly awe inspiring.  If you've seen one explosion.....really, there's only so much you can do with fire.  If you stripped the movie of all the garish violence, blood, and noise there'd be little left but a story that can be summed up in one sentence.  In other words, when things aren't exploding or people getting shot or run over, it's pretty dull: ordinary, sad, and not a little limp.  Cage obviously did it for the money and I hope he got paid up front because this was a huge box office bomb, not even the take from foreign markets could help recoup the cost.  (So don't expect a sequel.)<br />However, I did like some of it.  I was pleasantly surprised by William Fichtner's performance (usually a one note actor known for playing the same bad guy, repeatedly).  I thought he was hysterical.  Amber Heard was also good as Piper, someone Milton picks up along the way.  And it's always nice to see Tom Atkins in anything.  As for Nicolas Cage, it's hard to tell whether he purposely made Milton so low-key that he appeared comatose at times, or, dead, or he just wasn't trying because he felt the material was beneath him.  At any rate, I'm not sorry I watched it once, it was okay, I just can't see myself watching it again.him.

1401323952|5.0|Like this cookbook because it is great for a small family of 3 like ours. Her recipes cater more towards small servings. Also the ingredients are everyday ingredients which you may already have in your pantry or are not hard to find at the local grocery store. Her recipes are also just good home cooking. I would definetly recommend this cookbook.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This meditation timer is something I've looked for a long time. It lets you select times, sounds, intervals. It keeps logs displayable as bar charts showing time meditating for the past ten days, ten weeks, ten months. You can connect with others using the app. You can save favorite settings, such as a 30 minute session starting with one bell, bells at ten minute intervals, 3 bells to end, and have multiple such settings saved. This is the best app I've ever gotten for my Kindle Fire,and one that gets used every day.

The way you can change to read different versions of the Bible is fantastic, BUT I GREATLY DISLIKE that u have to b connected to the Internet just to b able to read it and that it CONSTANTLY runs in the background is why I took it off my Android.

B006IVBSBU|4.0|Great movie. Placed me in the mindset of \\"Outbreak\\" with Morgan Freeman.  It follows many different storylines about a viral epidemic that has forced the entire global community into its clenches. The characters, minor & major, all play a role in finding the cause and cure of the plague.  Highly recommendable.

1451627289|5.0|I have read the majority of Stephen King's novels, but this is by far one of his best.  From the first chapter, the book pulls you in, and if you think it is predictable - think again.  The book is a story in a story, and you do not have to be a JFK junkie to enjoy it.  The fact is, I enjoyed the parts of the book that had nothing to do with JFK and the story behind the assasination, the best.  Unlike most King novels, there are no real horrors or supernatural occurances - just the scientific confusion associated with time travel.  King will have a difficult time surpassing this one.  I recommend it highly!

0399536108|5.0|I have been following Chris's blog for quite a few months now, and his material is really something I prize highly. When I finally realized he had a book I had to order.  Well this book is everything I had hoped for. Chris gives great advice, relates it with amazing examples, and was everything I was looking for. I have only read it once, but I will be going back for my second go around very soon !  If you follow his blog you will love his book, if your a person looking for someone to inspire you to perhaps doing something amazing in your life, this is a great book as well!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! Love the ability to navigate easily and all the reading plans available. The app om my Kindle Fire makes ghd Bible so very portable.
B002E2M5J6|3.0|The video quality of this Blu ray was excellent, the music was excellent, but like other reviewers, I found the audio quality to be sub par.  It was muddy and flat sounding.  They did a terrible job with this audio mix.  It was still worth $15, especially if you are going to us just your tv for the audio.  But if you play through your audio system, you'll be disappointed.  Would have been five stars if the audio was better.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works great anywhere and everywhere! Very useful on my kindle fire for my notes and reminders when an idea strikes.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Everyone's entitle to their own opinion, sure. If you want to give this movie a terrible rating b/c you didn't enjoy it you have every right. If you give it a bad review b/c it's not \\"Fast and the Furious #17\\" or b/c you believe you were mislead from the previews, I'm sorry, but I blame you, your lack of research, and you're opinion isn't justified. This movie is based on a book that plays out at a very deliberate pace. The film is Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn:(Bronson, Vahalla Rising, The Pusher Trilogy)- is he the type of director that would direct a traditional action film? No, look at his previous work. Do Ryan Gosling or Carey Mulligan strike you as the types of actors that would star in a traditional action film based on their previous work? No, of course not. Some of you people didn't do your homework before watching this. Read some rottentomatoes.com reviews before you go watch a movie next time. It's clearly defined as an art house movie on steroids. This was a great film that's paced perfectly with a mysterious main character known only as \\"Driver\\". Great plot twists with a wonderful cast. It is an ART HOUSE movie, not fast and the furious, let's make that clear. If you're smarter than a 5th grader and/or have a love for the cinema, than I think you will enjoy this movie. There are 4 car sequences (2 chases, a stunt roll, and a high impact crash) so don't let these people depicting only one car sequence detour you, but at the same time, it isn't a nicolas cage film. It has depth, pace, style, and unique flavor.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love the look and feel of this case; it looks like an old book, but feels like suede. It has pockets in the inside front flap where I like to store little notes and to-do lists. It looks great and adds little weight to your Kindle Fire. I feel that I got exactly what I wanted- an attractive, but functional and sturdy case for my Kindle Fire.

B001OY5X2Q|5.0|This is probably the Banshees' most immediately accessible album, and it is also one of their best. The lyrics are as dark as ever, but it never sounds overwhelming. To my ears, Tinderbox ranks with Juju at the very top of their catalog, although it is a very different style of album. The sound is definitely guitar-driven alternative rock circa the mid 80s. The songs are excellent. The album is most known for the single Cities in Dust, but The Sweetest Chill and the trio of songs that immediately closed the original album (on my aging vinyl) are much better: Party's Fall, 92 Degrees, and Land's End. This album also works as an album with a cohesive sound and theme. Highly Recommended.
1451627289|3.0|I think this is very well written..the research for the years depicted is incredible..many things I remember, but I think King got too carried away at the beginning, and probably included two or three books he was writing into one..all about time travel.  I have never been a fan of time travel..don't believe in it..usually like the telling of things exactly like they were, and I have never been a Stephen King fan (although I loved \\"Misery\\"), but I was intrigued with the story about JFK, since I have been a non-stop reader of all related items about him.  I would say, although the writing and some of the stories are good, GET ON WITH THE STORY!  Just because King got interested in writing about all these years and times doesn't mean the book should not be edited. But some of the remembrances are great, like the drinks they had...a \\"Co-Cola\\".. However, so far I have a new respect for Stephen King's writing..you feel like you were there, and some of it is very nostalgic for me.<br />When one finally gets to the part about the Kennedy Assassination..and that should have been a much thinner book..there are many glaring things that are missing.<br />I have read countless books about the assassination, and feel that King missed many important issues, which is why I read the book.  I lived in New Orleans during the assassination time, and there were a lot of things that happened here that affected or caused the assassination.  King researched things pretty well, but he missed two books that could have affected why the President was assassinated.  One is \\"Dr. Mary's Monkey\\" by Edward T. Haslam and the other is \\"Me and Lee\\" by Judyth Vary Baker.  Stephen King didn't even know that Lee Oswald had an affair with a worker that worked beside him at the Reily Company, and in both of these books he would have found the Mafia connection with Carlos Marcellos, and other undercover forces that were going on.  This has never been even part of the Warren Commission studies..and he wouldknow that Oswald was just a \\"patsy\\" for these people..and there were more than one person shooting.  I was really disappointed that he didn't have anything about these things in his book.<br />He is a good writer and keeps one reading, but I had much rather this 3 inch thick book had more things connected with the assassination than his other things in the book.  These books are a goldmine of information about the assassination that King missed.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I thought the book was very enjoyable to read. This book was fun to read.  I recommend this book for people who like reading about adventures.
B0067LY4WG|1.0|This album is trash! Dude just talks over some old banjo beats for twelve songs. Straight Garbage! He sounds like Freddy Kreuger with a hangover or constipated Batman. Do not buy this album if you want music. This is as much as music as audio books which actually have more rhythm.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|Great movie with a great plot and a really unique filming perspective. I love how this movie hints at some actual political issues that we face in reality.
B00006AW2S|4.0|The Review, This is a really good old Stones album. I had it back in the 60's and I enjoy it today, it's worth the price. Mick plays more harmonica than usual on this paticular album and the songs are very, very good. I like all the songs on this, but inparticular, West Coast Promotion Man, The Spider and the Fly, and One More Try. Satisfaction was their big hit from this album, but if I was to vote the least favorite song on this one, it would be Hitch Hike, but I don't skip it when I'm listening to it. Micks harp playing is great and I think any rocker will enjoy this classic music. Thankyou kindly, Mike  GODSDOG, almighty!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|i gave it a one because it slows down your device. every person i have met had this app and it slowed down. even my friend had a brand new kindle fire and this was her first game. she played it and it automatically just slowed. DONT GET THIS APP

B005LAIIS0|5.0|I went in Expecting a Liam Neeson survival action flick, excited but with modest expectations.  What it is is wholly different. The Grey is a nearly impeccable look at human psyche faced with wild death. A grim masterpiece. Deeply disturbing but not overtly graphic, It shows restraint with such control I was worried til the last shot that somehow the illusion would break and the movie would fall into some cliche.  I didn't know Neeson could act that hard... I wil see it again in theaters.  Spiritual successor to The Thing (1982).

B0064NTZJO|1.0|Usually >90% Rotten Tomatoes = at the very least a watchable movie, often a great movie.<br /><br />In this case, the RT rating is wrong -- this is probably the worst movie I've seen in the past decade.  No plot.  No dialogue.  Limited action scenes.  Ryan Gosling's acting is actually good, but this is like Pulp Fiction with a bad plot and no dialogue (Pulp Fiction was a great movie precisely because it was able to combine all those elements flawlessly into a truely original movie -- this movie is a terrible attempt to copy it because movies without dialogue, plot, or action rarely work -- I can't think of a single one that does -- seriously, what is next for Refn: an Indiana Jones w/o dialogue, plot, or action?).<br /><br />I would love to hear about another movie that both:  (1) has a >90% RT score, and (2) was given a 1 star rating by >25% of all Amazon reviewers, as is currently the case for Drive.  Some people might like this movie, which of course is perfectly fine (and no need to tag this review as not helpful if that is the case), but if you are thinking about watching this movie based solely on the high RT rating -- this is just a warning that explains why you might not like it.

B005LAIGP0|5.0|\\"The Woman In Black\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Arthur Kipps is a widowed lawyer whose grief has endangered his career. When he is sent to a remote village to sort out the affairs of a recently deceased eccentric, it soon becomes clear that everyone in the town is keeping a terrible secret. Although the locals try to hide the town's tragic history from Kipps, he soon learns that his client's house is haunted by the ghost of a woman who is looking for someone and something she had lost, and until she finds it, no one is safe from her vengeance.  The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Arthur) is great. The directing by James Watkins is great. The screenplay (based on Susan Hill's novel) by Jane Goldman is great.  The music by Marco Beltrami is great. The cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones is great. The film editing by Jon Harris is great. The casting by Karen Lindsay-Stewart is great. The production design by Kave Quinn is great. The art direction by Paul Ghirardani is great. The set decoration by Niamh Coulter is great. The costume design by Keith Madden is great. The make-up and visual effects are great.  This is a great slow-build of a scary movie that will keep you thinking and on the edge of your seat with your heart racing. Daniel Radcliffe is great as Arthur Kipps and proves that he does have a career outside Harry Potter. This is one of the best horror movies in a while and another interesting return to form for Hammer Films.

B006HH5ZQY|5.0|just got vincebus eruptum in the mail today and what a treat is reissue is.  mono mix sourced from the original philips analog masters, the vocals and instruments are well balanced.  i remember when this came out, i was in junior high and had this plastic portable turntable that ran on 8 batteries.  i used to lug it around with a couple lps under my arms.  we had this plymouth valiant and i would sit in the back seat playing vincebus eruptum on the way to church, making sure the player was level on my lap.  those were the days.  now a weary old man, i still enjoy listening to blue cheer on obviously better equipment! no extra material, but new liner notes in cardboard foldout sleeve.  sundazed did yet another great job reissuing a classic from days gone by.  RIP dickie where ever you may be.  i'm sure the thunder and lightening are a little louder there.....
1451648537|5.0|This book is fabulous! It is a brutally honest treatment of Steve Jobs' strengths and weaknesses, and paints a picture of a highly flawed individual who nevertheless accomplished incredible, universe bending feats. The story drew me in and I couldn't get enough of it. It is not at all like your usual stuffy biography, bogged down with too many details. This book moves right along! To sum it up, I was blown away by the book.  Steve Jobs and Stephen \\"The Woz\\" Wozniac met in high school.  Woz designed the Apple I and Apple II computers for fun. Jobs saw the possibility of selling them, did the marketing, and in 1976 the two founded Apple Computer. The Apple II only had 64 KB RAM, but this computer changed the world and somewhere between five and six million were sold. The Macintosh, released in 1984, was the first commercially successful product to use a Graphical User Interface (it provides the user the means to operate the computer through icons on the screen and a mouse through pull-down menus, clickable buttons, scroll bars, images and pages). Practically the entire user experience (everything you see and how you use it) on a personal computer was introduced by Apple. Even the Trash Can icon was invented by Jobs.  The initial public offering for Apple was in 1980 and the stock took off. Jobs was worth over ten million dollars by twenty-four and over a hundred million dollars by the age of twenty-five. By the time Jobs died in October 2011, he was worth $8.3 billion; however the majority of this fortune was due to Pixar stock (a topic treated in depth in the book) and not Apple. Wozniak left Apple in April 1981 and went on to invent other things including a GPS tracker that could be attached to objects to keep tract of them. Woz is now worth $100 million.  Many of you cannot remember life without personal computers, but back in 1980 there were no personal computers. Work processing was done on typewriters (remember those?) and computing was done on mainframes with punch cards turned for one run per day. Jobs changed all this.  Steve Jobs' great strength was recognizing great ideas, assembling a truly talented team, and convincing them they could create products that would \\"put a dent in the universe\\".  However,Steve Jobs was not a \\"people person.\\" His management style was in-your-face and autocratic; one day he would call your ideas crap, and the next he would be claiming them as his own. But in some strange way he could motivate people and convince them they could do the impossible. There is no denying that he brought to market as unending string of \\"universe denting\\" ideas and products, In addition to the Mac, he revolutionized the music industry with the iPod (put \\"1,000 songs in your pocket.\\"), the iTunes music store, and the iPhone with its built-in camera, and the iPad. Both the IPhone and IPad had touch screens, another revolutionary idea. Practically the only revolutionary things he did not invent in the modern age were Google, YouTube, and Facebook. But give time, I sure he would have. In addition, alone the way, Jobs acquired Pixar, a computer animation film studio, in 1986 and proceeded to produce a string of Academy Award winning films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo. Pixar films have made over $6.3 billion worldwide and its average gross per film is the largest of any studio in history. The Walt Disney Company bought Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, making Jobs the largest shareholder in Disney and a billionaire. On the negative side, Jobs kept almost all the options for himself and did not share them with his employees. If you want to read a highly entertaining, incredibly informative book on Steve Jobs, this is it.
0439023513|5.0|I thought \\"Hunger Games\\" was too dark for kids, but the second book was darker, and this--you have to wade through the utter blackness that is Katniss' war. It struck me that Katniss is of an age to be in the army in the real world, and her situation was like that some modern-day soldier might encounter: being in a situation far over their head, and forced to make terrible decisions while other horrible decisions are foisted upon them. The PTSD aspects are particularly well done.  As with the other books, I was riveted from first page to last. Parents: do read these first before giving them to your kids. I don't have kids and wonder just how much they should be exposed to. Yet this book, in which horrible violence has human and enduring consequences, is a heckuva lot more healthy than playing violent videogames, where maiming and bloodletting only get you better points. If I were a parent I'd be sure to point out the parallels to modern war, and discuss what alternatives we have in this world, where we have far too many President Snows lurking, waiting to set off their agendas.  Can't wait for the movies! I'll be the one with the big box o' Kleenex. All three of these books are now sitting on my \\"Keeper\\" shelf. I look forward to re-reading them. AND getting a Katniss action figure! (She'll go on the same shelf as my best Wonder Womans.)

Having worked for a French company for 12 years and spent a great time of time in France, Italy, England, Switzerland and Spain, I can only say when Jared leads Alec Baldwin and the rest of the liberal establishment to Europe....PLEASE JOIN THEM.

Well, for much of the population, eating out is a rare occurence and for many, completely off the table, so is fine wines, ice for your drinks....etc., etc., etc.,...and are you ready to live with people who use no dedorants, wear the same shirt for 3-4 days in a row, take a bath maybe twice a week.  Why....HIGH ENERGY COSTS.  Why7...europe has no oil!  So what about the great civilizations of the mideast, why is there a level of poverty seen there with all that cheap oil.  Islam, my friend, so go for it.  Join this wacko and truly celebrate the good life from your 400 sq ft apartment in Europe or your camelskin and baked brick hovels in the mideast.

0385342063|4.0|Poppy Wyatt has lost IT.  After managing to lock down the man of her dreams, Poppy has managed to LOSE her engagement ring....a huge, gorgeous emerald that is not only practically priceless but also a Tavish family heirloom.  Poppy is TERRIFIED her fiance Magnus will find out.....and will go to great lengths to make sure that he doesn't.  Not only has she lost her ring, but her cell phone, the number that the WORLD has been instructed to call has just been stolen!!!  HOW is anyone supposed to contact her??  But what...what is that in the trash bin?  It can't be...but it IS.  A perfectly perfect cell phone!  And so the antics begin....with Poppy procuring the phone of a former administrative assistant for business executive Sam Roxton.  In a somewhat unconventional arrangement, Poppy manages to hold onto the phone while agreeing to forward to Sam all of his emails.....; but now she's reading all of them, and yes even responding to some of them (Sam is wayyyy to slow in doing so).  Add to that the fact that Sam is sort of dreamy, and things become even more complex.....  In typical Kinsella fashion, readers and fans of her work will find many reasons to laugh out loud while reading this fun tale.  4 stars only from me due to my complete and absolute frustration with the Poppy Wyatt protagonist several times throughout the book.  Fun stuff, however;  a \\"must read\\" for Kinsella fans.  DYB
B006VREN86|5.0|I have been hesitant to watch this show for awhile mainly due to the bombs that have come from HBO since the Sopranos. I don't mean to say they are Bad, just not nearly as riveting. The time is the early 1920's right after WW1. The scenes are authentic down to the smallest of details. The working Al Capone into this, really makes it captivating. Simply put, I was hooked after the first 10 minutes of the show. Am a fan of Buchemi and all of his works over the years, especially \\"Fargo\\". Was a great addition to the Sopranos as Tony's brother, and now an Excellent Anchor for this New series. If anyone ever wondered if Buchemi could carry a show, wonder no more!! Excellent X 10!!<br />I watched first 6 episodes in 24 hours. Hard for me to do with my schedule. Got little sleep. I'm a Boardwalk Addict!!

B005H29GSI|1.0|I have to agree with other reviewers in that it is too hard to build the towers from the rinky dink pieces.  It absolutely seems like the construction of the pieces was not done with any care.  It seems like they had a great concept for a game and rushed it into production to get it done for Xmas.  Pretty box, seems like it should be fun, but it is just frustrating.  I can not imagine a 5 year old being able to play this game.  Bottom line, I bought 3 copies of this game.  Two were to be given as gifts.  I'm glad I played it before I gave one to anyone.  Those two are going back.  I'm only keeping the one because I have to since I took it out and played with it.  Maybe I can sell it online. :P  Don't waste your money.  Just stick with the application.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Just a few words to sum it up.  Truly amazing book.  I could hardly put the book down.  Read this book, you will not be dissappointed
B005X47SQM|4.0|Season 4 keeps up with all the brutality and 'I love you's of the first 3 seasons. As one reviewer put it so succinctly in his review of the series, \\"Lather, rinse, repeat\\". And it does...and we watch it happen over and over...and over again.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed at my pitiful addiction to this show - but, if I have to be hooked on something - I guess it's safer than crack.<br /><br />View on!<br /><br />PjP

B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a fun and interesting puzzle game. I normally play with my two sons (5 and 8). The game is trivially easy to pick up and play even for children. The scoring rules are simple.  This is definitely a challenging game due to the complex interactions between colors on the board. However, I found that even my children were able to grasp the basic strategies of leaving their options open for later in the game, blocking other players, and saving the little pieces for last when the board is so full you can't place the big pieces anywhere.  I read the reviews before I bought it, and one person recommended shrinking the board by one square on each side for a three-player game and two squares all around for a two-player game. The board is clearly balanced for four players, but that idea works well enough.
B006FTCH2E|4.0|If you are a fan of combining sci-fi with fantasy, but only in conjunction with interesting science (along the lines of CONTACT with Jodie Foster, than I would recommend checking this out.

B0073LWEXK|1.0|I don't know if anyone else is having this problem, but after you use the rope once you cannot use it again to descend the well in level four. the hints just say to &quot;use rope&quot;, but before in chapter two I believe, they already asked you to use the rope to descend the cliff. I have re started and followed the hints step by step, but there is no where that you can claim another rope and you cannot get the rope back after you use it once. this is starting to seriously annoy me, has this happened to any one else?
B0067QPVD2|1.0|Yes the problem I have with this is that the Blu-ray Disc would not play on my blu-ray player it tried to connect to the internet on my blu-ray player.  Not all blu-ray owners own x-boxes or playstations.  I shouldn't have to buy a x-box or playstation to watch a blu-ray movie when I have a blu-ray player already.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A BLU-RAY DISC THAT WORKS ON BLU-RAY PLAYERS!

B001PJRAUS|5.0|I absolutely love Jemima Rooper! I thought she was spectacular in the Hex series. Anyway, Lost in Austin is a cute mini-series about a girl, a Jane Austin, played by Rooper, who's life isn't as great as she wants it to be. She finds a doorway in her bathroom shower and is transported to the setting of Austin's Pride and Prejudice. A 21st century girl sent back to the turn of the 19th century... let's just say you have to watch it. It's a great drama with funny and romantic moments. I'm not much of an Austin fan but I love this movie! I may even give Pride and Prejudice a read.

0385535139|2.0|John Grisham will always be one of my favorite authors.  \\"The Firm\\" is one of the top 5 books I have ever read, and a fictional book like \\"Bleachers\\" showed his incredible versatility as a writer.  But based on his last two books, \\"The Confession\\" and \\"The Litigators\\" (the latter of which I just finished), I believe he has maxed out on legal thrillers.  It's like a star athlete who has lost a step and can't compete at the highest level any more.  In TV terms, in my opinion, he has \\"Jumped the Shark.\\"<br /><br />This book starts out slow, picks up a little steam during the trial, but never came close to getting to the point where I \\"couldn't put it down.\\"  In fact, my only interest in reading it quickly was so I could get through it and move on to something else.  The characters are generally lackluster in terms of generating interest, and the story line is predictable and anticlimactic.  All in all, a second straight disappointing effort by a terrific writer.  I would take a pass.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|I wanted to be a parent that shares interests with my children. One of those my oldest daughter (12) and I share is the love of reading. Since I don't want her reading my books (Stephen King and such) I started reading hers. This series of books is a great tribute to the old Greek myths, of which I have read the originals. The character development by Rick Riordan is comparable to some of the best authors out there today. I knew when I bought the movie adaptation to his first book that it would not be anywhere near as good as the written word. And I was not disappointed in the least. Pierce Brosnan was ok as Chiron and I could accept that they needed to make Percy and Annabeth older to accomplish some of the story action, but the movie story was horrible. The characters were poorly portrayed and not at all like the book. Characters were left out while others were introduced that were not in the book such as Persephone. The casting director should be shot for that one alone. If you want to see a horrible adaptation of Greek mythology, get the remake of Clash of the Titans and this one. Movies these days stink because they all want to be blockbuster action hits instead of telling a story anymore and they can't make anything original. I pray they NEVER make another of Mr Riordan's books into a movie, they'll just ruin it like they did with this one. Save your money and read the series, but if you must see a good Greek mythology movie, feel free to pick up the original Clash of the Titans or even one of the cheesy Sinbad movies from the 70's.

B0062P3392|4.0|It is 1980 and the world is at war.  Mercenaries are in Mexico to assassinate a man and they get the job done in a violent manner but it happens in front of his young child.  Danny Bryce (Jason Statham), who kills the father, has had enough and realizes he must quit this job and he returns home to Australia to try to start a normal life.<br /><br />A year later he is told to come to Oman to rescue his friend Hunter (Robert DeNiro) who is being held hostage.  Danny learns that Hunter has backed out of a contract worth $6 million and Danny must complete the mission or Hunter will be killed.<br /><br />An old and dying Sheikh wants vengeance for the murder of three of his oldest sons.  They were killed by the British SAS (Special Air Service, an elite Special Forces group).  They only know one name but believe that three SAS men took the lives of the brothers.<br /><br />Danny reforms the old assassination squad to try to complete the contract to save Hunter.  The only problem is that the SAS are some of the most skilled warriors in the world and the task is not easy. What evolves is a web of protectionism for the ex SAS soldiers, lies and inner plots as to what happened and why.  This is a true story based on the book \\"The Feather Men\\" written by Ranulph Fiennes an ex SAS soldier.<br /><br />The movie features some fast action scenes and detailed plots to kill the SAS soldiers without being caught.  It is a good story line but the script at times is weak and Robert DeNiro's role is a little more than a cameo type appearance with little to add to the movie.<br /><br />Overall I still found it interesting and liked it because of the fight scenes but the script and directing could have been better!
0312641893|5.0|MY THOUGHTS<br />ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT<br /><br />The story of Cinderella has been around for eons and it has been retold in several different forms.  This one is a bit different since it has a wonderful mix of paranormal and science fiction elements.  Cinder lives in New Bejing where she is the top mechanic and somewhat of a tomboy.  She is also part machine after sustaining injuries in a devastating accident that took her parents' lives.  These cyborgs are second class citizens there and she is forced to support her step family when her step father dies. Of course, there is a cute meet when Prince Kai needs his android repaired and finds Cinder's stall in the market square.  She becomes friends with  him and even though there is a plague that causes imminent death.  Another sinister element is at play from the Lunars, a colony of moon dwellers, whose queen wants to marry the Prince and dominate Earth.<br /><br />Her step mother would do Disney proud since she is a real cross that Cinder must bare.  Cinder's step sisters are not that bad and she cares for them, especially her younger sister, so when she succumbs to the plague, her step mother blames her and turns her over to the Palace's scientific community to use her as test subject.  She survives her encounter with the testing and while in there, she learns about her true identity.  Nope, not gonna give that one away here!  There are lots of little twists and turns mixed in with the science fiction details while remaining pretty much true to the Cinderella fable.  The Lunar queen is an excellent evil foil to Cinder's goodness.<br /><br />I really thought the whole pace of the book was perfect, it kept moving forward at a breakneck pace and when I finished it, I really wanted the next one to find out exactly where Cinder ends up.  The world building is quite natural and I was completely swept up in the dialogue and details.  Meyer easily mixes old and new technology while blending different cultures into a wonderful place to visit.  I am so glad there are more young adult authors making inroads to science fiction with strong female characters.  This one is pretty safe for most teens with some mentions of alcohol, a few chaste kisses and some violence which is really nothing more than what kids see on television today.ere are more young adult authors making inroads to science fiction with strong female characters.

038572179X|5.0|\\"Atonement\\" is a classic case of why reading the book is so much better than watching the movie. I confess, I watched the movie first, and found it lacking. I thought, what was all the fuss about? And then I read the book. Such beautiful prose, such an evocative setting. I thoroughly enjoyed every page, and in fact found it more cinematics than the cinema.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The Help boasts a host of magnificent performances, a captivating storyline and absolutely mediocre direction. Scenes are directed with the delicacy of a sledgehammer.  I have not read the book, however, Skeeter, the aspiring author who's thinking does not quite fit with the rest of Jackson society is the only white woman not wearing a Jackie Kennedy hair-do. Hers is more Berkeley 1968 -- gee, might she be the \\"liberal\\" thinker?  Minnie says she never burns the chicken, then in one climactic scene Minnie is frying chicken and the camera does a close up of the frying pan... do you think the next scene will be someone commenting on Minnie burning the chicken?  The soundtrack music is wonderful but it punctuates some scenes with unnecessary treacle.  This is a movie to enjoy despite its direction. Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard are outstanding. Alison Janney and Cicely Tyson add wonderul detail to the story. These performances shine through in spite of the often ham-fisted direction.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|It's Oct 15, 2001 and General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) has just watched his Oakland A's team lose in the American League Division finals. That defeat hurts but now he is losing his best team players, the stars, to teams like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Socks at salaries that his cash poor team cannot begin to match!<br /><br />The question is, \\"How do you beat big money?\\"<br /><br />While in meetings with his scouting agents, he listens to them about all of the prospects that they are recommending. While he hears about baseball skills he also hears about \\"handsome faces\\" and \\"ugly girlfriends\\". He realizes that baseball scouting is not the panacea to solve his biggest problem. How do you build a winning team with a limited budget?<br /><br />While out trying to trade players he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a Yale economics graduate working for the Cleveland Indians. He learns that young Peter is a man who has no baseball experience but is listened to by the management of the Indians. He hires him and finds out that Pete has developed a mathematical relationship between baseball players and their skills and how to match those skills to a team to win games. Billy's goal is to win the last game of the season! The World Series!<br /><br />What develops is that Billy and Pete rebuild the Oakland A's with a bunch of misfits that nobody else wants and tries to build a winning team. The team's field coach fights them every step of the way.<br /><br />This is based on a true story about how these guys' vision of professional baseball reworked the model that is used today to build championship teams.

The book was fabulously entertaining and very well written.  I'm not a very fast reader, but I flew through the 550 pages in just a few days.  When you're finished, you feel like you've been swept up by Keith and his crowd and taken on a trip.  Highly recommended.
0439023513|3.0|The first book was amazing, the second was pretty good, but Mockingjay did not live up to expectations.  While it does offer a conclusion to the series, it felt rushed at times, like author was writing an essay and only had so many words to do so.  While this book does offer a conclusion to the series, I thought it was a mediocre end to what was an overall good series.  I recommend it to complete the story, there certainly wasn't a bow on top so to speak.

B002SAUCBC|5.0|The Long Walk is not like any book I've read.  It's a very simplistic storyline that manages to keep your interest and entertain you along the way.  The story takes place in a bleak future where citizens are horrifically exploited for promises of fame and fortune.  This seems to be a common theme with other Richard Bachman books.  The book follows Ray Garraty on his \\"long walk\\" with 99 other contestants, where inevitable fatigue and injury are NOT viable options.  As the story progresses, you learn more about the characters and the situation they find themselves in.  The ending requires some interpretation on the reader's part but I thought it was brilliant.

Wheat is something I have avoided for years, but was interested in the idea of other grains being introduced back into my meals.  Sadly this is not the case.  The info presented about the GM of wheat and its history is definitely interesting and probably quite correct, but then the writer goes on to tell you to eliminate/limit other carbs such as beans, other grains (including brown/wild rice) , sugars, starchy veggies, etc.  I can assure you that eliminating these items will certainly lead to weight loss around your mid-section (and I won't charge you $10 for that tip).  So in fact this book is nothing more that a low carb diet book (and should be labeled as such) and really doesn't present anything new.  It has some useful recipes at the end; if you are just taking up low carb its a good read (there are better low carb books out there though), but if you are a seasoned low-carber - give it a  miss.

0307959856|4.0|I know there are some who feel that using Austen's characters is close to sacrilege, but of all the writers who have done so recently, P.D. James does it best, and having been publishing excellent novels since 1962, she's certainly earned the right to do so. While not her usual cast of character or setting, James brings Pemberley and its inhabitants to life around a well-written mystery. I may be biased because I'm a bigger James fan than Austen fan, but I love both authors and enjoyed this immensely. I recommend it to mystery and Austen fans. I'm sure Dalgliesh himself would enjoy reading it. P.D. James is what I wish all writers could be: talented, prolific, and long-lived! God bless her.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Nothing to crab about here. Been waiting for this set for years. TOTALLY  worth the wait! Crystal clear and extras aplenty! May the force....etc,etc
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Great book, could not put it down. Oh how he can weave a web! This one got me started reading all of his books. The Nemesis and The Leopard are great as well. I am currently reading The Redbreast, and this is starting out in great form as well.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|awesome game.  I played Grisly Manor first and loved it.  The lost city is just as good.  These are the best two games I have played.  I like this game because it is much more than hidden object games.(Which bore me after a while).
0756405890|5.0|There are fantasy books you read once then donate to the library. Then there are the ones you keep and read over and over. This is the second kind. I've read The Name of the Wind and it's sequel at least 3 times so far. It's on my book shelf next to Tolkein, CS Lewis, LeGuinn, Brooks, Butcher, Rowling and E.E. Knight, and we've downloaded it into the family kindles.  The world and characters are compelling and consistent. Lovers of fantasy and literature will love this book. Unlike many current and new fantasies, I predict that this series and its author will stand the test of time and will be found on shelves and in ebooks generations from now.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was a teenager in the eighties so I guess I'm in the demographic that would get the most out of this book.  My guess is almost anyone would like it.  This book was just a pure pleasure to read.  It gave an interesting view of a possible future and the potential for virtual reality.  During every session reading this book I just felt happy and I had many laugh out loud moments.  Apparently a movie will be made of this book.  If they do a decent job it is going to be great and hilarious!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Use: 3-6 hours a day, playing music/movies sometimes simultaneously with MMOs (SWTOR, WoW, Aion, Rift), FPS (CS:Source, TF2, Skyrim), and other various games.  I got this headset about a year ago, and when I first got them, I couldn't believe how awesome they sound! The 7.1 surround is amazing for shooters and movies, and while you can switch to turn that off, I've never wanted to! The battery life is long enough for my 4+ hour gaming sessions at least -- I've never had them die on me, but I keep them charged as well overnight. Plus, if you needed to, you could just wear them with the USB plug in!  As for the range, I can go all the way upstairs from my computer in the basement and still hear clear as day -- I use the G1-3 buttons as Ventrilo commands and I can talk with folks as I roam about my house, do laundry, get a drink, and what not. Makes it easy when raiding in MMOs to stay on top of what's going on while still taking care of the things you gotta do sometimes! one day I went outside and wandered down the street and got pretty far before it started to fuzz a bit and miss parts of the song and eventually cut out.  Comfort wise, they fit around my ears snug against my head, the band at the top is adjustable and way more comfortable than other headphones I've worn. Because they are snug, sometimes my ears get hot, but that's not too often. They might feel a bit heavy to some folks, I think, but they're a perfect fit for me at one notch open for each side.  I haven't had any mic issues like I've read in some of the reviews, so I'm not sure where that came from. I haven't had any complaints from my gaming buddies, and when recording myself and playing back, it sounds clear as if I was talking to someone.  There are a bunch of items to mess with via the control panel for it, like voice changers and what not -- while I played with it at the start, I generally have the equalizer and settings to wear I don't need to touch it anymore.  I highly recommend this headset!If you're considering buying a headset, it's worth the money -- if I remember I got mine for a sweet deal $129.99, but they're worth the $160 price tag. I've had no decay in quality (audio or physical) after a year of rather heavy use.  If you have any questions, feel free to comment and I'll do my best to get back about it!

0553288105|5.0|This is perhaps the most brilliant book by one of the gods of Sci-Fi.  The story behind the book is almost as interesting, with a \\"washed-up\\" Asimov, compelled by the mistaken reference to a non-existent isotope (Plutonium 186) by another author, to come out of retirement to pen an award-winning tour de force.  The merging of science and imagination in this book, both at the grand scale and in myriad little details, is humbling.  If you ever feel like you could write a good science fiction novel, don't read this.  The bar is set way too high!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This a great app. I drifted for a while in my thoughts of the Lord. This app reminds me everyday how important reading his word truly is. Every day I read, it reminds me of what is missing and what is important. The daily devotions by Dr. Joyce Meyers are so easy to understand and relate so closely yo Ny life it us scathe yet comforting.In a weak moment it is great to have this app at my fingertips.My sister told me about this app and I thank her everyday. God bless everyone!!
0060920084|1.0|I purchased the book (The Lost Continent - Travels in Small Town America) some time back and finally got around to reading it. Am disappointed in Bill Bryson with this book.  Years ago I was given his book (A Walk in the Woods) and loved it. But this book about travel in small town America exposed Bill Bryson's very Liberal political bent. Even Mr. Bryson admitted that he was a lifelong Democrat. But he exposes the typical 'superiority - elitist' mindset of liberals in this book. When Mr. Bryson began to demean Republicans, and especially Southerners, I became upset with his book. He even lets the Liberal-Democrat anti-Christian mindset come through.  You know - he makes humor at the expense of Southners and Christians, just as the late night TV talk shows do.  I quit reading his book at chapter 7.  There is no one I would give this book to, so into the trash it went.  Tony L
031617615X|3.0|IT took almost 3 weeks to receive this book.  I have ordered from Amazon a lot.  And have never had to wait this long.  When the book arrived it was very small.  I feel that should have been in the description.  It was a little akward to read.

B005IU1OMA|5.0|I took the time to write a review on this product because in my honest opinion, I find this set to be the best bang for your buck type deal with the footage it offers. If your into beautiful scenery and adventure, this movie provides it all. It shows a lot of beautiful scenery along with a lot of fast action. The scenery is great for testing color accuracy based on your taste. The fast action is great for fine tuning the performance of your tv, preferably the motion. The movie is a great, I wouldnt call it short, but its enough for a great/fun experience. If thats not enough, the bonus features included in the blu ray are awesome! 3 POV videos of the boarders going down insane mountains, amazing birds eye scenery, and the toughest to watch; all their terrible falls... All in all, for its price, its definitely a great movie to purchase for all the features, scenery, and adventure youll be getting with this buy. They really put a lot of work into it with all the amazing footage they captured. That had like 15 HD cameras with slo-mo and everything, I wouldnt know that if it wasnt for the behind the scenes footage from the blu ray set. Trust me, do yourself a favor and buy this blu ray set and youll have a lot of sweet eye candy to show off along with some bad ass Dolby HD audio!
0307352145|5.0|In her book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain discusses introversion in the workplace and at home, covering such topics as the \\"extrovert ideal,\\" which prevails in the U.S. and Europe, and the biology of introversion and extroversion. Cain is an introvert herself--though like many introverts she manages to pass as an extrovert when the situation requires. She thus approaches the subject with great sympathy and understanding. The book is quite readable and interesting, at least to this introvert. I enjoyed in particular her discussion of \\"high reactive\\" children, since it seemed a very accurate description of my own daughter. The book should be required reading for all the extroverts out there who don't understand that the stuff they enjoy--\\"partying\\" and crowds and loud noise, the stuff people are \\"supposed\\" to like--is repellent to a large swath of the population. And introverts could benefit from reading the book too, or something like it. Young people in particular should be made aware of the existence of this introvert/extrovert divide. Navigating life can be difficult when everyone around you expects you to want to be in the thick of some social activity. It would be good for those quiet kids out there to know that they're not alone in wanting to just stay home and read a good book.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|The main thing that I like about McCreery is that he seems to sing from his heart and its honest lyrics and not the same ole \\"another drinking song\\" type music. All his songs have meaning and it's like you can vision in your head the painting that all his songs are about.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Worst movie in forever.  Think of the worst movie you have ever seen and it just moved up by one on the scale.  Plot - non-existent.  Unnecessary extreme violence.  You can just kill someone, you have to maim them into oblivion.  And the title says Drive but there isn't even a good chase scene.  The only 'Drive' it did was to drive me to write this review.  Save your money and time.
B005URRCNQ|3.0|One of the weaker Black Keys albums. Unlike many fans of their older releases, I thought Brothers was phenomenal. Like many of them, I thought Attack and Release was weak - maybe their worst.  This is a bit better than that, but it ain't no Brothers. It definitely ain't no Big Come Up or Rubber Factory. My take? They boys should stop working with dangerous mice.
B006PTL1QM|4.0|\\"Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable just to be able to go on living.\\" A woman named Sabina Spielrein (Knightley) is not acting \\"normal\\" so she is dropped off at the home of Dr. Carl Jung (Fassbender). In order to help her he begins to use his new idea of a \\"talking cure\\". As she starts to get better he begins a different type of therapy, but his friend Sigmund Freud (Mortinsen) does not agree with his methods. This is a movie I was really not looking forward to watching. I like the actors but the premise about the \\"birth of psychoanalysis\\" is not something I was interested in. Halfway through I was hooked and it did keep me interested the entire time. Once again this is not a movie for everyone, but the acting and story made it a very interesting movie and by the end you have a connection with each character and the \\"updates\\" during the credits really seem to add to the movie. Overall, a movie that was much better then anticipated and I do recommend it. I give it a B.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|A must watch and buy for home video library.  Seriously, it is that good.  Don't let the pretty boy features of Ryan Gosling scare you, he does a supberb job in this movie.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app for weather! It doesn't cause any issues which is surprising since it runs all of the time. All on all I would recommend this to anyone in need of a reliable weather app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great way to kill time if your at the doctor office, on a short break at work, or just plain bored. there's plenty of games for everyone to enjoy.
B003F5WOEC|5.0|I was very disappointed with Attack and Release. Brothers brought the Black Keys back to me.  Love this album as much as the first several. Not sure why so many fans of their early stuff don't like this one. Can't stop listening to it. The vinyl packaging is beautiful. Get it.
B006JTIZGM|1.0|You'd think something dubbed \\"Kindle Edition\\" would work on a Kindle? Guess again.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|We read this book for our book club and I never imagined being so taken.  Lisa's writing is spellbinding and her story is one that needed to be told.  She tells the story from Alice's point of view which makes the read so compelling.  As we accompany Alice through her days, we become increasingly aware that something is wrong, and then as she loses more and more of herself we realize the heartbreaking frustration of Alzheimer's. This book deepens your compassion and helps see your connectivity to humanity.  This book was truly a labor of love.
B0016BWACI|1.0|I was SO disappointed in this blu-ray version of The Dark Crystal. It's not in high definition at all! It's just a copy of the DVD version. I even took the time to write to Sony Pictures to complain about being cheated by their false advertising. Don't waste your money on this junk. The DVD actually looks better, in my opinion.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|It's truly sad how single minded some critics are with this film.  Like many others, I thought Drive would be more of a simple action film with the center of the story being action shots of chase scenes.  Something like Gone in 60 seconds, or The Fast and the Furious  I couldn't have been more wrong, and glad I am.  Drive is a classic.  It's execution makes what is a relatively linear plot into a smooth, dark urban crime drama.  It is atmospheric and sets it's own unique mood that in turn, sets it apart from films of a similar genre that have used the L.A. crime world as their backdrop.  Each scene is memorable, and each character has a genuine, warranted role within the plot.  The music of the film must also be mentioned with high praise, and is by far one of the better I've heard in years.  Less is more, and when you take away everything this film could have been, or was expected to be, you are left with a raw, simple, and moving story.  The chase scenes are brilliant, and don't concentrate on mass carnage and speed so much as calculation and delivery.  It's nice to get away from the over the top, regurgitated Hollywood remakes and find a film that concentrates on characters, production and plot as opposed to special effects, empty tough guy talk and cardboard characters.  The violence, when it does appear, is delivered with a swift, realistic brutality...as it should be.  The Cast is top notch, and Ryan Gosseling's performance as a quiet but effective main character is really great.  In a time where films are lacking in character depth and great cinematic craft, Drive gives us hope.  This film and the soundtrack are both highly recommended.  DW
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app it keeps my faith and religion strong. I addvise you to get this app it is awsome.

B003DZX3US|5.0|A young girl named Belle chooses to take her father's place as captor in the Beast's castle.  Through a number of events accompanied by memorable musical pieces Belle eventually falls in love with Beast.  This Disney Classic is a wonderful story broken down for children describing and illustrating Stockholm Syndrome.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Overall, In Time is a good film.  The concept itself was top notch, and although I found the film to have a lull to it during certain fight or flee scenes, it still held my attention.  There isn't necessarily a lot of twists, but that is not what a movie like this is about.  It's about the futuristic society, it's landscape and characters and their struggles.  The Sociological implications were well implemented throughout the film, and Timberlake proved again that he is becoming an actor who can play any role with conviction.  DW

0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson delivers again - well-written, educational, and laugh-out-loud funny.  I've never been to Australia and I am not all that familiar with the geography of the cities and sites in relation to each other.  I first listened to the audiobook.  I love that Bryson personally read the book but I was getting confused about the geography so I decided to pick up the actual book.  To me, the book was better because I could keep referring back to the map to get some perspective.  If you're a Bryson fan, this book will not disappoint.
B004PHE9F6|4.0|I've never raced nor driven very fast and now I have an idea what it might be like.  If you've ever pondered racing, take a watch.  This movie very simply peeps in on open-wheel racing in the late 60's.  I'm not a fan and still, I could NOT quit watching this film unfold.  The camera work (for ANY times) is incredible.  Many of the actors are behind the wheel - they LOOK like they are racing because they ARE.  As for the drama, it's beautifully understated and is icy cool.  Language is used efficiently - we could all learn from these folks how to speak concisely.  There's no need for endless and meaningless dialogue, imho - which is why I do not \\"get\\" the Tarantino films.  It's long and that's OK.  It wore me out because it was supposed to....
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|Text is missing in transformer prime. Very hard to play game without the missing description how to play. Wish devs would fix or refund.
B005Y423ZC|1.0|My first and last Adele release. Great voice but in between songs  when she gets down with audience she gets down in the gutter  with a foul mouth four letter vocabulary. What a disappointment!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|A young adult's review:  To be honest, before I watched this movie I expected it to be like rest of the Sherwood movies. The messages in the other movies (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof) were positive and good to think about- especially Fireproof. But, as we all know, all of their movies lacked in video editing, camera shots, ACTING and smooth moving scenes and plot.  When I watched Courageous, I was pleasantly suprised to see that the video editing and camera shots had become much better with a few minor flaws here and there. The scene sequence and plot was a thousand times better; I only have two or three objections to their decision making in that area. Finally, the ACTING was a bajillion (yes, I used that word) times greater than any of their other movies. I would only kick out two and a half actors that they chose instead of the whole cast, or nearly the whole cast.  The thing I liked best about Courageous was the ending scene. Being in the film and television field myself, I've seen a lot of endings but that one, I liked. It was creative and a little edgy (in a good way). The only thing I would have changed on the ending is the guys seen standing up. I wouldn't have chosen men who were wearing suits, or at least leave one or two in a suit and the rest in nice casual clothing. But that is my two cents.  Overall, my review is this: I watched the movie twice. Of my own accord. I may watch it a third time some day but just to say that I watched it all the way through and then watched it again says something. I'm extremely picky about ALL movies (Christian and non-Christian) and I can still nitpick this one. But, it is indeed their best movie by FAR and it is good enough to have been in the theaters.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I wanted to buy this game before, but the reviews distracted me.  Most pertain to an update issue that has since been resolved.  I'm so glad I bought the game now!  The graphics are so crisp and clear on my Fire.  I have played MMORPGs like WOW and of course this is very similar.  When you buy the game it comes with a free 3 month subscription so even better!  I especially enjoy the touch screen controls because it makes me feel like I'm more involved in the game.  I don't really enjoy games where you have to team up with people in order to advance but in this game you can run around all on your own.  Don't let the low reviews fool you.  Take a chance on this fun game that has beautiful graphics!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I really love this app - colorful, easy to use, save, doodle - whatever your heart desires.  I didn't know I needed an email app to send my drawings and when I contacted customer service they replied within minutes, super helpful and friendly!  Love it, get it!  THANK YOU DARREN!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This has changed the way I look at food altogether. I definitely go organic more than I used to after watching this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I bought Wool, the first book in the series, it was because I was looking for a quick and inexpensive read.  The ratings were high, the story looked interesting, and the price was right.  After finishing all the books (one immediately after another at breakneck speed) I can state unequivocally that I would pay any amount for future books in this series.  The concept is intriguing and the characters living in this world are portrayed vividly and honestly.  There are no \\"placeholder\\" characters in the series, everyone is fleshed out and has believable and consistent motivations.  Another thing that should be noted about these books is the lack of spelling and grammatical mistakes.  I know it's a trivial point, but I enjoy a book so much more when I'm not cringing at every other page.  Don't pass up this opportunity to get all the books together.  Once you start, you're not going to stop!
B004C4IKCU|5.0|WOWW.  WHAT A GREAT ITEM TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  I WILL LISTEN TO IT MANY TIMES AND SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.

Cool info about the sun, too. Very nicely done.

The illustrations are beautiful, the story is realistic, and the baby owl Bill is deliciously adorable. The kids love to say his \\"I want my Mommy\\" line with him every time. It's a great book to teach the idea that when Mommy's away, she's doing something for the kids - and she will always come back to the nest.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|...unless you have time to be swept away by one of the best period dramas in recent years! For DA lovers, season 2 does not disappoint! It's a bit faster paced, and there are more and more subplots with each episode. At times this can be a bit jarring because of frequent cuts to different scenes. I got sucked into watching season 1 with my wife, now I'm the one eagerly anticipating the release of the second season on blu-ray.

B006T5FDLG|3.0|On the heels of their disastrous collaboration with Lou Reed, \\"Lulu\\", Metallica releases \\"Beyond Magnetic\\", which I imagine is sort of musical damage control.  After all, while \\"Death Magnetic\\" still has had its fair share of detractors, I think it is considered by a majority of metal fans to be at least a relative return to form.  So after squandering their newfound goodwill by indulging in what could be best described as a musical vanity project with Lulu, it makes sense that they would dip back into the Death Magnetic well, with this release of 4 tracks that were completed for that album, but not fully mixed and released on it.  Listening to it, it reminds me of how confused the band must've been in the time leading up to the Death Magnetic recording sessions.  Since the dawn of the 90's, Metallica were being increasingly influenced by their producer, Bob Rock, which resulted in them attempting to re-brand themselves as a heavy rock band, as opposed to a heavy metal band.  Load and Reload were both ostensibly attempts to \\"branch out\\" into styles that the band members may have already had some interest in, but it was clear that the process was somehow...just not natural.  Everything sounded too restrained, too calculated, which I believe was in part due to Bob Rock insisting that they \\"play it safe\\", and keep things simplified enough to be commercially viable.  Eventually, it all broke down when St. Anger was being made, and with Bob Rock's departure, the band was left adrift in strange and out of tune waters.  They had the pent-up rage, but had forgotten how to harness that emotion in the form of actually listenable songs.  The songs on Beyond Magnetic are interesting in that they provide an insight on the path back from the confusion of St. Anger, as it is clear why these were not included on Death Magnetic, while at the same time being songs that wouldn't necessarily sound out of place on that album.  Let's get the bad out of the way first: the songwriting hereis not as tight and well-polished as what made it onto Death Magnetic, and as the songs were released without the same final mixing and post-production as those on DM, it's a less user-friendly experience in some ways(although with DM's way too hot mix, that may be open to debate).  As a result, there's a bit of that scruffy New Wave of British Heavy Metal vibe, which makes sense, given that I think the band went back to those influences on Death Magnetic.  Of the 4 tracks here, the weakest among them is clearly \\"Hell and Back\\".  It wouldn't surprise me in the least if this was one of the first songs written for these sessions, as it sometimes sounds closer to St. Anger than Death Magnetic, and it shares the same overwrought, confessional tone as St. Anger.  I will say that the song improves halfway through, and has the kind of pyrotechnic soloing that was absent on St. Anger, but it doesn't have the same success in blending Metallica's different eras together as the songs that made it onto Death Magnetic.  The good news is that the other 3 songs are all pretty damn solid pieces of work.  The unfortunately-titled \\"Hate Train\\" turns out a lot better than the name would indicate, as it starts off switching back and forth between the heavy-rock boogie of a song like \\"Fuel\\", and straight-on metal galloping, with some clean-sounding, melodic choruses.  About 2/3 of the way through, the song shifts gears completely, and throws a 1-2 punch of a somewhat thrashy, palm-muted theme and a slower, heavier riff, both backed with some nice guitar harmonies.  \\"Just A Bullet Away\\" is even more unabashedly metal, relying on a chunky, rapid-fire backing riff that builds up, until everything goes silent, and the band breaks out a clean, mournful section where guitar harmonies sprout like bamboo stalks, until things build back up into the main riff.  \\"Rebel of Babylon\\" can best be compared to \\"All Nightmare Long\\", although the emphasis here is less on fast riffs (which are still present), and more on slower, doomier riffs.  The common thread, however, is that these 3 songs don't quite seem to have the same confident tone as those that made it onto Death Magnetic, despite the generally competent songwriting and performance present.  So overall, Beyond Magnetic is a must-have for those who enjoyed Death Magnetic.  Those who dismissed Death Magnetic as Metallica trying too hard to recapture the essence of a band they no longer are, are unlikely to find anything to change their minds here.  If \\"Hell and Back\\" had been a stronger track, this EP could've easily rated 4 stars instead of a \\"very high 3 stars\\" (Amazon, please change the ratings to a 10 star system!).  This leaves us with the question of whether Metallica's \\"Lulu\\" misadventure was just a brief accidental detour, and whether they can regain their momentum that they seemed to have reclaimed in 2008.  Only time will tell, but I'm hoping for the best.

B006O5Y0SS|1.0|Why do I keep giving Woody Allen movies \\"one more chance\\"?  This one got such good reviews, I talked myself into thinking it would actually be enjoyable. So I gave it a try...  Just another in an endless line of really crappy efforts that will be quickly forgotten.  The characters are all the usual steriotypes and now this Wilson guy is doing a Woody Allen impression I guess because Allen is too old to play the part. Recomend this movie to someone you really don't like.

B004J00KJ8|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' REISSUE ***<br /><br />I recently reviewed the BLU RAY reissue of \\"Love Actually\\" - commenting on how beautiful the picture quality had suddenly become over the preceding DVD versions. Well - somebody seems to be taking care of business here too - because the print on this BR reissue of \\"Four Weddings And A Funeral\\" is exceptional also - especially given what's gone before.<br /><br />Filmed in the summer of 1993 and released in the spring of 1994 - Director Mike Newell and Producer Tim Bevan took a big chance on a then largely unknown Hugh Grant as the male lead. Playing Charles - a nice but bumbling 32-year old British bachelor - he's the love interest for the sophisticated and sexy American socialite Carrie (Andie MacDowell hot from her successes in \\"Green Card\\" and \\"Groundhog Day\\"). With six hundred thousand dollars lopped off their budget and only 38 days to shoot - it cost very little to make - and therefore when it became a global phenomenon it eventually grossed over $250 million in profit worldwide. \\"Four Weddings...\\" also made stars of Hugh Grant (and Liz Hurley in 'that' dress at the London premier). It laid the ground for so many British rom-coms to follow - highlighted the classiness of Kristin Scott-Thomas (\\"The English Patient\\") - Rowan Atkinson as a comedic genius - John Hannah as the thinking-woman's crumpet - and of course properly launched the 'film' career of England's best scriptwriter - Richard Curtis. It was even nominated for 2 Oscars - Best Film and Best Original Screenplay.<br /><br />Clarity - starting with spotlessly clean PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and MGM logos - the BLU RAY bypasses a menu and goes straight into the credits - and as the principal characters are established in the opening montage - its clear that some kind of restoration has been done here. It looks really great - bright, clean and amazingly fresh. The picture is also automatically defaulted to a 16.9 aspect - so it fits your entire screen without losing any definition to stretching.<br /><br />So much is visually improved in this transfer, but moments that stick out include - the scene outside the church after the first wedding where Charles spots Carrie across the churchyard - it's beautifully clear. When they are making their way back from the tent reception - drunk in a Land Rover singing \\"Stand By Your Man\\" - and Charles gets out of the car under some trees at night - it's 'so' clear. Charlotte Coleman as Charles' eccentric sister Scarlett and her scary dress sense - orange hat and purple dress - Rowan Atkinson as the trainee priest conducting his first wedding service and blowing almost every line - when Carrie turns up at the end in the doorway in the rain - all of it - just great. There are only a few occasions when you notice slight haze and blocking (Bernard and Lydia getting it on in the bedroom as Charles hides) - but mostly it's a joy to look at and really brings out the summery feel of it all - smartly dressed guests in sunny garden locations etc. It also shows a London landscape that has no Gherkin building, the lovely Lady Di was still with us and a person gave you a Fax number and not an e-mail address.<br /><br />It's very funny too - the script is fantastic in so many places - Charles describing one of his posh friend's new look \\"Tom...disastrous haircut...\\" - Scott Thomas describing the dress of the first bride Laura \\"...She looks like a big meringue...\\" - George the boor at the Boatman pub thinking he's in with the American sexpot - \\"Damn fine filly...\\" - Charles confiding in Matthew (John Hannah) about fluffing an attempt at wooing the same - \\"Do you think there really are people who can say...Hi Baby! My name is Charles! And this is your lucky night!\\" And Matthew replies \\"Well if there is...they're not English!\\"<br /><br />And when actual heart is called for (tears instead of laughter) - Curtis gives John Hannah the speech at Gareth's funeral complete with the W.H. Auden poem \\"Funeral Blues\\" at the end (\\"Stop all the clocks...He was my North, my South, My East and My West...my Sunday Rest...\\"). It's still evocative to this day. Even the gay relationship between their characters was handled with joy and class and didn't focus on disease and ostracization.<br /><br />Niggles - we've seen it too many times and it hasn't dated as well as \\"Love Actually\\" or \\"Nothing Hill\\" when it comes to repeat viewing. The terrible Elton John at the beginning. The lack of language subtitles shows an amazingly cavalier attitude to audiences outside of English speaking countries. The 'Extras' listed below are good - the 2004 versions put out on the DVD double (interviews with Grant, Newell, Callow, MacDowell etc) - but it would have been nice to have something new. But apart from those small points - there's little else. If only Terry Gilliam's film legacy was treated with such respect and smarts...<br /><br />To sum up - an evergreen movie and a very satisfying transfer to BLU RAY. So if you've any affection for this lovely British/American romcom - then acquire this version of it pronto - especially as its relatively cheap.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />PS: this review is dedicated to the memory of the actress Charlotte Coleman<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />PICTURE: Widescreen 16.9 Aspect Ratio<br />AUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio<br />SUBTITLES: English For The Hearing Impaired<br />EXTRAS:<br />Audio Commentary with Filmmakers Mike Newell<br />Four Weddings And A Funeral - In The Making Featurette<br />The Wedding Planners Documentary<br />Two Actors And A Director Featurette<br />Two Promotional Clips (one with Hugh Grant as Lead, then Andie MacDowell as Lead)<br />Deleted Scenes<br />Theatrical Trailere was my North, my South, My East and My West...my Sunday Rest...\\").

B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool game . my kids and family love it too because it has a variety of games must get this app.
B003UESJEM|5.0|An unnerving insite into what is actually going on today in our Corperate world.  Piercing right into the hearts  of the hard working upwardly mobile corperate who are discovering that they dont have life made.  Rather  taking the lessons from thier past or History...they choose to chase the dangleing carrot of materialism.  In  this film some survive and some don't.  Tough times brings out the worst or the best in all of us.  But for the  grace of God go I.  A movie that hopefully will encourage all to look at what we are building our hopes our  dreams and our country on sand or stone.  Loyalty does and can exhist. And it is shown beautifully in this Film.

B0000040W2|5.0|This recording enjoys an almost total agreement as the absolute reference. I agree. Sir Colin is  the commander conductor in Berlioz, ha has in account three great recordings of the Fantastique, but  this Concertgebouw version is the best of all. It fills all things we want in a great performance:  poetry, imagination, beatifulness, care in detail, drama, ellegant phrasing and brilliant sound.  After hearing this Fantastique, you could fell no need to have another competitor in your collection.  This is the one to get, so buy it with confidence.
0553386794|4.0|Best way to describe this book- purely addicting.<br /><br />I reluctantly began reading this series simply to get my husband and his friends to stop bugging me about it. Then, once I finally got past the imperfect grammar, unique writing style, and slightly over the top prologue, I was hooked.<br /><br />Believe me, I almost stopped reading many times. There is a plethora of graphic violence (of every type), bad things often happen to good people, and it sometimes reads like a fantasy soap opera. Despite all this, I cannot put the darn thing or the other books in the series down because there is never a moment where you are free from suspense. The depth GRRM gives his characters keeps me invested! Just when you think you have it figured out who is good and who is bad, you hear another point of view and learn that every character has two sides to them. In this way it is like real life, and he somehow manages to appeal to my love for non-fiction. Don't get me wrong, there is more than enough fantasy in this book, he just does a good job of making the characters real enough that even a non-fiction fan like myself can buy into the book.<br /><br />The book is brutal and dark, and I simply hate how much I love reading it. RR Martin is a great storyteller; enough so that I came to overlook what would normally cause me to put a book down for good. (Being grammar, rampant violence often directed at women, and over-the-top plots with slow resolutions)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful as long as you have wifi. It has more versions of the Bible than I knew existed.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This was my first Kindle Fire case and I later purchased a Deft Dante 360 leather case to replace it.  Overall I think this case is very attractive.  It is lightweight and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the fire.  It didn't work very well for me as a stand, however.  And I really wanted the ability to stand the Fire up in Portrait mode, which this case couldn't do.  Finally, I found the \\"fuzzy\\" material that is on the inside of the case to be irritating to my hands.  I often have dry skin and the material would \\"catch\\" on my skin.  It is a great fabric to sit against the screen, but when I had the case folded open for reading it would catch on my skin and wasn't very pleasant.  Probably not a consideration for other people, but something that bothered me.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a very minimalist case that will (hopefully) protect your device.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the way it works with the touchscreen -- the cards just slide beautifully.  Whiles away the time when you need it.
0525423842|5.0|I love everything that Grisham writes.  So with no hesitation I began reading Kid Lawyer. Mid way I was puzzled at the immaturity of the dialogue. For Grisham is a word genius, but the story was intriguing so I continued.  Not until the end did I discover that the book was intended for young readers.  I immediately gave the book to my eight year old granddaughter, who loved it.

0736092269|5.0|Excellent book for isolation exercises. Great illustrations and explanations. I would like to see the author write a similar book with compound exercises.
B0043EV774|5.0|I read lots of reviews and the rest of my family actually saw this in 3D in a movie theater and loved it, but I did not (seen the regular version). I had just purchased a Vizio 42\\"d TV and a Panasonic Blu-ray 3d player, and looked online for some of the best 3d movies, and this one came up. I am still waiting for my free copy of Avitar from Panasonic.  I bought mine on e-bay (sorry amazon) for 25.00.  You know the story so I will not go into a review about that, but the 3D in this movie is very good, there is just so many things that show up that don't in the 2d version. I will not give it away, but the movie is well worth the money, even at Amazon's $35.00 price tag. Other 3d Movies that I have are Toy Story, Toy Story 2, and Toy Story 3. This one is the best out of the four 3d movies that I have now.
0553573403|4.0|Although the book took me over a year to read, my overall thoughts on the novel is favorable. From reading reviews and seeing a few episodes of the HBO series, I knew that the story is gritty and full of characters. I did enjoy this book but it took me until about page 400 to really *want* to know what was going to happen. I fault that with the constant switching of characters. By doing that, it made it very difficult for me to like any character enough to care what would happen to them. By halfway I knew enough of each character to yearn for more about them.<br /><br />I must say, this was different from any other fantasy novel I've read, and I can't say it's my favorite either. I still enjoy the \\"hero saves the day,and ends somewhat happily\\" book. However, leaving this book, I really admire Martin, but it's more for his detail and world building than for any emotional connection I have with the characters. This is dark. I think everyone knows this by now, but it wasn't as dark as I was expecting from some reviews. The rapes and children being killed was the worst for me, and it sometimes took me awhile to pick up the book again, but I read on because I loved feeling like I was reading a really good history book. The lack of magic and magical creatures did make it feel less like fantasy and more like historical fiction, which I was fine with because I was warned, but I can see some people not being able to handle a fantasy with no magic.<br /><br />I should say that I'm trying not to get too close to any characters, but Martin makes it clear that everyone is expendable, so I'm holding back. It's not even that they *die* it's how dismissive the deaths are. They are expected and the deaths aren't some gallant self-sacrificing stunts. They're dirty and cruel. I admire this realism, but it is sometimes too much for me.<br /><br />I plan on continuing the series to see what will happen to the few characters I care for, and to see the characters I loathe be killed...But ending the book, there doesn't seem to be a clear way forward for any of the characters. Everything changes so quickly, and I can see no resolution in sight. Hopefully, this series will have a satisfactory ending for the characters I like, but I'm not holding my breath. Nevertheless, it's a really admirable book with outstanding world building, but, whew, it felt like a marathon to read it from it's size and the amount of content therein.seem to be a clear way forward for any of the characters.

B004EPYZXK|3.0|First I like to say that the other reviewers pretty much got it right. If your a thinking man's movie fan, you may  appreciate this attempt. If you your a Hollywood action kind of guy, this will bore you to tears. I was surprised how  good the script and acting was for this grade of film, being you had to approach this as major fantasy right from the  get go. The plot suffered from the typical Hollywood thrown together screen play lack of depth or logic because of no  research into similar highly rated written works. The sound effects really bothered me because it was way over the top  and unbelievable. The part that really ruined the movie was the missed opportunity to incorporate any story  elements from written works and resorting to the same old moon rock giant pubic lice type monster stuff so typical of  poorly thought out movies financed by God knows who.  Here was a perfect chance to use the moving black pools of helium from Larry Niven's short story \\"The coldest Place\\".  Also, a perfect opportunity to use the interesting concept/fate of the astronaut from another Larry Niven short called  \\"wait it Out\\" that could have been used as a cliff hanger for a sequel if the the movie made any attempt at creativity or  greatness. These are examples of ideas that would have turned this movie into a 4 or 5 star movie if any effort was made  by the writer/director to research other written works in hard sci-fi literature.  While I'm on my soap box, the sci-fi movie genre seems to have stumbled into this situation of recycling the same old,  seen it before stuff that has been done to death. Well, except for \\"Moon\\", but that was more of a political \\"Silent  Running\\" type of effort and not really adventurous hard sci-fi. PLEASE, somebody invest in an effort to bring some  grand scale fresh sci-fi adventure to the big screen like Pol Anderson's \\"Tau Zero\\" or Niven/Pournelle's \\"The Mote in  God's Eye\\". Forget about rehashing the same old garbage.
B000PKG6TE|1.0|This album has many good songs on it.  It in fact has one of my favorite songs by Queens of the Stone Age (Turning on the Screw).  However, I can't even bring myself to listen to it with how shoddy the sound quality is.  There is absolutely no depth, no dynamics, no punch, nothing.  It is just a flat lifeless mishmash of static that could have been so much more.  My only hope is that some day the people at Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs gets a hold of the original master and is able to release something decent like they did for Faith No More's \\"Angel Dust\\".  I'm a bit afraid that even the original master is b0rked though in that this is very heavily a pro tools album.  The way things are on this and other \\"works\\" is starting to give me the impression that we were all better off when recording music via analogue.  I'm with Neil Young when he says listening to 21st century recordings makes him angry.  It's not the songs that are bad, it's the compression levels and absence of any dynamics whatsoever.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We have not seen the musical yet.  We wanted to get familiar with the music first. The music is great and we can't wait to see the show in May. Even our kids are crazy about the music.
B004LROMSO|1.0|I'm a big fan of Spartacus: Blood and Sand, so thought I might expect the same quality as that Starz show with this Starz show, Camelot.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  Camelot may be the worst TV show I've ever seen.  It is atrociously bad on every level--casting, acting, direction, writing, cinematography, editing, music, wardrobe, sets and hair&makeup.  All are pitifully horrible.  This show is so wretchedly bad that it was literally a struggle to watch any of it.  Even Eva Green, who's usually a wonderful actress, is really bad in this.  And actor Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur may be the worst actor of all time.  Watching him try to act is cringe-worthy.  Save your time and money and stay FAR FAR AWAY from this disaster.  PS: Since Starz has such a hit formula with their Spartacus series, don't know why they didn't utilize the hallmarks of the Spartacus series in Camelot as well, but they DID NOT.  Suggestion to Starz--make the hallmarks of the Spartacus series your channel's brand formula!  Epically trashy, crazy WTF stories with great actors and tons of stylized violence, nudity and sex!  Works for Spartacus so it will work for all other shows you use use that formula on as well!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app for people that enjoy simple games. I have had to problems unlike what other users have said.
B005O64VH8|5.0|I agree with previous reviews that state that this album is \\"formulaic and predictable,\\" but at least it's not 100% singing (their last album, \\"Inside I'm Singing,\\" was all vocal)!!!  Plus, remember that Fionnuala recently released a solo album (\\"Songs from Before\\").  So, look, \\"Winter Poem\\" is the duo together again, creating music in their trademark style.  What a relief!!!  I'm reasurred by the fact that Secret Garden going back to their roots!!  Just listen to \\"Anticipation\\" and judge for yourself.
B000AYEIZY|3.0|These men are legendary for the music they played and recorded when they were much younger, higher, louder, and more self-destructive.  These men are not those young men. But these men *can* play, too, and what they do also offer is more tasteful phrasing.  Don't expect the wall of sound (and overdubs) represented by Cream's original recordings. But do expect to hear exactly what a \\"Power Trio\\" sounds like without effects, distortion, and deafening volume. In this aspect, this is a courageous recording.  Anyone who listens to blues guitar knowledgeably must agree that Clapton's work here is of a very high order and, at times, brilliant. Bruce is good and at times great. I feel Baker is the weakest link.  I don't agree with every track selection and I do wish the recording quality were better. I think the drums and bass have too little presence. It may simply be due to the size of the venue. You will find it is small-club performance in a 6000 seat venue.  But if you have applauded the music of Clapton, Bruce and Baker in the past, I am sure you will find many reasons to celebrate in this recording.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I thought I would maybe use this app once but I find myself randomly playing with it all the time! Very relaxing and so nice to just stare at.
B005T87QCI|2.0|this app for android was not a great app. they should try to make better controls. and, what? there is no atom? they should add atom (the main robot in the movie) to the beginning list of robots usable.
B003GDFQX4|5.0|Don't know how I missed this one over the years. It's said to have invented the modern thriller, and I can see why. Even though some of it is now dated, and you know Charles DeGaulle was never assassinated, you can't put this book down. Some of Forsythe's long narrative passages would be considered too much by today's standards, but he does know how to flesh out his back story and his historical setting for his story.<br /><br />The Jackal character himself is one of the best villains I have ever read in any book. Cunning, skilled, ruthless, and yet with a code of ethics in dealing with his sources for the tools of his trade that make him a highly believable and well-rounded center of the book.<br /><br />Great piece of writing, great thrills and great suspense.

1466401885|5.0|I just finished reading 'Beautiful Disaster' for the second time ( that should tell you how much I enjoyed this book). Travis is dysfunctional alpha sweetheart who I can't get enough of. This book takes you on an emotional roller coaster your laughing on moment crying the next then wanting to throw the book across the room out of frustration with the characters and I loved every moment of it. I even highly enjoyed the secondary characters in this book as well. Each one of them brought this story to life. I am looking forward to reading more of the Maddox brother stories when they come out. I cant wait to see if their extreme as Travis is when loving someone. I am happy with my purchase and can't wait for more.

The moment I opened to the first page, I couldn't put it.  down.This story has an amazing plot and is jam packed with action. If you're in need of a good read, the hunger gammes is the way to go

B00013M6NK|5.0|I bought this as a spare battery for a new camera and not as a replacement. I wanted another genuine Nikon battery for my camera because of their quality.    In my experience (with a Nikon D70 DSLR) Nikon batteries out perform comparable off-brand batteries and I was able to get this at a fair price.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|This is a simple sleeve made from a thickish padding. It's a little bit large for a Kindle Touch, but I think it would fit the non-Touch Kindles nicely. The padding is thick enough that it should provide great protection for a Kindle that's been tossed into someone's bag, though I wouldn't trust it so much if I dropped it on the floor. I do like the pink color -- it's nice and bright. This isn't something I use every day, as I have a lighted cover on my Kindle, but it's good for piece of mind while I am traveling.
0439023521|5.0|I really loved the book. I read it so I could screen it for my 11 y.o. son to read. Now I'm going to buy the second book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|l love this app.  I.use it on my iphone and kindle fire to not only study but to follow our church sermons live!
B005K2YXHO|5.0|This was a great purchase. I just have the basic kindle and it fits it perfectly! Also looks very modern and is very durable. Fits into any bag that I happen to be carrying with me (book bag, brief case, etc).
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I love this watch. It now keeps me on track whenever I run. It was a little hard to load on the computer, but once I got it going it was fine. Both my sisters have this watch; this is the reason I purchased it. And they were not lying when they said it was a great watch. The price is good. If you are thinking about getting it, don't hesitate. It holds the charge for about 7 days.
B0018TLRTU|5.0|Wow.  This brings me back to the days of blasting Billy's music at my parents house.  This is a great CD, DVD combo.  It has a very good collection of his work and is a pleasure to listen to.  I don't have any thoughts on what I would have wanted to know about this set prior to purchasing it.  To me, Billy Idol is one of the greats.  Now it's brought me back to singing along during the songs.  Quality wise they're good, no drawbacks.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Sorry, I'm still waiting for a good movie to come out that actually keeps me entertained for a longer period than 20 seconds.
B0068RHSZO|2.0|Sometimes your dream house can turn out to be a nightmare just ask director Jim Sheridan who helmed this thriller with supernatural overtones (it's NOT a horror movie despite how it's being marketed and avoid watching the trailer if you want to watch the movie as it gives the entire plot away in less than 3 minutes)and tried to have him name removed after butting heads with the producers, a disappointing preview and having the film taken away from him to be edited by the production company. Actor Daniel Craig summarized the film well by stating that things turned out great because he met his wife (Weisz)but the film, well, not so much.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" has a promising premise and an interesting plot twist that just doesn't come off. Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) gives up his position as an editor for a publishing firm to finally write his novel and stay at home with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz)and their two kids in their idyllic home. Their home is idyllic until they discover that a family was murdered there and they begin seeing figures outside their home. As Will investigates what occured he finds that the killer was never convicted and still lives in their community. Will begins to find out more and more disturbing facts about the killing as he tries to piece together what exactly happened and who is threatening his family.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" suffers from a lethargic first half and the second part of the film suffers from chopy editing clearly indicating that the film went through signficiant re-editing. The troubled history of \\"Dream House\\" included reshooting, director Sheridan being excluded from the editing of the film and, ultimately, trying to have his name removed from the movie (as well as the fact that Craig nor Weisz wanted to do publicity for the film they were so disappointed with the result) are sad given the talent involved. There's the hint of a good movie buried in this mess and the differing tones of the film.<br /><br />The nice production design, photography and performances are in service of an overcooked turkey.<br /><br />BLU-RAY IMAGE QUALITY: \\"Dream House\\" arrives with a handsome looking transfer and blacks are pretty consistent and solid throughout with nice detail which is an important point since some important scenes DO occur in the dark. Colors are robust and flesh tones accurate although the film is a bit on the cool side (a stylistic choice I would assume) for the \\"reality\\".<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES: We get four featurettes which are, frankly, aren't long enough to give us a sense of the efforts that went into the film.<br /><br />First up is \\"Burning Down The House\\" and runs under five minutes focusing on the conclusion of the film and next we get the complimentary \\"Building The Dream House\\" focusing on the production design which is interesting but, again, too brief. \\"Dream Cast\\" focuses on casting while \\"A Look Inside\\" is little more than a promotional short running around 2 minutes. We get the spoiler filled trailer. When watching this I couldn't help but wonder why Morgan Creek AND Universal approved this trailer which is compressses the film down to a couple of minutes and gives us the major plot points of the movie. Seriously, what idiot approved THIS trailer and what editor in their right mind would assemble it THIS way? The good news is that if you don't want to watch the movie you can watch the trailer and get the basic plot of the film.<br /><br />\\"Dream House\\" turned into a nightmare for director and for viewers it's a jumbled mess clearly messed with in post-production. The film starts off with promise but by the second act the film becomes a disappointing thriller that misses its potential.<br /><br />Rent or avoid.tones of the film.<br /><br />The nice production design, photography and performances are in service of an overcooked turkey.<br /><br />BLU-RAY IMAGE QUALITY: \\"Dream House\\" arrives with a handsome looking transfer and blacks are pretty consistent and solid throughout with nice detail which is an important point since some important scenes DO occur in the dark.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it on all my tablets and pods/pads. Have not had any issues or problems, most apps on android work with a few kinks based on version and hardware.  The app works thr same across all I have tried.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|What a splendid film.  While the synopsis isn't going to set the world on fire - Birding? - this bizarre yet mundane subject turns out to be the perfect subject for a comedy.  The Big Year probably isn't going to win any awards or make millions at the box office (note: it didn't), but it's the kind of well crafted and scripted filmmaking we used to enjoy back in the 1960s or 70s before things got complicated with lame gags and explosions.  The cast is in great form.  If anyone could make an entertaining film about birding, it would be director David Frankel - and he succeeds.  Recommended.
B004EPZ02A|3.0|I'm only reviewing the bluray itself, not the movie. I actually enjoyed this movie when i saw it in theaters. The trailer was missleading but the movie still delivered. Now after the movie had ended I had thought that there must of been two completely different cuts of the film to explain why they made a trailer with scenes that for the majority of the part were not in the movie. alas i was wrong. in this bluray you get the theatrical release, and the unrated version, along side the lost tapes which is pretty much a bunch of scenes where the stepdad just scares his wife in funny places, and his promo commmercial selling himself as a video recorder for special occassions. really. thats it. thats the special \\"lost tapes\\" that is all. so do yourself a favor and buy the single dvd version of this movie. it is still a good movie to watch.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|this game is great full of mystery and puzzles and seasons. great game with classic puzzles. I recommened this game for 8+
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome everyone should have it.  it rocks and I love,love,love it really rocks.  I love this game
1451648537|2.0|I thought I would an insight of Steve Jobs the person, but instead its was all about Apple the company and the products which was at times boring.this 600 page plus book I did learn he was smart and had a bad temper this book could have been 200 pages shorter.
B0058RN85O|4.0|i gotta say i love how modern family delivers in special features, there are tons of extended/deleted scenes, and great features. theres also a live audience table read for an episode that aired very early in season 2, that lasts about 30minutes or so. they put a lot of work into these features so i really enjoy them. and this new \\"season session\\" where you get to watch all the eps back to back without pause or having to select the next ep and even tells you to put in the next disc is a nice lil marathon feature i enjoyed.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is simple to use, and is very helpful during my college courses, and football film sessions. its the best note taking program I've used yet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game because it time consuming fun and free i don't see why people say its a waste of time i mean seriously how much awesomer can this game get
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for something I could play alone on my kindle fire. this downloaded fast.  it plays fast and it is a fun relaxing stressless game.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I'm here to talk about what the bluray comes with, not going to review the movie.<br />i was kind of bothered at the fact that this bluray release is very limited on special features. it comes with two short features, the first is about 14min long the second is about 8 minutes long i believe. i actually found both features pretty informative to watch about the movie itself. they were good. i was just expecting more. i mean other than those two small features, there are about 5 or so deleted scenes, and an audio commentary on the film. thats really all there is for special features. so if you buying this movie just for the features, stick with the dvd. but if your really buying it for the great HD movie it is, than go for the bluray.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. a lot of games. it takes a while to unlock everything. I just wanted the points for rating
B00356CO1E|5.0|I bought the 30 Day Shred on Instant Video- which I love because I can workout in either my living room or bedroom without having to transfer a DVD back and forth.  I really have enjoyed the workouts so far- it's been about 3 weeks.  I have already noticed some toning in my legs and arms.. unfortunately it's my tummy that needs the toning the most :(  I definitely recommend this workout for anyone who wants a great workout without spending tons of money for a gym membership or spending too much time at the gym.  I love how Jillian keeps me motivated throughout the workouts- she's pretty inspiring.  And I have to say that if Anita's abs don't push you to keep working out then I don't know what else could!?! That girl is ripped!!  I'm planning on purchasing the 6-week abs in addition to this workout.  I absolutely LOVE Jillian :)
B0052UZIFA|2.0|would give it 5 stars if it didn't freeze or crash every time I played it...won't work on my g-nex or my Droid x

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i didn't know this app would be so awesome! i thought it would be just a time killer but it was better. a little more challenging than expected but that makes it more fun, right? i suggest the app because it is FREE and ADDICTING!!! please get one of the best apps of all. it will totally be worth ur time.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This show is unbelievable. Truly. Within less than 3 weeks of finishing the show, I've seen a majority of it 3 times now. I've even gotten my friends crazy about it despite their skepticism towards war-related shows/movies! The only downfall is that now nothing else compares... Afterwards when I decided to watch Saving Private Ryan for the first time, I just missed the guys from Band of Brothers. Nothing compares to the deep bonds they shared with one another. Prepare to feel your heart wrench.
0446541478|5.0|This book by Dan Senor & Saul Singer knocked me for six, to coin a phrase.  I do not think that any review by me could do it justice, and I will rely occasionally on quotes from knowledgeable reviewers while describing my experience as simply as possible.  I know nothing about commerce.  For me it is a dry and boring subject, but this book was given me as a gift and so I felt duty bound to read it.  \\"Dry\\" and \\"boring\\" do not come into it.  From the reviews at the front to the final pages of information about the authors, I found every sentence riveting.  And exciting.  And joyous.  And although I have had nothing whatever to do with Israel's success, I felt - and feel - enormous pride and happiness as a person who loves Israel and wishes all its population well.  Senor and Singer explain the history of Israel, the seven attacks against it in the first sixty-two years of its existence, and the comprehensive diplomatic and economic embargoes to which it has been subjected.  I did not know that the first Arab boycott against Jews began in 1891 - to stop them purchasing land in the Middle East - and has been more-or-less continuous ever since!  I believed the current BDS campaign to be something relatively new:  far from it, and it is quite evident that Israeli presence in the West Bank has nothing whatever to do with the incomprehensible, ages-old Arab boycotts against Jews.  For at least a century there have been primary, secondary and tertiary boycotts in action - as there still are - and I am learning a great deal more than I ever knew before.  Despite all the attacks, no foreign soldiers have ever come to Israel's aid.  And, as the authors write, \\"The only way we could overcome our attackers' quantitative superiority of weapons was to create an advantage built on courage and technology.\\" Further, the only way of overcoming the lack of local and regional markets for Israeli creativity was by entering the larger, wider, more thoughtful, creative and innovative worldmarket of technology.  And so, Israel has become \\"one of the world's prime incubators of technological innovation.\\"  Where does it all begin?  Why, with the military, of course.  The Israel Defence Force has developed a culture where authority not only can be challenged, but must be;  a culture in which superior skills - never mind rank - plus initiative and improvisation, entrepreneurship and innovation, are encouraged, applauded and appreciated.  The skills finely honed in the military, where contacts and friendship are also made through team work, are then taken outside the army, first into the universities and then into the business world.  As one reads in the Foreword, \\"Israel bred creativity proportionate not to the size of our country, but to the dangers we faced.  This creativity on the security front, moreover, laid the foundations for civilian industries.\\"  The reader learns not only about the civilian industries, and how they are a natural outgrowth of military industry, but also gets an idea of the way Israel functions and flourishes, with endless start-ups which, if they fail, are unashamedly tried again and yet again until they succeed.  One learns too how other small countries living in terror and constant danger have requested advice and help from Israel on how to raise an effective army.  Israel's responses have been generous in the extreme, offering limitless educational support to countries in similar situations to itself.  These countries also wish to increase start-ups, and Israel tries to help in this way as well.  What amazes me almost more than anything about this book is the discovery that each and every day I am using technology developed in Israel and purchased by other countries.  Are you using an Intel Dual Core Processor in your computer?  Guess who developed it?  On and on it goes.  There are two great sadnesses in this book.  The first is that Arabs who came to Israel to be interviewed for the book have to remain anonymous and so cannot be thanked in print.  If their involvement were to be made public, they would be unable to work again in the Arab world.  This, to me at least, is so sad as to be incomprehensible.  From where does all this Arab hatred and oppression come?  Surely not from Islam which is supposed to be, at heart, a peaceful and loving faith?  One of the book's reviewers, Fareed Zakaria of CNN, writes, \\"It's a book I think every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician should read, because it explains this wide gulf between Israel and the Arab world.\\"  The second sadness is, for me, greater than the first.  Israeli Arabs have a very low participation rate in the economy.  A primary reason for this is that they are not drafted into the army.  They are welcome to join the IDF, but whereas for Jews it is compulsory, for Arabs it is a choice.  Most often their choice is not to join up.  This means they are far less likely to develop the entrepreneurial and improvisational skills that the IDF inculcates.  Simultaneously, they do not develop the business networks that young Israeli Jews build while serving in the military, and this exacerbates the long-standing cultural divide between the country's Jewish and Arab communities.  Each year, the authors write, thousands of Arab students graduate from Israel's technology and engineering schools.  Yet, \\"only a few manage to find jobs which reflect their training and skills ... Israel's Arab graduates need to be equipped with a crucial resource which the government cannot supply:  a network of friends in the right places.\\"  And, \\"in the absence of those personal connections, Israeli Jews' mistrust of Israeli Arabs is more likely to hold sway.\\"  So, no-one denies that Israel has its huge problems, many more than I mention here, and many of these have nothing to do with being surrounded by hostile Arab and Islamic nations.  Yet the start-ups forge ahead;  and these new companies are rapidly snapped up by larger international ones.  Israelis work all over the world, in many technology companies, contributing hugely;  thriving.  And foreigners come to live in Israel, to learn and to work and to do research.  Israel today has eight universities and twenty-seven colleges.  Four of them are in the top 150 worldwide universities and seven are in the top 100 Asia Pacific universities.  None of them are satellite campuses from abroad.  Israeli research institutions were also the first in the world to commercialize academic discoveries.  What I've written here is only the tiniest part of the remarkable story this book tells.  Depending on each individual's generosity of heart, one will be either awed and happy for this tiny, besieged, lied-about, struggling democracy, or one will be jealous, envious and furiously angry.
