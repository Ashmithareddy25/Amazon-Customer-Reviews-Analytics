B000PMLFRA|1.0|This should've been a simple enough release, the Star Wars films on Blu-Ray. Of course Lucas decided to include his \\"Special Edition\\" versions which essentially add pointless CG and other ridiculous edits to the original and beloved films that made the Star Wars series and Lucas popular in the first place. The Special Editions have been hated since they were first released on VHS tape, then again the first DVD set was special edition only and people had to wait a while to get the originals they wanted. Even then you had to buy a 2 disc edition with both, because Lucas feels a need to force these new versions on the fan. If the special editions were included as a bonus on this Blu-Ray release then that would be fine. However you are forced to watch the revised editions of these films.     Most people have to worry about their art being censored by media or other corporate factors, however Lucas has become his self censor and changes up his own films. I seriously see absolutely no reason what so ever to buy this set, and the original Star Wars films are some of my favorite movies ever. Also, apparently Lucas has added more new things so it is essentially a special special edition, so now we have alot more \\"great\\" revisions to look forward to.    Lucas has known since 1997 that people do not like his special editions, but forces us to buy them first, why you ask? It's not just because he has lost his mind and thinks these are the definitive versions, he knows some hardcore fans will reluctantly buy these versions and then later buy the original versions which will most likely be released in 2 years or so. Nice cash grab George, as if those toy sales and TV shows aren't making you enough cash on the side you have to screw over your fanbase. It is sill to have to deal with these things when the originals could've easily just been released like people wanted.
B001E45XT4|3.0|This headset has very good audio quality and it feels nice on the head.  The phones fit around my ears, meaning there is no uncomfortable pressure directly on the ears themselves (I tend to be sensitive to that).  My ears do get slightly warm during long periods of wear, but not uncomfortably warm and nowhere near the heat levels I've experienced with other products.    The mic boom is on the left side of the headset.  It is not reversible.  (This was not a problem for me.)  The mike boom pivots down from the left earphone and extends inward-outward in a telescoping fashion.  This allows the boom to be pivoted up and clipped into the edge of the head band when not in use.    The microphone quality is poor.  I needed to crank up the mic input gain on my computer in order for the audio level to be usable.  Unfortunately, doing this also cranks up background noise.  With the microphone boom fully extended it barely reached the near corner of my mouth.  If I removed the headset from my head and held the microphone directly in front of my mouth, the mic audio level was better and required less gain.  (Perhaps they should have made the boom longer?)    With the aforementioned required high mic input gain it also didn't do well in the \\"noise-canceling\\" category.  I set up a test with a second person standing eight feet away from me to my rear-left corner.  While I talked into the microphone this person also talked at a room-level voice.  The voice of this second person was picked up and could be heard clear-as-day (albeit quieter than my voice) on the input audio.    Overall, this is an average device with above-average feel but below-average microphone quality.  Avoid this item if you need high-quality input audio from the microphone or if you'll be using it in an atmosphere with background noise.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|This is a good watch. Its stylish and keeps time! Everything else is real good apart from the pins that hold the wrist bands. I had a few unpleasant experiences, searching for the pin in my car after my watch wrist band split. After a long time, I did find it(the pin is so small!). However the next day, the pin escaped my wrist band again(into oblivion this time)! Still, I had a few spares and it has not happened again so far. However, I would have really liked it if the pin just stayed tightly where it was supposed to stay.  And people, the thing that I did not know about it beforehand; which would have influenced my decision to buy it is: Its not automatic, runs on a battery! They dont tell you that. As for the battery life, I am keeping track of it so when its dead I will post again.
B004LWZVZM|3.0|Interesting movie.<br />I do not know just how much was factual.<br />If the trial went as it did in the movie with political discrimination (I believe it did) then it was a travesty of justice.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|Seriously, who gives this less than 5 stars? Bryan Cranston is great, but the side characters are SO well done. More people should be winning more awards for this. I'll miss this show when it's gone.
0307269752|3.0|I gave this book 3 -1/2 stars because I did enjoy the book . . . a lot. The reason it didn't get 4 stars was because of the ending, which I felt was much too short, abrupt and unsatisfying. The beginning of the book drones on for 100 pages, but if you're willing to stick it out the rest of the book is very well worth the read. I also understand that the main character has been compared to Pippy-Longstockings, I didn't see it.
B00004SA88|5.0|Salvatore Accardo in his mid thirties committed to disc his vision on the whole Paganini oeuvre (including the 6 violin concertos, the 24 caprices and some works for violin and orchestra). Paired by the London Philharmonic under Charles Dutoit, Accardo achieved - beyond any doubt - a truly benchmark for ages. His technical perfection and inspired musicianship contributed to a wonderful moment of great music. Although considered as simply virtuosity-oriented pieces, favouring soloist's bravura and responding to public's need for stage wizardry, these works gain here a noble finesse and musical value. Not only the violinist shines, but also the orchestra which takes the risk of dealing with a bombast atmosphere or lamenting melodies, here and there. Of course, Accardo is the star in all these 6 CDs and determines the listener to play these recordings again and again. Surprisingly, the sound is alive and full of colour, assuming the performances took place more than three decades back.   Not to be missed by any collector who loves music played in grand style!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Overall I liked the recording.  The performances are really good.  I fell in the trap of trying to compare to some of the original Les Miserables recordings.  I remember that I like the Gary Morris recording over Colm Wilkinson.      Initially I though that Nick Jonas performance was so so.   I do not think it was as charismatic as some of the other parts.  I certainly like the other earlier recordings such as the Complete Symphonic recording better. There were some places where it   seemed that Nick Jonas Struggled a bit.  I some of the performance had a little more character or expression.  I think Nick Jonas needs to develop the Vocal Range of his voice a little.   There was a place where he really struggled going for  some of the lower notes.
0307269752|5.0|All I gotta say. I love a mystery, and this one kept me guessing and guessing. The whole series is one of my favorites.
159420229X|2.0|This book has some neat tips for training your memory, and introduces a unique subculture.  Unfortunately the story line is BORING.  If you are looking for a text book type self help book, this may be the one for you.  Otherwise forget it.
B0023P7ZAI|5.0|Years ago, I never knew what Green Day was.  I thought they were some music group that had ties to the green movement.  I've learned since then.  Green Day is basically made up of three men, from the Bay Area, the East Bay to be more precise.    Well, I watched the blu-ray concert.  Green Day was loud, raucous, foul-mouthed, dirty, frantic, anti-government, anarchistic, self-indulgent, perverted, adolescent, sophomoric, juvenile, and a bit messed up.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were to incite a riot.  I think I saw two or three fights break out on the video.    So this concert is perfect for any Green Day fan and I give 5 stars.    Green Day has been described as a punk band.  To me, it seems that they are a mix of punk, grunge, and rock. (They have too much make-up around the eyes.) They seem to be uncontrolled, tattooed hooligans with too much time on their hands and with too much bad influences, without enough supervision and guidance.  I have a feeling, though, that their wild behavior is actually partially controlled and purposeful.  It's just part of their act.  Still, they're not quite the type of boys that you would want your daughter from Oakland or Berkeley to date.    They are a bit too much for me, sometimes, with the expletives and bad behavior. In general, it was an interesting concert experience and I enjoyed parts of it.    If you accept Green Day, the band, for what it is, and from where they, as individuals, came, it is easy to understand them.  They are part of the suburbian milieu of Northern California.    They do seem to be having the time of their lives, (maybe a little too much fun?).
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you are an active eBay user, this app is a must.  You can quickly see how your bidding is going on an auction, how your selling is going, what items you are \\"watching\\".  It's very useful if you are travelling and you are in the process of bidding on an item.  It's extremely useful if you aren't at your normal computer to keep up to date on the status of an auction.    P.S.  It was virtually one of the first apps I downloaded when I got my Droid X.
0060512806|1.0|such as Zodiac (a little rough, but his first novel), Snowcrash and the Diamond Age. I have re-read Snowcrash twice and The Diamond Age 4 times.    Struggled through this one, hoping that eventually it would start to have some sort of cohesion that would bring it all together. Never happened for me. I did enjoy some of the details and side tangents, but they never really factored into any of the story threads.     Finally finished it and then realized that around 200-300 pages in I had the insight that it was not really going to go anywhere - should have gone with that and abandoned at that point. And yes, I am a computer geek/professional with interests in encryption so it should have been a rewarding read. No dice.

0553801473|1.0|I first heard about Song of Ice and Fire at about the time the Game of Thrones HBO miniseries came out.  I picked up the book hoping for an entertaining read, and was not disappointed.  What first drew me in was the discovery of the dire wolf cubs and the way they seemed to be destined to be the companion of each Stark child.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that storyline was soon abandoned, with either the cubs being killed or driven off.  Those that have remained have been delegated to purely background status in the storyline.  \\"Game of Thrones\\" is certainly the best read of the bunch; the series has gone downhill from there.<br /><br />After the first chapter or two of \\"Dance With Dragons\\" I found myself mostly skimming through the pages looking for something interesting to happen sandwiched between very lengthy (read boring) descriptive passages that go on for pages and pages and the introduction of new (and uninteresting) characters who seem to have been produced so that the author can avoid continuing with the actual story.  I probably ended up skimming through half the book.<br /><br />I'll not reveal what happens in the final chapter for those who have not yet read the book, but suffice to say that the only main character still remaining in which I had any real interest appears to have been killed off as well.<br /><br />I have read elsewhere that these books have been compared to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.  Having read all of Mr. Tolkien's books, I would have to say that Mr. Martin's books don't even come close.<br /><br />To sum up in a few words: these books, including \\"Dance With Dragons\\", are basically just extremely graphic sexual pornography and violence pornography masquerading  as literature.<br /><br />Save your money and give them all a pass.
0439023521|5.0|This book is equal parts disturbing, thought-provoking, and chilling. More than anything though, it's completely compelling. Can't wait for the movie with Jennifer Lawrence. Should be something. It's amazing how much the book affected me. And just a heads-up that parts are pretty violent (quite brutal, in fact) and much of it is really unsettling, but you can't say the book's dull. It'll always keep you engaged. So, despite the violence, if you can get through it, it should prove quite an intrepid read. Opens your mind and your emotions, most definitely. Really, a must-read. Works both as a love story and an action yarn, and once in, you'll be hooked on Katniss and her journey.
0062060554|5.0|First thing that comes to mind is OMG! What an amazing amazing read. I can honestly say that this book had me at the edge of my seat. To say it's a definite page turner is an understatement. I stayed up till past 1 am to finish reading. Once I picked this book up I wasn't able to put it down. I read it everywhere, while cooking, walking to the bus, etc. It was that good. The ending was a great ending. I didn't exactly expect it. It was just an amazing book. And I'm super excited to say this book was picked up for a movie which starts/started film/filming this year. So I can't wait for it to come out on theater. Hopefully they won't change it much.<br /><br />Can you imagine yourself waking up every morning and not knowing who you are? Where you are and who is this person sleeping beside you? Well that's Christine's life. She suffers from amnesia due to an \\"accident\\" and she wakes up everyday not knowing anything from her life. Every morning her husband has to answer questions as to who she is, who he is, where she is and what happened. She doesn't remember much, just fragments of memories. The one thing that does help is the journal she keeps in a shoebox in her closet. And a Doctor she has been secretly working with to find out how to help her regain her memory.<br /><br />Almost every morning she wakes up and she gets a phone call telling her that she has a journal in her closet to help her remember or cope with what she has forgotten and feeling. As she reads this journal of the previous days she discovers she has been lied to. She sees that she's been working with Dr. Nash and doing different tests to try and help her with her amnesia. What she doesn't know is that Dr. Nash knows a bit more about her past and uses that information to bring out some memories. As he continues to push further into the study, she begins to have more and more different new memories in which he encourages her to write in her journal. He explains how revisiting certain places and people in her past might help regain more memory. But the deeper they go into the study the more information comes out and the more dangerous it becomes.<br /><br />This is a nail biting, heart racing experience. S.J. Watson did an amazing job with this book and I am so glad that I was able to read it, courtesy of Netgalley. I can't wait for the movie to come out. If you're looking for a thriller and suspense, then this is YOUR book! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! A definite definite MUST BUY!

B005KGPC4S|2.0|This is a poorly written movie. The preacher fills up way to much time with nonsense. It's like Kevin had a bunch of ideas and crammed them in to this movie, but they were not exactly put together in an intelligent way. I hope Kevin's wife paddles hims for making this.
B001H9JBW6|1.0|This is not a review of th oontent, but many will need to know that this series has no closed captioning and so is useless to so many who are hard of hearing and unable to hear slang, thick accents, mumbles and scenes with background noise drowning out the audio. My husband and I were unable to hear much in the first few scenes so gave up on a series that looks just like our cup of tea. Frustrating and sad.
0307592839|3.0|Egan's book is a like a teenage joyride with stops and starts, turning and twisting, seemingly with no destination until you realize that you are finally there. One section of the book, a PowerPoint diversion, clutters the content as coupons do a newspaper. Bad idea.     The rudderless characters of the book may not be memorable or endearing but are nevertheless tragic enough to motivate the reader to see what the next chapter holds. The subplot is really about where the excesses and egos of the rock industry will sometimes lead and it's not pretty. The author choreographs the Goon Squad journey as if it were a rock concert, with its main characters tripping and existing stage right. They are as fragmented as the book's structure.    Seems like the New York crowd judges saw the hip culture merits of this book as Pulitzer worthy. Goony logic. After reading Jonathan Franzen's poignant \\"Freedom\\", I realize that the top prize went to the wrong writer. A Visit from the Goon Squad doesn't hold a kindle to Freedom. 2 bad 4 Franzn mayB nex time.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I have been reading Stephen King since the 70's and I'm 54 years old. I am \\"Constant Reader.\\" So, I take no pleasure in this review. This is one of the weakest things that \\"my favorite author\\" has ever written. I have stayed with Stevie because he is the absolute best at writing about \\"pop culture.\\" I know he is very left wing but \\"Under the Dome\\" was still an excellent fun read. This was not bad political overtones or stereotyped characters. This was just not a story that allowed me to suspend belief and have fun. First, young children don't always act cool and \\"hip\\" when confronted by danger. A young 8 to 10 year old will rarely if ever think in terms of \\"f-word this or f-word that\\" as if he were a teenager getting ready for a party. Matter of fact most young children would not simply pick up a bottle of booze (vodka) and take a drink or two. The actual reaction would be \\"Yuk, I'm not putting my mouth on that.\\" But, for some reason my favorite author in his mid sixties has lost the ability in this particular story to write actual dialog that might come close to a child's actual thoughts. Even, that can be forgiven. But, the \\"Thing\\" from where ever (don't want to spoil it) just doesn't make much sense. I'm afraid the whole darn thing just doesn't make much sense. I believe in Stephen King and I believe this was just a brain fart or a slip. I look forward to the Kennedy era novel this fall. I honestly appreciate Stephen King and have enjoyed his work over the years. But, on this one I will have to say. I wish I had taken a pass.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Okay, I have been reading through the reviews on this book before writing my own. I have to say I was surprised by how many negative comments this book received. I am 24 years old and not a big fan of the movies. However, I love the Twilight series books. Breaking Dawn was my favorite out of the four books. I will agree that there are some things I would have changed about the book, but for the most part I loved it(not just because everyone lived happily ever after blah, blah, blah) I read all four of these books within a weeks time and they all had me wanting more. I thought Breaking Dawn was a great read and it made me want more. I was disappointed at the end when there was no fight scene, because the book was building the fight up and then took it away.
0312955006|4.0|Enjoyed the book as I do most of Connelly's work. However, there was one thing that bothered me throughout the trial. The issue at the trial was supposedly if Bosch was justified in killing Church. The trial became whether Church was the Dollmaker. It actually was irrelevant if Church was the Dollmaker for this specific case.   The testimony should have been directed to the justification, or lack thereof, for Bosch's actions in his killing regardless of whether Church was the serial killer.   As I said I enjoyed the book but this very basic mistake was bothersome to me.
1400076943|4.0|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's debut novel set in Nigeria tells a simple story with a depth of details, undertones and overtones.<br /><br />Purple Hibiscus is a first person account by 15 year old Kambili. Envied by her classmates and cousins for her fathers wealth and standing in the community and the church, she is thought of as snobbish, while she is actually a painfully introverted young girl.<br /><br />Her father Eugene, owns a multitude of businesses and helms one of the most fearless newspapers in Nigeria where he and his editor print the news as they see it. An upstanding Catholic, he is held in high esteem for his wealth, power and religious beliefs. All of which dazzle the priests, his community and the folk of his village and blind them to the fanatical edge to his beliefs.<br /><br />As the story progreses, we realise that the terror that Kambili, her brother Jaja and their mother face doesn't stem just from the perfection demanded by their father, but from the very real and frequent domestic abuse that they are all subjected to.<br /><br />Brought up by Christian Missionaries, Eugene renounces his own father for holding onto his ancient beliefs, calling him a heathen and completely cutting him out of his life, only relenting to let his children visit him for a few minutes each year, after his father brings the matter to the village council.<br /><br />Eugene's sister, Ifeoma is not as blinded by her brothers wealth and inspite of having a tough life as a professor and a widow with young children, she refuses to grovel for any monetary help from her brother. Instead, she tries to convince her sister-in-law to leave him for her own safety and that of the children.<br /><br />There are 3 very interesting sets of beliefs and ways of life that are portrayed in Purple Hibiscus. The narrow minded, fanatical Christianity followed by Eugene who leads a privileged life, the traditionalist way of his father who does not even know where his next meal will come from and the middle path that Ifeoma works out for herself and her children while hovering on the brinks of poverty. While they are baptised Christians, they respect their father/grandfather's beliefs, while their mother is well educated and is a professor at University, salaries aren't paid on time, prices are sky rocketing and supplies are low.<br /><br />One summer, realising that Kambili and Jaja know nothing of life outside their fathers strict, unforgiving, disciplinarian and fanatical way of life, Aunt Ifeoma invites just the chilkdren to stay with her family for awhile under the guise of undertaking a religious pilgrimage. And here begins their awakening. While Jaja quickly adapts and learns, Kambili's process is much slower and involves intense internal turmoil.<br /><br />Adichie writes beautifully, her turn of phrase is almost poetic and immerses you straight into Nigeria. She is extremely descriptive and sensitive in her handling of the story. The reader will completely empathise with Kambili within a few pages , rejoicing at each little triumph and shedding a few tears at each set back. While the story could be set anywhere in the world and would hardly change in plot, the strength of Adichies writing is the knowledge of all things Nigerian that come through in each sentence.<br /><br />The description of the food, the smells, the sights, the tastes, the customs all bring the reader closer to life in Nigeria.<br /><br />A poignant read, this is not something you will read for the story line or the plot, but because the words will draw you in and take you on a magical carpet right into the heart of Nigeria.erself and her children while hovering on the brinks of poverty.

006088732X|5.0|I couldn't put this down... and I didn't put it down until I was finished!  What an addicting story!  I'm not the target demographic for this book at all.  I'm 34 yo but I can't wait to start the next book.  Granted, it's not great literature by any means but it's something that pulls you in and you just can't wait to see what happens next.  It's like a train wreck that you know you shouldn't be staring at but you just can't help it.  Great twists, turns and secrets!  I felt so bad for all of the girls (except Ali) throughout the whole book because they are all a mess, have completely disfunctional families and make bad choices.  But it's fiction and it's so much fun.  I can't wait to get home from work and start book 2!
B004132HZS|5.0|An ingenious update of the Holmes stories, these take place in modern day London with sly asides to the original stories. The actors are brilliant in defining the characters. Watson is still an Afghan War veteran (some things don't change, mores the pity)and Holmes is still a genius. I love the way bits of the original stories are updated and inserted, instead of a three pipe problem Holmes wears three nicotine patches, instead of shooting VR into the wall it's a smiley face. If you're a Holmes fan give this a try.

The characters are interesting, if a bit under-developed.     My only complaint is that most of the action happened in the last 40 pages of the book. It felt like the author was setting the stage for a long series of books and just wanted to put down the groundwork for the series and then quickly finish up with a burst of action. But, again, it was definitely an enjoyable read and a unique idea for a book.     I'd like to reiterate other reviewers and say it is not a scary story, but more a work of science-fiction/fantasy.
B001FB55M6|5.0|I watched this in theaters a while back, and I had to own it. This can be classified as a romantic comedy, as the cliche of the guy or girl getting the lover always happens. This is a feel good movie in my opinion. Instead of being drenched in negativity in our lives, why not do things we actually wanted to do. After I watched this, I took a singing class, and hey, it just happens that I'm pretty good at it. I do recommend this movie to viewers who are looking at the downside of life at the moment.     Staying positive about opportunities that are presented to us will reward us eventually. I felt great watching this movie, and you might feel great as well.     (Everyone has their own opinion, I am a movie lover, so I love 95% of the movies out there. You may not like it, but I do.)
B0054PSY2W|5.0|A note to interested shoppers - be aware that the color correction on the blu-ray is a bit different from previous versions of the film. There's a lot more \\"green\\" in the movie than previously. Check out the dvdbeaver review to see some pictures of this. This is one of my favorite movies and I'm sure it'll still be enjoyable and beautiful, but I wanted to share this info.
0743442539|4.0|Can a book be interesting but kind of dull at the same time? Yes, although I don't think this particular combination happens often in writing.  I read \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" when it was first published, and what I remember liking about it was what I felt was its verisimilitude -- the appearance of being real or true. Before he wrote this book, the author had been a member of the British Secret Service, so he wrote as a former spy about spies and spying. The boredom, the uncertainty, the duplicity, the depression, the immorality -- these things all come out in the book. When you read this book, you can feel what the spies feel. In all these senses, the book is interesting.<br /><br />What makes the book dull is that, although it's not even 300 pages long, it reads like a 600-page book. Slow. Tedious. Long paragraphs. Little white space. Little action. A lot DOES happen in this novel: it just doesn't FEEL as if it's happening. It may be unfair of me to criticize the dullness of the story, because the author may very well have intended to show that this is what the life of a spy is like (this, not the James Bond action). Still, a writer must take readers into consideration and try to get the tedium across without being tedious.<br /><br />But, if you're interested in spy novels, read this one. It is to spy novels what Joseph Wambaugh's \\"The New Centurions\\"  is to cop novels -- written by a practitioner of the trade, telling things like they are.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Ayn Rand Clasic!  It was really great to see this movie once more. I saw it years ago and never foregot one major scene, where Cooper breaks a piece of marble with a chisel, and says now its broken miss. Francone.
B000SC245E|5.0|The Belt Unit is OEM, installed and worked as advertised. No problem. I would recommend it. There is nothing more to say, but Amazon wants 20 words, so...
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|After watching \\"The Pacific\\" on Netflix, I knew it would be a perfect gift for my USMC veteran brother's 74th Birthday. The problem? It was only five days to his birthday and he lived in another state. I went to Amazon to find the boxed DVD set. I chose \\"Supercdjoint\\" as the vendor, for price and customer ratings.   I received it, checked it for damage, packaging, and to make sure it was as advertized. Everything was A-OK. I taped it back up, put on a new label, and mailed it. He received it on his B'day.   This was my first time using Amazon.com and Supercdjoint. I was very satified with both.   As for \\"The Pacific\\", it is an excellent biographic. Another great collaboration for Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I have read many books about The War and watched hundreds of documentaries, but I can't recall anything that made me feel so totally awed by what these brave men endured. This is a real story about real men. I really liked \\"Band of Brothers\\", but this is equally as good in a different way. It's more focused on a few individuals, rather than as a group.
0345529057|5.0|Seriously, hands down, the best book series I've read in a LOOONG time. Chapters alternate with different character's story lines and each one is scripted like a well done television show. At the end of almost every chapter, there is a bit of a cliffhanger ending that makes you HAVE TO KEEP READING through the next chapter, even though the next chapter is a different thread of the story from a different character's experience. It totally sucks you in and keeps you turning pages.exa    Only complaint is that by the end of book four, you get the creeping suspicion that George R.R. Martin doesn't know exactly where the story is going or how long it is going to be (or how it ends?)... but, even with that it is an incredibly enjoyable read.    Grab the set & hit the beach/pool/couch, read & enjoy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is an excellent game with a beautiful presentation. Perfect for casual relaxing play that requires a perfect amount of thought to get that perfect score.

B0058ZJYJK|5.0|First of all, hi. If you already own \\"The Fool\\" and you like warpaint, stop reading this review right now and just go ahead and get this. It's worth the price and it's almost as long as a full-length album anyway.    Wow, this is incredible. I am actually quite surprised that there are no reviews on this album. I could have sworn someone had reviewed this. Anyway, this EP is special, because none of the songs on this are on the album, \\"The Fool.\\" Each song is good and there are no fillers. NO FILLERS. I swear.    I have owned The Fool for a while and i've heard great things about Exquisite Corpse so I went ahead and payed the straight up 6 dollars to get it. It was hard considering i'm the person that likes to wait for an album to go on sale. Lets just say I hardly buy EPs. BUT WOW, this is wonderful. It catches you right from the beginning and takes you on a journey right to the last 30 seconds of the last song. Utter brilliance. The lead singer's, Emily Kokal's, hypnotic voice along with the dreamy, sometimes very intense guitar really gets your attention. And lets not forget the bass and drums, always pumping in the background driving the song on.     Don't get me wrong, not all songs are loud and pumping - Warpaint has their soft side as well. The album starts out with soft eerie guitars and Emily Kokal's voice floating over the top of the beautiful arrangements that Warpaint creates. I'm not big on female singers, so they have to be very good to get my attention, but heck this is a four-piece all girl band and it rocks. So, yeah, stop listening to Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or whatever the crap Girl Singer music your listening to right now. Just STOP it. If you want to listen to girls really just downright rocking it - well buy this. flip yeah.
1451629184|4.0|An 18 month captivity with a Psyco is a horrofic ordeal!! I some how felt in some occasions the focus of the book was shifted to less important things (cats, dogs and other animals). I would have loved to know more about how Jaycee bonded with Philip and in several occcacsions she defended him! the \\"Stockholm Syndrom\\". I wished she talked more about that. In general a great book and I woudl recommend it.
0545128285|4.0|If you are a Harry Potter fan and own all of the books, Tales of Beedle the Bard is a wonderful addition to your collection. Although not an epic fantasy read, it does expand on details in the Harry Potter world already mentioned in series. Each story is short and quaint. My favorite of these stories would have to be the Tale of the Three Brothers. I also found it fun to read the book that Hermione studied so closely in the Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for another fantastic Harry Potter novel, this isn't it. Instead Tales of Beedle the Bard is another timeless addition to the series and helps enhance the Harry Potter reader's experience.
0446563048|4.0|This is a quick (weekend) read for an avid reader, but jam-packed with the successes, failures, and inspirational stories surrounding Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh. Tony reflects on lessons learned earlier in life as a child with an entrepreneurial spirit and culturally traditional parents. As consumers, there's a reason we love Zappos so much and it's not because they have the edgiest advertising campaign or bargain prices. Tony tells us why through his story about how Zappos evolved from a company in financial crisis to a growing business, happily married to Amazon. By believing in and never wavering in his loyalty to the core values and overall culture he had become a part of, Tony managed to achieve great profits and strides in the industry all while delivering happiness to all.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The title says everything you need to know about this garbage. Save your money people, this is a disgrace to film, art, and history.
0307266303|5.0|This book has a little bit of everything for everyone.  It has science, history, biography, sports & competition and more.  But what makes this book good is that throughout the various chapters that jump from subject to subject it never loses its focus from the main purpose.  What makes this book enjoyable is the style in which it is written.  It's written as though you're sitting at a bar talking to a good friend, drinking a beer and listening to him tell you a story.
B003I55BIA|5.0|You can't see it but I'm fanning myself right now. Perfect Chemistry is super steamy and oh so much fun to read. The chapters alternate narration between Brittany Ellis and Alex Fuentes, giving you each characters perspective.  As mentioned in the description, Brittany and Alex are total opposites. At school, Brittany is the popular good girl and Alex is the Latino blood gang member and school bad boy. The two characters are paired together as lab partners in Chemistry class and their differences create friction from the beginning.<br /><br />Brittany puts up a facade to her peers that she has the perfect life, but in her opinion it is far from perfect.  At home, Brittany's parents pressure her to keep up appearances by always looking great and keeping up good grades. While her parents are busy nitpicking her, they ignore her special needs sister, whom Brittany cares for deeply.<br /><br />Alex is the oldest of three brothers and ever since his father died, from gang violence, he has been the man of the house. Since gang activity is prevalent in his neighborhood, he becomes a member to protect his family. He hopes to keep his two brothers out of the `Blood' by doing everything the gang wants, even though he would love more than anything to be free.<br /><br />As they are forced to get to know each other, the lives they try to keep so secret are exposed. They fall hard for each other, but with everything standing in between them can their relationship last?<br /><br />I love so many things about this story: the characters, the romance, the social challenges.<br /><br />Elkeles wrote a sizzling romance that pulls you in and keeps you turning the page. The characters face real life social conflicts that, in the end, turn them into remarkable people. Alex's gang experience is very true to life and you feel the difficulty of his situation. Brittany pushes past what her parents want her to be and reaches out to help Alex, in return, she finds out who she really wants to be.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves teenage romance novels.yone who loves teenage romance novels.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I used this app all the time on the iPhone but the android is not as refined.  There is a particular station I listen to that will download the entire stream on the iphone but will not on this version.  Also if you are listen to a pre-recorded stream and the stream connection is lost, you place on the stream is lost and there is no easy way to advance your last place.  This was not the case with the iphone version.  The quantity of stations and streams is excellent and overall a good streaming app except the for the bugs above.
B000TGJ8AS|3.0|Not sure why, but there were subtitles for Season 3; but they decided not to do them for Season 4? They did not do them for Seasons 1 or 2 other but it seems random to have Season 3 with them and then 4 not. Does anybody know if Seasons 5-7 do or not? I am deaf and hard of hearing so its hard to watch without subtitles. I can not get closed captioning due to the new LCD tvs and digital connections. It is really difficult to watch. But I love the series, since Season 7 when my husband got me into it.   Just watching from the beginning now so I hope they can update all new dvds to include the subtitles.
0345529057|5.0|I'm half way through the 2nd book. I'd read these books all day long if I could. I never know what's going to happen next.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book is a riot. I absolutely love it when a book makes me frequently laugh out loud.  Paper Towns is a uniquely witty and refreshingly realistic teenage adventure story and I highly recommend it for teenagers and adults.<br /><br />Band geek and good boy Quentin Jacobson is weeks away from graduating when one night his rebellious neighbor and old childhood friend, Margo Roth Spiegelman shows up at his window. Quentin, also know as Q, has had a serious crush on Margot ever since they were kids but hasn't spoken to her since then, until this night.  His crush presents him with the opportunity to drive her around town and seek revenge on all who've scorned her.  Little did Q know that this night would change him forever.<br /><br />When Margo goes missing, Q and his band of geektaskic friends, Radar and Ben, search for clues to find her. Their search for her leads them on an outrageous journey that is results in unexpected new friendships, insights into Margo's life, and quirky encounters with all sorts of new places. Their twisted and perverted teenage boy sense of humor is nothing less than awesome and I couldn't help bursting out laughing.<br /><br />Even though Paper Towns is fun and humorous read, there is a note of seriousness that keeps the book grounded. John Green highlights the issue of teenage runaways, its causes and it's affects. Although this is a tough subject, John Green keeps the reader enthralled.<br /><br />I've been wanting to read a John Green book for a while now and I'm so glad I finally did. He is a smart and talented author who clearly knows how to write good young adult fiction. I'm already trying to get my hands on some of his other books because I cannot wait to go on another one of his teenage adventures.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This games is great and highly addictive.  However the iphone version has more content.  I can not imagine why this is.  The app works great but your need to watch what type of device your install this on.
0062060554|3.0|I read some really great reviews prior to reading this so my expectations were pretty high. As some reviewers have noted, it's an OK book- not bad but not great. I loved the concept but it ended up being a little too formulaic and predictable for my taste.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is the best GaGa has come up with so far. I listen to it 24/7! This album is full of good feelings and empowerment. If you don't own this yet you need to. Everyone should have this album even if they dont really like Lady GaGa. It's a masterpiece I cant wait to see what she has in store for the next album!
B000067J24|5.0|Just a magic film. When I lost my copy to a girlfriend after our break up, I was really looking forward to having it in the library again.<br /><br />It arrived ahead of schedule and in the exact condition it was advertised.<br /><br />Great service!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I have played this to nearly completion, just 3 levels left.  It is simple to learn but challenging without being too difficult.  I find this game to be original and unique and a worth while download.  I would recommend this to anyone as a good, low key time killer.
030788743X|5.0|As someone who loathes WOW players, and their (seemingly) trivial pursuits, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  I am happy to be disappointed.  Not only is it interesting (and possibly forewarning), it's well written, entertaining, and appeals greatly to my geek sensibilities.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|***New Update***<br />After the update 02/2012 I was able to play the minigames. I stopped playing the game and when I went back to it, all of my information was gone. Well, all but my name. Not cool at all. The update said it would not get rid of saved information. Two stars down to one. Pop Cap gave Android a crap knock off of the game and does not care about it. Sad that every other OS the game is on has the full game. I wonder if they got payed to give Android this crap...<br /><br />***Update*** Four stars downgraded to Two<br /><br />I was told to uninstall and re-install the game. I did. After I finished the adventure mode the mini games were working fine. I beat the adventure mode the second time and a week later the mini games were crashing again. The games that do not work are: whack-a-zombie, bowling, and the pool and day and night conveyor belt games.<br /><br />I contacted Pop Cap and was told they forwarded my issue to the necessary department. About a week later I wrote them back asking when would I hear from someone. The reply basically said they don't know what's going on and they'll let me know when an update comes out... He asked that I un and re install I told him I did and the problem came back. He said sorry. Pointless to go through all of that again if they haven't fixed the problem yet.<br /><br />The only reason this gets two stars is because it's fun and I do have some game play. I wish we had the full game though. What's the point of getting money you can't spend? I have everything Dave is selling and I have a lot of money to waste. I could buy up some plants, feed the tree of knowledge or something. I'm not sure why Android didn't get the full game. I barely play it anymore. Hopefully Pop Cap is working on the full game.<br /><br />***<br />Three of my mini games are crashing. The whack-a-zombie and the pool and day conveyor belt boards.<br /><br />When I open them it asks do I want to restart, continue our cancel. If I choose restart orcontinue I get booted out of the game. This has been going on for a while. Each day a new board is gone.

B002TZS5GU|3.0|Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or video quality of the disc nor the extras.  My review is concerned with the film's entertainment value only.    'Carriers' takes a limited, although interesting, one-track approach to the apocalypse genre, which is to ask the question, 'Are any relationships strong enough to trump survival?'.  In a world where a plague is in the process of wiping out the last remaining survivors, two brothers, along with their girlfriends, are attempting to reach the vacation spot they remember from childhood, while at the same time avoiding plague victims, and, just as dangerous if not more so, other survivors.  Chris Pine, as the older brother and default leader Brian, is forced to make increasingly more difficult moral decisions for the group as the film progresses, and though younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci) struggles to maintain his humanity in the process, he is also finally forced to choose between survival and fraternal affection.    Production values and the competent young actors make this film stand out over many of the schlocky, B-movie efforts that dominate the post-apocalyptic genre, yet the movie's very slickness helps disguise 'Carriers' essentially superficial presentation.  The themes and questions are interesting in and of themselves - and asking them in this setting is an effective way of highlighting this aspect of human behavior.  Yet once the characters are established, the rest of the film follows in a predictable pattern to its conclusion.  In other words, the film goes no farther than raising the question in the viewer's mind of whether or not there are any ties that truly bind.  The film answers - not if you want to survive.      Films of this type don't have to ask and answer complex ethical questions - and simply as entertainment, 'Carriers' is above average for this genre.  Perhaps the best description of its overall value is that I remember that I was attentive and interested during the film, though now that a few days have gone by, many of the its images are starting to fade.  Satisfactory as a rental, especially for fans of the genre, but not enough depth - nor mayhem for those most interested in that aspects of these types of films - for multiple viewings.

1400079144|3.0|Overall, I have few words for this book. Read the other posts.  But, did anyone else catch his references to the Gita? I just thought that that was really cool as a Hindu.  Of course, the accuracy and such of his statements is off, but just that kind of exposure makes me a proud, albeit only semi-religious, Hindu.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is one of my first reviews for a product that I bought off Amazon. I buy a fairly large portion of my electronics and accessories on Amazon, so you can imagine that this little piece of work made an impression on me.    I bought this case for my iPhone 4 (Verizon) not too long ago because I felt that the smoked out color of the case would look good with my white iPhone (which it does, by the way), and I wanted something low profile that wouldn't add much bulk to the phone itself. I have a minimalistic view when it comes to something I'm going to have on me all day, so an Otterbox, albeit invincible, was out of the question.    As soon as I had a chance to \\"test\\" this case's durability, I immediately had to post a review so that I could share my experience with anyone as skeptical as me about a $9 case. I clumsily attempted to put the phone back into my pocket and fumbled, dropping the phone from about 4 feet onto hard concrete. Not only was the phone completely untarnished, but the case sustained the smallest nick imaginable. That was the extent of the damage.    That wasn't the only time I've dropped the phone. I've been known for my inability for grasping a phone for extended periods of time, and often I'll drop it face down onto the hardwood floor (which, in most cases, is covered with a layer of small debris and tracked-in environment) with no repercussions.    Pros:    1. CHEAP!  2. Nice texture, looks great with white iPhone  3. Not too grippy, won't \\"stick\\" to your pocket (feels like 50/50 rubber/hard plastic)  4. Sturdy/rugged!    Cons:    1. Edges of the phone still not the smoothest to touch (but improved over naked iPhone)  2. Could be flashier?    Summary:    Buy this case if you're like me and are seeking the perfect balance between style and practicality. Can you go wrong with $9? They even throw in a screen protector, microfiber cloth, and a small plastic card to remove the bubbles when installing the screen protector.
0374531269|4.0|This book was a story that needed to be told.  At times I felt myself despising UNICEF.  It's unfortunate how the problem with child soldiers cannot be resolved properly.  I won't donate to UNICEF after I read this book.
B000NA28I4|1.0|If you read the books, and you thought the movie might be pretty cool, you are wrong. Characters have been poorly casted. Majority of acting is poor, except for a few actors, but their dialogue is very cheesy. The story has been completely and utterly destroyed. Usually some of the story is simply left out of the movies. In this movie, the story has been changed to a completely different story. The special effects are very low budget. This film was so low budget in fact, that an entire race of people were changed so it could be done easier. The Urgals are a ram-like creature with horns and all that. In the movie they are just fat guys with tattoos. If you want to be simultaneously humored and disappointed, then watch this movie. I suggest staying away. Maybe one day someone will get their hands on the rights for this movie who will actually put some effort into it.
B005IDXIL2|5.0|Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 official<br /><br />I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with Galaxy Bowl Lite.  I've tried out several other bowling/skeeball games on Android, and they've all been lacking in on way or another.  Galaxy Bowl Lite on the other hand is an excellent pocket bowling game.  Visually, the 3D rendered graphics are exquisite.  Sound effects are dead on, and the physics appear to be as well.  A pair of spin control options are available, and you flicking speed determines the ball speed.<br /><br />This is the Lite version, which means it's free and has an ad bar on it.  The full version is (currently) priced at $3.  The three smackers gets you online score tracking via Open Feint, achievements, different balls, and a few other tricks.  Try the Lite version and then go for the full if you're still interested.
1416594795|5.0|This is a fascinating book with lots of terrific photos as well as illustrations. For those interested in the development of life on earth, this is a must read. Since it is now in paperback, it is also a great buy. Highly recommended!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Didn't go see this movie when our church youth group went to theater, but I just rented the movie and it is definitely a great movie for all to see.  I am sure after reading other comments that the movie did not do justice to showing the real pain/agony this young lady must have experienced, but none the less it was an awesome movie.  I can't believe that someone could say that Jesus had nothing to do with her healing, just the body's own power, hogwash.  Without hope in Jesus we of all mankind would be NOTHING!!!  Who do they think gave our body that great ability to heal, not to mention our wounded souls to once again overcome fear and grief.  I just think it shows what we can do through CHRIST who strengthens us and this lady is one AWESOME example of sheer strength, faith, courage and ability to overcome an obstacle.  I would highly recommend this to one and all.  If this story does not touch your heart and soul then I pray God's great mercy on you!!
B004EJUMT2|1.0|The premise of this album is quite pathetic, mix together pilfered Mercyful Fate themes (I.E. bombastic Satanism without the King's charm) with the musical apparitions of Blue &Ouml;yster Cult.  Sprinkle on top a bit of \\"kvlt\\" cred seasoning for all the kiddies to go nuts over.  Since the arrival of this massive abomination all I have heard from the metal community is how much this \\"sounds like Mercyful Fate\\".  In reality, Ghost is a frighteningly unoriginal rehash of the aforementioned Blue &Ouml;yster Cult, and a terribly bland one at that.  The target audience is clearly 13 year old boys, a subset of the population easily attracted to such drivel.  Ghost appeals to the same tendencies as something like Slipknot, it's all a show, and maybe even a good one at that (That is when you take into consideration how presentation is more important then the music for most youth).  The end result is a hollow shell devoid of any substance.  I can MAYBE see some older 70's metal fans (for just a minute before they grow tired and put in real 70's heavy metal) finding something to like here, after all it is paying homage to the real thing (much like how a candy cigarette will give never give you a nicotine buzz, Ghost is simply a flaccid organ).  Their shrouded in mystery identities is an ineffectual final grasp at giving themselves a bigger mystique.  In the end I can't help but wish there was a negative star rating, to reflect how much I hate Ghost, and their entire production.
0740748475|5.0|I'm trying to find the best collection of hyperboles to describe \\"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes\\" by Bill Watterson. There are none. It is all good. All funny. All playful. All witty.<br /><br />So there it is. Find a word that is positive, then put 'all' in front of it. I like it that much.<br /><br />What these three volumes represent for most of us looking for it is exactly as the title says, 'complete'. Every Calvin and Hobbes strip is here. The print quality is strong, and the paper is marvelous.<br /><br />For me, this is not an archival collection. These are books I look at frequently. I read them. I crack one open, and find myself chuckling for 30 minutes. I can't say I deeply analyze the strips, or ask exactly how real Hobbes is. Rather, I just soak it in, and smile a lot.<br /><br />I have read them all before, but they hold up well over the years.<br /><br />As I grow older, I understand some of them differently. Mr. Watterson transcendently addresses human nature and our timeless nature to create unnecessary troubles. He remembers the complexity of childhood romance, parent-to-child-to-parent relationship dynamics, and the struggle of being a less than attentive student. In all of this, he finds enormous amounts of gentle creativity.<br /><br />What is missing is a short line from Mr. Watterson himself. I looked for it. It isn't here. It is, in fact, the only thing lacking. There should be a line which says, \\"Thanks for reading, friends. I'm hard at work on relaunching new Calvin and Hobbes cartoons. Look for it soon in your local paper.\\" Mr. Watterson never wrote that because it isn't true. Instead, Mr. Watterson ended the strip on his own terms with possibly the best last strip ever. The only strip perhaps exceeding it is Charles Schulz' last Peanuts strip.<br /><br />I first heard of the strip from an old, good friend when I was in college. Soon after, he gave me a copy of the first collected strips in a now-worn paperback volume, inscribing, \\"Here's some light reading to help you through the rougher times.\\" Then, when he passed away this spring, he bequeathed one item to me, and that was this complete collection.

B000G75AE8|3.0|For those unfamiliar with the hype that came with this album at the time of it's release, they must first realize that it signified the return of the once departed Dave Lombardo.  The hype surrounding this release became insurmountable, there were pre-release cries that it was the best effort since 1990's Seasons In The Abyss, which no surprise was Lombardo's last album with the band. It became a popular (and crazy) notion to attribute the bands lack of good material on Paul Bostaph taking over for Lombardo in the years before his return.  Christ Illusion dispels that foolish proclamation.  In fact, as mediocre as this album is, there is a certain sense of cohesion between the guitars and drums, but technically speaking Lombardo isn't \\"better\\" then Bostaph was.  Moving on,  Lombardo and Kerry King feel comfortable playing this style of music with one another, since it is indeed Kerry King that writes just about everything in Slayer these days (The real reason the band hasn't been as good as they once were, Hanneman hasn't been as involved in writing songs in the last decade plus).  \\"Cult\\" is a marvel to behold, it takes the most obvious route lyrically, but somehow manages to be catchy and credible in it's assault.  \\"Supremist\\" is the most unexpected thing on here for me, not because it is different from what you would expect (this is a SLAYER record after all, you know mostly what is coming) but it surprises me because it is an amazing thrash song, one of their best since the aforementioned Seasons In The Abyss.  The Hanneman/Araya penned \\"Black Serenade\\" is a bit of a disappointment, because it has one of the best riffs on the album, and degenerates into a snooze-fest.  What remains is a plethora of tracks that would comfortably sit as B-Sides on superior Slayer albums.  In the end, Slayer has made a brand out of staying the same, and repeating themselves over and over, and this album does just that. (Even though Slayer tried to go nu-metal with Diabolus and GHUA, which this new generation of kids who is hell bent on rewriting the history of metal doesn't realize because they are off fighting invisible online battles against the new bad guy metalcore and deathcore, and nu-metal is a distant non-reality that they don't understand)  This album could very well serve as an appetizer to the bands 80's material for the uninitiated.which this new generation of kids who is hell bent on rewriting the history of metal doesn't realize because they are off fighting invisible online battles against the new bad guy metalcore and deathcore, and nu-metal is a distant non-reality that they don't understand)  This album could very well serve as an appetizer to the bands 80's material for the uninitiated.
1609611543|4.0|I obtained a copy of Wheat Belly, mainly because I have suffered from stomach problems for many years. I assumed for so long that I suffered from IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) but realised about a year or so ago that the problem was more to do with the things I was eating ie. lactose and gluten. The moment I stopped consuming things that contained gluten, I was amazed at how different I began to feel and how much flatter my stomach became.<br />When I spotted this book, I was intrigued to know more about this awful affliction (if that's the right word!) that affects so many of us.<br />I must say that I was shocked by what I read in Wheat Belly. It all made perfect sense to me, strengthening my belief that wheat isn't all it's cracked up to be (excuse the pun). I was so surprised to learn that cutting out products containing wheat can even help autistic children. I would recommend this book not just to those with problematic stomachs, but to everybody - full stop. Wheat Belly is an awesome read... sometimes a little excessive and a tad repetitive but excellent all the same.<br />I have completely changed my diet and feel so much better for it, and I can thank (in part) Dr William Davis for his sound advice about wheat and the many problems it can cause.
B00000FCBC|3.0|Take disc one and throw it in the garbage immediately.  It's not that some of the bands that they chose to cover aren't amazing (Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy), but there is something so so so horribly wrong about the sound and vibe of the first disc that it must be discarded like excrement.<br /><br />Disc two is where your money is at, the first 5 tracks take the well known Garage Days Re-Revisited EP and compile them with many other well known older covers such as the long time favorite \\"Am I Evil?\\".  Other notable inclusions such as \\"Breadfan\\" and \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" help make this worthy of buying, even if one disc is a mere coaster.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|I've been trying to find a more comfortable controller than the normal PS3 controller.  The small PS3 controllers seem small and painful to use over a long period of time and I can't grip them easily to get precise control.  I've always liked the xbox360 controller over the PS3 and hoped I could find one like it.    Well, I've come as close as I can so far.  This controller is more comfortable than the PS3, at least to me.  It is larger, easier to grip, the analog stick on the left is in the upper position (like a 360) and has more heft to it.  The grip has a textured surface which I like, but you if you like a smooth feel this may be a con for you.    The problem is the dead zones/sensitivity.  The triggers feel fine, comparable to the PS3 more than the xbox.  The problem is their sensitivity.  They aren't as linear proportional as the regular PS3.  I do like their feel, but would like a little more up turn on the bottom edge, to prevent finger slipping.      The other issue is the analog stick dead zones.  Like the trigger buttons they aren't linearly proportional.  Precise control, for me, is very difficult.  A little movement won't cause any movement on screen, as you move it further out it causes a sudden vast   movement (more exponential, than linear).    I'm not trying to say they are unusable, but it does make precise control for racing or first person shooters more difficult.    Battery life seems as good as the PS3 controller.  I wish it didn't need the USB dongle to work, but I can live with it.    Overall I really like the controller and will use it over the PS3.  I would recommend it for anyone that likes the xbox360 controller or feels the PS3 is small and hard to grip.
B000002ITM|2.0|I must lament that I initially planned on giving this a one, and it would in fact be deserving of such a score.  However, \\"Return To Serenity\\" has always been a favorite all time ballad, and thus I threw in an extra star to reflect my love for this track.  As everyone no doubt knows by now, The Ritual finds Testament peering through the looking glass at the success of Metallica and Megadeth and wishing to emulate their master's success.  As one of the first bands to sign to a major label Testament was the most likely to produce an album such as this, yet even they waited for Metallica's approval before they went such a route.  It is common for metal fans to diss the non-thrash output of their favorite thrash bands, but in the case of Testament, The Ritual is a bare skeleton of quality.  The once entertaining Alex Skolnick, who took some of the earlier average thrash albums and propelled them into above average status with his guitar adornments, fails to inspire in a setting which would seemingly make him the most comfortable.  The Ritual attempts to get as catchy as possible, and opens with \\"Electric Crown\\" a fan favorite, but in my estimation quite boring.  In fact, nearly every other song after it sounds like a rehash of it.  Their attempt to sound this way is more forced then any other band I have ever heard.  For as much hate as the Black Album gets, if you sit it next to this one it is a raging monster in comparison.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Fans really must boycott this release if they ever want to see the original theatrical release trilogy or at least the 1997 special editions on blu-ray.  If you go ahead and buy this anyway, thinking \\"oh well,\\" then this may be the only Star Wars blu-ray set you will get.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I absolutely loved this version of Jane Eyre! I do not think that a better Rochester could be played by anyone other than Michael Fassbender. He can convey so much with so few words. His emotions are in his eyes. It does skip over the harshness of lowood school a bit, but in just 2 hours, Carey F. did a wonderful job. This version focuses more on the gothic elements of the book which is a refreshing change of pace. I could watch Michael Fassbender in this movie everyday and never tire of it. He does that good of a job.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|well, if you dont like the 2004 remixed & remastered series then you should go for this one... the album is remastered but not remixed, so it still sounds like the original record... the second disc alone is worth the price, the KIMB-peace sells line up performing songs from those 2 records... cant go wrong with that!

Its set up like a work book that you can write and draw in. The best part about this book is it makes learning the guitar easy, by instructing you in a way that you will draw diagrams and say certain phrases out loud, you really remember what you are learning.

I guess i'm kind of a sheep because I thought, \\"if she's so popular, there must be something great about this\\" but really...no. the workout is hard, i'll give you that. my problem is that it doesn't give you enough of any one kind of workout to be really successful. it's not enough cardio that you can get away without doing anything else, and the same goes for strength training. also, jillian's approach to motivation is telling you to keep going even if it hurts, which is kind of idiotic. i'm not surprised there are so many complaints on here about knee problems, i had them myself!   although this is called, \\"30 day shred\\" i took 60 days to complete it (meaning i did each level 10 times taking off a day in between) but near the end i was so bored i would rather do anything else but this!   if you want a good strength workout invest in Pauline Nordin's \\"Butt Bible\\" She's pretty funny and gives you different workouts for upper and lower body so you can give your muscles time to rest!

Still, the lovely pastels and graceful shapes will NOT spare you from t all the shadow content that beautiful decks tend to neglect. It will emerge in the readings as it should be.  This became my favorite deck for all-type-of-public readings. Something about it allows meanings and connections to be easily made.  If one thing could be changed, I'd wish the cards to be plastic in order to be preserved for longer time.

1848566980|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1M4XMB2GSNRXG]]I managed to get this book from Amazon UK as it was released earlier there.<br /><br />This book is an amazing value for money. It's a rather large art book and it's filled with all these wonderful art from Chris Foss, mainly from the 70s and 80s. Each page typically has around 1 to 4 illustrations and there are a total of 240 pages. That's a lot of work!<br /><br />Chris Foss is an incredible sci-fi artist. There's a sense of realism that comes not just from how his works are painted, but also from the designs. For the ones that are printed full page, you can really check out the details that are put in. All are fully coloured and there are some line sketches as well.<br /><br />There are lots of variety of spacecrafts featured, space stations, alien landscapes and cities, a few robots, some ships and planes. Chris Foss certainly made space more colourful with his colourful spacecrafts. Many of these work have appeared on sci-fi novels, and have also inspired sci-fi film designs.<br /><br />It will take a while to go through this wonderful collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're into sci-fi art.<br /><br />You can also check out more work at Chris Foss' website.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
0756405890|5.0|I stumbled on this book while browsing at the library and it was longer than the books I'd been reading lately but I picked it up to give it a try, so I got it on a whim, and immediately got completely engrossed in the story. The character and plot development is so detailed that it completely engages you; I found it really hard to put down. I love George RR Martin's work and this captivated me even more.  Liked it so much that I bought a copy to re-read and to loan to friends; I've shared with a couple so far and both have found it as fascinating as I did. The sequel is also fantastic and I can't wait for the concluding book of the trilogy, will probably read the first two books again soon.

0553801473|2.0|Six years is a long time to wait for the second half of \\"A Feast for Crows\\", because that is what this book is. Martin's previous book became so huge that he literally cut out half the chapters, covering half the characters and pushed them into this book. Thus this story covers the same timeline as the previous, more or less, just from another viewpoint. More on that in half a hand of minutes, but first the reason I am still reading this series.<br /><br />George Martin does imagine a intricate and sometimes quite delicious set of intrigues. A cast of characters that seems to put Tolstoy to shame and a sweeping political situation mixed with injustices and wrongdoing that make the reader long to see favourite characters avenged. Martin does know how to weave a remarkable story, and that is surely the secret of his considerable success.<br /><br />Neverthless should we think for half a minute, there are certain things that really let this book down. There were times reading this book that I simply sighed and put it down, and each time my inclination to pick up the book was reduced.<br /><br />Stylistically, certain phrases are so over-used in this book that they have reached the point of immense distraction. I am tempted to find the e-text of the book and count how many times \\"half a...\\" is used. Certainly it was not unusual to find the phrase twice in a single paragraph. Do the people of Westeros not have the word \\"fifty\\", and thus need to say \\"half a hundred instead\\"? Other phrases like \\"words are wind\\" were put in entirely too many mouths, and just reminded me that it was just one author writing all these dialogues.<br /><br />Assuming that annoyance is just me, there are other problems. The most important is this story has become incredibly slow. This book and the last are filled with so much clever dialogue, character development, internal monologue and other page filling material that there was precious little space left for action.<br /><br />This is not helped by the multiple point of views used. Each chapter is told from a different character's point of view and the timeline goes back and forth as each character is given page upon page of development. All in all, this is a text book example of a story that is totally over-written.<br /><br />Then there is the world the story is set in: Westeros is just another faux medieval land with swords, sorcery (not much of that mind), dragons and knights and really nothing to distinguish it from the great raft of Tolkienesque literature, except the lack of elves and the number of pages.<br /><br />What really did it for me though was the incessant crudity and vulgarity. Some people will like that in this book I suppose. They will say this is a more earthy tale than Tolkien's. For me though,this book contains probably my most disliked passage I have ever read. I presume the author's intent was to make the character involved seem seedy and base, and to his credit, he succeeded in spades. I am no prude when it comes to books, but I don't want to read this, and this will be my last Martin book. I presume it will be another 6 years before the next in the series (if we all live that long), but when it comes I do not intend to buy it.<br /><br />This is not a series I can recommend anymore. The author has lost his way, and the early promise is coming to nothing. I wonder if I have correctly predicted the end - but I find I no longer really care.<br /><br />Two stars because despite my dropping this series, I do think the author has produced some good story here. If you can be bothered to wade through all the over-written stuff, you may find half a hundred reasons to enjoy it.<br /><br />Finally a note on the audio version of the book. This is extremely hard on the ear beause the narrator has a tendency to. Punctuate mid sentence.<br /><br />Every single sentences seems. To contain punctuation to interrupt the thought.<br /><br />I do admire the narrator's ability with accents, but his femal voices all just sound daft.

0061474355|5.0|Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, brought up in a world much like our own except for its proximity to the \\"Old Kingdom\\" which is a very different world indeed - where the dead walk, and magic works and technology does not. When her father goes missing - and is likely dead - Sabriel crosses into the Old Kingdom to search for him and learns that she is now Abhorsen, charged with controlling the walking dead, and keeping the people of both kingdoms safe.<br /><br />This is a first rate novel from a first rate author, and really should become a classic. The characterisations are rich, the world is beautifully drawn, and there seems to be plenty to set the reader thinking.<br /><br />The concepts in this novel are intriguingly different from the standard fantasy fayre. The idea of an old Kingdom with a crossing point into something we would recognise as the real world reminded me of Erik L'Homme's Quadehar books. There are perhaps other similarities in the magical concepts used, and in the office of a sorceror and the apprentice - but it is not at all clear that one book was written with any awareness of the other (both had UK publication dates in about 2002/2003 - but Quadehar was originally published in French).<br /><br />But other than similarities with Quadehar the Sorceror, this book is really very fresh and written in a style not entirely like other works in the genre.<br /><br />The book is, in my opinion, at least a teen read. That is partly down to the style, and partly down to the content. It is, however, a very worthwhile read.

B004P1JEXE|2.0|George Martin must have some exceptional gifts to induce readers to stick with this story through 4 books. He writes well. Indeed, his descriptions of battles are frequently gripping, and he imagines beautiful intrigues with complex characters who frequently surprise you.     But this book is simply not a very good story. The whole series is heavily overwritten, and it seems that this caused a problem for the author in writing this book - such that he then simply jettisoned the points of view of half the characters. Unfortunately it was largely the most interesting storylines that were jettisoned, and we were thus treated with hundred upon hundreds of pages of ... nothing very much. At the end of this book I cannot think what intrigue has really been advanced, nor what stories have been concluded. It feels like one of those American TV shows that spans 10 series and here is series 7 which does nothing but sow confusion and fill air time.     The faults of this series remain. It is set in a faux medieval world with all the derivative elements such as knights and jousts and carousing and such like. Terms like \\"Ser\\" instead of \\"sir\\" and \\"your grace\\" instead of \\"your majesty\\" don't create a sense of difference as they are so close to the classical terms. The one innovation - the seasons that span many years - is entirely irrelevent in this book, and having read this deep into the series, there really is nothing particularly magical about the land. What is more, the characters all seem to speak with the same voice - and I am peculiarly fed up with \\"half a hundred\\" and all the other \\"half a ...\\" that are charactersitic of the author's idiolect. Don't the people of Westeros have a word for \\"fifty\\" (although that admittedly would require just one word rather than three)?     This is the weakest book of the series thus far, and the most heavily overwritten. It is not entirely without merit (see my opening paragraph), but it is becoming increasingly difficult to recommend this series.

B0035WRY7C|5.0|This is the first of the Alex Rider series. Its typical Anthony Horowitz. The kind of adventure story boys from about 11+ will love. Nothing deep - just a good action adventure.     Alex Rider is 14 years old but when his Uncle is mysteriously killed in an alleged road accident, he gets swept into the secret world of MI6, where he is enlisted as a spy and sent to investigate the same case his uncle was working on.     What pre-teen or teenage boy has not dreamed of being Alex Rider? 14 year old spy sent to save his country from evil. As such this is a concept that will work. Not the kind of book you would recommend to adults who do not enjoy children's fiction though.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|I love Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film, AM&Eacute;LIE. I already owned the [[ASIN:B000068QKT Am&eacute;lie]] 2-DVD set and have been in love with the movie since my friends took me to see it at a French movie theater back in the early part of 2002 (BTW it is in French with English or Spanish subtitles).<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, AM&Eacute;LIE is a wonderful story about two lonely people who've been dreaming about one another since they were children. Both Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) and Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) wished they had another person in their life, being such lonely children, and one day as adults, their paths cross. In the meantime, both acquire quirks and Am&eacute;lie, after finding a tin box filled with a boy's childhood treasures, decides that she's going to reunite the owner (now a 40+ man) with the lost keepsake. After proving a successful and joyous reunion, she vows to become a crusader for good helping all the other lonely people around her.<br /><br />However, no matter how many good deeds she accomplishes, Am&eacute;lie cannot escape the cold loneliness that she feels inside and around her, until she's finally forced to help herself and take that flying leap of faith and letting someone else in.<br /><br />Perhaps that's why I enjoy this movie so much. It isn't just a boy-meets-girl type of film; it explores the angst that comes along with meeting someone that you feel a connection with and that period in-between, especially if you've been alone for a long time, and you just don't know how to take the next step.<br /><br />Another great thing about this film is the use of special effects. This has to be the first movie that I've seen that uses special effects and it isn't in the science fiction/fantasy genre. The use of the effects really punctuate the story and gives it a whimsical feel. Although it does paint a romanticized view of life and of Paris, it's used to great effect throughout and I love the visual style of it.<br /><br />The BLU-RAY edition of AM&Eacute;LIE is gorgeous! The saturated colors really pop and the clarity makes the movie a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />I am however a little disappointed that there wasn't any new special features added to this BLU-RAY edition.<br /><br />In fact, several extras on the DVD are gone from here: the TV Spots, the French language trailer, and the cast and crew filmography.

It is slightly out dated in terms of some of the techniques and equipment that is available today but it doesn't detract from what Charlie is trying to instill in your mind, which is to Relax, Don't Worry, Have a homebrew.  Now you if you have never brewed before you may be saying to yourself how can I have a homebrew if I don't have any??! But even after 10-12 batches of beer I still learned a thing or two from Charlie as well as to not worry and it has improved my brewing experience.  I will say that that while this book has a ton of great info I am glad I read Learning How to Brew by John Palmer first.  These are two different approaches to teaching your how to homebrew and John goes more in depth into technique, equipment and the WHY & HOW of what is going on in your brewing and fermentation that this book does not delve too deep in.<br /><br />This book was a pleasure to read,  easy and fun.  This book is a must read for anyone thinking about getting into the hobby, John Palmer's would be right next to that.
034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a truly unique tale in which the author, Vanessa Diffenbaugh, tells a back story in alternating chapters within the context of her current plot.  It is a literary device that works as we see Victoria's life at 10 in a wonderful pre-adopt home with a single woman named Elizabeth and alternately at age 18 being emancipated from a terrible group home.  Why didn't Elizabeth adopt Victoria?  How did she wind up back in the system?  And what is the language of flowers?<br /><br />The need to answer the first two questions and interest in the language of flowers itself, drove me straight into the plot of this book.  Everything about Victoria's personality and demeanor is \\"hard\\"-she is quiet, full of anger, full of contempt for the world.  Yet she tenderly cares for flowers-their names, their \\"definitions\\" (apparently yellow roses don't mean \\"friendship\\"), and helping people with their own issues by making meaningful bouquets when she manages to snag a job at a flower shop. Her social awkwardness is excused by her innate ability to match flowers to people's needs.<br /><br />Despite her love for flowers and plants, Victoria isn't \\"girly\\" and I adore that about her.  She doesn't care how she dresses, if she smells, or how much she eats-even in front of guys!  She is a refreshing protagonist, who at times, isn't even likable.  But as the reader comes to know Victoria and as Victoria comes to know herself, there is an increasing awareness of the depth and softness of her character.  Though there is a romance in Victoria's life, this book is far from romantic. Even though the world \\"flower\\" is in the title, this book isn't flowery.<br /><br />It wasn't until I stayed up way past midnight finishing The Language of Flowers that I discovered \\"Victoria's Dictionary of Flowers\\" in the back of the book.  Apparently, Diffenbaugh spent hours pouring over various conflicting Victorian definitions of flowers to compose this dictionary, even consulting with botanists.  It would seem as if the author herself puts the same detail into her work as her characters put into the tedious task of growing flowers. The Language of Flowers is an excellent book, full of emotion, characters that have dimension, and a fresh premise in a world of tired story lines.<br /><br />*I received a review copy from Ballantine in exchange for a fair review.*s if the author herself puts the same detail into her work as her characters put into the tedious task of growing flowers.

B0052U59F4|4.0|First let me warn you that Fifty Shades of Grey is a BDSM novel.  I was unaware of this when I purchased the novel and got quite the surprise of my life.  BDSM is not usually my thing. In fact, I usually steer clear of such literary content.   That being said I am glad that I was recommended this book.    I started reading at 9:00 pm and could not put it down until I was finished at 1:45 this morning.  I am still thinking about it now.  There are no hearts and flowers in this book.  It is dark dark dark.  The H, Christian Grey, is such a tortured soul that your heart aches for him while at the same time you want to run screaming in terror from his \\"Red Room of Pain\\".  The h, Anastasia, is the light to his dark.  Young and innocent, you're not quite sure whether to tell her to run for her life because you can see Christian dragging her down into the darkness with him or pleading with her to stay and try and save his soul.    I'll admit I was way out of my element reading this book.  It overwhelmed and confounded me. I felt just as confused by Christian as Anastasia trying to understand his dark needs.  Even though I'm still not quite comfortable with the BDSM I can't wait for the next book, Fifty Shades Darker, to come out.
1451629184|5.0|Wow!  This is an amazing book by an amazing woman.  Jaycee Dugard endured monstrous abuse at the hands of her kidnappers and lived to inspired all!  This is a very ADULT book and the abuse is detailed to a great degree.  I appreciate that she tells the story without dwelling on the awfulness  of the situation. She tells it like it was and then moves on to the solutions and how she dealt with something I can only describe as a modern day prison camp with two jailers and NO holds barred. I love that so many stood by her after her rescue and wish her the very best of everything for all her future years.
0545259088|4.0|i didnt care for the way this book ended. after reading three books and investing days reading the entire series, i was disappointed. the book itself though is pretty good. i loved cole in this one and thought he really made the book. sam was his usual self. quiet and kinda mopey. a little to much in my opinion. cole on the other hand was funny, sarcastic and downright charming.and by halfway through the book i was more interested in his and isabel's relationship than sam and grace's. as everyone else has said, the writing of maggie is great and continued to be great and intriguing throughout. the most interesting part was cole's littel experiment's and him trying to find a cure. but because of the ending i had to give it only 4 stars.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I purchased this to take with me on my upcoming deployment. If I get any down time I would love to have some gaming time. I have waited until the very last minute, and got it only 3 weeks before I leave. As soon as I got it, I checked out the manual to see if  there was anything I might need to know. Well the manual didn't give me any thing I didn't know but it was very entertaining (KANGAROOS!!). So I strapped hooked everything up and had an issue with my first unit that wasn't up to the standards. After a very short and friendly process with representatives from GAEMS, I had a new unit within 24 hours and now I must stay this is amazing! At first I felt the lid might snap off but unless your having a small child playing this unit shouldn't move a whole lot once you find a place to get some gaming going. Everything fits in quick, easy and perfectly. There is plenty of room for everything. The hdmi cable is short but not so short your worried about stretching it. The display is bright clear and sharp. I find it a tad bit to sharp, but after playing for a few hours I no longer noticed it. The sound gets as loud as you need it, and has 2 headphone out puts if you don't want to use the speakers. After several hours of using this in my house to get a feel for it, I found this to be a great unit. It light enough that no gamer is going to complain about carrying this around an airport for the ability to have gaming on the go. The 15 inch display sounds small at first but once you get set up and start playing your find the screen to be very well sized. Any bigger of a screen would mean a bigger case, and from there you lose alot of the ease of taking it through airports and on trips. 300 bucks is a lot, but if you are someone who wants the ability to game anywhere then this is the perfect unit. Find a place, open the case and plug in and play. For parents, this is the perfect thing to get for long road trips and hotel stays. For gamers, this is the all essential unit for the ability to game any where.     Pros:   Gaming on the go in one convenient package  Room for additional accessories (power cables and controllers)  Easy setup  Great display   Speakers and headphone jacks give you multiple options.    Cons:  The need for an outlet with 2 open plugs or having an extension cord available.

0316044695|4.0|I think this is a fascinating story and my heart goes out to the guys that didn't make it, and their families. Brave, brave men. However, I wish he hadn't gone into slamming liberals throughout the book so much. I'm politically somewhere in the middle and I would feel the same if it were coming from the left. I guess the trauma of losing your friends like that and being the only one to make it would make you point in a lot of directions so I don't really blame him.<br />What I really don't get is this.... tying the goat herders up was a kind of after-thought with the conclusion that they didn't have any rope to do so anyway?? I don't get this. For a start, aren't turbans made of a long strand of cloth just wrapped around and around? Weren't the shepherds wearing clothes that could have been fashioned into some kind of bind? You know what I am saying? I don't understand how the only options where to execute or release. Anyway, great book and I'm looking for more recommendations on other such books

0553577123|3.0|Once I had set my mind to actually reading this famous book, I went to the library two weeks ago to see what they had. I narrowed the choice down to a hardcover book that was  translated by B.M. Mooyaart, which has an introduction by Eleanor Roosevelt and published by Bantam in 1993 but also has a copyright date of 1996; The other choice was this paperback book titled The Definitive Edition, which is translated by Susan Massotty and published in 1997. At first I compared the first paragraph of each book to see if I could determine which one had the better translation. I figured I would go with the paperback copy which said The Definitive Edition. I finished reading the book the other day and now here is what I have to say.<br /><br />The book/story is ok but I don't think it is so good that I would want to read it a second time. On page 17, where Anne talks about her friend Lies and then mentions the word \\"mayhem\\"--which I thought was the wrong word to use in that paragraph--I wasn't sure whether it was the translator's fault or the writer Anne's fault. Anyways, regardless of the translation quality, hopefully the story is pretty much the same. There were some parts that I thought were very well written but again I don't know if the translator gets the credit or Anne herself.<br /><br />Having edited my own self-published (or shall I say vanity printing) book which my mom translated from Dutch to English, I'm somewhat familiar with what is required in the translation process. [By the way, my book is titled: \\"The Life Story of Hubert Dielen, 1855-1926, an autobiography.\\"] I know that translation is an art which involves idioms, context, dialect words, etc. I also know that there is a general or \\"dynamic equivalence\\" type of translation and there is also a literal or \\"exact\\" translation. From what I could tell of the two Anne Frank editions mentioned above, I believe the Susan Massotty translation to be a \\"general\\" translation of Anne's diary. Which was fine with me, since it was easy enough to read and hopefully the story is the same. But I noticed that of the two editions, one edition has around thirty more pages. Does that mean there was more elaboration put in the translation or shall I say \\"translation liberty\\"? How far astray does it go from what Anne really wrote? Today I relooked at the B.M. Mooyaart translation and after noticing the stilted English in many parts, I chafed at the thought of rereading the Diary again but this time with Mooyaart's translation. I am not that enamored with the story to be motivated to do such a thing.<br /><br />My mom, who is Dutch, told me that she saw the Anne Frank movie decades ago but I recommended to her that in the event she decides to \\"read\\" the Anne Frank story, she read it in the original Dutch language since I am aware of the common saying \\"All translated works are mere shadows of the original.\\" As for me, I don't speak Dutch, so I don't have that luxurious option. I also know that the key to translation is not knowing the language you are translating from so much as knowing the language you are translation to. Hence, the Anne Frank editor Mirjam Pressler had a critical job provided that English is her primary language. Otherwise, that's where the Anne Frank diary is lacking and can be improved upon yet.<br /><br />What a pity that Anne Frank didn't survive WWII to edit her own work. She was such a talented girl.since it was easy enough to read and hopefully the story is the same. But I noticed that of the two editions, one edition has around thirty more pages.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Lucas Davenport is a great character! I just started reading this series a few months ago, but am quickly working my way through all the books.

B003UESJFQ|5.0|If you've seen `Norma Rae' then you've seen `Made in Dagenham'.  Sure, the stories are different to an extent, and `Made in Dagenham' contains a certain level of spunk that `Norma Rae' didn't (the former being a more dramatically laced film) but the overall conceptual nature of this film mirrors its predecessor.<br /><br />That isn't to say that you shouldn't see this film, because it certainly deserves to be seen, but you may feel as though you've seen it before.<br /><br />`Made in Dagenham' takes place in the 60's, during the Dagenham strike in England when female workers at the Ford plant become enraged over unfair treatment.  The unlikely hero, or should I say heroine, or our story is Rita.  Rita is a mother, a wife and a friend, but most of all she is a levelheaded woman who just wants to be valued for her work, not degraded because of her sex.  So, after months of being strung along by the Ford company, Rita and her co-workers rise up and fight back by putting an immediate stop on their work and campaigning for equal pay.  This, of course, puts a strain on relationships, including that of Rita and her supportive husband Eddie.<br /><br />But it's all for the greater good.<br /><br />Now, while I initially began this review by calling out the film for basically being a remake of `Norma Jean', I also said that this film contained spunk, and that spunk goes a long way to making this film stand alone.  The cheeky nature of the time and place (1960's England) coupled with the vivacious personalities cloaked in gorgeous attire with glossy lips and perfectly sculpted hair, not to mention the authenticated set pieces really help `send you there'.  The script is familiar yet it also contains the right amount of wit within the dialog to keep the audience enthused.  And then you have the cast; equal part veterans and rising stars.  Bob Hoskins and Miranda Richardson develop nice supporting players who are refreshing and memorable; Richardson taking off heads and letting them roll while Hoskins downplays his usual demeanor for a more paternal and genuine performance.  Then you have Andrea Riseborough and Jamie Winstone (daughter to sexy beast Ray Winstone) slinky their sexiness across the screen.  But the film really rests on the shoulders of two very capable women.  Rosamund Pike has just a handful of scenes, but she captures the attention of the audience and remains the most memorable part of the film.  Sally Hawkins has been on the tips of everyone's tongues after her brazen performance in 08's `Happy-Go-Lucky', and she matches her initial promise with another powerful yet drastically different performance.  She beautifully layers this woman and underlines her convictions as well as her insecurities.<br /><br />Bravo!<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this film.

B001OGWY1W|5.0|Everyone can't be Christopher Nolan! The fact that he's chosen the perfect script, screenplay, cast, locations, gadgets what not...he pulled the right cord each time. Everyone perceives and imagines things differently. If 50 people were given a comic to read and make a movie out of it...very very few can turn out to be Christopher Nolan. His idea, concept and vision of Batman and Gotham is outstanding - the way he projected the Gotham city and its dark knight. The Batman Begins is more of developing the Batman and sketching the Gotham. In the Dark Knight Nolan really dived deep and explored the dark side.     The visuals of the film are breath taking. The panoramic views of the city, the shot where batman and his catch fly along with the plane, the whole movie from the point the police officer confesses himself as the Batman to the scene the Joker escapes from the jail, the hell of a ride on the batpod and many more.    What can we say about the Joker -- so cruel, insane, sadistic yet funny. We missed Joker in the Batman Begins and will miss him in The Dark Knight Rises. Waiting eagerly for the concluding part of the Trilogy and can't wait more..

I play the dvd every Christmas watching the videos and I really enjoy this album as well. I even play it when it isn't even Christmas time cause it puts me at ease. I enjoy her voice on every song especially Christmas time is in the air and the first noel, charlie brown Christmas and auid lang syne. and of course oh Santa. I bought mine from Hsn with the dvd which is really nice to watch. I can't get enough of this album. Mariah will always be the Christmas Queen.
0060555661|3.0|This book should have received 5 stars from me, but I'm holding two stars back for these terrible comments which are all over the book.<br /><br />I have also read Graham his other work Security Analysis, which is more complex and dry than this book. This one is easier to read and to understand. This book certainly is not outdated, the fundamental approach Graham you can still apply on today's stocks.<br /><br />Certainly advised to Buffett fans like me. It's simple, logic, straightforward and easy to apply. I should have read this book two or 3 years earlier in my trading career.<br /><br />One major disadvantage are these annoying comments. The are everywhere (behind each chapter the author added a chapter of his own comments, below each page you'll find several comments from him and at the end of the book you'll be reading them). If you possibly have the opportunity to buy The Intelligent Investor without these comments from Zweig, make sure you do. Even if it's more expensive, you'll be happy to read this book without those comments.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I understand why people liked this book and others did not. Although Collins conveyed the characters emotions and journey perfectly, there were moments in the story where I find myself feeling frustrated. This story is about war and sacrifice is a necessary aspect of it so I was not surprised or mad about some of our beloved characters perish. What bothered me was that their death felt meaningless due to the way the rebels seized the Capitol. What was the point for Katniss's team to die if at the end it was Coin's attack that ended the games? I know, I know in reality death during a war is something you can't control but us readers invested in 3 book and many hours, you think as a favor the author can make their death worthwhile.     The story flowed well for the most part except at the end. I agree with other reviewers that it seemed a little rushed. I was deeply unsatisfied when Collins hinted that Coin can be Snow 2.0 and did not expand on it. I felt like the author was like \\"Oh look there's another twist! Shoot I don't have a lot of pages left to elaborate! Oh well let's just keep it hanging by adding another plot twist!\\" I also did not like how she settled the love triangle. Although I think Katniss made the right choice, there was absolutely no defining moment where she was like \\"He is the one\\". The decision happened so quietly I had to re read the paragraph (yes it was decided within a single paragraph). After all the ups and downs our three love birds went through you think there will be more of a aha! moment but sadly there were none. However, the reason Katniss gave to her choice was sweet and true.    Overall I enjoyed reading this story. It was definitely a page turner and I did find myself making comments like \\"oh no she didn't\\" and \\"I can't believe this is happening!\\" Collins did pull me into a world so unbelievable, so heartbreaking and so breathtaking that I'm proud to say I don't regret investing in The Hunger Games at all.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|I absolutely love this blu ray, got it a few years back and love to listen to it from time to time. It looks great, and the sound is amazing. It's a must have for any fan of Queen,very cool extras and commentary by Roger and Dr. Brian plus more.
B000SNUMFC|5.0|For those of you interested in the music of Magnus Lindberg, you will want to pickup this recording at some point as it contains the premiere, and only, recording of his \\"Violin Concerto.\\" Lindberg's mature style has been criticized for abandoning the high-intensity of his earlier, more avant-garde work in favor of something softer, more accessible. For me, I think the current phase of his development as a composer has produced some of his greatest music. I do like some of his earlier works like \\"Kraft,\\" which was influenced by music he heard while he was in Berlin. His current phase has something truly happening inside of it: it has tonal undercurrents. Also, the harmonies and textures aren't as dense as they were. I'm simply onboard with what he's doing currently and if you aren't then I seriously suggest you to stay away from the \\"Violin Concerto.\\"<br /><br />This concerto, written in 2006, was scored for a small, chamber-like orchestra: around six or seven winds and small string section. One of the most remarkable things about this work is how he gets such a full sound out such a small group of instruments. This aspect of the work alone is remarkable. The music is very hard for me to describe because I don't think Lindberg's music lends itself to words. His music is simply something you have to hear for yourself. The concerto was premiered by the violinist on this recording Lisa Batiashvili under Louis Langree with members of the Mozart Festival Orchestra.<br /><br />The accompaniment from Sakari Oramo, himself a devoted champion on Lindberg's music, and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra is excellent. The violin playing from Batiashvili is all one could ask for: incredible intonation, technique, and tone. She feels this music and with a work such as this it's important that a musical narrative is established, and, again, you couldn't ask for a more committed performance. The Sibelius performance on this recording is decent but nothing to write home about. Many great violinists have already walked this road. My benchmark performance for the Sibelius is still Mullova/Ozawa/BSO on Philips.<br /><br />If you're new to Lindberg's music, I think this is as good as a place as any to start with. The music is accessible, but Modern, so don't think Lindberg has completely shed his thorns, because they're still there, but he makes the music easier to follow. Highly recommended.ts have already walked this road. My benchmark performance for the Sibelius is still Mullova/Ozawa/BSO on Philips.

I would like to request that you fine gentlemen (and/or ladies) give an option to disable that button for certain alarms, thus preventing my extended slumber, such as today. And yesterday. And the day before.    Aside from the cursed mute button, I love this app! Much more effective than a standard alarm clock, very well built, and very well styled!

0393327345|5.0|The only complaint I have about this book, aside from the fact that I'm finished reading it, is that it caused me to absolutely hate the Fight Club movie. I'm not much of a reader, not yet anyway, but this book was difficult to put down. No matter how long I had been reading it felt like I had just started. Every line was captivating. To avoid rambling, I'll just say this, it's a book you'll want to re-read, and loan to your friends so that they can see how awful the movie was.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|Many years ago when I was in the 6th Grade, I ordered a book about the Lincoln Assassination at school. Although the book was supposed to be intended for young readers, I vividly remembered the graphic picture of four hooded conspirators--3 men and 1 woman--hanging from the gallows. Thus began my fascination with the Lincoln Assassination and the conspiracy that changed history.  Most Americans know that John Wilkes Booth fatally shot Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theater. Few know his assassination was part of a much grander scheme to totally cripple the US Government with the assassination of the three top US government officials - the President, The Vice-President and the Secretary of State. The ensuing chaos could have brought down the Union government and forever changed the history of the United States.    Robert Redford has done a remarkable job in trying to tell a part of the story in a historically accurate manner as possible. THE CONSPIRATOR is a brilliantly staged depiction of a turning point in American history. The movie basically deals with the story of Mary Surrat, a 42-year-old widow who runs a modest boarding house in Washington, D.C.,. Nothing out of the ordinary at first until we learn she is the mother of one of the conspirators and that John Wilkes Booth and other conspirators were frequent visitors to her boarding house. Mary Surrat becomes one of the accused and she and the surviving conspirators are charged in a military court NOT a civil court. Most of their civil rights are suspended in a trial where a guilty verdict is a certainty.    THE CONSPIRATOR draws in actual historical documents to tell its tragic story. Was Mary Surrat innocent and her only crime was running the boarding house where the conspirators met and schemed? Of did she play a more active role? Could she have warned the authorities of the impending plan to assassinate the President and two others. Through the years, history has taken a kinder look at Surrat but that vision haschanged in recent years and THE CONSPIRATOR does a great job in presenting the facts and bringing a feel for the day as people worried that even a grander conspiracy was in the works.    Mary Surrat's innocence or degree of guilt will never be known for sure but her story is an amazing tale of injustice. There never was a chance for a fair trial. The verdicts were known before the trial began. THE CONSPIRATOR is more a story of the trial than of the actual events of that April night. The movie can get dry and ineffectual as we watch the courtroom proceedings. The action scenes are kept to a minimum as we see President Lincoln shot and Secretary of State Seward--recovering from a near fatal carriage accident--brutally stabbed to within an inch of his life. Vice President Andrew Johnson is spared as one of the conspirators is unable to do his chosen deed.    There is so much to tell in the Lincoln Assassination..so many side stories and different angles that are breezed over in THE CONSPIRATOR. Of course, there just is too much to tell in one movie. There is Booth's escape and the manhunt, the amazing journey of John Surrat to the Vatican and so much more. Here we have basically one aspect of the whole story and that is the trial of Mary Surrat.    Anyone who is a history buff and wants to learn more should get the two disco version of this film. The bonus features include a 67 minute documentary and various featurettes about the making of the movie and about the conspirators. Photography was just coming into its own during the Civil War so there are a lot of pictures of Abraham Lincoln, the locations involved and of the conspirators. It is an amazing story.    Here is a movie that will excite anyone interested in history but might not catch the attention of someone looking for a typical movie with romance and action. This is a hardcore and sometimes dry historical film..one that is totally amazin.
B005HNMPBM|4.0|Not bad.  The cast did a good job portraying the younger characters.
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|Most reviews here have thoroughly described the real life story and plot of FAIR GAME. But what brings the story to life are actors Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, Sonya Davison, Vanessa Chong, and Tiwari, director Doug Liman, and script by the main subjects Joseph Wilson and Valerie Plame, and writers Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth. This combination of Hollywood's top actors and director telling the hair raising story of heroic American Joe Wilson blowing the whistle on the war mongering lies of George H.W. Bush's imperial presidency led by his henchman Dick Cheney is a very scary movie!     FAIR GAME rivals the NEW documentary film \\"Chasing Madoff (2011).\\" Directed by Jeff Prosserman, and \\"starring\\" lead whistle blower Harry Markopolos and his three Wall Street fraud expert collaborators. Naturally, Madoff had been one of G.H.W. Bush's ardent supporters. Both Wilson and Markopolos lived under constant fear for carrying out their civic duties, fears of deadly reprisals by powerful people from the president on down in the Washington and Wall Street \\"food chain\\".      For experiencing two good scary movies, you must see FAIR GAME and CHASING MADOFF.
0142405809|5.0|This is one of our all time favorites! The rhyming is great, the story is great, and the delightful illustrations lend themselves to additional discussion about what is transpiring on each page.<br /><br />When my son was 2-1/2 a friend lent us the UK version of this book, and it was an instant hit. It was the longest book he had ever sat through at the time, and his was completely captivated from the very first word to the last. At my son's insistent request I read this book 12 times the first day we had it (and would have sat through it more times if there were someone else to read it to him), and 4-12 times a day for the next six weeks. Six months later it is still in regular rotation. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />FYI, there are a few changes in the US addition, which we purchased, and my son corrects me if I don't use the UK language as that is what he initially memorized. Most of the changes are insignificant, but the one he doesn't like is on the second page.<br /><br />In the UK version it reads:<br /><br />The tiny sea snail sighed and sniffed,<br />Then cried \\"I've got it! I'll hitch a lift!\\"<br />This is the trail<br />Of the tiny snail,<br />A silvery trail that looped and curled<br />And said, \\"Lift Wanted Around the World.\\"<br /><br />In the US version it reads:<br /><br />The tiny sea snail sniffed and sighed,<br />Then cried \\"I've got it!

1466208686|5.0|As I watch my paycheck coming every month I cannot help but think that my professional skills remain my only lifeline and only investment that still looks viable. Stocks go up and down, companies go boom and bust, but if I have the skills in demand, the society will have to reward me.  A good interview book is therefore a great investment: it raises your \\"market value\\" and pays off down the road. A good interview book that costs like a lunch or two is plain bargain.  This one is good. It is so good that I am writing my first (ever) Amazon review (what a waste of time, lol), having no financial obligations or incentives to promote it.  It has more variety and depth in covering the classics (lists, trees, strings, bits, recursion, ...) than \\"Programming Interviews Exposed\\" (very shallow and unremarkable book in my opinion), but it also avoids the academic complexity of Cormen's \\"Introduction to Algorithms\\", striking the right balance between the two. The style is very condensed, pragmatic, always to the point. The book is entirely focused on its sole mission to help you land the best job offer you possibly deserve. If you escape from reality with this book for a week, study it honestly, crack a number of test problems (provided by the book and/or taken from careercup.com) with a pen and paper, you are guaranteed to come back sharp (if you can code at all, of course).  I like the author's attempt to deal with the dreaded/hated interview unpredictability by suggesting some approaches that should work in the majority of cases. During the actual interview you will probably not be able to recall or follow the method precisely, but somewhere deep in your brain there will be a \\"roadmap\\" to guide you and bail you out.  I love the fact that each chapter challenges you with some relevant test problems allowing you to gauge your readiness. The set of problems always feels minimal yet sufficient - the problems are quite diverse and there is little to no redundancy. The answers are also there, so you can learn a couple of useful tricks and get in the ideal shape to write those recursive gems (you know, that kind of brilliant code few hires actually bother to produce at work :).  The book has worked well for me. I got a few job offers in the past thanks to the 4th edition, and this 5th one helped refresh my interview skills to prepare for an intra-company transfer at Microsoft.  UPD: forgot to give it 5 stars.
1848566980|5.0|If you're a Chris Foss fan, don't hesitate to get this book. It's very comprehensive, and many pages show off the artwork with full-spread images. I've collected a few Foss books over the years, and there's obviously quite a bit of repetition of that material in this volume, but the quality of the prints are fantastic, and all the information I could ever want is here. This book is an excellent value, and I'm incredibly satisfied with the work that went into this.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I have been dying to read this book, but I purposefully kept putting it off because the sequel doesn't come out until September 15th, 2011. I had heard that this book left off on a cliffhanger, and I didn't think I could stand the agony of waiting for two whole months. Originally, I wanted to read Fifty Shades of Grey two days before the sequel released. I had a game plan and everything, but last night I cracked. I just couldn't wait any longer. Now, I have 8 more extremely long days to go until the sequel comes out. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. I NEED MORE CHRISTIAN AND ANA. (Yes, I am using shouty capitals. I can't help it!) Obviously, I have some issues with patience. I may need an appointment with Dr. Flynn J(Read the book, you'll get it!)     Since I can't read the sequel, Fifty Shades Darker, right now, I guess I will go ahead with the second best thing: I'll talk about the first book in the Fifty Shades series, Fifty Shades of Grey.     Fifty Shades of Grey was an educational introduction to BDSM literature.     I was pleasantly surprised by the witty banter between Ana and Christian. Their interactions, especially their emails, are honest, sexy and hilarious. I also very much enjoyed Ana's subconscious and her inner goddess, especially when they were at war with one another. HYSTERICAL! Because this novel is extremely intense and dark at times, this lighter, comical side was much needed and appreciated.     Is Fifty Shades of Grey a romance?   Not in the classical sense.     Christian Grey is your gorgeous, wealthy, adventurous \\"hero\\". He's also your dark, unreadable, unpredictable, controlling and tortured \\"villain\\". He's into some interesting and peculiar things (floggers, gags, bonds, ties, etc.). After Christian meets Ana, he clearly states, \\"I'm not a hearts and flowers kind of man, I don't do romance. My tastes are very singular. You should steer clear of me.\\" For most girls romance would be hearts and flowers, but for Ana every smile, laugh, andendearment from Christian is a romantic gesture (because coming from him they are rare and special).     Christian and Ana have a unique relationship with their own set of rules. (Literally, their own set of typed up rules. Which I might add, I found mighty fascinating to read.) Their relationship is complicated. Ana is innocent, sweet and naïve. She wants your traditional relationship. Christian wants a Submissive. Together they try and meet in the middle and reach a compromise. I will admit, I was fascinated with Christian's lifestyle; it's intriguing and disturbing. But is Ana capable of being who Christian wants her to be? Is that the right lifestyle for Ana? And is Christian even capable of love?    I gave Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James 4 STARS. I really enjoyed this dramatic tale. I recommend this novel to adults who are looking for an EXTREMELY EROTIC, CRAZY TWISTED AND SOMEWHAT ROMANTIC TALE. (Note: if strong language, nudity or graphic sex bothers you or freaks you out then this is not the book for you. This novel is extremely graphic and should only be read by adults. This is NOT a young adult novel.)     FOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF

B005COO1X6|4.0|This is a macabre horror story from one of the few authors who can actually make your skin crawl by simply penning a few choice words.  The beginning of the story gives you a \\"dirty\\" crawl as he skillfully describes the detritus of teenage assignations at an abandoned rest stop through the eyes of a young protagonist seeking bragging rights for a great adventure.<br /><br />The middle section serves up a \\"creepy, spine-tingling\\" crawl as the evil villain is revealed through a series of close encounters of the grisly kind, the prey being well intentioned good Samaritans who happen to be on the right road at the wrong time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are far too few words to choose from by the time you get to the end of the too-short story, and the ending fails to live up to the promise of the earlier premise. In fact, only 80% of the Kindle space is devoted to Mile 81, the rest being a lengthy sneak peek at King's next project; and of the 80%, very few words make up the ending.<br /><br />Never-the-less, at least two-thirds of your Kindle purchase represents vintage King, and this short story is recommended for Kingaholics and short attention span horror fans.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 7, 2011
0765324849|5.0|While the story takes a few pages to get going, the end product [like an expensive prostitute] left me totally satisfied. The way the chapters are broken down is almost like reading a diary. There's everything you would expect from ADAM and big daddies, to deceit. There's also a torture scene that's so vivid, I can see why John Shirley won the Bram Stoker award. If you're a fan of Bioshock, there's no way you won't love this book. If you're not a fan of Bioshock, would you kindly pick up this book and surprise yourself. You might find yourself wanting to play the game afterwards.

B00190OHD6|5.0|I happen to love PS I LOVE YOU, this was such a heartfelt movie. I laughed I cried (most of the time) then I bought it and made my sisters and my mom watch it and they laughed and cried. The entire cast was great, Gerard is so handsome and Hilary Swank did a good job as Holly. I don't understand these one star reviews, maybe the people who read the book before watching the movie have valid complaints but anyone who said this is slow and boring and they hated it because Harry Conick Jr. didn't end up with swank in the end are just ignorant in my book. I was actually pleased that the two characters didn't end up together, just friends seemed way more appropriate. He spends the better part of the movie basically telling Holly to get over the man she loved so deeply. I guess if you have never been in love you wouldn't understand but I would say a year of mourning is not long at all. I love this movie, and would highly recommend it! BEWARE, it is a tearjerker!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Dear Music Appreciator,<br /><br />Here are three reasons to buy this music:<br /><br />1.  You are the kind of music fan who has the patience to listen to a three minute instrumental before the vocals kick in (opening track \\"St. James Infirmary\\").  Perhaps you even enjoy the instrumental as much as the vocals, or maybe the delayed gratification on those vocals make them mean a little more when they do finally show up.<br /><br />2.  You have a thing for freaks, geeks, carnivals, New Orleans, nightclubs, jazz, blues, cool clarinets, sweltering saxophones, tinkling pianos heard over tinkling glasses and the kind of music that sounds best floating over a sea of little round tables with white tablecloths and smoke ring halos.<br /><br />3.  You enjoy traditional songs sung with bluesy, whiskey-soaked vocals from world-weary characters who've been around the block a time or two.  And if the world weary-character that is singing also happens to play a world-weary doctor on a hit network television show that you`ve been known to enjoy, then so much the better.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
0385341008|4.0|The title put me off - too cute - and I almost didn't read this.  I'm so glad I did.  First off, I got quite an education.  To be honest, before this book, I couldn't have told you where Guernsey was on the planet.  I had no knowledge that the German's had occupied the island during WWII.  I enjoyed this from the start.  The entire premise was utterly real to me and the fact that the story was told through letters was a plus [84, Charing Cross Road is perhaps my favorite book of all time].  Bittersweet with a happy ending.  I've given this to three or four friends - everyone loved it.

B004ODLUGM|5.0|Today, I finally convinced my sons to watch The Gruffalo with me. They are little creatures of habit and love to watch the same things over and over again. I can gladly say that I now The Gruffalo will be added to their \\"List of Most Watched\\" shows.   I had never heard of the book \\"The Gruffalo\\" except through a blog post by my friend, Erin. So I was unsure of how I'd like this movie, having never read the book (and books are generally better than any movie!). But oh, this was precious. I really loved the animation - I don't know what kind it was but almost a claymation type.   What a fun little tale! I couldn't tell if the narrator(s) were rabbits or squirrels. My favorite part of the movie was when the owl flew in to three trees. It just made me laugh out loud; and Moose too! Honestly this was just a wonderful show; not very long! And just so simply beautiful. Truly, this is a must-have DVD - and book. I hope to buy the book soon for my sons!

It left an impact on me when I saw it years ago, and I just HAD to buy it to watch it again and again! A must see for anyone in love with good story, good cinematography, and the surprising warmth that can come from such a bitter tale.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|There are hundreds of back packs to choose from and with a HUGE price range.  I needed a back pack quick, inexpensive, and could get me through a trip to Iceland.  For those reasons I purchased this back pack.    Construction quality is ok, but do not expect anything super durable.  One side of the loop handle has started to rip out of the bag, but that's because it was grabbed too quickly while on a cave tour.  Regardless, I highly recommend treating this bag with care while in use.    As for storing your camera gear, the pack offers plenty of space and an ability to customize compartments to fit anything.  I carried a Canon 70-300mm telephoto lens, a 50mm prime lens, a 10-22mm ultra-wide angle lens, lens hoods, camera body, and flash in the main compartment without any trouble.  I felt the gear was protected rather well from scratching or light impacts on the bag.  Spanning from the straps again, I also was concerned and paranoid about the zippers popping open by accident while hiking.  The fix was to purchase a couple of luggage bag locks and locking the zippers together.  Probably overkill, but it was cheap insurance in my mind.    Overall, I do like this bag for its price and capacity.  But, I do not see it lasting forever as I do a lot of landscape shooting and plan to carry my gear on moderate hikes for future trips.  For now I just may use the bag for storage and carrying to local destinations.  In the mean time, I will keep on looking for a new back pack that is rugged and can handle more abuse even though I may drop $100 or more.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This was a great movie! Very inspirational how Bethany Hamilton overcame losing an arm. Sharks scare me to death and I hardly go in to the ocean, and here she was bitten by one and didn't let it stop her! I thought Annasophia Robb did an amazing acting job and I really enjoyed Helen Hunt and Dennis Quaid (he's one of my favorites!) I thought the worst acting award definitely went to Carrie Underwood, who couldn't seem to work up one authentic scene or show an ounce of true emotion. I cringed whenever she came on but at least that wasn't too much. Stick to singing, Carrie! All in all, worth the time! (and for those who complained this movie shoved religion down their throats, I thought it seemed more an add on ... the most of it being done by Carrie in a very poor fashion.)
B000VNMMWA|4.0|I Love this movie.   It is one of my all time favorites!  I bought the three disk version because of the bonus features, or what I thought would be anyway.  I am a film fanatic, so I love to watch the making of  in order to see what it took to put all of the cinematic magic together.  Unfortunately, the making of and featuretts are more of the people introducing each other and being silly, which is great if thats what you are looking for.  I was looking for insights into how each shot was put together and filmed, this was explained to a certain degree in some parts, but certainly not up to my expectations, especially for such a phenomenal film.  I love the movie, hence the four stars, the case is super cool, and the pictures fun to boot, but the making of( the main reason for why I bought the edition with bonuses) did not live up to expectations.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series and rushed out to buy the blu-ray the day it was released.<br />My only concern is that the blu-ray is a bit grainy in certain places, considering I've seen alot of older movies, even some from the 80's, on blu-ray that looked flawless e.g. Night of the Creeps.  In anycase, this is a must for zombie fans, looking forward to season 2 which starts on October 16th, they are supposed to have 13 episodes but they will not be shown consecutively, they will show the first half on the schedule date in October and then take a break and start the remaining episodes in February 2012...
B004EPZ07K|2.0|All great superhero movies have a origin story that has you rooting for the hero before they finally transform into the hero they were destined to become. Superman came to Earth as a child and learned to balance his powers with human kindness. Spiderman over-comes guilt over the death of his uncle to become New York's savior. Here's the first problem with Green Lantern: the origin story is basically \\"Hey kid, here's a magic ring!\\" Boom, we're done.  The second problem with the movie is Blake Lively. Yes, she is a beautiful woman but with the incredible ability to slow every scene she's in to a dead stop.

B003AWRMCE|3.0|I'm mystified by all the glowing reviews here; not too many discerning viewers have been able to see all the \\"holes\\" in the story.  There are one too many scenes of Little Bill \\"disarming\\" supposed gunslingers set on the reward money.  What idiot in his right mind would deny being armed with 10 guns aimed at his head?  Munny also seems to be clairvoyant upon seeing the cutter cowpoke leaving the cabin for an outhouse visit when he's never set eyes on him before (the \\"wanted poster\\" is a crude drawing).  These, and many other poorly thought-out developments had me thinking Clint had done this much better several years before in PALE RIDER.  At the end, I knew, KNEW (!) that Little Bill would mention that ridiculous house he was building before Munny blew his head off.  This movie was not Oscar-winning material even if it was a Hollywood lovefest for all Eastwood's previous work.  And Hackman Best Supporting?  It was hammy and not distinguishing at all, IMHO.  This movie does not rank in the top 20 westerns ever made and was far from the best movie of that year.

THE ONE FROM DENVER IS WORTH THE MONEY ALONE,IT'S FILMED IN THE ROUND THE WAY I SAW THEM IN CHICAGO AND IT'S REALLY GOOD QUALITY. THE ONE FROM FLORIDA HAS 2 SONGS THAT WEREN'T PLAYED AT THE OTHER 2 CONCERTS, \\"SOON\\" AND \\"STARSHIP TROOPER\\". THE BIG DOWNFALL OF THE FLORIDA CONCERT IS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE FILMING FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES WERE CONSTANTLY SHAKING AND GOING IN AND OUT OF FOCUS, SO BASICALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THE CONCERT WAS FILMED DURING A 3 HOUR EARTHQUAKE. STILL THE MUSIC'S GREAT AND IT'S ROCK HISTORY. AND IF 3 CONCERTS WEREN'T ENOUGH YOU ALSO GET 2 CD'S OF THE AUDIO FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONCERT. A MUST FOR ANY DIE HARD YES FAN. BEWARE THAT THE ONE YOU MIGHT BUY FROM ONE OF THE SELLERS MOST LIKELY WILL BE THE SINGLE DISC. SO WHY PAY $45.00 FOR ONE DISC IF YOU CAN GET THE BOX SET FROM GONZO FOR ABOUT $10.00 MORE. SO I WOULD CHECK WITH THE SELLER BEFORE YOU BUY.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case has a lot of pros:<br />-Low price<br />-Complete protection<br />-Accessory compatibility<br />-Awesomely large camera/flash cut-out<br />-Screen protector is a fine freebie<br />-TPU material is nice to the touch and durable<br /><br />This case has one major con.  It is enormous.  Way bigger than it needs to be.<br /><br />Get this case if you don't mind the size.  If you do, get a bumper.  If you need accessory compatibility and small size, I have yet to find a good solution.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|When I completed my recent novel, \\"Passion is a Harsh Taskmaster,\\" I was undecided about how to proceed with publishing it. Several alternatives were available, but I did not want to go a route that would require me to sink a lot of money into promotion that may not bear any fruit. So, a friend of mine recommended that I purchase this book by John Locke. I found that in the first half, Mr. Locke talks mostly about his success with his novels. However, the second half has the real meat. Here, Mr. Locke discusses all the ways he promoted his books with very little money, but with great success. If you are just getting into eBook publishing, this is definitely one of the books you should read.<br /><br />Randy Finch (author of \\"Passion is a Harsh Taskmaster\\")

0553801473|2.0|My opinion of this book keeps wandering back and forth without really getting anywhere, like a fair number of its characters. Nevertheless, here's a road map so far--<br /><br />During initial readthrough: \\"Cannot... stay... awake. Too... many... turtles.\\" (~3 stars)<br /><br />Occasionally interspersed mid-read and lingering afterward: \\"What the hell were those bogus plot twists? Most of this book could've been titled 'Dancing with Godot' wrt plots/characters stagnating and going retrograde, and the few apparent bits of supposed plot development came out of nowhere.\\" (~2 stars)<br /><br />Developing over the next few weeks of reading fan discussion forums: \\"Hey, I didn't catch all those little details about dangerous dining (mushroom soup and wedding pie) and stuff like that-- that's pretty cool.\\" (~4 stars)<br /><br />Drifting downward again as I struggled to actually re-read the book itself but got bogged back down in the Meereeenese quagmire: \\"Y'know, I don't enjoy spending time in Westeros/Essos anymore. In previous books, I thought this world was grim and backstabby, but it was grim and backstabby in an interesting way and I wanted to see how it changed the characters who managed to survive. But now I'm starting to lose interest in those characters, especially since the past two books (like Buffy season 6) have been about everyone 'learning to fail'-- which may be important and necessary life lessons, but they're not my idea of entertainment. And on reflection, I kinda resent that most of my actual enjoyment of this book had to be crowdsourced by proxy, via reading other people's pickups of the significance of otherwise throwaway lines.\\"<br /><br />So if you factor in the online crowdsourcing forums, I'd be willing to average the book up to 3 stars.<br /><br />But my rating for the book itself remains bottomed out at two.
0679735259|5.0|Dear Friends,              \\"Dispatches\\" is one of the best novel about the Vietnam War. Besides other issues, it deals with the battle of Khe Sanh, which I regard as one of the most memorable fights in history. It deserves to be categorized as a battle that changed the Vietnam war as well as the D-Day changed the Second World War. I think it is sided only by the War of Troy, a war whih became a myth in history od the world conflicts.

0385342055|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books in this series.The others not so much. This  book was just meh. It was kinda dumb at times.This series has really  run it course.
0439023521|5.0|So. I got this from the library originaly. I should of just bought it. OH.MY.WORD!!!!! This book is so action packed, emotional,and the story flows so smoothly! To explain the story itself- Long story short- extreme communist American government drives youth to survival of the fittest. The way the kids are treated in the book itself is horrible, but it makes you want to cheer for the good guys. Seriously. I caught myself gasping as if I was watching an extremely intense movie scene when I had to put this book down to do something. It is that good! Its such an \\"on the edge of your seat\\" and \\"stay up till 4am reading it\\" book. Nothing. Like. Twilight.Or. Harry Potter. This book has totally unexpected story line. There are no vampires, no wizards, no magic. But for some amazing reason- Suzanne Collins took reality and actully made it exciting. There are no boring parts. Each chapter ends at a place where you simply HAVE to read one more. I read this book in less than 1 day... I had to sleep between reading it, so if I never stopped for breaks it might have been 4 hours. Simply CANNOT WAIT to read Catching Fire- and you won't be able to wait either. JUST ORDER IT NOW!

0061148512|5.0|A classic isn't a classic because it has reached some measure of perfection on the page, but because it has resonated with more people on a deeper level than most other books.  And that is precisely what makes this book burn.  It's not that everyone loves it, or that it has a happy ending (it doesn't), but instead, it has a transcendent tangibility about it - it can be universally felt and related to by those who slip between its pages and stay awhile.  And feel it, they will.<br /><br />The writing is seamless and smooth; Plath knew how to write.  She knew how to get her troubled spirit to materialize long enough to photograph it for the page.  The combination is dynamite, a subtle, understated, gut-wrenching explosiveness which leaves a trail of smoke in the reader's psyche far too long; you won't quickly clear your soul of this book.
B004ZGM76A|4.0|The movie itself to me is worth watching, it's somewhat hard to follow but the combination of real life action and CGI images are done in an amazing way, that coupled with the sountrack makes it a must have in my collection.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I always loved the original but I find the descriptive \\"remake\\" of this film woefully inadequate. The characters in FN 2011 are much more well rounded and believable, the script far superior. But in all honesty when I first heard about this my first thought was \\"another remake? Really?\\"    And then I found out David Tennant was in it. Now, Mr. Tennant is known to be a very intelligent man. I just couldn't see him taking this on without good reason. Turns out that reason was the script and the changes in the character of Peter Vincent. Unlike the original Peter Vincent, he isn't playing a part. He is terrified of vampires...and for good reason!    To quote @timegeek, another reviewer, (and I so much agree with this I simply have to share it!) \\"Tennant is not only absolutely hilarious, providing the majority of the comedic relief in this film, he also delivers the deepest and most moving scene in the film without uttering a single word. While all the actors really deserve praise, it is David Tennant who really gets the opportunity to shine and put his acting abilities on display in what is, interestingly enough, one of the major roles with the least amount of screen time and earns, what I consider to be, the most outstanding performance in the film. \\"    What Marti Noxon has done is not simply retell original screenwriter and director Tom Holland's story. They've rebuilt it from the foundation up. They took the original premise and all but created a whole new verse and cannon. I loved it so much I've pre-ordered it.    And let's hope this heralds the end of sparkly, romantic vampires...I like my vampires to be proper murderous monsters, thank you very much!

B0021L8V0W|3.0|I would like to talk to you about a little movie called Salt. Oh where do I begin? Let me first start with the title. I think this title is stupid. You think the title is stupid. I realize that there are people in this crazy world whose surname is synonymous with a vital chemical compound, just like there are people named \\"Jane Water\\" or \\"Peter Vitamin C.\\" However, a good movie title it does not make. Is it supposed to be some kind of play-on-words that I'm missing? Like \\"salt\\" of the earth (which would make no sense) or \\"salt\\" in the wound (which makes slightly more sense maybe)?    Anyway, Salt stars Angelina Jolie, she of the strange facial amalgamation of angular and puffy, as CIA operative Evelyn Salt (ugh) who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. That is pretty much the whole plot of the movie, sorry for not giving you a SPOILER ALERT. The rest of the film basically revolves around the question of \\"Is she or isn't she?\\" set into the framework of chase sequences and obligatory, balletic beat downs/gun battles that you expect from a summer action vehicle. In that aspect, Salt doesn't disappoint. The action sequences are thrilling, if not totally original. They do manage to strain at the limits of believability without crossing them, which is really the goal of any action movie of this type.    That being said, Salt does have a couple of major flaws that, when combined, prove too much. The first problem is Ms. Jolie herself. Now, calm down, let me explain myself. Angelina is a badass. I totally buy into her killing black op mercenaries with her bare hands. She exudes such power, confidence and badassery that she should have been in The Expendables instead of Randy Couture. But because of that, I've always had a problem with her when she has to play vulnerable. A critical aspect of the film is Salt's love for her husband and her need to protect him. It drives the action and is pretty much the entire basis for the movie. So it's unfortunate that Jolie and August Diehl have all the onscreen chemistry of a cardboard cut-out and an inanimate carbon rod. Since Diehl's total screen time is about 10 minutes, I'm afraid most of the blame has to go on Jolie. Even when she is talking about him or begging her now-suspicious CIA cohorts to help him, it seems like so many crocodile tears. It appears that, much like Chuck Norris, Angelina Jolie only seems to have two settings: Wait and Kill.    The second problem I had with the film is the bloat it develops as the story progresses. I was into this film for the first third of it, right up to what turns out to be the FIRST twist. This first twist comes early enough that you are like \\"Cool! Now that that is out of the way, let's see how the rest of this plays out.\\" And it is exciting up to and after the first twist! I was all, \\"Yay Salt!\\" But then twist number two comes up and I'm all \\"Ummmm...ok...well, I guess that kind of makes sense. On with the plot!\\" Then the third twist comes (really?), then a fourth (Oh come on!). By the last set of twists and reveals, you've figured this whole thing out way in advance and you're just not interested anymore. To top it all off, they've worked so hard to make it complicated that the ending seems lazily thrown in there. It's an ambitious bit of storytelling but in the end, it's a mess and is ultimately unsatisfying.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|Here are two facts about myself I'm going to share with you to put this in perspective. Fact the first...I am a fan of food. I don't just like to eat per se but I like to experience and try new foods. I am a foodie if you will, but I am in no way a food snob. This is the obvious fact as evidenced by my ever expanding waistline. The other fact is that while I enjoy documentaries, I try not to watch ones that have a political undertone since I get all fired up about them. I don't really watch the news for that same reason. Politics are bad for my mental health. So it was with some slight trepidation that I watched \\"Food, Inc.\\"    Let me start off by saying that you should never trust a documentarian. They usually seem to have an agenda and it often times seeps into the film itself. So with that in mind, \\"Food, Inc.\\" is a film about the way we eat. Or more correctly, the way our food is produced and packaged and brought to the consumer. It is a fascinating subject because it is something that effects every person in the country but it is a topic that most of us never stop to consider. The film touches on many aspects of the food industry: the industrialization of farming and the changes to reality that it has brought to our farming communities, both physically and economically; the virus like spread of corn into all of the products we eat which is often not immediately apparent to consumers; and the genetic tampering and short-cuts the food industry has taken to give the consumer what it wants at the cost of nutrition and, as a consequence, our health. These points are presented well and are thought provoking.    But the real revelation of the film, at least for me, was the depiction of the food industry as a shadowy and powerful cabal in the US government. According to the film, they have positioned themselves into power by exempting themselves from trust laws, keeping their operations a strictly guarded secret, and paying low wages to employees who work in dangerousand filthy environments. All of this leads to risks to the health of the public at large. What is truly shocking, if true, is how the food industry has effectively made the USDA and FDA powerless to regulate and enforce sanctions on them. Realizing that they have made organizations that are meant to protect us toothless in the pursuit of capitalism is, well, part of what gets me all fired up and why I try to avoid these things.    The above is contrasted by images of the local farmer, the organic grower, companies that care about the well being of the public and the environment. So the message is to eat local, eat organic, eat seasonal, stop The Man. (By the way, this is spelled out explicitly in an interminable \\"you-should-do-this\\" sequence at the end.) And that is my main problem with the film. I understand they are trying to get a message across. But they only pay lip service to the negatives, if at all. For one, the film does touch on the expense of eating organic and local yet it is a short segment and incomplete at that. The fact of the matter is that it is significantly more expensive to buy organic and local products. Many families simply can't afford to do this. The film seems to suggest that this is also the doing of the food industry. While the industry does play a part, the flip side is not significantly explored. Also, zero mention is made (from what I recall) of what organic produce does to the population of the world at large. I have heard jokes told that for every \\"progressive\\" yuppie enjoying their organic apple, 100 people are dying of starvation in the third world. The simple fact is...if all we produced was local and organic, we couldn't support the worlds population. Who knows if we could even support our own. While it is all well and good to say it is better for your health, I'm sure those starving appreciate your moral stance against a genetically modified kumquat.    \\"Food, Inc.\\" is a good film and I encourage you to see it. Listen to what ithas to say but don't go off the deep end and keep it in perspective. Oh yeah, and in case you were wondering, there isn't much in the way of gruesome animal slaughtering. The most graphic things involves chickens (at a small farm no less.) Bon appétit!
B003SA7X9K|5.0|I became a passionate fan of this show the first time I saw it in 1999 at the Jane Street Theater in NYC.  I saw various casts performing in Kansas City, Chicago, Cincinnati, Rochester, Washington D.C. and New Orleans.  I own several different cast recordings, and I taught myself to play the entire show on guitar.  Suffice to say this show changed my life and is probably my favorite musical of all time.<br /><br />While I have enjoyed almost all of the different performances, nothing has ever equaled the magnificence of the original cast recording.  The movie soundtrack is OK, but there's something magic about the chemistry between John Cameron Mitchell and the band Cheater (led by Steven Trask, the composer of the music and lyrics), who performed as Hedwig's backing band in the early days.<br /><br />The recording evokes classic rock sounds of bands like the Beatles and David Bowie and runs the gamut of emotion from punk rage (\\"Angry Inch\\", \\"Exquisite Corpse\\") to camp humor (\\"Sugar Daddy\\", Wig In A Box\\") to mournful reflection (\\"Wicked Little Town\\") to triumph over adversity (\\"Tear Me Down\\", \\"Midnight Radio\\").  Gorgeous guitar tones highlight the various arrangements, and JCM's rich tenor voice soars above the mix, supported by outstanding harmony arrangements.<br /><br />Words almost fail me when I try to describe this work of genius.  For any fan of glam rock, this is required listening.  Hedwig is nothing short of a transsexual Ziggy Stardust.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Without a doubt the funnuest show (movie, live or TV) I've ever seen.  Absurd yet completely relatable; it's fast paced, commedy at its best.  If you like Brittish humor, you will probably love this series.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Nothing makes cinema more compelling than giant fighting robots; combine that with characters confronting adversity because of their involvement with giant fighting robots, friendships that develop because of the giant fighting robots, and moments of genuine peril BECAUSE of the giant fighting robots... well this is great cinema, no?      Transformers didn't have the budget to show the real wonder and majesty of giant fighting robots, but Real Steel pulls no punches in this department; the trailer alone must have cost $100,000,000 and half the scenes aren't even in the movie.    The simple fact of film (and life) is this; if it looks awesome whilst Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\" plays in the background, and has giant fighting robots, then it's an awesome movie.  If it pulls this off for 90 minutes, then it's above awesome - it's Real Steel.    I haven't actually seen this movie yet, but I can tell it will be the greatest movie of the year, possibly even the decade. I sometimes cry during Karate Kid (not the new one)

B002QY9RMA|3.0|Let me just say that I like Beyonce's track listing for \\"4\\". But she had nowhere to go but up in that aspect from this album. What was she (or her management team) thinking when it came to this album? Who thought it was a good idea to lump a bunch of same-sounding AC stuff together and then put the body-moving music on the second part? I know it was supposed to be something with Beyonce tracks and then the Sasha Fierce tracks separated. But was that even necessary? Technically Sasha already had her own full album before (see B'Day). Why tack on this? She could have easily blended the tracks but included in the notes which persona fit the song. Or just leave it up to us to figure it out (for ex. see Prince with \\"Sign O' the Times\\").     Anyway the first three tracks were pretty good. I personally LOVED \\"Disappear\\" which is AC done right. The vocals, production, everything. Definitely the \\"I AM...\\" highlight.  \\"Halo\\" was beautiful but the clicks and claps in the production takes away from elegance I think she was aiming for. \\"If I were a Boy\\" was an interesting first single, and I must say the chorus is on point. The rest of the first half is really ZZZZZZzzzz. Thankfully \\"Single Ladies\\" wakes you up. The highlight though of the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" half is between \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" both of which are plenty fun. \\"Videophone\\" is ugh...should of went back into the left out track bag. \\"Diva\\"'s strength is in the production. A female \\"A Milli\\", not as strong but interesting. \\"Ego\\" is okay. Kanye uplifted it.     Anyway it's amazing that for Beyonce, every other album has a messed up track list. Her first solo one was plagued by that boring uninspired second half. And this one is more plagued by the first AC half. \\"B'Day\\" and \\"4\\" were spared this and I don't exactly know why.    Highlights(or MP3 a la carte):    Disappear   If I Were A Boy  Single Ladies  Sweet Dreams  Halo   Diva  Ego (feat. Kanye West)

B001QFZADA|4.0|I had not read any of the Five Love Languages books but many friends recommended them. Being a new Kindle owner, I decided to buy the book in that format. One of the things I love most about my Kindle is that it allows me to enlarge the font as needed and that saves me from buying the more expensive Large Print books.     My issue came when I found that certain parts of this book are not subject to that benefit. For example, the beginning of each chapter contains a paragraph which I assume to be very insightful and serves to set the tone for the chapter. However, the text is presented in a font that I cannot read. Nor can I enlarge it the text.    I made the most of it and continued to enjoy the book. Until I came to the questionnaire at the end. The one that will help me determine my very own love language. It, also, is presented in text which is too small for me to read and I cannot enlarge. Having read the book, I am fairly certain of my love language but I would like to answer the questions to know for sure and to know if there are any surprises in what I determined it to be. I am quite frustrated over this. At this point, I almost feel as if I may as well have not read the book at all.    If anyone else has had this problem and overcame it please share your solution with me.
0670022411|5.0|I AM NOT A BOOK REVIEWER BUT I KNOW WHAT I LIKE AND THIS I LOVED.  WHAT AN AMAZINGLY DETAILED STORY.  I WAS HOOKED BY THE SECOND PAGE.  HER CHARACTERS WERE VIVID AND SO EASY GET TO KNOW.  I AM PASSING IT TO ALL FRIENDS AND RELATIVES AND CANNOT WAIT FOR NEXT ONE.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book was downright amazing, the only problems I had with it were the fact that it ended and that I still don't fully understand the religions and histories involved.  The character development was extraordinary, and the plot was outstanding.  My only warning with this book would be to make sure you have plenty of time to read it, as I didnt find myself putting it down until it was done and I realized the entire night was gone and it was morning.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My 1 yr old recieved this for his bday. HE LOVES IT! It's even fun for me :) The only problem is one of the suction cups-it came bent so it has some trouble sticking to the tub, but not a big deal, I can always replace the suction cup. Overall, great toy!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am in my 40s and moderately fit; meaning I've been fairly regular with excercise such as jogging up to 2-3 miles, walks and yoga.  However, when my 23-year old niece raved about this workout, it piqued my interest, but I felt I'd never be able to get through it.  I ordered the DVD anyway and am very pleased with the results.  It was difficult for me and it took discipline to get through the first 30 days at least 5 times a week.  Not having lifted weights in the past, I started Level 1 without weights; moved to 2lbs for a couple weeks; then 3lbs.  Now, almost three months later, I've moved into the 5lbs Jillian is using in the video.  Starting slow and working my way up was the best decision.  No injuries, constant motivation to get to my preferred weights and RESULTS.  After three months, I've lost from 1-2 1/2 inches in all alreas.  I strongly recommend you take your measurements before starting.  I have not lost weight, but the measurements show me the results (and drop in pant size).  I am still progressing into level 2, but may start to change things up a bit and vary the different levels.  I still find level 1 challenging due to the increase in the weights.    The bottom line is that this is a very inexepensive investment that produces results and does not run it's course in your workout regimen.  I can use this DVD for the long-term due to the different levels and ability to switch out weights.  I highly recommend this DVD, especially for those who are looking into toning and for a workout that produces results with a relatively short (yet intense) workout.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Great little thing to mess around with when you're just strolling around or watching the show.   I got this given that I'd been hearing some issues with the Mark VII toy, namely the design issues, despite actually preferring it. This one works great, had it for almost 3 weeks now, no issues so far. Been playing with it on and off.  Some good durable plastic and crafted well. The retractable bit doesn't click into the model as hard as I'd like, but I do like my stuff firm so take that with a pinch of salt. Same with the bottom part: it won't fall off from some minor fiddling (you have to consciously try to remove it), but it's softer than the cap with the ink nib, meaning you gotta hold it in place if you want to get the pen open.   Looks great too, for the most part. Made of plastic, feels like plastic, but looks like metal. Some of the joint welds are a bit messy, and for the top half you'll definitely notice the line where the two halves are glued together, but it's a minor complaint.   Extends and retracts well, and the two buttons are both comfortable and easy to reach.   Speaking of which, the light. Not as bright as I'd hoped, but bright enough, just don't expect to see it in daylight. Wish the whole tip lit up too instead of just the middle.   Sound isn't really the same, but you have to compare it to the show to realize this. It also alternates between one sound and the same sound with some chirping, with a higher frequency. Sort of a \\"strained\\" effect.   Battery installation is simple, and the ink nib and UV light work as promised. All in all a good buy for $20, great for kids (or otherwise). Now if only it came with the wallet and paper.  UPDATE: Seems less durable now, after about 3 months. I taped the underside of the extender nib on (the part that covers the screw that you need to open it), and when in the retracted position it doesn't hold very well (you can wiggle it some and it'll move far enough that the button isn't aligned anymore). Does still hold tight when extended, though.   I also glued the UV ink nib onto the bottom with some firm but easy to remove glue. Some minor scratches have popped up too.   Might take a little more abuse from a kid. Still, it's good for $20, I'll most likely get another if this one gets too roughed up.   On a side note I did buy the 11th Doctor's screwdriver, and that one is definitely better.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I ordered this holding my nose because I knew Lucas would release the \\"updated\\" (read garbage) editions and once again completely disregard the fans.  At least I was used to them and even though every \\"enhancement\\" made my skin crawl, I knew when to fast-forward.  Of course, that wasn't enough.  He had to go one step further.  \\"NOOOOOO!!!\\" - Really?  I'm done buying his junk... If he can't get it through is arrogant head that every single little thing he has done to \\"enhance\\" these movies has made them worse - at some points considerably so - then he does not deserve my money.  Let's face it.  He's only made one decent movie as a director (Episode IV), and that was luck.  He had a good story with mostly fair (one or two excellent) actors and the thing worked.  Then He's spent the next thirty years messing it up and chasing it with some really awful stuff (I-III).  I know I'm wasting my time - Only about a million people have said the same thing and the guy clearly could not care less.  Send him your money if you want.  Plenty of people will and his \\"updates\\" will be validated in his little arrogant mind...
0553288105|5.0|This is a novel composed of three separate stories, each having some thing in common with one another. This is a great example of Isaac's writing style and I say it is my favorite novel, er series...by him. Let me warn the reader that this book begins at chapter 6 and slowly makes sense of everything from there. It is a strange classic, but a classic none the less. If you have not read this book, you owe it to yourself to read it. It's one of those rare gems, that make me wish that there was more!

So, it's awesome.

B004SHED22|1.0|A good friend with a master's in library science recommended this book to me and the concept was very compelling. It didn't take long at all, however, to see how poorly written the book was. After a few early heart-wrenching scenes, I wasn't actually *feeling* the anguish but more caught up in how the sentences portrayed them in a way that was too distracting to feel anything other than annoyance. I slogged my way through it only to find a terrible ending. Are we really to believe that Sarah killed herself and Julia will fall in love with William (who is conveniently also divorced and only mere months into dating someone) to raise baby Sarah together? I was hoping that someway, somehow there would be a tiny promise of a less than merde-y ending.<br /><br />Other reviews hit the nail on the head: cardboard characters, predictable plot lines, writing that is a case study of \\"how not to write.\\" Sigh... like others I'm also actually a bit angry at how poorly this important story turned out so I guess, in the end, I did experience some emotion!

Yes, the new update was less than perfect but all I had to do was uninstall and reinstall to get the mooncake level. And when I emailed Rovio about it, they responded right away. I think if more people emailed developers when they had a problem INSTEAD of complain about it in a negative review, the good apps would be give the right recognition. I counted 15 negative reviews on the market complaining about the update when it came out but when I emailed rovio, they were unaware of the problem. that's as bad as downloading a theme and giving it one star cuz it &quot;force closes&quot; when people try to &quot;open&quot; it.

0198326769|3.0|The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is the 5th novel by Irish author John Boyne. It is a holocaust tale from a different perspective: that of the naïve and innocent young son of a concentration camp commandant. He asks his father when they arrive if his father has done something bad at work to be punished in this way, being sent by the Fury to this awful place, Out With. Bored, and missing his friends in Berlin, Bruno eventually sets out to explore, and meets, on the other side of a big fence, a boy in striped pyjamas. It is a friendship with tragic consequences. The device of using a child's narration to describe something he cannot understand, but that is perfectly clear to the adult readers, is a clever one, but some glaring inconsistencies make this story less credible than it could have been, and perhaps detract from its strength. Bruno seems too naïve for a German 9 year-old in 1943, especially about Jews and Hitler; the idea that Shmuel has the time and opportunity to sit alone by the fence daily seems very unlikely; that the fence is not regularly patrolled, and that it has a gap the size of a small boy, again unlikely; the other children in this novel also seem far too naïve. The Fury and Out With, I can accept as a literary device, and these are effective, in their way. Inconsistencies aside, Boyne does depict the setting very skilfully and builds the main character well. As a Holocaust fable, I guess it gets a message across, but I'm not sure for whom or what exactly that message is: maybe, tell your children the truth, don't try to protect them from uncomfortable facts? I enjoyed reading it but I thought The Book Thief was much better.

Giving this fleece job one star because I can't give it zero.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The official death of star wars. George Lucas has continued to ignore fans, and put out copies of these films with the pure intent of making money. It's clear he is no longer the man he was when he made the glorious original trilogy, and that Star Wars has been destroyed by its own creator. George Lucas was once a pioneer in film making, and spoke out against altering films, but he has now become the very thing he swore to destroy.
1934030554|2.0|This book is worth buying for the sample training plan in the appendix. The rest of the book is pretty poorly written and it seems a lot of chaff to wade through (and compelling arguments why you should subscribe to their web service) for the substance.

B001PCOSW8|4.0|I know, I know. You're thinking this is the band that made The Final Countdown. In reality few people know that Europe existed before or even beyond The Final Countdown. It's as if they were frozen in time to 1986/87. As the band proves with their first album, Europe (1983), early Europe was much more aggressive and heavier overall going for more of a Metal sound on their debut album (think Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with some Scorpions thrown in it). The band's self-titled album shows a very different Europe, there aren't any keyboards here, Joey Tempest's voice is less forced and more much natural and not overproduced. Plus it's a relentless guitar attack, there are some killer riffs and solos that I think a lot of Metalheads could enjoy. Certainly not the Europe most remember, they were much more successful during The Final Countdown/ Out of This World era during the late 80's. I believe they would have much more credibility among hardcore metal devotees if they continued to release albums like this. It's probably not a \\"classic\\" album but I consider it somewhat of gem because it's actually a well-kept secret and tends to be unfairly overlooked. It doesn't have much in common with The Final Countdown except that three band members are the same as that lineup.<br /><br />The story behind this album and ultimately Europe's career is quite interesting. The band competed in a sort of \\"battle of the bands\\" competition in Sweden when they were known as Force and earned the first place. Their prize was a deal with a record label. The result is the band's very first album; they headed to the studio and quickly changed their name.  Europe doesn't sound commercial or doesn't give any sings that it was heavily produced. The band co-produced the album and did most of the work themselves and the result is stunning. Not a masterpiece but quite impressive considering their young age and the fact that English isn't even their first language.<br /><br />\\"In The Future To Come\\" came as quite a surprise to me. The first song from the first Europe album, I expect something softer and then comes in this amazing heavy song out of nowhere (they're from Sweden actually)!  \\"Farewell\\" is an edgy rocker that has a youthful spirit (Don't know where I'm going/ So long/Farewell/ I Gotta Go) that cannot be replicated by older bands. Nice chorus, catchy without being pop or repetitive and Norum's solo is terrific. Tempest tells a story here and doesn't focus on choruses or \\"Oh ooohhs!\\".  It's a wonderful display of youthful aggression and opens the album with a bang.  \\"Boyazont\\" is a neat instrumental, displaying John Norum's talents on guitar. He was latter overshadowed by keyboard and almost barely audible and I'm only slightly exaggerating here. \\"Seven Door Hotel\\" starts all soft with a piano leading the listener incorrectly in thinking that it's going to be a soft song. WRONG! It soon kicks into fast and heavy gears and quickly becomes what I consider to be the highlight of the album. \\"Children of this Time\\" has some excellent lyrics and has a galloping beat not unlike Iron Maiden, solid track. The closest thing to a ballad here is \\"Words of Wisdom\\" which is a slower and more melodic track. This track features the \\"Oh oohs!\\" that Tempest would later be famous for. \\"The King Will Return\\" is another slower song, not one of the album's best tracks but still quite good. \\"Paradise Bay\\" is full on rock and roll, catchy as well and concludes the album just as well as \\"In The Future To Come\\" started it.<br /><br />It would be interesting to put this album on and have someone guessing which band's album it is. Unless it's a hardcore Europe fan, chances are this person won't be able to tell or guess accurately.  One could even compare it to Def Leppard, another European band who gained a lot of success in the 1980's. Their first album, 1980's On Through The Night sounds almost nothing like the popular Def Leppard material. It's much heavier and shows their influences. That's why I find it interesting, it's different and miles away from the sound of the commercially successful Europe.<br /><br />If you thought The Final Countdown was too pop or commercial and prefer Hard-Rock/Metal this is more likely to suit you. If you're into metal do yourself a favor and grab Europe's debut album, it's much heavier than one would expect and it's an overlooked album that deserves more recognition. Europe's Europe isn't overproduced or filled with keyboards. It's much more raw and honest. I like myself some Final Countdown as well, after all it was my introduction to Europe like many others but this and its excellent follow up, Wings of Tomorrow (1984),  is totally different and in a good way. 4.5/5.I find it interesting, it's different and miles away from the sound of the commercially successful Europe.

B004FOA84A|4.0|This game has fantastic graphic artwork (you truly can spend extra time just enjoying the scenery), and enjoyable story line, intriguing puzzles to solve, and inspires careful thought and analysis at times, and attention to (seemingly minor) details at others. Clearly some thought went into the design to make the solutions non-linear, which makes the game even more fascinating. The gameplay experience is wonderful.<br /><br />Except...<br /><br />...that it's over too soon. Most other games I've bought at the 99-cent price tier provide longer-lasting and/or repeat playability, and this game is twice that price. Sadly, this game is very much too short. I didn't actually count the puzzles that were solved, but it subjectively feels like maybe 20 or so. Combine that with the basic nature of this genre, which means I get to enjoy it only once, and, while I applaud the authors' clever puzzles and stunning artwork, this still managed to feel like a let-down.<br /><br />As enjoyable as the technical merits make this game, I still felt like I had run up against a locked door, behind which remain \\"the other 80% of the game\\" when it was over.
1416575464|5.0|I found Domino when I was starting out in college as an Interior Design student. I would cut out pages for projects and ideas to paste in my notebook- I even carried my free tote around proudly. I was devastated when they stopped printing (I got glamour as a replacement :( ) and instantly put this book on my wish list as a birthday/christmas gift. It took my family years to finally get this book for me, but I love it! I'm now an Interior Design  graduate student and I refer to this book all the time- especially for arranging my own tiny city apartment. It has great ideas for making a space your own- whether it's a house or an apartment. I love how the book is broken down by space, which makes it easy when you're thinking about a particular space and you can't go wrong with the adorable cover! I would take the print right off the book and make pillows out of it. It's definitely a must if you're a Domino fan or just need help decorating your space.

B00559B9N8|3.0|I'm about halfway through this book, and I love the story.  For the content, I would definitely give 4 or 5 stars.  However, I feel that people should be aware that there are multiple errors and typos with this Kindle version. I for is, Moth for Both, etc.  They don't make the book unreadable, but there have been a few times when I had to reread a sentence to try to figure out what it should say because a typo was making it really confusing.

0465011020|5.0|This book is an eye-opener for anyone who doubts the horrors that are hidden behind North Korea's wall of isolation.  It follows the tragedy of a boy who was punished for his grandfather's political beliefs and dealings.  It shows how fast one can go from being welcomed by communism and then shunned and persecuted when fallen out of favor with those in control.  More than that, it describes in great detail the suffering of North Koreans at the hands of a brutal regime.  It's also a story of triumph and one man's quest to be free of his misfortune and free of communism forever.

0811875040|4.0|This book is aethetically the prettiest cookbook I've ever seen. I sought out Miettes Bakery in Hayes Valley, San Francisco. Its an experience just entering the store. The book is a mirror of that experience... lovely and elegant in everyway. So I was amazed that I found the book on Costco for only $17. I had seen it online for far more. Rechecking Amazon's price online (Sept '11) I see they are even lower. There is an \\"errata\\" sheet included in the Costco version listing numerous changes for measuring and adjusting. (hence the price drop). Apparently a new version is coming out next month. I am an avid cookbook reader and what impresses me about this book is the detailed explanations accompanying each recipe. Last year after visiting New York I became a big fan of Magnolia Bakery and bought several editions of their cookbooks. Have had fun making some of the recipes which are homey and old-fashioned & really enjoy the books. But Miettes book is far more generous in tips and pictures so that you can create the beautiful cakes and treats. I think it will make a wonderful gift book going into the holidays.

I think it was after pushing through the first two-thirds of the way into the novel that things finally started to click with me, the setting, characters, plot and so on.  And it was worth it - I loved the way things wrapped up like they did.  I guess the way this book tossed all the characters at me, without too much of the back story that was obviously being referred to, made things pretty tough.  Still, I can't wait to read the next one, which I've already purchased.  I very much liked how DIFFERENT this story was from most of the usual fantasy LOTR based tropes you see in most novels.  And I enjoyed the miltary aspect of it.  The end of this book definitely left me wanting for more.
0142419680|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B005L7B22C|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that my 1-star review is specific to the episode Night Terrors, though, it's not 100% at odds with my overall feelings about this year's crop of new Doctor Who. The current season has been pretty uneven so far, with Moffat and his collaborators (except for the main cast) seemingly adopting the over-arching attitude of good enough is good enough. The previous season was similarly up and down, but there seemed to be at least a little bit more spark, especially with the writing. Midway through the current season, that spark feels distant, with even Neil Gaiman's episode being a relative let-down (at least as a story, as a love-letter to Doctor Who it was charming).<br /><br />Let's Kill Hitler was a mess, but it was at least entertaining in a \\"Doctor Who Meets Coupling\\" sort of way. Night Terrors, on the other hand, is proof positive that Mark Gatiss should not be allowed to write for Doctor Who anymore. I'd been trying to keep an open mind about Gatiss' writing after last year's Dalek story, because it had some really good character moments, especially involving Bill Patterson as Professor Bracewell, that helped offset idiotic things like \\"Danny Boy\\" and the Spitfires in space. Night Terrors didn't even have that much to recommend it. Even the relatively interesting moments felt pointless and un-involving, a bunch of creepy moments thrown in because the makers of the show feel like they need to have creepy moments. They felt grafted on to the plot rather than being anything truly relevant to the story. In short, it committed the cardinal sin of any drama, more so even than being bad, it was boring.<br /><br />Addendum (1/5/13): From the 1 out of 6 helpful votes, I can only surmise one of two things. Either people really loved the episode Night Terrors or the majority of Doctor Who fans will reflexively discredit any opinion that's remotely critical of the show.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|Anyone who knows Hugh Laurie prior to 'House' is not surprised by the amount of talent displayed in this CD.  The rhythm, lyrics and music keeps you humming for hours as you listen to the great and unforgettable tunes.   The beat changes and twists and keeps you focused on the music and delighted in the changeups.  I am not a music critic, but I know what I like, this is great!

They are very stiff & narrow, I just don't like them. I bought these to replace my others as my barn boots & they just are too uncomfortable to walk in. Did I say stiff? & tall? Give me back my Georgies!!!
B0050PYNO4|1.0|I found the negative - bigotted take on Christianity unsettling. This film was very anti-American in that it perpetuated every negative British stereotype about Americans. You have to check your brain at the door if your going to watch this film. Only those who embrace the counter-culture worldview that hates, America, the traditional family, and Christianity - will enjoy this film.    Larry
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I didn't quite understand it at first. \\"A movie about facebook? Why?\\" I thought to myself. It seemed like a boring tale -- boy creates website, website goes big, boy makes billions of dollars. However, the tale is much more intriguing. This is the story of a no-holds-barred, out-for-blood internet domination.<br /><br />There are very few films I will watch repeatedly, and this is one of them. In fact, the first time I watched it was late one night, and I watched it again the very next morning. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is neurotic and spot-on. Justin Timberlake plays a slimy Sean Parker. Andrew Garfield is amazing as Eduardo Saverin, and is really the only character in the drama to elicit any real sympathy from the audience.<br /><br />If you haven't seen The Social Network yet, you definitely should. I can honestly see why it was hailed as \\"film of the year.\\"
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I heard about Paper Camera on a review site and it looked like something fun to download and play with. Right after I bought it, I realized that the version on the Android Market was updated with more features, features that really interested me and the apps seem to get updated at a slower rate here, if at all, than the other market. Well, I wrote to the developer and got a response within an hour, telling me what was coming to this market in the update and why it wasn't here yet. The email was personal and very helpful. Check back for the update. It's coming. Installed the updated apk and it's working perfectly on my Incredible, but I do understand the delay as they want it to work on all devices. I see so many reviews here dinging apps for not supporting older hardware or tablets, so I understand wanting to get everything squared away before releasing it to the public. I wish all developers were so responsive.
B002AOWXO0|4.0|I put this album on when I was working on my garage over the Labor Day weekend, and I loved it. Pete and Scarlet's voices are a perfect foil to one another, and it never feels forced. I'm sure they had a great time recording this album, because you can hear it in the music (despite the depressing nature of a breakup). The only drawback is that it's only 29 minutes long, but it's very listenable and re-listenable.

B004ZGI1V0|2.0|The trailers made this film out to be an action/thriller starring the man who trained Obi-Wan Kenobi and Batman. However, it's a slow-paced boring piece of film. If you were looking for a film like \\"Taken\\", you won't find it here.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This isn't going to be long, mainly because I'm skirting around any hint of spoilers to avoid ruining the fun.    If you're a geek, there is something in this book that will make you smile. From anime to Monty Python to ancient computer games to 80s music, the references read like a geek checklist.     The plot is somewhat predictable, but that isn't exactly a bad thing, and it manages to throw a couple curveballs, and it's very well written to boot. If you've spent anytime on IRC, Usenet, or any of the various MMOs, you will find something in Wade to sympathize with, and some of the things he does and goes through will probably invoke memories.     It's one of those books that will suck you in for hours and make you realize it's 3 AM when you meant to go to bed at Midnight, that you don't want to stop reading, but you don't want it to end.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|I bought Born This Way on the release date and have listened to it almost every day since.  Every time I hear the album in it's entirety I hear new sounds and get something new and positive out of the lyrics.  GaGa's Message is a very positive one, of self exploration, and finding your path and embarking on the journey, no matter what obstacles may come your way.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|Converting \\"older\\" movies to blu-ray has been a hit and miss proposition. Some do not look much better than the standard issue Dvd and thus are worth buying only for the upgrade in audio. Happily, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" does not fall into that category. The audio and video quality of the blu-ray issue are both superb. If you have a fairly large hi-def TV and a good surround sound system, watching this refection on Vietnam is like sitting in the theatre watching it when it first came out. Coppola filmed some scenes that look and sound amazing in blu-ray! If you want to round out your experience, also get a hold of the documentary on the making of Apocalypse, \\"Heart's of Darkness.\\" It will make you appreciate the film even more.
0060734191|5.0|First of all I'd like to say that I am not much for writing reviews, but this trilogy has got to be one of my all time favorite book series. I happen to stumble across the first of the books when I was meandering the aisles of my local bookstore, dazed and confused, looking for a suitable substitute for Harry Potter - remember that lag when there hadn't been an HP release for quite sometime? - I needed a fix and I needed it bad, and there it was. Sabriel. The blue coat, black hair, and bandolier of bells captivated me. I immediately picked up the book and began to read it. Needless to say I was hooked. I was two chapters in before I had even realized I was already at the cashiers cashing out. I gobbled up this book and its subsequent others in no time and still read this series with the same tenacity as I did the first time. I fell in love with the characters instantly. The storyline is mature, without being too heavy. Garth Nix's ability to weave such a mesmerizing and enchanting story is uncanny. I am eagerly awaiting the rumored prequel.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I am trying to get this app and the interaction is so badly designed that it opened this review pane. That is just incompetent of them.
B005COO1X6|5.0|The first couple of pages of Mile 81 weren't really awe inspiring, and I really can't say which point in the story I had reached before I knew I would have to finish the entire thing before putting down the Kindle.  In tone and pacing I was reminded of a much earlier style of King novella.  I loved the ending, but wished the story were longer - and who knows? maybe we will meet up with the protagonist again in some future book.  I can hope . . .<br /><br />Well worth the cost - buy the book and read the book!
B002RWKSII|5.0|I am a fan of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys since the very first record they ever made.  I was in high school when it first came out.  I have also been a life long George Gershwin fan and actually have a collection of different recording of Gershwin's music, including Gershwin/Piano Rolls album.  So, when I saw this album, I just had to have it.  I especially love the cut \\"I've Got Rhythm\\".  But, it's just a fun album to listen to.  And, I am so glad that Brian Wilson is again performing and recording.  Anyone who is a Beach Boys fan or a Gershwin fan has got to love this album.  Way to go!
B002ECJZ76|4.0|Tonight I watched a Finnish version of Santa's childhood. I enjoyed the totally non-commercial version of Santa.  I have always loved the old-fashioned Santa and I think you will too. This is for older children or children with a good attention span.    It kind of reminded me of Shirley Temple's version of Heidi. A good story but not a lot of action. Never thought much about Santa's childhood so   this was a nice movie for me. It is not for the kids who can't live without video games but for the kids who like to read, enjoy simple things  and act older than they are. I will surely watch it again just before Christmas because I get entirely sick of the commercialism of Christmas  and long for the slower Christmas where you celebrate giving to the people you love because you love them not because you feel like you have to.    As you can tell I love Christmas and start watching holiday movies in July, (I hate summer). I hope you give this movie a chance when you are just wanting to relax  and are in no hurry but feel like stringing popcorn, and celebrating just living your life and looking back on Christmases past when you could believe   that life is more than rushing around. Hot cocoa would go with this too.     I know this is not the most exciting review but it made me slow down for a little while and just spend time by myself and remembering being a child who believed in Santa.  Someone good, just for the sake of being good.    Hope you give yourself the gift of time and enjoy!
B004YEJGEO|5.0|The game is very well designed, and the levels are very clever. The new update seems to have added the ability to look at other people's solutions. Unfortunately, the solutions don't always save right, so there is some fiddling you have to do to get the pieces back in place. However, the game is quite fun and addictive.
0765365278|5.0|First I must say that I am a huge fan of his writing. At first, he seems to be a sesquipedalian. In truth, he just loves to write. Once the story begins you just dive right into it. I've read a few reviews stating that he does too much world building. Bear in mind this is the first book of many in the series. You can ask any author of any series and they will tell you, and you will find, that the first book MUST set the mood. It MUST set the stage. It MUST give the reader a reference as to what is happening in the world of the book.<br /><br />On that note, the book is simply amazing and he has an incredible ability to keep you hooked, chapter after chapter. It's nothing short of an amazing start to a seemingly incredible series. I don't want to give too much away, which is why my review may seem a little roundabout. But, read the book and you'll see what I mean.
0545128285|4.0|If you enjoy the Harry Potter books and have all 7 of them, get this one to go with them.  This book isn't mentioned until the last book, (Deathly Hallows), but if you'd like to know what Dumbledore wanted Hermione to know from reading it, get it.  It's a very short book which you'll read quickly.  The tales in it are like fairy tales, with obvious morals and wisdom, told in Non-Muggle style.  Each tale has a little commentary from Dumbledore, which makes it interesting.  The tales in this book are similar to the old Irish folk tales by William Butler Yeats.  All in all, it is a good short read.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|I love the whole saw series so I could never give this movie a bad review! Ever! This movie is wonderful addition to the saw series so I know that any saw fan will love it! If you liked 1-6 You have to watch this one!!! This is the ultimate ending to the saw series even though I hope they put out more movies! This movie will blow your mind if you have watched the first 6, Trust me! :) So you should order them all! Everyone in the world should watch the saw series! They have changed my life greatly!

B004VQFQ2Q|2.0|I got this album when it first came out. Played it and thought there was something wrong with my speakers. The mix was horrible couldnt hear the drums like you should have. Really ruined an album which had some great riffs and songs. Saw the offer for the digitally remastered and jumped on it. Problem is the mix is still horrible. They added some bunus items but the mix on the lives tracks is horrible too. Album needs to be remixed not remastered. Pretty dissapointing for me. Too bad cause the songs are good.
030788743X|5.0|I read a lot. I RARELY recommend books to friends because while many books are good, few are great, but  even fewer did I enjoy more than this one. I have been bragging and exclaiming about this book since page 50. What a blast!  I spent must of the book smiling!  With fun 80's nostalgia, tons of geeky references, a great treasure hunt and good characters, Ready Player One is definitely my favorite book I've read this year and probably in the past 10 years!  I highly recommend it!

0394806220|5.0|My daughter is 5 months and 2 weeks old. She likes it when I read this \\"noise\\" book to her. It not only grabs her attention but also makes her laugh. I guess it's because of the sounds as well as the exaggeration of my facial expression (you'll need it to make some of the sounds in this book).<br /><br />As a comparison, we also have Sandra Boynton's [[ASIN:067144901X Moo Baa La La La]] (which is a lovely book). I can see my daughter is interested when I mimic the animal voices from Moo Baa La La La, but seldom does she laugh like when I read this \\"Moo!\\" book.<br /><br />The only downside is that a few sounds are a bit challenging; for example, eek eek of the squeaky shoe, grum grum of the chewing gum, and splatt splatt of the lightning. I can never make them right. But I don't think my daughter mind it, as least for now. :)

B0054N73EY|5.0|Short and sweet: buy this album if you're a fan of the Chili Peppers. This is a fantastic album. I had my doubts, as many fans did, about the loss of John Frusciante. John contributed so much to the band and he was such a creative force. It was almost inconceivable that they could carry on without him. Trust me when I say that Josh is an amazing guitar player. He fits in with the rest of the band so well, it's mind boggling. He isn't John, but he \\"speaks John better than anyone else\\" according to Rick Rubin. You'll notice it too. On \\"I'm With You\\" the Chili Peppers really are a new band. They've reinvented themselves once again while at the same time retaining their classic funk-rock style. It's just awesome. Go out and get it now. It's such a wonderful trip.

0893860220|4.0|This is certainly a classic read in mindful teaching  However ,  does anyone here find him/herself little absent when one returns reality and tries to r achieve his/her goals.    At least, C.C Jung seems to agree with me.   In JUNG-Man and Myth, it writes that Jung once visited India. Jung was thrilled by the richness of the culture and spiritual practice in this land. However , Jung doesn't seem to believe Detachment from Reality. To the opposite, he believes he finds truth and meaning of life \\"by living , not by death.\\" (Chapter 26)  He doesn't seem to be willing to give up the abundance that life has to offer, neither materially nor spiritually.    Going back to my own question- how to deal with your goal in the reality world, while practicing being mindfulness, so far, the best answer I discovered is the following:    \\"\\"Steady in the state of fullness, which shines when all desires are given up, and peaceful in the state of freedom in life, act playfully in the world, O Raghava!\\"  \\"Inwardly free from all desires, dispassionate and detached, but outwardly active in all directions, act playfully in the world, O Raghava!\\"  \\"Free from egoism, with mind detached as in sleep, pure like the sky, ever untainted, act playfully in the world, O Raghava!\\"  \\"Conducting yourself nobly with kindly tenderness, outwardly conforming to conventions, but inwardly renouncing all, act playfully in the world, O Raghava!\\"  \\"Quite unattached at heart but for all appearance acting as with attachment, inwardly cool but outwardly full of fervour, act playfully in the world, O Raghava!\\"    These are words from \\"My Meeting With Ramana Maharshi\\" by By Mercedes De Acosta, who is a Hollywood screenwriter and social commentator.    What is your take on this subject?   Can't wait to see your input.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Title: Shutter Island  Author: Dennis Lehane  Genre: Psychological thriller  Publishing Information: April 6, 2004 by HarperTorch    Where I got it: Borders liquidation sale    One sentence: In 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando from Ashecliffe mental hospital on Shutter Island, only to find that he is somehow connected.     Themes: Mystery, detective, psychological thriller,     Main character: 3.5/5  Teddy Daniels was an intriguing, well-rounded character. Lehane dropped in so many additional details and quirks that created additional layers and made Teddy complex. His relationship with his wife was particularly revealing, although I wish I would have seen more interaction of him with his children.    Secondary characters: 3/5  Chuck was a fun secondary character, providing some comic relief while still moving the plot forward. He was a good foil to Teddy, and definitely helped to make clear the roles and limits of each character. I became confused with the many doctors around, and kept mixing them up, so I wish their personalities were clearer.     Writing style: 4/5  While I can't call Lehane's writing fast-paced, it definitely kept my interest. The writing was remarkable and descriptive; the action fascinating and entertaining. Lehane was incredibly skilled at leading the audience along his plotline, pulling them along with his twists and turns until they finally reach the ending.     Plot: 4.5/5  One major disappointment for me was that I watched the movie before reading the book, so I pretty much knew what was going to happen. One thing that I liked better from the movie (which is saying something, because the movie wasn't very good), was the spooky aspect that was incorporated in (or at least shown in the previews). That was sadly missed in the novel, which focused more on the mystery part. However, I adored the premise, and the twists kept me guessing throughout.     Ending: 5/5  Superblydone, fantastic in both execution and action. I can't tell you anything more except I adored it.     Best scene: The ending, hands down. Didn't see it coming.     Positives: Well-rounded main character, writing style, plot and premise    Negatives: Less than perfect cast of secondary characters,     First Line: I haven't laid my eyes on the island in several years.    Cover: My version had Leo and scenes from the movie, which was a little disappointing, but it still evoked the feel it needed to.    Verdict: A thrilling and thought-provoking psychological thriller that left me wanting to read more from Lehane in the future.     Rating: 8 / 10
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I like the immature quality of the presentation. The person to person quality makes finding a solution to the destruction of the environment seem dramatically imperative.   I almost hope the stories are not real but the illustrations/videos give a very truthful,hopeless feeling about the future of our country and its people.   Perhaps the rest of the world is already suffering from this environmental destruction by the liberation of all that \\"clean, natural gas\\".  Ruby
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Totally cute and entertaining movie.  The younger set will thouroughly enjoy this one.  Appropriate for every age group even the little ones.

1582701709|5.0|I did not know much about the book prior to purchasing.  This book has a great message that is easy to read.  I want to see the movie that it is apparently based upon (I did not know this prior to purchase).  The Secret is to think positively about everything.  The message is similar to the message of Eckard Tolle.
0345529057|3.0|This is one of the few books I've read where the TV series is better than the book.    The series is written in a style that I find very tedious: long, drawn out narrative descriptions of what people are wearing and what the place around them looks like, with relatively little dialog, and even less real action. The books could easily be edited down to a third of their length, and would be much more enjoyable that way (not unlike what they did for the TV series).    The author also loves to introduce new characters, often for no reason that adds anything to the story. There are regularly entire chapters where he introduces multiple new characters per page (often with unpronounceable names).    Overall, although I enjoyed the underlying story, I found the books too verbose and drawn-out, and wasn't able to finish the series. My wife had the same reaction; she did get through them, but only by skimming large sections.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Unfortunately I have to side with those saying the app doesn't work.

Still nothing! The app says \\"updating\\" and just sits there.    Would probably be a great app if it worked as advertised.    In the mean time: Uninstalled!

B005HJAOLY|4.0|Starting at an abandoned rest stop, Mile 81 embodies a distinctly haunted/ghoulish feel with an air of suspense on prolonged tension before turning into something altogether different. Echoes `From a Buick 8' and `Christine' can be heard over searing screams of blood curdling fury and hopelessness as an entity in the form a seemingly haunted car victimises good Samaritans along I-95. While short, Mile 81 hits all the right notes in terms of pacing, character depth, and pure horror. The murder scenes alone are worth the price of admission - coupled with the excerpt of 11.22.63, this ebook exclusive is value for money entertainment - 4 stars.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|It's a great app. It does what it says it does and more. People putting bad rep on this app are people either living in Alaska or in the boonies.   Just because it doesn't work on your cheap phone doesn't mean the app is garbage. This app works great on 3 different phone I have.    Great app with a lot of info. I use the barometric pressure scale since I get migraines and this tells me when one can be around the corner.
0812550706|5.0|I am not a fanboy of any book series but I must give praise where its due. Ender's Game (though similar to Heinlein's Starship Troopers) is a quick, self-contained, and well written tale of groups of intelligent children, deviously manipulated by adults for the sake of mankind's survival. The book deviates from Starship also in its conception of morality; at times you simply have no idea who really is \\"good\\" and who is \\"evil\\" but all the while you will be rooting for Ender.    I was able to finish this in about 10 hours, and don't be fooled by its focus on children, this is not necessarily a book for children. The themes and situations Ender encounters are vicious and they are serious, but they all make for a phenomenal novel. This is simply an immense work of fiction and I'm glad I was able to get to it after pushing it off for nearly a decade.    I strongly recommend...however after reading this book, I am hesitant about the quality of its sequels.
B005GIS7GK|5.0|Great movie with lots of references to other similar movies. Funny and entertaining...streaming is the best thing I've done in a while.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|the app's GUI is the best in class without question. my only Annoyance is the way the radar loads...it should zoom into my location and load that area instead of the entire country...takes a Long time to load.  the notifications are great and I'm very glad you can turn them off.
B000001E21|5.0|Not many people talk or know about the songs on this album. Correction, they do know about the soft, made for radio songs, like \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", and \\"Two Steps Behind.\\" The others were written off as b side songs, and songs that couldn't cut it on other albums like Hysteria and Adrenalize. The truth is, these songs that got scrapped, because Mutt Lange (producer) came back on board. He cut these songs, not because they weren't good, but because they were dark songs. Hysteria was upbeat. Songs like \\"Run Riot\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Shotgun\\" (from the Hysteria album) are good songs, but they are not better than \\"Desert Song\\", and \\"Fractured Love.\\" I'm sure Mutt thought these songs would have no chance of airplay, because they're dark, and kind of lengthy. He was right, but in no way does that mean these songs are mediocre.     If you listen to these songs for the first time, your going to like them right away. You might even be blown away by them. Another song that really stands out is \\"Ring Of Fire\\", which was put on a b side record. No this isn't a cover of Johnny Cash's song with the same title. This song is very catchy, and pretty heavy for Def Leppard. Basically, it rocks! Now if the rest of the songs are just average, this cd would probably be worth buying for the Def Leppard fan, but it doesn't stop there. Another song almost as good as \\"Ring of Fire\\", is \\"Ride Into the Sun.\\" It's also hard and catchy, somewhat like \\"Riding on the Wind\\" by Judas Priest. And yet again, another good song equal to \\"Ride Into the Sun\\" is \\"She's Too Tough\\". And another hard driven song \\"Action\\" is good enough to make any of Def Leppard's best albums.    So I mentioned all the great hard driven songs, but there are a couple, that aren't the typical Def Leppard sounding songs, but yet they are both good. \\"Only After Dark\\" was a song done by someone else, but is a pretty cool song the way Def Leppard does it. It does have Def Leppards familiar background harmonies, but Joe Elliot does some changing of the vocals. He sings a little deeper and it works well. Then there is \\"From the Inside\\" which is a very dark song about drugs. It's got some different string instruments in it, which sounds cool. It's all ochrastrated nicely, and I think their are some guest musicians on it. Some people might not care for the song, but it's a song that critics would give good ratings. Like movies, the critics always like different, or original. And finally there is \\"I Want To Be Your Hero\\", which starts off slow, but picks up. I could see this song being a top 20 hit if it was released as a single, but it wasn't. I really like this song, but I think chics will dig it more. It's one of those songs that Joe Elliot's voice comes off as emotional, that will have chics reassuring that Joe Elliot is dreamy, and guy's wishing they could tough girls (women) heart the way Joe does.    And the other two songs are \\"Two Steps Behind\\" electric guitar version, and \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" piano version. So if you heard and like these songs, this is a bonus for you. If I had to rank all the Def Leppard cd's/albums, in which I own all the ones except X,and Yeah! I would rank this one probably 4th best. Only High 'N Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria, are better imo. Believe me, I hate puting some money down on a cd, because I heard a couple songs that I really like, and then after buy the album find out the rest doesn't live up. This one will, I promise you. It will be a pleasant surprise, trust me.
B004GYY714|5.0|It is a must have. If I miss an episode of Says You on the weekend I just find a station somewhere else that is playing it and I am good to go. It has broadened my tastes and gives me easy access to almost every radio station or streaming source in the world.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I like almost everything about this app. It is stylish, provides a lot of information, and gives you many customizable widgets. Other reviewers seem to have an issue with the radar loading. The radar loaded fast for me. The only minor issue I had was not being able to clear the alerts.
030788743X|5.0|NO SPOILERS    This book was well written with an interesting twist on both the \\"high-tech future\\" and the \\"brink of apocolypse\\" types of books.  The main character is so relatable, and you will find yourself searching along side him.  You will puzzle with him as he deciphers clues, you will celebrate his victories, and mourn his defeats.  One of the most interesting \\"realistic\\" sci-fi books I've read in a while.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This has become my favorite adaptation of the novel, I have seen thus far.  I have loved the novel since I read it back in high school and have re-read the book many times, watching the movies always make me do this.  The story falls very much in the novel and the few things that they changed just enhance the story me.  This to me is one of the best films that captures the relationship between Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre.  The dialogues they exchange and the beauty of how their relationship evolves.  The watcher really sees the chemistry and how Jane & Edward play off each other the dialogues are wonderful, you see two people see the other for what they truly are and love them all the same.  Yes, I know there is no bedroom scene after the failed marriage, in the book, but I think it actually captures the essence of their relationship and how difficult it was for the two to separate and the turmoil and anxiety that arises at the thoughts of separation.  In the book, the characters do hold a grand passion for one another and it evident all the way through their relationship.  I don't mind the shortness of the early years of Jane's life and the time she spends at Rivers and his family, the movie still captures the essence of those times in the scenes that it shows.  Everyone who has read Jane Eyre will always see their ideas play out in there head and how the characters look, feel and develop, so each version has it own good points, but to me this version is the one that follows closest to how I felt and saw the characters when I first read the book so long ago.  That is one of the best things about reading, each person envisions their own world and perceptions which may not correspond with an adaptation but that is what makes movies create their own story.  I have seen and have owned several different adaptations and for me this was definitely one of the best in my opinion, but each fan must find their own.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Don't listen to all the George Lusas and Star Wars bashers. No one is \\"raping your childhood\\" or destroying your old copies of the saga you already own. This is more than just editing a few scenes or adding lines...it's 40 hours of never before seen footage of, the making of and complete remastering of the films. If you like Star Wars then buy this Blu Ray collection. If not, then don't buy it...It's that simple.

B004AKCMD4|5.0|Being a bird lover and fantasy buff, I greatly enjoyed this movie.  The first thing which struck me was the jaw-dropping graphics and animation - some of the best I have seen in recent digitally animated films.  The voice actors do a great job for their character's role, although Soren's voice did get a little annoying at times - funny because he is the main character.  The story was fun to watch unfold and entertained me even though there were really no new concepts explored - the characters and story are typical for fantasy/adventure titles. I love how the owls move and act realistically for what you would expect for talking warrior birds. This movie is a little darker themed, which for me was an interesting and almost refreshing change from watching other overly cheery/happy digitally animated movies of it's kind.  A caution to parents with kids under eight though - depending on the child, they may not be able to handle some of the battle scenes and strong character conflicts which occur later during the film. Personally I loved the battle scenes - they are very well directed and amazing to watch.  The owls fight fiercely and simply use crafted helmets and metal claws; which once you see it looks more realistic than it sounds.  Some people love it, some people hate it - I give it a 9 out of 10.  Although it is full of under-developed characters and has a usual 'good warriors versus bad warriors' plot with plenty of cliches thrown in, it has become one of my favorites (even though I am normally very annoyed by cliched movies) and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy stories, owls, or spectacular digital effects.

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|There are more than just a few films out there with a protagonist who does not know who he or she is. Simple films like Bourne, Unknown, or Hanna, keep coming down the action thriller pike, each one seemingly unaware of the others redundantly derivative existence, all stumbling over one another. First of all much older great films like The Manchurian Candidate & Seconds, as well as more recent fantastic films like, The Matrix, Momento, and The Others already exist so one might assume from the rehashing more recent amnesia/who am I films that keep coming out that all the good ideas are already taken. After watching Dark City you will know that it is possible to tell a unique amnesia/ who am I story with a strong protagonist and still be original. Dark City is not new but is does stand the test of time and can sit on the very short list of best amnesia films ever made. It is science fiction but it is also a film noir piece and the blending of genres here stands alone as a diamond in the rough. The character has a past that gnaws at him. This propels his actions and choices. He also posesses powers that he does not understand. All this and a whole lot more make Dark City a must see film that only gets better with time.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|would love to write a review on black Sabbath's heaven and hell but I am still waiting to receive it, having previously owned the album I can make comment that it's great and hope it would be too much longer. next time I'll order from local record shop
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|Slight spoilers... Nothing major... As with many films nowadays I simply rented this because I have little time to see everything I want to in the theatre. I was floored by what I saw. I knew nothing of this story and, thankfully too, as this film has some dark secrets. As I was watching I was even wondering if this was about to become a vampire film. This gothic style  film comes about as close as possible to being a  horror film without actually being one. It was gorgeously photographed, well acted, and had a beautiful score that I grabbed the very same night I rented the film. The main character Jane Eyre is a fully realized and entirely complete character. Her past history is shown along the way, as most of the film is a flashback. Despite her harsh upbringing she manages to retain her integrity along the way. So often I expected her to snap and take revenge on some witch  of a character along the way but instead she retains her composure and remains true to herself and beliefs. She does snap once as a kid. This film has a religious undercurrent and subtleties regarding love that may not be for everyone. This is a love story but it is also a film about our stations in life and how just being true to oneself is all we need ever be. I watched it twice in one night and think this is one of the best films I have seen all year. It is one of the best period films i have seen in a very long time and right up there with Barry Lyndon and some Merchant Ivory films. Also, for anyone who loves films with strong, well realized female main characters this is the film for you.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|This is a wonderful double CD. Some of the numbers are live and some are 'demo' songs. \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" is just great. If you love Amy, jazz or blues...invest in this CD.
B0051T46XM|5.0|This is a B movie that knows it's a B movie and uses that knowledge about itself to create an entirely original and enjoyable film. The craft and self reflection of this homage to lowbrow films is incredible here. The fact that it is not an American film but a subtitled foreign one only adds to it's uniqueness. I'm sure Hollywood will remake this, poorly, ASAP. I rented this one night and enjoyed it so much I kept checking to see if Apple TV had it for sale ahead of the DVD release. This is a popcorn film and is just there to entertain, not with any grand points, or hidden meanings,  but with pure schlock fun. The SFX were surprisingly above par for a film like this too. This is Cloverfield/Blair Witch but with trolls.  Take your thinking caps off for what, in my opinion, was one of the most enjoyable drive-in style films to come along in a long while.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Can't figure out where Denver, CO is. Says &quot;location must be in the United States.&quot; Was the Amazon Free Pay App of the day... and over priced at half that price.
B001AOKA3W|2.0|Unfortunately, this movie missed the mark more than I had envisioned, even considering the poor reviews. The characters and the decisions they make are fairly unrealistic given the scenario at hand. There are MANY technical mistakes. The ending and key moments leading up to it are extremely predictable (e.g. the story leaves much to be desired). There are a number of \\"cheesy horror\\" moments that serve no purpose except to be slavish to the genre. At least the camera work was mildly interesting, though.    In short, if you want to see a cheesy horror film in the vein of The Blair Witch project, and you don't mind turning off your brain, you might partially enjoy this film. I did not.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I compared this app with the weather channel and it is dead on. I'm on a Droid x and find this app to be more informative than the other. The numerous options and widgets are a plus. No problems with install. I found that when I first loaded it the temp reading was 2 degrees off, but that was for the city that was ten miles away. I used GPS to dial it into my locationand it adjusted for the 2 degrees. Play around with it before giving it a bad review.
0670022411|4.0|This book is a combination between the Twilight series and the Stieg Larson girl with the dragon tatoo series. The story is complex with lots of things going on and its slow to draw you in, but once you're in you're committed, and eagerly flipping from page to page trying to get to the good parts which pop up often enough to keep you reading.There is the abstinence factor but this isnt some bodice ripper, you dont need the sex to carry the story..the relationship is fine without it. Very compelling story, but yeah probably written more for women..i have a feeling the next book will be less about the romance and more about all the other things at play with the supernatural warring. anyway loved the book and cant wait for the next one... the only reason it didnt get all the stars because the beginning dragged and there are some slow bits
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Hi The CD came on time was as stated and no scratches was happy to get and listen to thanks
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|I liked the book but not as much as the first two books. Even from the beginning I knew it was going to be different. Apparently Christopher Paolini wanted to give more depth to the characters' lives but in the end I just got bored with it. There was a lot of running between places without any action inbetween just talking to himself or to whoever was with the character at the time. Like others have said I could have gone without so much detail into how to become a dwarf king and there Gods. Like Eragon really needed to know these things to survive all that went on. I just hope the next book has the same length but without the useless characters lives. I like learning about Eragon, Saphira, Roran, Arya and maybe even Orik. Just not learning about their religions and how to become one of them. I'm more like Saphira where it's just one track mind at a time, eat and kill and Eragon, she doesn't care to hear about how somebody is going to become something or be punished some certain way. I'm not saying to avoid the book but just keep in mind you'll be reading a lot and forgetting most. I remember the fights and few talks between a few characters and more about Eragon's family. Then there's the meditation which took multiple pages. I might read it again but skim a lot of pages that made it drag. I'll read the first two book ten times more than this one is all I can say. It's worth buying to complete the series but only few parts are worth knowing for the next book I bet.

I've never seen my Mom hide behind a pillow like she did with this movie!  Great story line, keeps you on your toes from beginning till the very end.  left it open ended for more, so hopefully they do(they more additional paranormal activity and the was the worst movie I've seen)!
B0053F042G|4.0|With all the so-so (at best) movies out lately I was happily suprised that Source Code was actually a pretty good watchable movie that made sense.  It had some Inception-type moments (I hated Inception) but they were well developed and were consistent with the plot line.  Source Code also borrowed a theme from Star Trek TOS episode \\"The Menagerie\\" were Captain Pike who was badly injured in active duty was able to enjoy life in another dimension.  Overall a good movie-I might even buy it on bluray.

Detailing the century old flaws in how players are evaluated and chosen, Lewis describes how Beane turned the baseball world upside down.

B001OGWY1W|2.0|Toward the end of this (Seemingly very) long movie, The Joker talks about how he's an agent of Chaos, the foil of those who make plans.    He himself doesn't make plans, you see.    Except he does, continually, throughout this movie.  From the opening sequence, we see extremely detailed plans being enacted, apparently only to foil the plans of those who.. make plans.  Oh, and to scare people.  In hopes that by doing so, chaos is created.    Something like that...    This seemed like lazy writing to me.       I enjoyed Ledger's performance, though it seemed a bit lacking in depth.    So, who IS The Joker, where did he come from, what makes him tick?   We don't know.      Backstory for the main villian wasn't as important as one of the excessive number of scenes featuring the various gangs, apparently.       There were just SO many scenes that were simply not pertinent to the story.     As long as this movie was, smooth transitions from scene to scene, and adequate build up to plot items like Dent's becoming \\"a bad guy\\"  were simply lacking.        So it ends up feeling like a disjointed, quickly thrown together mismash of goals and ideas, with the Joker's apparent desire for chaos being used to explain one sorta random, unbelievable and violent scene after the next.       While it was quite impressive to look at, it lacked substance.    Was it really just a 3 hour long lead up to Gotham PD declaring batman public enemy # 1, so as to set up the 3rd movie?      Not sure what else the point of it could have been.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|Lenny Kravitz has returned with a killer album featuring his soulful vocals over some really high quality and memorable songs. Half of the songs on this album represent some of the absolute best material he has ever created and the rest is still very good. The production is really excellent and balances raw groove with just enough polish to make the songs come alive. The musical styles on this album are very eclectic featuring funk, rock, ballads, and some electronic sounds but they all mesh into a really satisfying musical experience. The flow of the album is really good too with lots of style changes at just the right time. Highlights include the retro 70's infused funk of \\"Black And White America\\", the awesome horns in \\"Come And Get It\\", the sexy flavour of \\"Liquid Jesus\\", the electro groove of \\"Superlove\\", the great chorus of \\"Everything\\", the nightclub feel of \\"Looking Back On Love\\", the amazing whistling ostinato of \\"Sunflower\\", and \\"Dream\\" which is one of the best ballads Kravitz has ever done. Black And White America is a killer album that is essential listening for all Lenny Kravitz fans and is also highly recommended to fans of Jamiroquai and Prince. Glad to have the rocking Lenny Kravitz back!

B0054N73EY|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers return with their great new album featuring a new guitarist and a very eclectic set of songs that showcase a band in top form despite a changed lineup. I'm With You is a solid album that contains everything the Chili Peppers are known for including their funky bass lines, solid drumming, and cool vocal rhymes. The band might be in a transition period due to the new guitarist but this album is very strong and definitely sounds like a fan pleaser. Highlights include the catchy opener \\"Monarchy Of Roses\\", the rocking hooks of \\"Ethiopia\\", the great groove of \\"Look Around\\", the awesome sound of \\"Did I Let You Know\\", and the amazing performance of \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" which is the best song on the album. There are less guitar solos than usual but the songs are not affected as the band gels together to produce one of the best rock albums of the year. The last time there was a change in guitar players the result was the amazing album One Hot Minute and although I'm With You doesn't reach the same level of uniqueness it is still highly recommended to all fans who have been enjoying what the Chili Peppers have been doing over the past 20 years. On a side note, the album cover is very cool...

B0052UZIFA|3.0|PvZ is simply a fun game. Having played both the PC and Xbox Live Arcade versions however, this one feels inferior. The graphics are downgraded to run on slower phones but theres no option to change the resolution. Stretched widescreen looks terrible and there is no zen garden either....<br />On the plus side... using the touchscreen is a lot of fun and makes the gane feel fresh even after you have played it on other platforms. And having a passable port of a great popcorn game is better than a perfect adaption of something thats no fun. Plants vs Zombies is one of those rare gems of a game that appeals to everyone - young. old. gamers. non gamers. If you havent tried it yet, this is a steal of a price and perfect for on the go fun.

1932907009|5.0|Save the Cat! is a really nifty, useful, fun, easy to read, obvious, deep handbook on screen writing.  It inspired me to continue after several years ago having abandoned all hope.  It has helped me understand other (more oblique, less capable) authors in the \\"how to write\\" field, thus adding to their value.  I may try creating a novel by adapting, stretching and warping the tips in STC.  Or not.  Sad that the author is no longer with us...  Hands down, this is the best \\"how to write\\" piece that I have come across in the past 10 years.  And that includes JC's hero's journey, and offshoots.  Computerwise, I selected \\"Movie Outline 3\\" instead of the Cat software.  Appears MO3 can easily contain all you're gonna need from Save the Cat!, plus a little more.
B005DC68NI|5.0|So I won a copy of David Gaughran's Let's Get Digital via a giveaway, and let me just say, if you are even considering taking the Indie-plunge, this book is a fast must-read. It will save you a lot of trial-by-fire mistakes and keep you from wasting hours combing the 'net for the best tips on publishing your first book.<br /><br />This book is chock-full of tips to help the first time indie author, but the schooling doesn't just apply to Newbs. I've been at this for a while now, and I could have skipped hours of research by getting this book. And even novice publisher's like me will gain a few ideas to take their career to the next level. As an added bonus, included are features from numerous successful and up-and-coming Indie Authors.<br /><br />Let's face it... as a virgin Indies, we not only browse for tips and information, but we also look for the tiniest sliver of promise within the \\"success stories\\" of the industry. This book delivers on all counts, and I can see a time in the near future when Let's Get Digital will become the first stop for all those that consider bypassing the legacy publishing system by taking control of their own destiny. So what are you waiting for? Go check it out!
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Like many others, the app won't get a location fix by GPS.  However, using the city choice list, the app did start reporting weather info, but only after about 20 minutes of me messing around with the settings.  I had also tried the zip code & map selection methods, which gave no results, though I didn't give them the 20 minutes of attention.  Also, adding new locations seems hit-or-miss.  New York, NY would load, while Orlando, FL would not.<br /><br />As far as being able to move the app to the SD card:  Since it has widgets, I doubt that will ever be an option.  It would be nice though, an app using 5.63 of internal storage is a bit of a porker.<br /><br />I did find the app's internal error logging (go to \\"Options\\", and select \\"Report\\").  There's some interesting stuffing doing on.  Having programmed for the Android platform myself, all I can say is that this app needs work.  I'm giving the app 2 stars (instead of 1), because I did eventually get the app up and running.  HTC EVO 4G with Gingerbread (2.3.3)).<br /><br />Hopefully, the problems can be fixed.  I'm going to uninstall, but I'd be willing to give an update a chance.<br /><br />Update: The GPS location did work once, but only after sitting for a half-hour.  Though, this is not enough for me to chance my rating.
1401201911|1.0|Really, what a truly imaginative and interesting concept, the Last Son of Krypton falls not in middle American Kansas but rather in a Ukrainian farm collective circa 1930's. This setup gave the authors an great opportunity to examine the debate between nature and nurture, how different societies view justice and heroism, in addition to being a great artistic platform to survey and reinterpret the graphic designs of the USSR.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story falls far short of its potential. It starts out with promise as Superman is touted by Stalin as an unstoppable Soviet weapon in the Cold War contrasted with Superman's reservations about becoming a political figure and symbol. However, it then slowly devolves into a Randian battle between Superman and Lex Luthor.<br /><br />In terms of the art, while there are some great pieces, especially the hammer and sickle Superman emblem, and some cool propaganda posters here and there overall the art misses the mark. The art team felt that simply using lots of red was sufficient to give the images a Soviet flair.<br /><br />Go elsewhere for revisionist superheros.

B0058EBNAO|1.0|Failed to update on my galaxy s. Obviously needs work. I like the fact that they try to pack all of the said features into one app, nut it has to work first of all! whack!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Like the app! but how do u disable the notifications in the notification bar? All the options r for the actual app itself...

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Some parts of this very sad book made my stomach churn. It made me angry. How she endured this perverts sick demented ways is simply a miracle. No little girl should ever have to endure this. When my now 13 yr old daughter disappeared one afternoon at age 4 while playing with another neighbor girl I was beyond consolable. The most terrible thoughts came to me.Thankfully I got my daughter back a couple of hours later. She had taken a \\"trek\\" to local park that had a pond and was going to sleep in the woods with her friend and look for bears. The pond!!!! OMG! I still shudder to think of the newspaper headlines later had they not been found. Also to note: she walked 2 miles barefoot holding a miniature ceramic teaset that even made it home unchipped and unbroken. Before they disappeared, every couple of minutes I called out to them under the livingroom window and asked how they were, the next time I checked....POoF! They were gone! It happens fast! Her mother has been through hell too. I'm glad she got her baby back; it just took too long to find Jaycee.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Great product that works as advertised.  I've ripped all my CDs to thumb drive and needed a way to play them in two cars.  I use the FM transmitter in the car and it's fairly strong, but sound quality is not quite as good as using the aux out port and connecting directly to your head unit.  Can be difficult to find a clean frequency when driving around major metro areas.  I use the aux output for my other vehicle to connect directly to the factory stereo and the sound quality is excellent.
B002IVLH60|2.0|People are going to love me for this, but Pearl Jam is a shadow of their former selves. The fantastic compositions are not as precious as they once were, and it sounds as if the band is simply trying to be punk rockers, in a mid-life crisis, if you will.<br /><br />I don't have to explain the music because You Tube is riddled with the songs from Backspacer and any curious listener can log on and listen.<br /><br />Many people fall into the camp of \\"never good as they once were, there's nothing like the old pearl jam\\" people. I am not one of those. Pearl Jam has done some great work since the closure of the 90s, but it is dispersed so finely between several records that one can hardly consider an entire album since then a modern classic.<br /><br />The PJ of the 90's is not the same PJ of today. And it bothers me how people can say the new album sounds like \\"Yield and No Code mixed into one, with a bit of Versus\\". This is just fairy dust from the die-hard fans, trying to pump some air into the new records, and believe that the new stuff is like a powerful mixture of everything great the band has achieved. The new record(s) do not sound like Yield. Yield sounds like Yield. The record(s) do not sound like No Code and Vitalogy mixed together; No Code and Vitalogy are two seperate albums, over a decade old. Some of the formulas may be similar - but this is an entirely different sounding band in a different era making different music.<br /><br />Die-hards will continue to be just that - fans that will die hard. Nothing will upset them except the splitting of the band.<br /><br />Pearl Jam will continue to make music - not music that sounds like Ten, music that sounds like whatever they are concocting next. And I believe Pearl Jam will still continue to play killer concerts, because they have always been a spectacular live band.<br /><br />Until PJ do something phenomenal, however, I will continue to believe that they are a wonderful legend of the 90s, a casualty to the millenium.
1401307957|5.0|It is an exciting book to find yourself adventuring through from page one. You will find yourself immersed within seconds in the images Danny Gregory the artist has painted through his books combined with his handwritten story throughout.

B001QXE0OC|4.0|I bought this album last year in August, because I wanted to see if Selena Gomez & The Scene's music was so great like people said, and seems they were right, this album is very good and I like listening to it. This is not their best effort, if you want to try even better music by them, try their more recent efforts like A Year Without Rain or When The Sun Goes Down. Now onto this album, it's not their best album, but it's definitely great for what it's supposed to be, a debut album.    Songs review:    1. Kiss & Tell: 10/10 This is a great song to start the album, it could have been a better lead single than Falling Down, but well...    2. I Won't Apologize: 9/10 The first song on which Selena has collaborated writing, and the only one she co-wrote on the album, is a cute song, about her ex Nick Jonas from the Jonas Brothers, but is not as great as the other songs on the album.    3. Falling Down: 9.5/10 I like this song a lot, this is the album's lead single. As I've said previously, the title track could have been a better lead single, but this song still works.    4. I Promise You: 8.5/10 I remember when I first heard this song I just loved it, but now I think it's just ok, cute song but after listening to more recent songs like this I think this is a good effort but not the best.    5. Crush: 10/10 I have to admit that this song is addictive, I love the beats.    6. Naturally: 10/10 The album's second single and the song that definitely marked the band's career and deserves automatically a 10/10, it sounds very mysterious and is the sound Selena chose to use in her following albums with The Scene.    7. The Way I Loved You: 10/10 This ballad is beautiful, I think it should have been the album's third and final single before Round & Round from the second album.    8. More: 10/10 This is one of my favorites, great lyrics and great beats.    9. As A Blonde: 9/10 Before this song arrived to Selena & The Scene, this song belonged to Fefe Dobson and was going to be in her album Sunday Love, but then when she got out of Island Records, the album was cancelled and the song was given to Selena some years later, and made it onto this album. I personally think the lyrics aren't very awesome, and that Selena's vocals aren't that great either, but it's still a decent song.    10. I Don't Miss You At All: 10/10 This is as well one of my favorites, I like how at the end it gets acoustic, a great sound, I think this sound fits the band and they should try it again some time.    11. Stop & Erase: 9.5/10 Some people may think they're listening to I Won't Apologize going faster, but it's actually this song, which is nice, but maybe should be in another place of the tracklisting.    12. I Got U: 10/10 This is my favorite song on the album, Selena's vocals sound awesome here and musically it's just awesome.    13. Tell Me Something I Don't Know (New Version): 8.5/10 I personally think this song shouldn't have been on the album, the original mix is better than this remix, but anyway, it is what it is.    So that's it, I think. This album is a great debut for Selena Gomez & The Scene, but their following albums are even better, so you should try them out, but I think this album is still worth getting.

B000006YCU|5.0|I draw a lot of criticism for my view that the first three Dream Theater CD's contained a direction and vision that I wish the band had never strayed from.  I myself have been listening since 1992 and so I'm not exactly a n00b when it comes to this band.  I get the feeling that a lot of people that praise some of the later DT albums that I don't like are newer fans who weren't brought up familiar with the style of music Dream Theater plays/used to play.  I say that distinctly because I was very disappointed when I felt that the band started to move away from the more innovative and magical writing (both musically and lyrically) to a more standard, commercial sound that even seems to have drawn from nu-metal at times!  I think that is just atrocious for a band with as much talent and pizazz as Dream Theater.    OK, let me get down to the nitty gritty-- On this record, you are going to find song structures that are similar to those on Images and Words, and Awake.  These first three albums are the ones that I feel truly captured that magic that this band can bring to a record, and a live performance.  If you think the technical aspect of the band's music, or the melody or songwriting somehow leaves more to be desired here, then perhaps you just aren't married to DT's original sound like I am.  Performed flawlessly, with great fineness, and leaving the listener with a sense of wonder, I definitely rate this as one of the best three Dream Theater CDs of all time.  Another thing I love about it is the style of lyrical structure which eventually changed over the years.  I did not like, for instance, the uber-introspective and philosophical nature of Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory.  I also was horrified at what I saw as a move away from progressive metal and closer to the mainstream.    I want to touch briefly on the vocals here because I'm sure some people claim that this album isn't what it could be without LaBrie and I think that just couldn't be further from thetruth.  Charlie Dominici is just fantastic on this record IMO and delivers each song just great, with a great range and delivery.  Don't get me wrong; I have always loved LaBrie's work and I still do.  But Dominici is just fine on this record.  As far as the musical songwriting and execution of those parts, if you loved the albums that followed this one, you should love this one too.  Great work on everyone's part here and if you know DT at all, you know what I mean.    So in closing, I think When Dream and Day Unite is just highly overlooked and underrated and really does serve as a great stepping stone for what was to come after.  If you a real and true lover of the band, I don't know how you cannot have this record in your collection.  It is sure to please again and again.
0061714402|5.0|I have always been fascinated by the story behind Megadeth, particularly the history and timeline of band members who were hired and fired (and rehired and fired again!). If you spend a lot of time reading threads in forums about, for example, Nick Menza's departure from the band and David Ellefson's court case with Mustaine, this book will clear things up nicely. The dynamics between each band member was really interesting to me, including the link between Mustaine and Metallica. I was also very impressed by how candid and transparent Dave is about his drug problems, marriage problems, feuds with band members etc. He openly admits his mistakes, gives credit to people where it is due and is very diplomatic in describing the relationships he had with some people in the business. For example, he speaks very highly of the Drover brothers and describes the positive influence those guys had on the band. He also described how he was always very fond of Marty and Nick but could never get those guys to gel with the dynamics of Megadeth. I thought he was very fair and impartial about all of this stuff and now respect him more than ever.    I also read the new chapter that describes Dave's reunion with his old band mates and friends in the 'big 4' including his reuniting of Ellefson in the band, this really rounded the story off and turned this into a truly inspirational read.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've gotten to the point that I don't expect much from the faotd, but I love this weather app! It's got a lot of customization features, I can choose between classic, symbol, and photo icons; when I  modify the primary location (click the ... button) I can choose static position, cell location only, or using gps and cell location; I can also choose measurements that I prefer to use.   This app even gives me measurements and information that I'd never expect, I've never seen a weather app with earthquake information before, it lists where the earthquake was, the strength, and tells me how many miles from me it is (which can be adjusted to only show earthquakes within a limited range). I'm quite surprised that minor earthquakes are so common.   Unlike most weather apps I've tried so far, this gives me more of the information that I'm looking for; such as radar, rain chance, and forecast without having to navigate to the website. Really love that clock too, I've never seen anything like that before.   All of that being said, I wish the app was prettier, give it some beautiful animations similar to what came stock on my HTC sensation, and this will become my main weather widget.
0316776963|5.0|This is a great book.<br /><br />1. It can be read in a few hours.<br />2. It can be read out of order (all the chapters are a number of self-contained vignettes).<br />3. The writer is genuinely funny. This book actually came up based on a recommendation from other books that I had purchased off of Amazon.com (\\"I Was Told There'd Be Cake\\" and \\"I Don't Care About Your Band\\"), both of which were categorically NOT funny. This book was a rare success.<br />4. There was a lot of good insight into the characters. For example: He talked about working for a Communist (a genuine Working Communist), but then made a very relevant comparison to Idiot Communists At University (who seem to think that \\"after the revolution comes they will be the ones holding the clipboards\\").<br />5. The author has a great way with words (in spite of his claiming to have an IQ that, if it were translated into dollars, would \\"be enough to buy a few buckets of fried chicken\\") that draw ones interest and form great visual images.<br /><br />There are lots of copies of the book available, but even in there weren't this book would be worth buying new.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000001FMX|5.0|Along with the Velvet Underground, the MC5 and the Stooges, the New York Dolls' debut album provides a blueprint for the foundations of the burgeoning Punk Scene that was brimming from within New York, Detroit and Los Angeles, and while the group were destined for failure in the commercial acceptance of the masses, this stunning debut record remains an unsung classic of the genre. The sound of the Dolls' is definitely good time rock and roll, albeit from a rawer, street-cred and grittier origin. Their appearance as a unit, is also a signal of irony, in that, they mix a sense of androgyny with the hard attack of their collectiveness as a group.     Todd Rundgren produced this record and although some of the members of the band would later dismiss his production credit, I think Rundgren captures the band quite well with what he was handed to work with; the Dolls were anything but a polished and slick band of musicians. David Johansen and Johnny Thunders were sort of a cartoonish caricature image of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Sylvain was the Dolls' mediator and solid rock rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist that provided a balance for the group, and Arthur Kane and Jerry Nolan were the perfect rhythm section that provided an unsteady, yet solid anchor to round out the group's overall sound.     From the opening crash of Personality Crisis to the reckless, breaknecking churn of the album's closer, Jet Boy, this album simply personifies the future of rock music, while also giving an ultimate homage to the simple beginnings of rock and roll itself. The songwriting team of Thunders/Johansen provides ample testimony of the Dolls' repetoire with a couple of Sylvain/Johansen songs, namely Frankenstein and one of the band's anthems Trash and a cover of Bo Diddley's Pills, creating a sound that is direct,simplistic and has a slightly street rouge-ish quality in its intents. Looking For a Kiss, Bad Girl and Subway Train display all of these qualities to the band's dimensionalsound and Johansen's Lonley Planet Boy, one of the \\"lighter\\" songs on this set, also shows a slightly softer approach within the group's collective songcrafts. Thunders and Sylvain's guitars run rampant throughout on numbers like Frankenstein, Jet Boy, Private World, Bad Girl, Pills and Trash, whilst Johansen's vocals careen and throb with excitement, earnestness and unbridled aggression.     Years ago I had checked out the follow-up Too Much Too Soon as a taster for what the Dolls were like, and unfortunately, I was still discovering music at a young age and didn't fully understand or appreciate the overall picture as far as innovation and style were concerned. I rediscovered the Dolls around 2002 and have been a fan ever since!! Its a fair summation that while, all these years later, the Dolls are looked upon as precursors of the punk revolution, it should also be noted that they were responsible for keeping rock music to its basics musically, while lyrically, giving a unique spin on the genre with slapdash varied lyrics of sillyness, snideness, ignorance and innocence all wrapped into an innovative package. No, the Dolls didn't last long in their heyday(despite the \\"re-union\\" of the present day surviving members Johansen/Sylvain led incarnation) and sold few records within their time period, but history has been kind to the Dolls and, with the gift of that history and hindsight, they have been allowed the acknowledgement of adding something to the projection and style to rock music, overall. This record is a garage-band classic in every sense of the word. 5 Huge Stars
0446541478|5.0|The reason that a lot of acadmemics won't like this book is because there is a lot of praise for the military and \\"military-industrial\\" complexes.<br /><br />There are so many things good things that are touched in this book, that I had to think about how to write this review in a readable and useful way.<br /><br />Topics touched on are:<br /><br />1. New Growth Theory. This idea has been argued forcefully by Paul Romer. He has the idea that most future economic growth will be because of intelligent new ways of doing things. The authors explore the role that brainpower has in the success of the Jewish state. That leads us smoothly into the next idea, which is<br /><br />2. The Solow Estimate. It has been estimated that 80% of the growth of the industrial countries over the last couple of hundred years or so has been because of improvements in efficiency and that 20% is because of increases in inputs. (Paul Krguman has taken up the idea that the Asian crisis was because the growth was input driven and not productivity driven. And ditto the same for the Soviet Union many years earlier). Of course, in this paean to Israel, I think you can guess where most of Israeli growth came from-- and it had to come from increases in productivity because resources are scarce for the Jewish state because of its hostile neighbors. That leads smoothly into<br /><br />3. The Resource Curse. A lot of the Arab (and other oil rich) states have not been able to develop alternative sources of growth-- and this is because they are so used to just drilling for their income that they don't need to develop institutions that support the generation of wealth. And so, the Arabs have oil and Israel has salt-- but Israel has come up with a higher GDP per capita *because* they don't have the destruction that comes as a result of \\"the devil's excrement\\" (=oil).<br /><br />4. Military Industrial Complexes. This idea is something that a lot of academics do a lot of whining about (because of the visceral hatred of a lot of academics of the military), but in Israel it serves the fourfold purpose of: assimilating newcomes, teaching people practical skills, creating \\"Men of Action\\" (a la Eric Hoffer), and technology invention (in the context of self-defense against Arab aggression)/ transfer.<br /><br />5. Pioneer Societies. There are countries, like the United States/ Canada/ Australia/ Israel that are essentially pioneer societies. There is (in the early stages at least) not any entrenched bureaucracy against which to fight in order to get things done-- and that can be of great benefit in the process of nation building.<br /><br />6. National Investment policy/ Development Economics/ Incentive Structures. The authors talked about the Yozma program (this is a program that Israel created to figure out how to direct and encourage investment), and they laid bare the clarity of the reasoning and the sheer brainpower that went into making it succesful. The chapter on Yozma could also have been read as an discussion of building the \\"right\\" incentive structures.<br /><br />7. Jewish Indestructibility. They have survived against the odds (as a race) and so has Israel survived against the odds as a nation in the face of a clear and present danger.<br /><br />There were, however, some points in the book that were..... not so good.<br /><br />1. p. 184. \\".....try anything no matter how destabilizing to societal norms.\\" Huh? That doesn't always and everywhere turn out to be a good idea.<br /><br />2. p. 130. The reason that the government (in the US) closed its doors to Jews was not because they were Jews, but because the US didn't want fewer of ANY types of immigrants at that time.<br /><br />3. p. 228 \\".....the greatest contribution of the Jewish people in history is dissatisfaction.\\" I'm not sure that quibbling is categorically a good thing. Quibbling is great for pure science, of limited benefit for engineering projects and absolutely destructive to the welfare of a country. The authors took up this point frequently, stating that the Jewish tendency to not defer to authority was a good thing. I'm not convinced as of this reading.<br /><br />The good thing about these topics is that none of them are dealt with at such length that the reader might perish of boredom-- but there are references and suggested readings for further study of any of the many points that are brought up in this book.<br /><br />The text only takes about 4-5 hours to read, and has great references and bibliography. The writing is easy to follow and interesting. I can STRONGLY recommend this book for the purchase price of a second hand hardcover or a new paperback.ority was a good thing.

B001NLL8LA|5.0|By far the best Reacher to date. I rarely post a review, but couldn't resist sharing my \\"Job-well-done\\" platitudes for #13 in the series.    I generally get hooked on series novels because of \\"ensemble\\" characters like the Stone Barrington series, aka, continuity. Not so true with Reacher novels. Only one constant, a super-hero drifter finding himself in the wrong place-wrong time.    Despite the lack of continuity, I like to read a series in order. In my opinion, the entire series as whole is 5 star, with one boring glitch, but the non-stop action in Gone Tomorrow, blows the top off. No doubt that the reader of Reacher novels is pee-disposed to \\"Rockem-Sockem\\" non-stop action--Gone Tomorrow is the ultimate.    Many thanks to Amazon's Kindle 3 that gave me the ability to read again--hadn't been able to read a hardback for almost 10 years--since October, 2010 (10 months), I have blown through 92 Kindle editions--added value from \\"take-it-anywhere as in read on Kindle, move to PC app and iPad app--leave one device and pick up where you left of on another device.    Back to Gone Tomorrow. I don't care if you are not a Reacher Groupie, it is a Must Read.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|The only reason I gave this product 2 stars and not 1 is because in the horizontal position it does its job, but when you try to turn the phone to a vertical position (as pictured) on the side, the weight of the phone doesn't allow the tripod to stay up. It's cheap, which I expected, but so lightweight that it can't handle the phone on the side. Like I said, for one direction, it's fine and does its job but if you are looking for something that you can move to different angles and orientations, this is not for you.
B003XX2PD6|4.0|I was not an aficionado of Deerhunter before hearing Halcyon Digest. But something about this album--perhaps its tunefulness or decaying ambience--drew me to listen to the record all the way through, more than once. With each listen, the songs clicked in my brain (especially \\"Desire Lines\\" and \\"Revival\\"); although some songs here, like \\"Sailing,\\" can be yawn-inducing. What more needs to be said? This album needs patient/careful listeners for maximum appreciation.
B000P0J09M|4.0|One side for half of the movie - one side for the remaining half.  A little inconvenient.  The DVD is advertised as widescreen, but it's a matted / letterboxed image.  Using my TV's zoom feature to fit it to the screen results in a slight decrease in image quality.  I'd give five stars to the movie itself.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The CD is great.  Songs/lyrics and of course the voice are all spectacular!!  Her voice reminds of old time blues. Highly recommend it to all.
B0019N94X6|5.0|For anyone who enjoys this film, and a quality sound; nothing can be better than this remaster. First of all, I was shocked to see them go the extra mile to 7.1 DTS HD-Master Audio. Too many have stopped at 5.1. During the finale shoot-up I could clearly hear distinct gunfire coming from all four rear speakers; very impressive. This was no throw together. And you cannot beat Amazon pricing and having it wait at your door, the day of the release, without having to go to any stores. FANTASTIC!
B003B96AOW|5.0|The only thing that's off to me on this particular one is his mask detail seems a bit off, like one side of the black seems to go lower than the other? Though to be honest in the end I really don't care if it is or not on this one. In all it's really nice, great size, detail and coloring of it are nice. Definitely gotta say I'm happy I bought him. Now I just gotta find somewhere in my house to put him lol!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|It sure looks nice, and I'd like to be able to use it, but unfortunately out won't work unless it can find you by GPS and in spite of my having GPS on the app won't activate it and use it... It just sits at &quot;finding you with GPS&quot; forever.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|installed on my thunderbolt and updated quickly. good interface. no problems at all. if you have a fairly new phone it should work great. i recommend highly!
B004YXE438|5.0|Please make another application identical to this and I will gladly buy it. Love it! Can't get enough of it!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|The app works really well. The UI is clean, best free app yet. Give it about an hour to load the first time.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Would have loved the features of this application however it crashed my phone and had to uninstall it to get phone function back
B0058EBNAO|3.0|works OK. nothing to jump up and down about. I think it's hilarious that they put &quot;including Pakistan &quot; in the description though. don't see why that's necessary but it is funny.
B004BLJQOK|1.0|This is a horrible remake of Let the right one in. Once again hollywood brainless remake instead of coming up with an original story. Buy Let The Right One In!!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|One of the best weather apps I've had. Weather Channel app NEVER worked. This is a fun little app. Thanks Amazon!
B000QUCNOK|5.0|You have to watch it from start to finish before judging it! Understand that it isn't like any other movie you've probably ever seen! It's dark & weird  wonderful!!!!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Perfect app for weather visually appealing and accurate I dont understand all the ones when you mostly got this app free
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This was one of those films that you watch after a hard day at work. If you are looking for realism, films and nearly all television is the wrong place to look. If you are looking to relax, be entertained, and have a few laughs this is a great choice!    My favorite part of this film is Helen Mirren. Seeing such an elegant and accomplished actress saying 'I kill people daaaling', and soon after in snow fatigues carrying and shooting a sniper rifle (correctly).... and later firing a heavy weapon in a enclosed place (and in an evening dress), is worth buying the DVD!    The only reason I didn't use FIVE stars is because there are a few (very few) parts that were too far fetched, even for this kind of film.... example Bruce Willis calmly stepping out of a car spinning out of control.... I HATE CGI car stunts!    I bought it when it was more expensive, and it was worth it.... now it is a steal!
B005L7B22C|4.0|Doctor Who fans cannot complain about any Matt Smith episode, he's a great Doctor (although so was David Tennant).  I did feel that this was just a \\"filler\\" it's totally off the main plot.  It's entertaining but after the last two it's a bit of a letdown.      Worth watching just don't expect the thrills and excitements that prior episodes gave you.    Hopefully we'll be back on track next week.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Nice app but doesnt update location with gps only cell tower. Isn't accurate on location.  I continue my search for a good weather app that updates location fast.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Moderate movie.  There are some decent action scenes between a strange storyline.      There was nothing about this movie that really made me say WOW.  I watched it last night and could not even remember the title when I woke up so I'm being generous by give it 3 stars.
1878424505|5.0|Fabulous read.  A simple guide to living a full and happy life.  Follow these basics and you will find your life is full of abundance, love, and understanding.  We are loved just the way we are.  There is no need for jealousy or greed.  This book is just what I needed - a warm fuzzy.  I highly recommend this book.  Great for discussing at a book club gathering.  If everyone followed the simple and easy messages in this book, there would be no more wars.  As Miguel Ruiz says, we would be living in Heaven right here, right now - the way we were meant to be.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This album is album of the year to me. The songs are so inspirtational, + her message speaks to everyone. Hair happens to be my favorite song, followed by JUDAS. :) You will deffinately like this album! Gaga is amazing, + I love her. <3
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Runs very smooth. found my location as soon as I opened it. Radar works well.  I really like the clock/temp screen. I would like to have that as a live wall paper.  Good job on the app!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Works okay on droid X2, seems graphically cluttered. App has a wealth of weather information.  Needs a more straight forward GUI
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Set it to try for location via cell networks and GPS. It could do neither. Also locked the GPS in active mode until I killed the app by uninstalling it. Developers have some major work to do.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|What a wonderful unexpected love story! The art of which the author incorporated the economical push on relationships was done very well!
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra Streisand, without a doubt the most gifted female singer of her generation, has produced a lovely tribute to her close friends the Bergmans.  Each song is graceful and seductive in her renditions.  The Bergmans/Streisand partnership has results in some emotional highlights of the past half century.  Think of the theme from \\"The Way We Were\\" or the entire score to the epic masterpiece YENTL.  Barbra is able to communicate the emotional texture of the Bergmans' lyrics better than anyone singing today.  This CD is a glorious addition to any CD collection.  There are many standouts on the CD, but my two favorites are \\"That Face\\" and \\"Nice 'n' Easy.\\"  My only complaint - why didn't she sing more of their songs.  I would have loved to hear Barbra's version of the theme from \\"Tootsie.\\"  As a fan of Barbra's for many decades, I always want more.  Thanks, Barbra and the Bergmans for this lovely musical feast.  Movie Junkie
B004KPLVV8|3.0|When \\"Tron\\" hit movie theaters in 1982, it wowed a lot of critics by placing human actors in a computer-generated environment. Actually, some of it is back-lit animation, but that was a convincing stand-in for the digital world. I wasn't especially impressed at the time. It looked like a video game, as was intended -that was the novelty. Stephen Lisberger wrote and directed the film, which was inspired by the game Pong. It looks it. I've been re-watching iconic films from the 1980s to see how they have held up. \\"Tron\\" wasn't one that I liked in the first place, but, ironically, it has taken on new meaning with the passage of time.<br /><br />Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), is trying to break into the computer of his former employer, Encom, whose CEO Mr. Dillinger (David Warner) stole several video games that Flynn wrote and used them to advance his career. Flynn is looking for evidence of his authorship, aided by Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora Baines (Cindy Morgan), scientists who still work for Encom. But his efforts have been repelled by Master Control, Encom's ambitious security program. Alan has written \\"Tron\\", a program which he hopes can infiltrate Master Control. But when Flynn's attack becomes threatening, Master Control zaps him with a beam that turns the man into a computer program, at Master Control's mercy.<br /><br />The story is incoherent and silly. A lot of scenes serve no narrative purpose. The visuals were unusual for a movie at the time but were never interesting in themselves. The attempt to fuse photographic images of actors with digital animation is funny, perhaps because filmmakers have still not gotten that quite right. George Lucas' and Stephen Spielberg's effrots in this area still look like video games with humans walking around in them. The depth of field never seems to match up correctly, among other issues. The imagery in \\"Tron\\" is, mercifully, unsophisticated enough not to be bedeviled by these finer points.<br /><br />Thematically, \\"Tron\\" is more interesting. It exists somewhere between \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968) and \\"The Matrix\\" (1999) is its concept of powerful, all-knowing, all-controlling computers. Master Control's personality is that of a heavy-handed, militant HAL. It terrorizes humans and machines alike. It entertains a grand ambition to hijack all government and corporate computers, because Master Control fancies himself better than humans, who have become his toys. From inside Encom's computer, Flynn, aided by Tron and a program called Yori, must destroy Master Control and free cyberspace from its dominion. Sounds like \\"The Matrix\\".<br /><br />The casting of Jeff Bridges is odd. Flynn is a god, a \\"user\\", fallen to earth, or cyberspace, to free the masses, but  Flynn's personality does not resemble any computer geek I've ever met. This was before geeks were allowed in movies. Back then, coders were still called \\"programmers\\". That \\"Tron\\" was a pioneer effort in digital animation is undisputed. But, ultimately, the tediousness of the whole thing does not allow me to give the movie more than 3 stars. It's not great entertainment. It takes some effort to stay awake for the duration. \\"Tron\\" has other merits, however.esting.

1439102724|5.0|Zoe and Max Baxter have struggled with infertility for nine years, trying every measure imaginable, expensive IVF and trauma. Zoe finally becomes pregnant and seems to be carrying to term when tragedy occurs, miscarries. In the aftermath, Max decides he just cannot deal with this anymore. He walks away from his marriage, leaving Zoe to pick up the pieces of her life. On top of all this, Zoe discovers she has cancer and must undergo a hysterectomy. Zoe and her best friend, Vanessa, discover feelings that surprisingly reach deeper than they had expected. Max is conflicted and at the mercy of his brother and his church, while Zoe only wants to work with troubled patients and be a mother. While Zoe can no longer carry the frozen embryos left behind from her marriage, Vanessa can. All that is needed is Max's consent for Zoe to use the embryos. And therein lies trouble.     There are many issues to deal with that make the pages fly by. A lot of drama, human spirit, legal and moral issues make this a must-read book and I guarantee the impossibility of putting the book down.    Ann T. Mason
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app does what it says and is far more useful than the stock weather app on my phone. $3 seems fair for the broad functionality, which includes widgets. The best part is that the app saves me the trouble of checking the weather somewhere else before riding my bike to work every day, which I sometimes forget to do, with soggy results. (Tide times and surf forecasts would be nice additions.)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A beautiful movie about love, loyalty and friendship based on a true story.  If you love dogs, you will enjoy this.  Keep your kleenex close though.  The first time I watched, I almost made myself sick from the crying, and I didn't even know it was based on a true story until the end.  I saw it on TV and had to have my own copy.  I love this dog, Hachi.  This is my favorite movie by far.  The music is beautiful and fits perfectly.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Installed on Verizon Droid 4g lte worked great found the exact city I live in also correct time and temp.  Was not going to bother installing after I read all the negitive reviews but thought for no charge lets see what happens.  After downloading and opening all info correct. Give it a shot
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game has made my long commute (riding carpool that is) tolerable. Several of the advanced levels require many, many attempts and strategic refinement. If you like tower defense and a lot of variety in maps, ZDefense is as good as any of them.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|I'm so excited to blog about this book. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to those who are fans of YA Comtemporary Romance. It's so so good, I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. I don't exaggerate when I say this book is really good! I thank all those great reviews, 'cos they all lived-up to my expectations.<br /><br />This book is so refreshing, so vibrant, you can actually feel that you were part of the story. You'll gonna love Anna and Etienne. Both were created with flaws that made them more lovable and real. The story is so romantic, and funny, and heart-warming... If there's a book I  would love to read to keep myself entertained and feel good, I'll definitely pick this one! There's nothing extraordinary about the story but it's just so good that  I would want to go to Paris, study in the same university, live in the same dormitory, and meet Etienne! (to my hubby: luv, you're still my #1 :) It's just so addicting!<br /><br />When I started reading it, I was so anxious to know the rest of the story that I didn't realized I was on the last few pages already. The ending was perfect, that when I finished it, I felt like \\"I can't get enough of it\\" so I reread the last pages over and over again. And when I finished it for the nth time, I have this huge grin on my face... This book linger on me for days! And from time to time, I still think about it. There's no doubt I'll be reading this book again!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's cinematic gentrification. Erasing history. 'Nuff said.  Cleaning up the edges is one thing but adding or removing anything makes it a whole new movie.  There are plenty of directors and producers who have always said that as soon as a movie is made and released, it is no longer theirs but the audiences. These were OUR movies not his to do with as he pleased.
B0000024YL|5.0|I had this on vinyl when it was first released... still as great as ever!  Some of the true talents in my time..
B004EPZ07K|4.0|OK, so I will admit some major bias, I am a big fan of Green Lantern ever since the Death of Superman saga back in the early/mid 90s. So that being said, I have had some time to fall in and fall out of the GL fanboy status but still my heart pumps that crazy green glow no matter what. Hence, when I heard that this movie was coming out I was absurdly ecstatic about it (kind of like how I was when I heard about Transformers). And much like Transformers, I didn't go into this movie expecting much.     First of all, the movie had Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan. Ryan Reynolds as the care free, smartass Kyle Rayner maybe, but not as the serious and solemn Hal Jordan. Honestly, I could've seen Nathan Fillion in his younger days as Hal but really, the guy from 2 Guys and a Girl and a Pizza Place? And yet with my skepticism, he works. Despite what I would consider some major artistic license with this re-imagined version of the title character, Reynolds works his charm, comic timing, and overall sincerity to make this version of Hal Jordan very likable to the point that you might actually be reciting the oath with him (I did so under my breath at one point I think).    Folks gave this movie some major flak for some of the effects looking too cartoony. We all realize two things about this film right? One: this is a freaking comic book based movie for Christ's sake! Magic ring and spandex! Granted, the 100% CGI costume is a bit overboard in my humble opinion and did have some moments of cheese with it. However, this is a movie about a guy who gets a magic ring and meets aliens one of which is a human sized chipmunk! Two: we do realize who this character/actor is? One scene in particular that many critics and audience members disliked was the race track that GL used to divert the falling helicopter. The ring makes constructs from the user's will power and imagination. From the goofy and immature way that Hal Jordan is portrayed, who is really surprised by this? Yes it is cartoonyto the point that it reminds me of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" but it is sort of the way they were going for. Once again, not exactly how Hal Jordan is in the comics but once again, re-imagining and artistic license.    The acting and writing. OK, that I will give in on. The writing sounded like it came straight from the comics and as eye candy(licious) as Blake Lively is, I wouldn't consider her the strongest actress out there. However, she and Reynolds do make an attractive couple and they do have decent chemistry with one another. Unfortunately, a lot of the other actors are relatively forgettable in this movie. And yes, there are some major plot holes in this film. The Guardians are beings from the beginning of time with infinite wisdom with one of them becoming the being known as Parallax and he somehow forgets about the gravitational pull deal? OK, fine I'll forget about that. Then Sinestro after witnessing Hal Jordan proving the power of the Green Lantern Ring does his thing at the end? Couldn't they have made this more of Lucifer thing with him becoming jealous or something instead of just a random act? Eh, what can you do?    For all its faults, Green Lantern is still entertaining with plenty of eye candy in either visual effects, Lively, or Reynolds. The acting and writing isn't the best but this is a comic book movie looking more for box office receipts instead of Oscar nods. Is it true to Green Lantern lore? No. Is it entertaining and a decent origin story to introduce the general populace to Green Lantern? Kinda. Is it worth a watch when you don't really want to tax the brain? Like many other action flicks, it definitely is. This is by no means on par with The Dark Knight but at least it is a few levels above Superman Returns. (Once again, my opinion not fact)
0913866156|5.0|This deck is different from all the others I got. It may be an impression of mine, but it seemed full of magic and power from the first moment I read the cards. One of them just fell onto the floor, and then it kept appearing all the time. It was just the right answer to my worries! It gave me Strenght (it was the Lust card) and I felt indeed stronger to go on. Aleister Crowley indeed had a well won reputation!
B004LL1HM4|5.0|A very good follow up to their first album.  No grand standout single track like :He didn't know\\"   but is a more mature sounding both lyrically and instrumentally.  Most bands wouldn't have reached this stage til their 4th album,  but Fleet Foxes know how to spin a great tale in each of their tracks.  Defintely worth a listen as it is still just as catchy as their first album  and ep.  Will be great to see and hear them live when they start a world tour.  Keep up the great work.  Regards  John

1594484805|5.0|What we think motivates us and what really does are miles apart. Yet schools, parents, corporate America etc are still trying to motivate us using strategies and approaches that just don't work. What if we actually started using approaches that work?<br /><br />His distinction about performance goals vs being/lifestyle goals was a revelation and explained why so many people have a difficult relationship with the whole goal setting process.

B0058OUJA4|5.0|great Game! at first i compared this to hexdfense. after playing awhile its kinda. more fun. there are tons of maps and more added. all the time. the game is very challenging. perhaps to much maybe. but overall its a great game and worth the money. plus there is a map maker!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Works perfectly. The backups make it easy to copy from one andriod to another. Try it, you won't be dissapointed.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|This is a fantastic weather app. This is easily the best I've seen with no close second. There is good summary data, good detailed data, great customizable info in the notification list, which clicks to open the app.     It did take a bit of fiddling to get it to sync to my location. Sometimes gadgets just do. I added and deleted locations, I added locations from a list. I updated my GPS settings in my phone. Finally, it grabbed my location and has kept it. I've deducted a star for the needed \\"fiddling\\" but am very happy with the app.

B004UXUXGE|1.0|I saw this movie in a theater, but only in 2D.  I learned almost nothing by watching the movie, except I did get to see the paintings.  I think the magic must have been in the 3D effect.  The movie maker wasted much time with silly things like a perfumer who was sniffing the cliff looking for another cave, instead of perhaps including an artist to evaluate the art we were seeing for composition, form and development.  There was only minimal discussion about \\"the people\\" who made the drawings, and no explanation about the animals we were seeing depicted from a paleontologist's point of view.  However the director wasted time with a man badly tossing a spear in a demonstration and another guy in a fur \\"getup\\" playing the Star Spangled Banner on a \\"flute\\".  Some of the drawings were done in red and some in black.  There was no explanation.  Did the artist use blood? charcoal? What?  I was also disgusted by the albino alligators at the end of the movie.  Why did the film maker waste his time with that?    I left there being able to say, \\"I saw some cave paintings made maybe 32,000 years ago.\\"  I could list some of the animals I saw, \\"Lions, rhinos, horses, cave bears, mammoth, and hyenas.\\"   I could NOT answer the following questions: \\"From an artistic point of view, how did these paintings compare to other examples in other caves?  Was this art \\"trained art\\"? From a modern perspective what do the paintings suggest to us about the artist and the culture he came from?  What do we know about the lifestyle of the people who would have painted these?  Do scientists believe these drawings were made as a part of a religious activity?  How long would it have taken someone to draw them?  The animals that are depicted in the drawings were how prevalent during the time the paintings were done?  When did the different species become extinct?  Besides the lack of a lion's mane, did paleontologists learn anything else from examining the drawings?  Etc Etc Etc    It seemed like the film maker was trying to make \\"art\\", and without the 3D effect he failed.  If you are looking for something beyond a look at the drawings, forget it.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Being as this was the free app for the day, i gave it a try. After inputting settings and such, the app couldnt find my location either by gps signal nor network tower signal. I kept getting a java error and a string of jibberish after the error message. Graphics in the app description look good and it seems that its purpose is well intentioned but in some cases, the use execution is lacking. Im hoping developer can address the potential bug. So while it was free today, its still dissappointing that a regularly priced $3 app doesnt work at all on my HTC Inspire 4g phone. Glad i didnt purchase this for cash. Ive uninstalled now. Maybe the developer had it put up for free to find out what phones it does and doesnt work on? But regardless, it seems that what devices it DOES work on is far less than the devices it doesnt. Time to head back to the drawing board for a bit. Not being able to find location(regardless of whether 1 uses gps, cell tower or from a list) on the vast number of currently available devices isnt good.
0545259088|5.0|Forever by Maggie Stiefavter<br />Disclosure:  I received a copy of this book from Goodreads in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />From the back of the book:<br /><br />\\"THEN<br /><br />When Sam met Grace, he was a wolf and she was a girl.  Eventually he found a way to become a boy, and their love moved from a curious distance to the intense closeness of a shared lives.<br /><br />NOW<br /><br />That should have been the end of their story. But Grace was not meant to stay human.  Now she is the wolf.  And the wolves of Mercy Falls are about to be killed in one final, spectacular hunt.<br /><br />FOREVER<br /><br />Sam would do anything for Grace.  But can one boy and one love really change a hostile, predatory world? The past, the present, and the future are about to collide in one pure moment -- a moment of death or life, farewell or forever.\\"<br /><br />This is one of my all time favorite young adult series and Maggie Stiefvater is one of my all time favorite YA authors.  She consistently provides an engaging, well developed and entertaining story.<br /><br />I'm not going into detail about the story itself, I don't want to give anything away.  If you like paranormal romances and are a fan of YA fiction then this is a series you should read.  Keep in mind that this one of those series where you really do have to read it in order.<br /><br />What I liked about the book: I like the way Stiefvater tells the story alternating between the characters. I feel this gives us a deeper look into each character.  None of the characters are perfect (though Grace is pretty close without seeming like a Pollyanna) and it's nice to see how the characters see themselves as well as how they are viewed by the other characters in the book.  The pacing of this book is a little faster than Shiver and Linger, but that's as it should be considering what's going on in the story.<br />What I didn't like about the book: Cole's language. Though I have to admit it fits his character.  There is also a bit of sexual innuendo.  They don't really take away from the story, but I'm not sure they are totally necessary to the story as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent YA series. I am sad to see it end, but I'll be watching for other books by Steifvater. I'm sure there will be more.I'm not sure they are totally necessary to the story as well.

0312430000|5.0|As a second-year medical student, I loved this book.  It has definitely changed the way I think about practicing medicine.  I grew up with parents who both work in the medical field, so I had my preconceived notions about the way things are.  And Gawande blew a lot of them away.    I really liked the fact that he emphasized teamwork, something that medical schools only now seem to really emphasize.  No longer is it just a doctor-patient relationship, it is a complex interplay between several practitioners and the patient, all trying to accomplish what is best for the patient.  All members of the team deserve respect and should be able to voice their concerns about potential errors (ie, a nurse reminding a surgeon to change his gloves after he inadvertently contaminated them, surgeon reminding anesthesiologist of a patient's specific request not to get an antibiotic before a minimally invasive procedure, etc.)    Gawande also takes his analogy to other fields such as finance and aviation, expounding the virtues of discipline all the while.  The central theme is the same, but the situations change to keep it interesting. Great book by an extremely eloquent writer.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Atrix 4g. nothing. nada. zip. zero.  Even putting in several zips it fails to deliver anything. I live in a major metro area in Texas. Hard to believe it's assertion that there is no data. Broke plain and simple for this phone anyway.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|My jaw dropped watching Alien in high definition. This movie looks AMAZING, the lighting and sets do such a great job of enhancing the mood. I was paying close attention to the level of detail on the Nostromo and alien spaceship, it's a reference quality blu-ray disk and a fine addition to any library. The world that Ridley Scott and his genius collaborators have fleshed out in this movie is so well defined. You feel the claustrophobic environments of the air ducts and maintenance tunnels of the ship, the hissing coolant and heating gases ... An amazing accomplishment and even though I've seen the movie four times by now, I was still on the edge of my seat in the final 30 minutes of the film! Do I have to even start mentioning the kick-ass sequel Aliens, with some of the best dialogue ever in an action flick (\\"game over, man!\\"). I also really like the packaging, it has a very high quality and slick feel.
B0052OWGYW|5.0|This is a must see movie if you like action and a fan of Jason S. The action scenes are articulated with nice touch promoting the movie into 5 star. Excating action scenes with some funny dialogs.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I really like the original Star Wars trilogy. I own all three movies on Laserdisc, in the best version released so far: remastered sound, cleaned up picture quality, and NO OTHER CHANGES.    I don't want pasty looking CGI inserted into scenes. I don't want scenes inserted or changed (example: Greedo shoots first).    I want a *technically* improved product. Remix the soundtrack so it sounds better in home theaters, but don't change the music. Improve the picture quality so it looks as good as possible on blu-ray. Leave everything else alone, or at least give the customer a choice of \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" version. The original Star Wars movies are considered classics; messing with them is not appreciated by a large number of fans!    The Alien(s) blu-ray edition is an excellent example of how to do this correctly: each film on the blu-ray can be see in the original theatrical version or the new version and the films look GORGEOUS.
B005ILYW1E|3.0|This is a movie to watch if you have time. It misses all the fight and action figures of Jason S. from his other smilar movies but it is a good movie to watch during a plane trip when there is nothing else to do.
0061928356|5.0|When Kavita, an impoverished young Indian woman, gives birth to a hazel-eyed baby girl she knows that she will not be able to keep her. Her husband needs a son to help him in the fields and they can't afford to pay a dowry for a daughter. Kavita makes a difficult journey of many miles with her daughter to an orphanage in Mumbai since the only other option is infanticide, an unfortunate practice in India for some girl babies.<br /><br />Halfway around the world in California, Somer and her Indian born husband Krishnan have tried everything to have a baby of their own. Finally they decide to travel back to Kris's homeland to adopt a baby from an Indian orphanage. They come home with a sweet, hazel-eyed baby girl.<br /><br />The Secret Daughter interweaves the story of the hazel-eyed girl and her two mothers beautifully. The basic struggles of Kavita in India differ greatly from Somer's problems in America. However, the author shows us that even though they are in vastly different countries some issues are universal, especially for mothers.<br /><br />I loved the way the author vividly described India; I felt like I learned a lot about Indian culture. She also did a great job of authentically voicing the internal conflict that international adoptees feel as they grow up; at least according to what I've learned in my foster/adoptive parent training. I also really appreciated that she included a glossary of foreign terms at the back of the book - I referred to it fairly often.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you have an interest in Indian culture or international adoption.
0440178002|5.0|Clavel sucked me into the Japanese lifestyle.  After this book, I had to read them all........then watch those horrible made for TV movies.  Sad to say, I actually enjoyed the Shogun mini series.  Anyways, great book, read them all and don't leave out King Rat, probably Clavel's greatest work.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I love the hourly temps and the clock motif, but unfortunately the info was inaccurate. It found my location accurately but the temperature it gave was 15 degrees lower than TWC,  and 18 degrees lower than my thermometer,  even after refreshing. That is just unacceptable. It's too bad, I really wanted to like it.
B000NTPDK0|1.0|The movie itself was quite good.  Helen Mirren is outstanding, as usual.  However, I am rating an \\"item\\"; the blu-ray disk that I received (and viewed after 30 days, so I cannot return it) has \\"skips\\" towards the end.  It's really inconvenient to sit through a two hour movie only to have problems at the end.  Sigh.
0316056863|3.0|I found it was more a biography than I'd expected.  While I think TF is hilarious and a genius writer, I wasn't impressed. I'd say I LOL'd at the parts involving parenting, and her 10 commandements for her daughter.  The most interesting factoid was how she acquired her scar (she was attacked in an alley by a man with a knife when she was a child). So, now I've saved you $10.
B0000VD04M|2.0|I must have missed something...but why make a movie about a failed director? I like Depp and Bill Murray but their roles here are bizarre, and in Murrays case they don't really let his comedic talents shine. He could have added some needed humor to the story, instead they accentuate his bizarreness without mining Murray's comedic talents.    All in all a very disappointing film that I could not watch to the very end, and even after reading all these glowing reviews the only way I see this movie again is if I'm in a film class and they dissect it for teaching purposes - not for entertainment.

B005LAMY76|5.0|Although the episode mainly dealt with Hank getting closer and closer to the Gus-Walt-Jesse case, my favorite moment was when Gus is taken to task by a Mexican drug honcho who killed his cohort and then terrorized him.  I've been waiting to say this: Gus can sure dish it out but he can't take it!<br /><br />We also see that Hank is really a very fine detective.  The case has brought him back to life and even though he will probably never walk right again, his life is livable as long as he keeps his spirit intact.<br /><br />A fine humorous note occurs at the cancer scan station.  Walt previously thought cancer was the worst thing that had ever happened to him.  He had used it to justify ever insane action he's taken ever since.  He sits next to a younger man, also waiting for his cancer scan.  This man comments about how horrible cancer is and Walt says in response that cancer is barely a blip in his life, that so many more serious things have occurred that he can barely even afford to think about being a cancer patient!  He is being utterly serious and that is what dealing with drug cartels, drug partners, the DEA, including a DEA relative, have brought him to in his almost unbearable life.

B000KIRT6A|5.0|This pedal works well in my rig, I have two Boss EQ20's advanced EQ's and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have, this little toy does the trick, and does it very well, I think that people who writes negative reviews don't know how to use it, it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable, highly recommended... or you can go for the overpriced $100+ Boss original unit, at the end is the same, maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing.
0307279189|5.0|Even though I'm a lifelong runner and no less than three friends tried to press it into my hands imploring that \\"you have to read this,\\" I'd put off reading Christopher McDougall's \\"Born to Run\\" until last week.  Why? I'd heard from others that \\"it's about barefoot running!\\"  Great, I thought: that's all I need to do is to read 300 pages about the wonders of those ridiculous Vibram Five Fingers.  Me? I love my Nikes.  I'll gladly pay $100 for the science that Nike pours into my Vomeros.<br /><br />Turns out, of course, that the \\"barefoot running\\" synopsis missed the point of the book.  Author McDougall tackles a much grander theme: the premise that man is, in fact, a running animal and that our great, great ancestors hunted down beasts (seemingly faster by leaps and bounds) by simply outlasting them.  That tramps like us, baby we were born to run.  Our gig is endurance, and it always has been.  But, ah, the disconnect now: TV, video games, computers, creature comforts, general lethargy have turned many of us into something a far pace from these warriors.<br /><br />McDougall's triumph is to take what could be super-dry material and turn it into a rollicking yarn by manifesting the science and 'Born to Run' premise in the high spirits that define the ultra-running community.  This is subculture with some hard-core, one-of-kind characters.  McDougall corrals a fistful of them  - characters like Scott Jurek, Billy Bonehead, Barefoot Ted and Jenn Shelton - draws us an indelible picture of each of them, then troops us alongside the crew as they come together to race the Tarahumara in Mexico.  Even if you have absolutely no interest in running, this book will grab and hold your attention.<br /><br />McDougall is simply a brilliant writer.  He makes it seem effortless.  It is most assuredly not.

B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I've had my microphone for a couple months now, and really find that I like it a lot.  The on-board microphone on the Nikon D3s isn't bad, but I wanted something in close to what I was recording, so this is great for interviews.<br /><br />Regarding someone's comment that the mic picks up camera noise, I don't generally attach it directly to my camera, and instead use a series of very good quality stereo audio cables to get sound.  The cables aren't that spendy (even though these are the gold-tipped type).  I spent maybe 3 dollars for each 6 foot section of cabling, and I've been able to use three at a time without getting nasty background distortion.<br /><br />A little foresight will save you a potential headache.  FYI, there is a mounting screw hole on the bottom of the mic and I found that it fits quite well on the top of one of my lighting stands, if you need a fixed place for the mic when it's on (an) extension cable(s).

1439165653|4.0|In The Hundred-Foot Journey we read about the journey of Hassan Haji to become a great chef. It begins with him living in Mumbai with his large, eccentric family. Throughout the section in India Morais gives detailed descriptions of the food that Hassan grew up with and loved. We also get introduced to his family, the two most memorable being his mother and father. His father is a larger than life character that is fun to read about and his mother is more quiet and nurturing.<br /><br />After a family tragedy the family moves to Lumiere in the French Alps where his father opens an Indian restaurant across the street from an elegant French restaurant run by the famous French chef Madame Mallory. Madame Mallory was my favorite character in the book. She is complicated, intense, and goes through quite a change that was so much fun to read. Madame Mallory recognizes the talent in Hassan and trains him in the art of French cooking.<br /><br />When I started reading this book I expected it to be filled with glorious descriptions of both Indian and French food and I was not disappointed. I was hungry while reading the entire book. What surprised me was the touching story of family and a man's search for where home is for him. Like I said, Madame Mallory is a wonderful character and I really enjoyed reading about her passion for food and how she ran her restaurant. Reading about Hassan's education and life experiences was so well done, I really felt like I was reading a journal written by Hassan himself. If you enjoy books about food and ones that also have humor and family drama, this is a must-read book.

B000002HB4|5.0|For a while, Rock music has been so bad I stopped listening. Well, stopped listening to newer stuff. (No angry letters, please, that's how I see it)<br /><br />It seems like Rock is a lost art, so many performers haven't learned to play their instruments, or they are \\"sampling\\" the better riffs of their betters. But I have recently discovered this. So it's new to me, from the mid 80's. It seems there is a pocket of, Hmmm, what we used to call Country Rockers in the late sixties, (when Michael Nesmith and Gram Parsons melded Rock, Rockabilly and Country and all the other rockers followed). Some of these \\"Country\\" musicians still know (or knew) how to make music! The Georgia Satellites sound to me like late sixties early seventies Rolling Stones and earlier, Chuck Berry. And what could be better, the Stones certainly didn't use up all the notes! The Georgia Satellites records remind me in places of \\"Let it Bleed\\".<br /><br />These guys only made three or so albums and these are the best, that is the \\"rockers\\" off of those. melodies, harmonies, masterful Bill Wyman type bass lines and Keith Richards type leads.<br /><br />It was a put together group with a lot of egos pulling in different directions. Shoehorned together from two other groups the \\"Hellhounds\\" and \\"Woodpeckers\\" (and that was ultimately their downfall). Dan Baird has that countryish nasal twang in his voice but is ultimately a better lead singer than their great guitarist Rick Richards. \\"Keep Your Hands to Yourself\\" was a great hit about a Southern miss who teased a lot but wanted that ring first - funny!. \\"Don't pass me By\\" was originally a Ringo song with the rest of the Fab Four playing backup. GS's version is much stronger rock. I particularly like \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" a tune the early Beatles covered.<br /><br />\\"Mon Cheri\\" has just the right note of sleaze. The protagonist meet a girl who doesn't speak English:<br /><br />\\"Well she sat herself down right on the park bench/<br />Her skirt rolled up and I could see she was French/<br />and my heart said 'Toujour L'Amour/<br />Avec ma ami!'/<br />My My My Mon Cheri\\"<br /><br />This is wonderful Roadhouse music, and great music at that. Drips of Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll at it's finest. Rock with gonads. I wish the Satellites had stayed together.<br /><br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed.heart said 'Toujour L'Amour/   Avec ma ami!'/   My My My Mon Cheri\\"     This is wonderful Roadhouse music, and great music at that.

140131046X|5.0|Little faith is all we need to believe in others and ourselves. To believe that they (or we) can change and that they can live new lives.<br /><br />Mitch Albom has very wisely chosen the title for this book. All through his conversations with the Rabbi, Albert Lewis and the Pastor, Henry Covington, Mitch concludes his (or our) little faith in others can help them change, which may henceforth help transform whole communities.<br /><br />Despite the lost avenues we wander in and despite the wrong values we choose in life, a little faith in ourselves and in God as our guide (and endless hope) will help transform our lives, our families' lives, and communities at large.<br /><br />There is a powerful message in this book and that is summarized by a statement made in its conclusion. No matter what religion we follow, what belief-system we belong to (\\"the many melodies\\"), our hope and faith in Him will unite us with His everlasting love (\\"His Song\\").

B002G1YPH0|5.0|My moms computer has an AMD Phenom II X6 1100T processor in it. Its a fairly small case with horrible air flow, and we're talking about blue screen of death every 5 minutes or so due to overheating on the stock fan. Well, downloaded core temp and idle temps were 70 degrees Celsius. Absolutely horrible. Bought this and installed it in a hour due to the horrible directions included with this product, (watch a YouTube video on installing it). Temps never exceed 35 Degrees now, even after 48 hours of Prime 95. CPU isn't overclocked, but even at stock speeds, HUGE IMPROVEMENT. My gaming rig in my room uses the Corsair H60 on top of an Intel i7 2600k @5.2 GHz and my idle temps aren't even that good (maybe 31). Overall would buy again.

I got home and started reading (a.k.a. devouring) his book. Within days I had already read it twice and was starting to journal some things based on what he discusses in the book. I've followed him and TOMS for over a year now, so it was great to hear the full TOMS story. And...It was great to hear other entrepreneurial stories. Take those stories and couple it with best business practices and suggestions for starting your own \\"something that matters\\" and you've got a bestseller in my book! It's honest-to-goodness my favorite book and I'm about to purchase a bunch more to give away! Love it...You will too! Get ready to be inspired, challenged, and convicted...This book will cause you to take a hard look at your life and make some changes! Enjoy! :)

B00526ZKYS|3.0|After hearing so much about Lauren Oliver and seeing the average review here on Amazon, I was expecting a lot from Delirium. The premise of the book was very intriguing, but after a while, it got so that the connections between amor deliria nervosa and practically every emotion or personal human preference didn't make much sense. Why will Lena probably not run after the cure? Why does curing love mean you're suddenly peachy keen with having a wheezy, rude husband? Are they taking away the ability to dislike things too? Carol obviously doesn't like certain things about Lena. I mean how far does it go? I LOVE having my own toilet. Does that mean that the government takes away my toilet and once I'm cured, I'll have no problem peeing in my back yard?<br /><br />I found Lena to be pretty slow as far as main characters go, which seems to be the case whenever you have a dystopian female protaganist still trying to figure out what's going on in her world. People compare this to The Hunger Games, but it's NOT like The Hunger Games and Lena is NOT Katniss Everdeen. Delirium would be like a book about Katniss after her father dies and she's in the woods endlessly learning how to hunt and snare, then she meets Gale, etc. In short, all the boring prequel stuff to the action.<br /><br />And while I do admire the author's beautiful writing, I felt it was pretty out of place for a girl who supposedly spent 12 years of her life being raised by a loveless society. It turned pages after about halfway through, but the ending didn't dazzle me. It felt like it was cop-out writing, with no real commitment to what it appeared to be. You can tell that in the next book, she'll unravel the big final event and undo what she pretended to do. And that will end up being tired and predictable.<br /><br />As for the Kindle edition, I found it extremely annoying, with what seemed like at least one line<br />on every<br />page looking like this.

Hearne did a fantastic job with the book and entire series!

I watch all the videos I buy on my computer. It was disappointing that it has some block against playing in my Mac.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|A great collection of songs that show off Laurie's talents as a musician.  The cool instrumental opening for St. James Infirmary sets the  tone for some unique renditions.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Its very sad that a film maker such as George has had to spend his entire career nursing a franchise that is a shell of its former self. I am convinced that this man is unable to make films anymore. He's a hack, and this shouldn't be news to any fan of his work but what made his 1st 3 films great(Episodes 4-6) had less to do with George Lucas and more to do with the people around him. Back then he didn't have a group of YES men worshiping his every decision. He had people that would flat out tell him no, or this does not make sense for the sake of the film. That is all gone, people will continue to think this guy is a GOD when in reality he's a bloated Bullfrog who has only made 3 good Star Wars films(The prequels were complete garbage) before he rewrapped this gift with soiled newspaper. There is an article off MSN where Lucas was giving a testimony at Congress in 1988. In it he said \\"People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.\\" Barbarians George, really? If that is the case then you are the Genghis Khan of Hollywood! Fool me once(*Greedo shooting first) shame on you, fool me twice(*Voice overing Sir Alec Guiness' voice) Shame on me!

B005B0QYMM|5.0|Grave Encounters is much like the film Paranomral Activity, but has a different plot. It is just as scary and filmed from raw camera footage. There are many arguments throughout the public if Grave Encounters is real, based on a true story or all fiction. I can't see if I have a theory, but does it matter? People have been complaining because it isn't real. So what? Wheather it is or not, it's still a great film and worth the money. I'm not a friend of the film makers and I love it. Sorry, this other comment who hated it kind of made me mad enough to write that. This a good movie for people who loved and were scared to death by Paranormal Activity.

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I cannot think of any series that has managed to hold onto my interest and surely millions of other people interest as Criminal Minds has for the last 6 years? Just how the writers continue to come up with the different stories one after the other is a tribute to their capabilities.This series includes the added tensions of Emily Prentice becoming a 'victim' in more ways than one. (actress Paget Brewster and A J Cook were summarily sacked from the series as the Producers thought it was a good idea? Where exactly do they get their brains from??)    New actress Rachel Nicholls was brought in to fill the gap before the Producers realised what a boo-boo they had made and had to eat vast amounts of humble pie and go crawling back to TRY to re-sign Paget Brewster who already had another project lined up as did A J Cook? Also Thomas Gibson was sticking out for more dosh, reasonable in the circumstances as everyone was being treated like something the Producers had stepped-in rather than a hard-working, team of actors that had earned the series Multiple Awards.    Gibson got his dosh, and a new 2 year contract as did AJ Cook and I believe Brewster. Rachel Nichols was for her sins paid off.She was the innocent victim in all of this.  The series itself as far as the storylines, acting, etc was as usual faultlessly brilliant which only goes to show how the old adage of \\"if it ain't broke don't mend it\\" applies even to this? I only hope the Producers have learned a lesson from their collective stupidity?
B002PEP4SC|2.0|Sadly, this is not a great novel.  I wanted it to be because I'm a fan of the show but instead it reads like fanfiction except this one is the 'professional, make you pay for it' version.  The conceit of having a character from a show write a novel based on the series has great potential and as a fan it is fun to see the lines drawn between the book and series.  The characters were not well fleshed out although the dialogue did seem true to the show's characters, but the romance is hackneyed and stilted and the whole perfume reference?  And more than once?  Bad, bad, bad.  The writing style is basic (and in some places plain bad) which would have been fine if the story was more gripping with better character development. Also the story is more litteral than I expected - Richard seems to have taken the exact people he's been observing and thinly veiled them for the use of his books.  I wonder that Kate didn't have a go at him for making Nikki Heat so closely based on her - right down to her mother's murder, albeit in slightly different circumstances.  Does Richard not have enough imagination to come up with something more original?  He certainly seems to be capable in the series.  And the sex scene which is touted to be so very steamy by the serie's characters?  Not so much.    Richard Castle is meant to be a top mystery novel writer... this does not bear it out and the fact that all the characters have read and seem to enjoy the book in the series takes away from their credibility a little - which I am perfectly happy to overlook, but instead of enhancing the series, it is a dissapointing appendix. I will probably buy the next novel in hopes of something better although I'm not holding my breath.

0515149489|4.0|I have been looking for this book for quite a while, after I read a preview of the book.  The book was in very good condition, as a used book.  I would again order from Amazon.com. I like that I can find, hard to find items.
0316056863|3.0|Funny, breezy autobiography with very little dirt and a surprising amount of practical advice on comedy (the two-page section on 'How to Successfully Improv' is gold, Jerry, pure gold!). Some of the stuff on Fey's Sarah Palin is pretty interesting as well, combining the personal (Palin offered to have Bristol baby-sit Fey's duaghter during their co-appearance on Ssaturday Night Live) and the political (a few weeks later, Palin complained publically about all those mean impressions of her).<br /><br />You'll find out that a certain number of 30 Rock bits are based on reality (including the propensity of some male writers at SNL to urinate into containers in their offices because they were too lazy to go to the bathroom), though you'll get very little on the day-to-day workings of the show or wacky stories about wacky goings-on -- probably because 30 Rock is still airing, making it a bit of a necessity to avoid the chance of ruffling any feathers.<br /><br />Like Steve Carrell on The Office, Fey is a happily married parent who plays a gormless singleton. I'm not sure what that means in the Big Picture, but there it is. Fey also briefly explains where the scar on her face came from, a scar I wasn't actually aware she had until I read this autobiography. The Photoshopped cover riffs on Fey's experiences being on the covers of magazines, by the way.

0143038583|4.0|Once you read this, you will never again look at the food on your plate in the same way.  Some of it is hard to read, not because it is poorly written, but because it makes you realize that the lifestyle that we Americans have cultivated and grown to love is changing the landscape of the American farm and meat industry and it is not neccessarily for the good.  The Omnivore's Dilemma has forced me to really think about the foods I buy and what my family eats.  The author would likely be pleased to know that he inspired me to put my little spot of land to good use.  I think everyone who eats should read this, but especially if you are curious about where those eggs and that asparagus came from and what it took to get it to you.
1594488843|4.0|Still reading, about 3/4 finished.  I wholeheartedly agree with the basis of the Author's argument, but am hoping for more points on implementation in the latter 1/4.

B0000214F0|1.0|I purchased this because I thought it was about the excesses of the Roman Empire. It was so awful and offensive that I stopped viewing it half way through.

1451629184|5.0|[[ASIN:1451629184 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]]     This book is a true story of the accounts and details of what happened to Jaycee Dugard in HER OWN Words. Learning what this kidnapped 11 year old child went through for 18 years, and seeing the strong, wonderful, inspiring woman she has become is amazing. Her survival at the hands of the animals that stole her innocence is unbelievable and displays an admirable amount of courage not usual for a child or young woman. Nothing near as traumatic has happened to me in life, but her story shows me that there is nothing that I cannot overcome in life. I found this book not only to be theraputic for her but for me as well. I hope she becomes a motivational speaker one day and I have the opportunity to sit in her audience.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Just another wx app that doesn't function. Stay with the big players like twc and weather bug. Good concept but brings nothing new to the table.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|1* because this is not a movie - it is more of a computer animation project (or call it as you wish) in which some people (actors) and some story are included just to give it a false sense of being a movie.  Everything else but the computer magic is devoid of any meaning and sense.  Visually, totally impressive, no doubt, who likes those things will be awed.  I stopped watching after 30 or so minutes when it became clear what it is all about.

0553801473|2.0|First 2 books in this series were fantastic.  They were complex with interesting characters.  The characters later were revealed to have believable reasons for their choices.  No one thinks that they are evil.  Its all about perspective.<br /><br />In the foreward for the fourth book, the author stated that he had too much material and was splitting the book.  That the fourth book was about the lesser characters.  The fifth book covers roughly the same time period as the fourth, but showcases the more popular characters.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons is too long.  There are too many characters.  There are too many people mentioned in passing.  There are interminable pages and pages of description and handwringing introspection.  I was skimming and skipping by page 100.  What a huge disappointment.<br /><br />It is the authors creation and he might revel in it, but I don't enjoy it anymore.  I WOULD genuinely like to know what happens to the characters.  I just don't think that I care enough to be the 6th book and the 7th book and probably an eighth book.  Just stop, man, just stop.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I like the weather clock, but the radar... Even with wifi its downloading the global radar at about 1kb/s, and the killer problem was it placed my location in Antarctica?!?
0446691437|5.0|If you just said Steven Pressfield's The War of Art [[ASIN:0446691437 The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles]] was about the process of writing, it would sound boring. It is about that, but far from boring, it is the key to unlocking every project that sat in your desk for seven years, every New Year's resolution unkept, every unwritten book in your head. Read it for the calmness it brings you. Read it to get off the bench. Read it because the world needs your gifts.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Personally, I prefer to get tons of weather data packed into my smartphone screen as opposed to a pretty app that doesn't tell the whole story about the weather. This app tells the whole story, as well as the prologue, epilogue, series trilogy, and the prequels.

B003F76F3Q|4.0|\\"But if we're going to stay together, let's cut the deluded romanticism. Circumstance is the glue between us. I have you. You have me. We don't have very much else. And if we're going to stay together, from now on I tell you the truth, no comfortable lies - we're equal as we have never been equal before. You can take it or I can wait for the next train.\\" - On the train to exile, Leo's wife explains to him the state of their marriage<br /><br />Leo Demidov, trained by the NKVD and a World War II hero, is an officer in the Soviet MGB, the Ministry of State Security. As such, he's taken part in his share of early morning arrests and enhanced interrogations in the Lubyanka. It's 1953; Stalin is on his last legs, but Stalinism still holds sway, especially in the sekurity apparat.<br /><br />A jealous MGB colleague frames Leo's wife, Raisa, as a dissident. Because Leo refuses to denounce her to save his job, both are exiled to a bleak manufacturing city in the Urals, and Leo is demoted to the lowest grade of the militia. It's here that Leo finds Jesus, so to speak. Or rather, he discovers evidence pointing to a serial killer of children. Wishing to do something good for society for once, he proceeds with an unauthorized investigation in the face of the approved stance that the U.S.S.R., being the perfect state, has no murderers, especially serial ones. Caught out, Leo and Raisa are further punished. But Leo won't give up either on his sleuthing or his failing marriage.<br /><br />CHILD 44 is a revealing rendering of the official Soviet approach to state security versus common criminality at the end of the Stalinist era. It twists \\"to preserve and protect\\" into a travesty of the concept.<br /><br />Author Tom Rob Smith's focus is on character and milieu development, so I found the ending somewhat implausible based as it was - very minor plot spoiler here - on Leo's beeline to a particular folder in a particular file cabinet in a particular office in a particular city based on nothing more than what appeared to me as a lucky guess. It's as if Smith found himself with an overly long story that he had to wrap-up in a hurry, so I'm knocking off a star.<br /><br />CHILD 44 does contain a pretty good \\"gotcha\\" delivered in two parts. That, for me, is what makes this thriller as good as it is.e as a lucky guess. It's as if Smith found himself with an overly long story that he had to wrap-up in a hurry, so I'm knocking off a star.  CHILD 44 does contain a pretty good \\"gotcha\\" delivered in two parts. That, for me, is what makes this thriller as good as it is.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Great app. easy to use. replaced all of my other weather apps. I recommend watching the video demo. no problems on HTC thunderbolt
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is by far the most amazing and well made weather app, period. I have tried every weather app and nothing comes close to the reliability and forcasting this app provides. While others have some fun features that I wish Elecont would use, they just aren't reliable enough when it comes to the actual weather or gps tracked weather.
0062060554|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time.  Although it was a little predictable, it was very suspensfully written.  I could not put it down.  I have already recommended this to quite a few friends.  So glad I got it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a wonderfully done account of Queen Elizabeth's father, King George VI and his courageous battle with stammering.  Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter are brilliant in their portrayals of Bertie (King George VI), Lionel Logue, and Elizabeth, the Queen Consort of King George.

B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Loved it! Very fun to watch! Like many my brain went crazy trying to figure out what's up and whether it's true or not. The format tells me it's true since it's like a documentary but who said that it has to be? We are all used to the movies being in a certain format and thus it's ok for those stores to be fictional but it's not ok for this movie to be completely fictional? Wrong answer :) I enjoyed it very much. They probably spoiled it a bit by taking mail out of the mailbox (which is a federal offense) and also showing that postcards arrived the day those guys arrived to Michigan....I think too many days went by for cards to arrive so slowly...but I don't know. To me it felt like a real story but again....it maybe cause of format....maybe it is real....we'll never know maybe :) Fun movie.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Great product<br /><br />work well and am happy to use my keyboard & mouse<br /><br />recommended to my friends to buy it<br /><br />Thanks,

B0058EBNAO|5.0|Very attractive app. Requires some time to learn all the settings because there's a lot of options, especially for the widgets. Worked great on my Lg Ally.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I really like this app. The displays are informative and easy to read. The temperature clock is a nice display. I don't know what the reviews complaining about the radar are talking about. Radar loads fine and does not load in the entire US.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I thought the book was well but when they said it was short they were not kidding. I would not buy it had I known the ending.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I don't see how people can buy this and support Lucas changing something that meant so much to so many people.
0446563048|4.0|The book is an easy read and I did enjoy it. For the most part, the book follows the life story of Tony through childhood up until the day that he sold the company to Amazon. Those expecting ideas, principles, and bits of wisdom to apply to life and business will be somewhat disappointed. About the only thing that may be applicable to business is their mantra \\"Delivering happiness to the world.\\" They stand by this and explain the company's core values, each of which are aimed at delivering their higher purpose.    Other than letting you know that great customer service will be beneficial in the long run (meaning external and internal customers), the book is not really much else than an enjoyable life story.

B001P9EQH8|1.0|If you like a few different color LED lights this is for you.  If you want any real amplification of sound, this isn't the way to go.<br /><br />I tried this device on 2 different iPods and I honestly could not tell any difference with this plugged in line or not. If there is a difference it so imperceptible.  I was really hoping for this to work when on my (rather loud) motorcycle.  But forget that, it doesn't even raise the volume in a quiet room. Also the battery drains even when not in use.  I left it fully charged in a draw only to find it completely dead 3 days later.<br /><br />I saw some of the other posts stating the same thing, but I really wanted to believe  they just got a bad one.  Nope!

1594744769|4.0|The premise behind \\"Miss Peregrine's Home\\" is unique, and the story's execution is good. I am not a fan of fantasy novels, and this teetered on that line a bit much for me. The writing is good, but what made the difference for me were the photos -- creepy and compelling in a Ripley's kind of way. Even more amazing is that the pics are all real and from the collections of people who are into old, odd pics. If the author writes a follow-up or a new stand-alone novel, I'll definitely pick it up.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|What stood out to me in Jaycee Dugard's story was her steady refusal to not only look dead on at the truth of her horrible experience, but that she seems so free of hatred for her captors who destroyed so much of her life. I would not call it forgiveness, but more like acceptance of who they are and what they did and a determined refusal to let them ruin any more days of her life. If everything she wrote is true (and there is no reason to doubt her account of things), then she has every reason to sink into hatred of this sick man and his sick wife, for their crimes against her and for their refusal to take responsibility for it. Also, I can't believe she does not hold the State of California in contempt as well. I realize they paid her a significant amount for the damage she sustained while they consistently and reprehensibly failed to do their job (monitoring Garrido following his parole for an earlier sex offense). But still, it was chilling to read the passages where she actually is introduced to the parole officer as a niece, and the officer does not even question what a convicted child sex offender is doing living with a child! It left me wondering how many lost children might still be out there, alive today, because no one is seeking them, or really investigating the lives of perpetrators. God bless you, Jaycee, in your new life. I am so glad you made it home.

B0009UC810|2.0|The Blues Brothers, 1980 film    The movie begins with a view of a big city at night. The dawn reveals a smoky haze, and a 19th century prison in Joliet. A prisoner is brought out. [A lot of padding here.] A song to amuse the audience. Then we see a stunt with an old car on a drawbridge. They visit an orphanage that has financial problems. Are they a disappointing pair with filthy mouths? Can they raise the money to pay the taxes? And so their quest begins. \\"I have seen the light!\\" We see a song and dance. [What are they putting in the communion wine?] Elwood doesn't stop for a red light and is pulled over. We have a car chase for entertainment. [I guess that destructions is supposed to be amusing.] We see chain stores that are now just memories. [Was that the theme from \\"Peter Gunn\\"?] A rocket launcher? We see a cheap hotel. The police arrive, there is an explosion.    The brothers stop at a brick apartment house. They plan to reform the band and look up a friend in a fancy restaurant. There is an example of free speech by Illinois Nazis. Another song and music for entertainment. \\"Toasted white bread.\\" Another song and music for entertainment. They look for the last man in pawn shop. Ray plays a piano for old songs and dances. A woman throws flames. The band plays at a \\"Country & Western\\" bar. They have chicken wire in front of the band. More songs. Stand by your band? There is another comic skit and pursuit. They want a big venue for the biggest audience. Can they raise an audience? Will there be a problem? \\"Keep the change.\\" There is a song for the audience until Jake and Elwood arrive. Others are waiting as well. And so the big show begins, the audience cheers the songs. A record producer offers them $10,000 as an advance. Is it a deal? \\"Where did they go?\\"    A lone gunwoman shows up to complain about Jake's past actions (or lack thereof). They make a getaway. Police cars and a tour bus follow them. Who else? Three is a comic crash on the highway, an din the city. [Don't try this at home!] Then the Nazis chase them onto a highway under construction. Finally their car arrives at the Richard J. Daley Center. Can they get to the Tax Assessor in time? Yes. The last scene shows a performance in prison. What are the prisoners eating to energize them so?    Was this film intended to attract tourists to Chicago? It seemed funnier when I saw this thirty years ago. Maybe those skits are funny in the Second City or a TV show, but now seem dated. Note the uncensored use of firearms. Does this film have any socially redeeming values?
B001EN71DG|4.0|Score! I found this gem at my local TRU for 1/3 the price. I just wanted the theatrical releases on a digital format. Nothing MORE, nothing less. Of course, I would have preferred remastering but seeing as how George Lucas is the Anti-Christ, I will have to settle. I also have an upconverting blu-ray player. I had no idea of the acrimony over the upcoming blu-rays until I read the reviews here. I then found out about these theatrical releases on DVD. However, I was hesitant to shell out over a c-note for a trilogy, even this one. Especially if it was butchered. I had it in my cart but decided to google it. What do ya know, 6 stores in SE WI had limited stock. All had this gem at significantly lower prices than here. I had to confirm that the ONE store that had it was the right version: DVD, 6 discs, Luke and Vader on the cover, black and blue NOT the one with only Vader's mask and 4 discs. For those seeking digital nostalgia nirvana, \\"The force is strong is this one!\\" Say \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" to George. He will NEVER release the theatrical versions on blu-ray, NEVER!<br /><br />Google also said that BestBuy.com had it. Don't waste your time as you can only get it by \\"store pickup.\\" Good luck with that. I suggest targeting TRU's in locations with the lowest geeks per capita.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy]]

I am a big U2 fan and will most curious to hear their version of \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" a song that must be listened to only when the cruise control is firmly set below the speed limit because it just leads to excessing acceleration on my part!

B0058EBNAO|5.0|looks very good ,very informative, nice widgets, people seem to be having problems with the radar but not me with samsung infuse, people were saying that the radar is blurry try messing with the transparency in the settings and it looks great, radar does take a while to load.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The only thing to look forward to with this release is that Red Letter Media might possibly do another Star Wars Plinkett review. I cancelled my pre-order after Lucasfilm released the changes made to the films in this set. Noooooooooooooo more George.
B003L77GGK|3.0|I have been a fan of supernatural since it began and have really enjoyed the show up to this point. I was really excited for this season in the wake of the apocolypse and writing changes etc. However as the season started and went on I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. The whole purgatory and Eve story angle was intersting, but felt rushed and came off a little boring at times. Like others I will say towards the end of the season it did become a little more interesting and I am a interested to see how castiel's new role as a god will be developed. Overall this was a decent season, but pales in comparison to previous ones. So with few worthwhile episode I would recommend skipping this unless you just have to have it for the collection
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  I was expecting something lighter and less &#34;adult&#34;, I guess.  I loved the story so much that I went looking for a sequel (sadly, there is none yet).  Great book, great storyline, great writing.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I saw the original movie The Mechanic starring Charles Bronson which was good.  I thought this updated version starring Jason Statham was much better.  They changed the movie a little from the orignal to the better.  The action was really good.  Jason was excellent in the movie.  I really enjoyed the ending surprise.  This movie is very good and if you like Jason Statham you should enjoy this one.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Great DVD & CD.  STAND BY ME is the reason I bought this.  I play it AT LEAST once a day!  The singers are amazing but who ever put this together is more amazing!  Thank you.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I saw the movie Paul at a pre screening and enjoyed it so much I purchased it.  I felt the movie was done in good taste. There was a continuous flow in the movie.  They picked the right voice to play the part of Paul.  It is hard to belive that the animated alien and the humans weren't really in the scene together.  There was no time that you didn't believe they were together. I would recommend this to movie to people who enjoy a good laugh and have a sense of humor.
B0010X745K|4.0|I didn't like the ending. I can't tell you why only it depressed me. The rest of the movie was very good. Sort of remined me of a Twlight Zone or Outer Limits episode. The monsters in the mist were scary. It had a creative plot to it. I just wish the ending had been better for me. The ending for me is what made it a REAL HORROR ending.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|The movie kept you on your toes.  If only this was real.  The movie was interesting and entertaining.  Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro performed well together.  If you like fictional movies I would recommend this movie.  The movie was never slow, it moved at a good pace so it was easy to follow when going back and forth with what was happening.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I am a big Twilight series fan and heard that I should try the Vampire Diaries.  The first two seasons had already completed so I purchased season 1 and 2 on disc.  What a great decision.  I was hooked after the 2nd episode of the 1st season and have raved about it to my friends.  The cast is great and Damon is AWESOME!  I highly recommend the Vampire Diaries.  You won't be disappointed!
B0042JIL2E|5.0|What a great album.  I love the CD and it is worth getting the physical copy because of all the cover artwork and notes. If you like swing, or rockablilly Imedla May knocks it all for six.  Brilliant vocals, brilliant music, fantastic lyrics.  Hear the pathos, the houmour, the joy, the energy - it is all here.
1594744769|3.0|When his grandfather is killed, Jacob travels as far as a remote Welsh island to discover the truth behind the strange tales and photographs his grandfather left behind. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is as much about aesthetic as anything else, and if the cover intrigues then most of the book will satisfy: indulgent, creepy circuspunk brought to life by vintage photos, the book lingers gleefully in the dark corners of history. I'm not often scared by what I read, but the pictures attack the imagination from a second angle and do much to instill the aesthetic; while their inclusion eventually becomes contrived, they're on the whole a fantastic inspiration and one of the best parts of the book. Peculiar Children is a fast read, because of the illustrations but also because of its growing focus on action and its teenage protagonist--while not strictly YA, it shares the easy-reading first person POV that's common in that genre, and the prose is otherwise transparent. Initially, its consumability is as delightful as the aesthetic, making for a book that's easy to slip into for a few hours of immersive distraction. But in the end, Peculiar Children lacks something. What begins as a mysterious premise and promising worldbuilding develops into too much explanation with too little depth; at the end of the book there's no mystery, and, as a result, none of the intrigue and threat promised by the subtle impossibility of the images at its premise. Combined with an open-ended conclusion, the end of the book doesn't quite fall flat--indeed, insofar as one cares about the characters (Jacob's suburban frustrations are trite, and the rest of the cast is promising but underdeveloped), the book ends with an emotional climax--but it does betray its growing focus on action and drive home that the destination doesn't justify the trip. None of these issues are ultimately deal-breakers: Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is still brilliantly inspired and a fun distraction. But other than potential and a very handsome presentation, it's not much more than that. I recommend it ambivalently: there's no harm in reading it, especially if the atmosphere intrigues, but there'sction.

1594744769|5.0|This book is incredible!  Ransom Riggs keeps you going throughout the entire story; pulling you into his story so you do not want to put it down!  It is amazing the writing creativity performed in the book and linking the peculiar pictures to the story line.  He does an amazing job bridging the spans of WWII and present day.  I cannot wait until his next one!
0891419063|5.0|The book, `With the Old Breed' by E.B. Sledge, is a descriptive book describing the stink, gore mud and maggots of the dead littering the battle fields of the USA Pacific Island campaigns; the strategy of island-hopping all the way to Japan. Most books on the WWII do not describe in detail the stink and hamburger-red flesh littering a battle field - especially after a day in the hot tropical sun; this book does.<br /><br />Sledge was a newly minted Marine when he entered battle on the island of Peleliu (Pel' - e - lu). The battle for Peleliu has not received as much attention as say Iwo Jima, but was every bit a vicious battle.  Sledge survived the Hell Hole of Peleliu .<br /><br />Sledge was again sent into battle; Okinawa, April 1945. The Japanese by that time had given up the Banzai charges used earlier against the Marines. They had retreated into numerous mountainous caves on Okinawa. The Marines fought uphill into murderous fire from Japanese weapons; carnage does not describe the gore of cave battles. By the first of August,Okinawa was in US hands. Sledge survived. On the 8th of August, the US dropped the first A-Bomb. Japan Surrendered 15th August 1945.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Unfortunately being focused on and concerned about our economy, and continuing war against terrorism the majority of Americans know very little about the nation of South Africa, and the almost miraculous achievements of Nelson Mandela. Invictus is a brilliant biographical/sports drama directed by Clint Eastwood starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. The story is based on the John Carlin book \\"Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation\\" centered on events in South Africa before and during the 1995 Rugby World Cup, hosted in that country following the dismantling of apartheid regime. Freeman and Damon play, South African President Nelson Mandela and François Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby union team the Springboks.  The title Invictus is translated from Latin as unconquered, and is the title of a poem by English poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903).<br /><br />This is the true story of a man who was released after almost three decades in the harsh prisons of South Africa and that was to assume leadership of the nation that had imprisoned him. His personal forgiveness of white South Africa was the torch that illuminated that nation's Truth and Reconciliation Commissions. This being one of the very few examples in world history of a nations people who have actually made personal, and political efforts to address, forgive, and pardon the many brutal, and murderous actions of both sides in the struggle for freedom, and democracy. While Mandela attempts to tackle the country's biggest problems such as crime, unemployment, civil unrest, and international relations he watches a game of the Springboks, the national rugby team. Mandela knows that the blacks in the stadium always cheer against their home team, as the Springboks, and their team colors represent prejudice, and apartheid in their minds. Mandela remembers that he too did the same while imprisoned for 17 years on Robben Island. Many South Africans, both white and black, doubt that the rugby team will unite a nation torn apart by over half a century of racial segregation, conflict, and prejudice. For many non-whites, especially the ANC black leftist radicals, the Springboks symbolize white supremacy. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the international 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela is faced with the problem on whether or not to support or disband the faltering team. It is then that he decideds to meet with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar  (Matt Damon), and questions whether a Springboks victory in the World Cup might unite and inspire their nation. Mandela perceives Francois to be of good heart and character, and shares with him a poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his long lonely time in prison. Can and will Mandela's and Pienaars belief and stance behind their theory that this team can successfully unite the country prevail?  Could any nation obsessed by its national sport whether it is soccer, basketball, baseball, football or its standing in the World Olympics be able to unify, and redeem itself before a world audience?<br /><br />Clint Eastwood seems to have always had the unusual ability to understand the many irrational aspects of human emotion, and existence. Despite the numerous books, documentaries, and historical pieces written about South Africa it is he alone that has managed to make a wonderful, inspiring film about this important historical event, and its consequences. Morgan Freeman (who personally met, and befriended Mandela) does a great job of evoking the man Nelson Mandela, who is as much a secular saint of Africa as Gandhi of India is perceived to be. He portrays him as a cordial, confident, balanced yet strong personality.  Matt Damon gives what I believe to be the best performance of his career playing the tough, dedicated rugby captain, Francois Pienaar, an Afrikaner, child of racism, transformed by his contact with Mandela. Clint Eastwood, themasterful director, orchestrates, and directs one of the best movies of his long career and has us loving Mandela, proud of Francois and cheering for the gutsy, energized Springboks rugby team. This film could have gone bad in so many ways, it could have been too long, too preachy, too overacted, too over stated, instead it is a film that that is based on historical fact, both heartwarming, and inspiring in its message. It is wonderful entertainment, and a film whose significance concerning the ethical beliefs, and motives of a great leader should be a guideline for the rest of us to follow.ctor, orchestrates, and directs one of the best movies of his long career and has us loving Mandela, proud of Francois and cheering for the gutsy, energized Springboks rugby team.

You probably don't need this app, all android phones have a weather app built in, but this one is really pretty, and is nice on higher end phones.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from this product, as I had never had anything like this before, and I had read many mixed reviews of similar products. The Soundfly AUX MP3 Fm Transmitter is absolutely fantastic. The sound quality is wonderful, and it is very easy to use. I have had no problems at all! It was a LOT cheaper than replacing the broken CD player, and far more flexible too.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|If I buy a remastered version of Sgt Pepper, I don't want to hear newly added sound effects. If I buy a new deluxe printing of Lonesome Dove, I don't want to find parts have been re-written.    I was 9 when Star Wars came out, and I spent a good part of the summer of 1977 in the movie theater seeing it over and over again. I remember the death star explosion that looked like fireworks. I remember Obi-Wan's light sabre losing its blue color at certain angles.    These films were released into the world and for better or worse became a part of the collective consciousness. They were part of fabric of popular culture from that time and place. It's not whining to want the original versions in the best quality format. We just want to see it the way we remember it.    Hey George Lucas, think back to when you were making American Graffiti - a film that looked back fondly at much of the popular culture that YOU grew up with. What if you were putting that soundtrack together and found that no versions of the original recordings were available - that they had all been updated with electronic rhythm tracks and sounded different. That would have been a drag, right?
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones don't have the most amazing sound (just average) and I personally prefer over the ear style headphones for home use.  However, for the gym, especially the treadmill, bike and elliptical machines, these are much better than the over-the-ear ones I used to use.  They are extremely lightweight, so I would be careful how you handle them so as not to crush, bend, or snap them.  I do plan to be careful with them, not just throw them in a bag and forget about them. They were only ten bucks and the light weight is great for exercising.  They stay in place securely while exercising and thus I'm very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend these for sports/active use especially.  I also use them to watch movies on my laptop since they are so light weight and fit nicely in my ear (like ear buds).  I usually have trouble finding headphones that are not too big even on the tightest setting (whose head is so big anyway?), I am a 5'3\\" woman and these fit great. Not sure if they work great for a large man's head, but they fit my boyfriend and I suspect they will fit most people--they are adjustable. Does the job!  Glad I bought these.<br /><br />*Update: I really love these! They last about a year with constant, daily, rugged use and abuse.  I have sat on them, stepped on them, crushed them accidentally, all fine.  Finally after a year, the plug-end wasn't connecting properly anymore and causing weird sound issues and I had to toss them.  I bought another pair right away and have been using them for many months. I tried other more expensive headphones and hated them.  These are my all-purpose headphones now. Love 'em. :-)  Even if they last a year with daily abuse, that's fine by me.
1400069181|5.0|It has been a long time since I've read a book that stirred me and got me thinking about my future and what I want to accomplish. Start Something That Matters had me grabbing a pen, underlining, writing in the margins, and making notes about how I could change my life for the better.<br /><br />Author Blake Mycoskie shares his own story of how he came up with TOMS shoes and the concept of buy one, give one, a pledge that has provided over a million people with shoes they badly needed. He also shares numerous success stories about other people that will cause you to think about what you can do to change your life and help others as well.<br /><br />He encourages everyone to find their story, face their fears, and understand that giving is good business. In fact, the more you give the more you will receive back into your life - an old adage that Blake has brought back to life in a very real way. He also shares the steps you need to take in order to become a success at whatever you attempt to do.<br /><br />If you are not happy with where your life is at this time, this is the perfect book for you. It is amazing what someone can accomplish when they create from their heart with the purpose of helping others along the way.<br /><br />If you buy only one motivation book this year, Start Something That Matters should be that book. It belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who dares to try something new.
0385720920|5.0|I listened to a recording read by the author.  It was jaw dropping crazy but I loved it.  Maybe it was his reading that made it so good.  I think so.  I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed it as much if I was reading it.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|At first, I was so disappointed to learn that Something Blue was not about Rachel.  By the end of Something Borrowed, who didn't love Rachel???  I didn't care about Darcy.  I didn't much care for Darcy halfway through Something Blue, as a matter of fact.      This book was predictable in that you can really see where the story is going fairly early on.  What's wholly unexpected is that I would be a believer.  I didn't think it was possible to see Darcy as a sympathetic heroine.  But then slowly, I started to care.  And then care more.  And then by the end, I had as much love for Darcy as I did Rachel and felt the story was complete.        The message in this story, to me, was: We can never overcome past disappointments if we aren't accountable for the role we played in them.  After all, only crazy people keep doing the same thing, over and over, expecting a different result in the end, right?    Great message hidden in a great story.

B0058EBNAO|3.0|I really want to like this app. It has a lot of useful features and a lot of data, but the UI is just bad. It's awkward, jumbled, overcomplicated, and just generally confusing. The widgets are a jumbled mess.  The app is also well over 5MB installed.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I'm definitely a dog person and ever since I read it, I have to tell you I sometimes revert back to some of the things said in the book and wonder if my beloved puppy is thinking the same things.    I wasn't as much a fan of the \\"Racing\\" chapters; once I felt I understood the message, admittedly, I pretty much skimmed through the rest of them, hence the four star rating.    I've recommended this to several friends who, I felt, would appreciate the story.
0375701427|2.0|I know this book won the Pulitzer Prize and I know that Philip Roth is considered as a great contemporary writer, and I am not questioning the point in any sort of way, but I am afraid I am one of those who did not enjoy reading American Pastoral.     The story in itself is interesting, and sure enough Philip Roth has a specific style that is mostly enjoyable, but I cannot stand the repetitive pattern he uses in his story.   On and on it goes, the same event is narrated again and again, and again.... That bored me ... a LOT. And even the interesting writing style did not manage to make the read pleasurable to me.     What seems to be a particularity of Roth's style from what I recall of my reading The Human Stain and that The San Fransisco Chronicle describes as \\"At once expansive and painstakingly detailed\\"... is exactly what I did not like in the novel and made my reading of it \\"painstakingly\\" achieved. I would probably have dropped it if I did not have to read it for study purposes.

B0043M4TYY|1.0|I am specifically commenting on the Kindle edition. In one word: unusable.    The Kindle might work for books that one reads from start to finish, but it does not work with a very large book that one browses through and where one jumps from one part (where one currently is) to a vastly different part of the book (where one plans to go next).     First of all, it lacks a table of contents, so you have no clue what is actually where in the book. I had to look into a printed copy to get an idea of the rough outline of the book.    There is no usable index either and even when using one of the hyperlinks they only take to a Kindle page in the approximate region. If you try to search for, let's say 'Bali' it will take you to all mentions of Bali in the book, which are hundreds. You can then skip through every single one of them to get to where you want to get. Then you have lost the page you came from and start searching for that.    The maps are, while blown up 4 times (and thus spread over four Kindle pages), are still too small to read and with legend separated on another page really cannot be read. Some of the smaller maps have not been enlarged and are totally useless.    The printed LP benefit from a very careful layout which gives you an idea where you are. In the Kindle edition, you never have a clue where the next bit of important information could be found.     Lonely Planets on Kindle need a lot of work to be of any use. I would not buy one again.     Actually it was so bad, I would like to get my money back.

Wish I could go back in time and get my old LD's back. If only I'd known that those cuts would never be available again because of a petty a nasty director.

With the exception of 'Squares' all of the characters were pretty good and realistic.  I just could not buy into the 'Squares' character...seemed like a character that the author created just to branch some tough issues.  The storyline was exciting and with twists that I just didn't see.  I was intrigued up to the very last page.  I will definitely read another book by this author!

B00004T9VY|5.0|TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN is essentially \\"everybody's favorite Cat Stevens album\\".  It has the childhood whimsy of Donovan's A GIFT FROM A FLOWER TO A GARDEN, the adult beatnik contemplation of Dylan's Blonde On Blonde, and the madrigal folk styling's of Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention, Renaissance, and Pentagle.  One word sums up the whole art of TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN: Beautiful.<br /><br />Sometime after the \\"2nd Folk Revival was pioneered by The Weavers, Joan and Zimmy, and then Donovan and Joni further bent it into the musical revolution of the latter 60's, a burgeoning British pop performer with four hit singles and two 1967 albums (one of them a top ten charter) contracted tuberculosis and spent two years in hospital and convalescing, all the while contemplating life and spirit.  He studied meditation, metaphysics, yoga, and various religious holy books.  This newly found spirituality led to a musical change in both lyrics and style for him and `Cat Stevens', the new folk phenomenon of the 70's was born.  His two 1970 releases, MONA BONE JACKSON, and TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN became almost instant critical and commercial success stories, TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN became a gold record within 6 months of its release and a Billboard Top Ten seller (charting at #8).  This new introspective folk-rock style had mass appeal to the audience on both sides of the Atlantic and Cat Stevens had now established a signature sound.<br /><br />TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN is #206 on Rolling Stone Magazines list of the 500 greatest albums of all time!  It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.  Finally, in 2007, it was also included in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame's \\"Definitive 200 Albums of All Time\\".<br /><br />So why all the accolades for this album over say, TEASER & THE FIRECAT, or, CATCH BULL AT FOUR?  Again, it is simply a beautiful work of art.  All of the songs immediately work their way into your head.  They are simple and yet very deep.  They depict a journey in terms of human conditions, the beginnings of Cat Stevens', and by extension our own, search for truth and light in a very dark world.  This album is food for the soul and the spirit.  It makes you feel, it may even make you think, but most importantly it makes you feel.  The music is not ingrained in traditional folk, nor is it quite modern folk, yet it has all the best virtues of both worlds, in a sense, it is old and new.  And having said that, this album has not aged a day, nor will it ever.  It is timeless.  This album is the Grimm's Fairy Tales of our time, we keep reading those and those who come after us will read those and listen to TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN.<br /><br />To this day I usually claim that TEASER & THE FIRECAT is my favorite album of Cat's, however in a pinch I usually find myself tossing this one on more often and it is not purely out of habit.  TEASER has elements which are more personal to me and when I am of a mood to really `listen' I will tend to the TEASER first, however...  Like Donovan's GIFT FROM A FLOWER, the purity of TEA FOR THE TILLERMAN, the seductive outward simple-ness of what hides vast universes inside it, is what makes this album truly great.  It has powerfully incredible sound for a two-track recording.  The remaster of this achingly demonstrates the triumph of talent that was Cat Stevens, Alun Davies, and band.  This is a guaranteed winner to anyone who buys it, one of those `desert island' albums that ends up on everyone's list of must-haves when the world blows up.  Speaking of... when you listen to this album, you will find that Cat Stevens is indeed giving us a gift in contemplation of our enjoying it to full measure, before the world blows up.<br /><br />So pick this flower and plant it in your garden.an conditions, the beginnings of Cat Stevens', and by extension our own, search for truth and light in a very dark world.

Speaking of... when you listen to this album, you will find that Cat Stevens is indeed giving us a gift in contemplation of our enjoying it to full measure, before the world blows up.    So pick this flower and plant it in your garden.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I took like a couple of min to get my location but once locked the weather information was top notch. the best :part is the weather breakdown every hour. amazing
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is the most addicting game I have ever played on the android platform. I can't rate it highly enough. More that they allow sharing of solutions it is even more fun. Droid x gingerbread.
B0026PW67W|3.0|For a real fan of the series, this map is a double edged sword. First of all, the other complaints were right in that the houses are NOT marked. At all. Some classes are but I doubt they're actually in the right place. A previous commenter said that TRUE fans won't care because they just want a \\"Maurders Map\\". In my case, that was true. However, I can see a lot of my friends (Who are fans) getting very upset because of that. However, I love the little comments that say \\"Beware moving staircases\\" and \\"beware boggart in this closet\\" and while the map DOESN'T have the parchment feel some fans (And I, admittedly) wanted it's not bad. And the shipping was really quick. ;)<br /><br />And there is ONE problem I have to point out. Some people said their lines on the front didn't match up. Mine has that problem SLIGHTLY at the bottom but it doesn't really upset me. There's a FOLD in the map which did annoy me for a while but it's small and I think I can straighten it out with a school text book. ;) Even if I can't, I'm fine with it. I'd get a kink in it anyways, I'm sure, and I'll use this as my one problem so I won't make another.<br /><br />Okay, basically? It's not the amazing Map people wanted but for a collection-or a cosplay!- it can't be beat. The shipping was fast and even though there was a small fold I wasn't enthused with, I do like the look of the map. I also got the wand of Sirius Black and that was in perfect condition.<br /><br />Thank you and blessed be.
B0001E7LMU|1.0|This is the German version of the game.  The game plays the same, but the rules are in German.  So if you know how to play, or look up the rules online you should be fine.  Just don't be shocked when it takes a month to get to you, and is then in German
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I had a VERY hard time putting this book down.  I spent the majority of my early-teen years dialing into BBS systems on my 14.4K modem, playing text-based RPGs such as Swords of Chaos and MajorMUD, and this book took me right back to that time.  This book features wonderfully developed characters, an imaginative story line, and so many pop-culture references that you would probably need to read it dozens of times to catch them all.    If you were a nerd back before nerds were in vogue, this is going to be the best book you'll read all year.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|overclocked to 3.9 ghz and turbo at 4.1ghz, really i could probably go higher on both, its staying pretty cool.  i added a fan to it as well, so i have two fans  blowing it towards another fan which is my rear exhaust.  couldnt be happier.  someday if i make enough money i'd like to upgrade the processor and an h100 corsair liquid cooler, but thats at least a yr away so this is plenty good lol
B0058EBNAO|1.0|This is the first time I have felt it necessary to write a negative review. I have no idea if the app works as after waiting for 5 minutes it still had not displayed any data. On top of that the ui is completely counterintuitive. Not worth the time it takes to download. Droid x gingerbread
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Works well. nice graphics. good selection of widgets. I did have to wait a bit for the first update but after that no problems.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|the radar does not even allow for cloud cover or other things to be included.  weather. com app's radar is much better and easier to use
B0058EBNAO|3.0|The app got my location fine by entering my zip code (I have wifi/gps location disabled), and the UI could be better (a bit confusing.) It seems to often cause a force close if you zoom in and out of the radar screen. Other than that, this app is pretty decent, but not worth the $3 price tag if you ask me. D2G
B005CA4SJW|5.0|The one thing that must be said about \\"The Walking Dead\\", and I quote, don't walk away from this captivating series or dismiss it as horrible.  It is a modern classic piece of filmography and deserves a chance to convince you of its greatness.  It is unlike any other show on cable and simply well-constructed and acted; these characters show us a side which answers how people would relate to a world completely changed and a life you would have to appreciate if given a chance to survive.  I have never been very drawn to comic stories, but this graphic novel series has completely changed my views and I am hooked!  I can't wait for the new season on October 16th!  I have everyone... aunts, uncles, cousins (of age, of course) and friends waiting in desperation.  This is clearly a show to collect and a series to be watched.  I have read ALL of the graphic novels to date and hope that you will too, so you'll understand what I am saying.  Robert Kirkman is a master of his craft.  In praise of George Romero, thank you for bringing the zombie lifestyle for us to discover and encouraging the craft to continue.  I am so impressed with everyone's work on this series!  Thank you.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is a great weather ap it is now my favorite one I have.  no idea way the complaints.  It is a perfect widget . It works perfect on my T-Mobile my touch 4G
B0058EBNAO|1.0|HTC Inspire. stuck on clock screen like many others. uninstalled. would have been nice to actually try this app. maybe an update will change this problem so many are having.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|This movie opens with a lovely, artfully done scene with Hana stalking and killing a large elk in a isolated snowy forest. Remember that scene because that is about the most you are going to get out of this movie. After that it disintergrates into a \\"babe-in-the-woods\\" hodgepodge. After emerging from said woods, she is basically a cave-girl overwhelmed and distracted by a modern world (yep - she discovers electric lights, TV and radio, goes on a first date, makes a first friend and has her first kiss). Yawn. The bad guys are silly caricatures. The fight scenes between the bad guys and her dad are dry, clumsy, unrealistic, amateurish and just the worst I've ever seen. For a honed assassin Hanna spends most the time depending upon the kindness of strangers, running and running (a lot of running), and hiding.  If you want to see a silly movie about a budding teenager discovering life outside of a log cabin this is the one to see. If you are expecting anything (you name it) else from this movie - run.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I too ran into some of the same issues mentioned by the negative reviewers, BUT... They all resolved in short order. Seems  a matter of error messaging. For example, the first time I looked to the radar, it did not find me. However, upon looking again, it was just fine. There are a couple of quirks that i am not thrilled about (like demanding gps from first run... I was inside) and it was difficult to realize that i could manually enter my location... perhaps a prompt? but why do we need fine location for that? I am sure that tower location would suffice! Anyways, its pretty cool...
B0040JHWKS|3.0|If you are considering buying the pricey and poorly packaged box set - forget it. Get the discs   separately. You get nicer cases with liner notes and photos not in the box set. Trust me I bought the box  and then resold it here on amazon since it was so clumsy designed and you didn't get any real story behind  the songs for this collection. The notebook concept is useless and gimmicky - you don't need it.    Great collection once you get over all the trickery behind the facts that some of these tracks are newly  recorded vs direct from the vaults.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|The application gave plenty of info &amp; the radar seemed fine. I also liked the various options of widgets to choose from. Only problem is it wouldn't update the weather or location. Would say it can't find gps location (which I keep off), but I dont leave gps on all the time. Can't find cell towers for some reason. HTC Evo4g
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|The DVD is Great for the whole family.  Not only is it funny but denotes real characteristics about Bees.  There are currently a lot of movies/DVD's that are too violent with intense sexual scenes and the low level language would make a Sailor blush.     Since Young persons imitate what they see and hear, this video along with parental guidance would assist in providing a positive balance for them.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|I was hoping this would work because it looks pretty cool but it's unable to find my location by the gps or my zip code.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Dr Dukan's weight loss program is an amazing way to drop unwanted pounds and inches!<br />I know because I have lost 25 pounds by following his books instructions (check out my utube videos and blog on blogspot.com).<br />I began the diet weighing in at 161pounds in mid May 2011, its Sept 8, 2011 and I now weigh 138pounds!<br />I went from a size 13/14 to a 6! I highly recommend it for anyone serious about shedding body fat and changing their unhealthy eating habits.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|I love finding new weather apps and you would think if they were going to sell it for $3 that it would be good but I live in a major city area  (Dallas/Ft Worth)  and it would not pull up my location, i tried all options and nothing, it never came up... i hope they can fix this.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Had difficulty setting up location. Then it crashed with popup saying to reinstall from amazon. Widgets are kinda ugly. Wished it worked better, kinda like the info it offers. Htc inspire.
B000JML7YC|3.0|Northanger Abbey is a great addition for those who are already Jane Austen fans, but it's not a good choice for first-time Austen readers (or even, second or third-time Austen readers). I have now read all of her novels save Mansfield Park. Northanger Abbey is not without its merits, but overall, it is underdeveloped. According to Wikipedia, it is the first novel that Austen wrote, but among the last published. Knowing the novel's history helps one be more understanding and sympathetic towards all of the book's flaws. In fact, arguably, the value of this novel is precisely its unpolished state, for that provides precious insight into Austen's thoughts and development as a writer.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is the title's heroine. You know that she is the heroine because the author explicitly tells you at the outset. She is invited by family friends, Mr and Mrs. Allen, to travel to Bath, where she meets her hero. Again, you know who the hero is because the author explicitly tells you. When she first arrives at Bath, she bemoans her lack of acquaintances. Slowly but surely, she meets some friends; and thus, the first half of the novel revolves around Catherine's social life in Bath. The second half of the novel brings Catherine to Northanger Abbey, which gives the author an opportunity to poke fun at gothic settings.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is largely a parody of popular gothic novels during Austen's time. Not having any knowledge of the gothic novels that Austen references, such as Udolpho, I couldn't properly appreciate Northanger Abbey. The best analogy I could think of was if someone today wrote a parody of Twilight, not in a mean way, but in a good-natured humorous way. Then two hundred years from now, someone reads the parody version without ever having heard of Twilight. That's the analogy I had in my head as I read Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />Thus, I tried to appreciate this novel for what it was. But still, I didn't care for the characters or the plot of Northanger Abbey. I never really took to Catherine Morland in the way that I always took to the heroines in Austen's other novels. Catherine's personality lacked that fire, that spark present in Austen's other heroines. I also didn't care for the story in this novel. Not much happened, and what did happen was choppy. Certain plot elements towards the end felt abrupt and I didn't get sufficient closure on certain characters at the conclusion of the novel.<br /><br />One unusual aspect of this book is that the author sporadically interjects herself into the novel, and even offers a lengthy ranting defense of novel readers in Chapter 5. From this I infer that others in Austen's society must have looked down on novel readers. Ironic, isn't it? Nowadays Jane Austen novels are considered classic literature, and I imagine that those who read classics are more likely to look down upon those who don't. Anyways, the author's direct interjections are weird and out of place. I know that sometimes writers speak directly to the reader as a literary device, but that is not the case here. Austen is just randomly spewing her thoughts here for no good reason.<br /><br />All of my complaints aside, I must give Austen credit for writing a pretty humorous novel. Some of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are delightfully funny. The parody of the gothic setting is amusing, even if not fully appreciated. I might even say that among the Austen novels I've read, this is the funniest.I never really took to Catherine Morland in the way that I always took to the heroines in Austen's other novels.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|UI is really nice and very detailed. Enough to satisfy the weather fanatic and casual weather goers alike. Plenty of options to choose from plus a ton of notification options. I may use this permanently as my go to weather app.<br /><br />But like the previous comment states, the radar could use some work. I noticed a blurriness on the radar that looked like it was still buffering. God forbid you use the radar on 3g. It took 1 min for 2 frames to load and I had a force close after I went to radar options. So that meant I had to reload the radar frame by frame which was unpleasant.<br /><br />Other than that complaint I think this app is as close to a perfect server app that we will get. Until the next big app comes out or this one is improved, then it may be the perfect weather app. Why not try it because it is free today.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Would I pay $3.00 for it? No. However, this app is pretty cool. Not sure it's needed as I have The Weather Channel app, but it works. In using the Motorola Atrix and it found my location right away. Anyone having problems needs to learn patience and how to read.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I don't regularly submit reviews for Apps especially when I agree with the average rating which this time I do not. worth every penny of the 3 bucks asked!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I loved this movie - loaded with subtle and not so subtle direct references to every great and every cheesy Sci-Fi & Fantasy movie made. There are direct quotes from Alien, Men In Black and Star Wars. If you aren't a huge Sci-Fi geek (which I am) you may not even be aware of these moments. Excellent cameos by famous folks in the Comic-Con genre also....funny alien, Shaun of Dead guys, Blythe Danner, quotes & music from all the old favorite movies....what's not to love?<br /><br />It is a bit crude and if you're hyper about your religion this is sooooo not the movie for you. However, if you have a sense of humor, this is worth an evening.
1936719118|5.0|I found it really easy to understand.   A different way to create a business just based on common sense, and good advice to start your own business.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|What a weird app. It takes forever to update and its hard to understand what it all means. Must be for a weather enthusiast I guess. Won't update on a tmobile G2X.
0375851569|5.0|Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?! Got these for my daughter who is 7 months old.  My wife and I read them to her and she loves the colors.  Although she would love to grab the pages, rip them out and eat them, but she is only 7 months... This is a pretty good value too.  You are basically getting 5 books for under $6.  The same books at Walmart are around $8.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|wow, the best weather program ever for windows mobile has come to android!  eye candy is a little fancier than I remember, and a little fancier than needed, but all of the information is still right there where you need it and easy to access.  click on location at top to add new location.  fully customizable status bar alerts if desired.  I don't know why these guys don't have elecont displayed proudly in the title of this app.  I would have purchased it a long time ago! as it is, I'm just glad I found this.  (who knew finding an app could be so fun)<br /><br />if needed, elecont always had great customer support on their forums.  i hope everyone supports this development team.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|Loads of fun. lots of logic involved. Very challenging yet solvable. A lot of levels (more than 100) each with unique challenges.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|This app does provide a fair amount of data, however it is presented in a counterintuitive manner. it's surprising that they expect people to pay for it. needs a complete UI overhaul
B004SEUJKU|5.0|If you dont own the blu ray version yet, this is the one to buy.  My only complaint is that it is the cheaper type of blu-ray book where the disc rests in a sleeve rather than the plastic disc holder of better Blu-Books.
0307948560|5.0|Ah, the age old question, Can you really have it all? And at what cost? Women are constantly being told that they can do it all, career success, financial success and still raise a happy family and be the perfect homemaker. You can't help but wonder if we are setting ourselves up for failure, or at least a nervous breakdown. Are we trying to do TOO much? Kate Reddy is facing just this dilemma. She's a working mom struggling for balance amidst a world that is moving far too quickly to even attempt \\"keeping up.\\" The book looks at a woman's life from every angle. The career woman trying to raise healthy, happy, confident children, maintain a loving marriage and build a successful career while fighting the powers that try to thwart her at every attempt. We also see the stay-at-home moms who feel they have put too much into raising a family and lost sight of themselves as individuals, as women with dreams and goals. With humorous and honest storytelling, Pearson has created a truly enjoyable novel that offers an unfiltered glimpse into the lives of women and the effects of modern motherhood.
B0000029GA|5.0|I really love how when you click this album Amazon suggest that you buy it with Enter Wu Tang and Low End Theory by Tribe Called Quest!!! This album and those two along with Ready to die by biggie are my favorite New York Rap albums ever and the most amazing part is that they are all pre-1995 which should tell you something about Hip-Hop in 2011: It blows. This album is the epitome of amazing lyrics and beats combined to create a smooth and chill listening experience much like The Low End Theory which is in stark contrast to the raw and harder beats of Ready to Die and Enter Wu. Nas is a killer artist and I love everything he puts out but this is just tops all the way. SOLID 5
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I'm in my mid fifties and normally only listen to Classic Rock and Classic R&B. My eight year old grandson approached me one day not too long ago and told me that I might like the music of an artist named Bruno Mars. I bought this CD and I think it's fantastic. I have not read all the reviews, but the few I've read compare him to Michael Jackson. Yea, he's got a little MJ in him, but I believe his voice is more favorable to that of a young Smokey Robinson. At any rate the tunes on this CD are catchy and I recommend it to music lovers of all ages.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|What a great movie and the fact that I adore Russell Crowe does have alot to do with it.  He is great in this movie!  The soundtrack is also worth the money...........I loved it and to see Mr. Crowe play the violin is great as well.  He said that it was the hardest thing that he's ever done for a movie............to learn the violin.  It's a movie that you can watch more than once!  You will always catch something that you missed the first time.
0553801473|1.0|This is easily the weakest of the 5 books.  Even AFFC was more enjoyable, as it was at least interesting to watch Cersei unravel everything Tywin and Tyrion had built.  As has been stated before, this book is very weak on plot development.  I heard the author say that if plot development is all you care about, you should just read the synopsis.  That the books are about character development.  That's fine, but character development and plot go hand in hand, how can a character develop without anything happening around them?  There were so many chapters where I got to the end and asked myself if anything happened with the plot, or any character development, and there just wasn't.<br /><br />The example that sticks out in my mind is the wedding of Ramsay Bolton to Jeyne Poole.  All that happened was they got married, but it's one of the longer chapters in the book.  Nothing developed with the characters, reek was still weak, Ramsay was still a dick and Jeyne was still scared.  The only thing accomplished was making the reader uncomfortable with explicit descriptions of sex and torture.  I have absolutely no moral qualms about what was written, but given that it did nothing for plot or character development it just left me frustrated.<br /><br />Even the characters' motivations I find myself questioning.  Why does Daenerys care so much about slaves?  Why is she so apprehensive about using her Dragons?  I understand why someone today would have these concerns, but in the context of the world Martin has created I don't understand it.  It's like he just decided to create a character with modern values.  It's hard for me to care and understand Jon's motivation to get as many people as possible to man the wall when there's been nothing all that scary revealed.  I'm five books in and I still haven't seen an \\"Other\\".  Just some wights which apparently die really easily if you stab them with glass.<br /><br />Having read all five books consecutively I find myself getting tiredof the same phrases used over and over.  How many times do I have to read \\"little and less\\", \\"much and more\\", \\"dark wings, dark words\\", \\"words are wind\\", \\"you know nothing, Jon Snow\\", and \\"where do whores go?\\"  It makes me cringe every time I see them.  But just as Martin overuses these phrases, he also overuses the same plot devices.  GRRMs use of the cliffhanger and killing of main characters reminds me of M. Night Shyamalamalans twists.  It's so ridiculous that he has to include a single Jaime chapter in this book just so that he can end his storyline on a cliffhanger instead of where we left him in AFFC.<br /><br />This book and AFFC would have been much better if kept a single volume with all the fat trimmed out.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|gps does not work. zipcode does not pull up weather.. total junk... it also has an ugly clock that does seem to work.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm just lending my voice to the cause.  Please boycott this product to show that Lucas' changes are unacceptable.  I've already cancelled my pre-order.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|wanted to edit photos I've taken of my baby.  select of existing images via gallery just flat out doesn't work.  how to get refund through amazon...oh yeah, there is none ...do not buy!!!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I too had  problem when I first installed it.  But I uninstalled then reinstalled and it had already found the location, lots of features to get used to, but once it works, its really really nice.  Unlike some others, I find it to be very accurate, it will display FEELS like temp, and the Air temp, people, these are 2 different things....
0316069884|5.0|As I read this book, I kept thinking, \\"If only I had known.\\" It's shocking that for so many years I could have helped perpetuate practices that destroy and threaten all life--not just animal life--on this planet. And never realized it. Like so many others, I just stupidly shopped, consumed, shopped, consumed, shopped, consumed. Never truly questioning the source of the food I prepared for myself and my children. Never genuinely realizing or even considering the true cost of my consumption. Unless you just truly do not care about the survival of the planet for human life, read this book. I am so grateful that I will now make more informed and intelligent choices for myself and my children.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Lots of cool features and graphics. Very professional! Nice colors and seems pretty straightforward. I would like to turn off the notification bar input but I haven't figured out how yet.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|I love the depth of information that this application provides, but the location tracking does not work for me. I tried tracking by gps and cell towers and i got the wrong location. I also tried typing the zip code and it gave the wrong location. This app looks great, i just wish it worked out.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I've read many of the reviews on Amazon and on the internet, and it seems like Lucas is shifting the series away from his hardcore base to appeal to the large majority (which is where the money is).  To those that don't care about the changes, you're right that it's his prerogative to do this, but that doesn't mean we have to like it (or buy it).  I won't be buying this collection and will stick with my DVD's.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Ok my first impression was that I liked this app. Very impressive graphics and layout. Then I went to the radar,  which is mainly what I'm looking at when I open a weather app,  and was less than impressed.   First of all, it wants to download the radar for the entire country frame by frame. I'm on wifi right now and it still took too long. I can't imagine it on 3G. Secondly, the graphics on the radar look fuzzy. Almost like it's not finished downloading yet.   If the radar isn't what you're after in an app this one is definitely cool and stylish. I especially like the clock view.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|App is decent, provides a lot of useful info. Perhaps I'm a little vain, but the low-res forecast clock widget turned me off of app. If the forecast clock widget looked as good as it did within app, my opinion would be different.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|Amazing talent. Thankfully, she left us with a few gems. Bless her soul. I recommend getting this soulful, well-crafted album.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|There are really two parts to this film.      The first one is a beach and underwater film with the characters portrayed by Paul Walker and Jessica Alba.  If you look at the cover of the blu-ray, that picture is worth a thousand words, and that's pretty much the first part of the film.  This blu-ray also features Scott Caan, from the current TV series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\".  It's a fairly peaceful life on an island paradise.     The second part of the film involves discovery, temptation, guile, violence, guns,  danger, betrayal, and death.  You also have the introduction of a bunch of crazy, nasty, wicked, vile and murderous characters.  Who wants to watch all the gore and pain?   Sometimes, you just don't want to see blood everywhere.    You can summarize it as a Garden of Eden theme, with knowledge, temptation, and a fall from Grace, sending them from a peaceful paradise into a twisted hell.    Needless to say, I prefer the first part.  I give five stars for the first part and just ignore the second part.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Love every minute of this video! Such a great video to remember MJ.... well worth the purchase. This is definitely a great video of Michael the way we loved him!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Works fine for me answer all my weather needs. Love the earth alert feature it as has loads of widgets that give you a lot of play.
B000002KJM|4.0|ZZ Top, or as many people would call them, That Little Ol' Band From Texas, is truly a band with staying power. 14 albums (Well, soon to be 15), 40 years, and NO lineup changes, they are truly one of a kind and a rare breed indeed. It's hard to imagine this band any other way: The gutsy vocals and deep-fried pickings of Billy Gibbons, the rattling bass of Dusty Hill, and the excellent drumming of Frank Beard (the only one without a beard, thank you very much). The band has virtually reinvented the blues, almost to a self-parody of sorts (I'm of course talking about their 80's blunders, which they have made up for with their more recent heavy albums). But all seriousness aside, they are just a good fun rock and roll band, and that's all their music is.<br /><br />ZZ Top's first album, which came out in 1971, is a fantastic introduction to their boogie rock stylings. While it doesn't have any of the big hits that became their calling cards, it does establish their sound, their attitude, and their quirks. The songwriting is already unique in itself, using clever double entendres in their sexual repertoire. Each song just hits hard, whether it's the radio-friendly Somebody Else Been Shaking Your Tree, the mean riffing of Brown Sugar, or the laidback grooves of Squank and Backdoor Love Affair.<br /><br />The band also doesn't mind getting a little heavy in the riff department, as songs like Going Down To Mexico showcase a mean British side to their blues rock. One can say that Billy was a fan of Black Sabbath during this time even! Also, what's prevalent on here and not on future releases are slow ballads, and Old Man is definitely one of those, a slow burner with a lot of soul.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great intro to the world of Top; slick but unpolished, raw but professional, bluesy and rocking all at the same time. That's the Top for ya.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|At first, I thought this was going to be an action movie.  It was not, although there are some action scenes.<br /><br />Then, you find out quickly that it is a love story.  Love found, love lost, and then love found again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't care for neither the politician nor the dancer.  The politician has issues, including excessive drinking and partying, that haunt his political career.  All of a sudden, he seems to be having a tryst with a party-crashing dancer.  Doesn't this sound way too familiar?<br /><br />Then, there's the element of the Adjustment Bureau, a large group of bureaucrats with the supernatural power to guide human destiny.  I didn't care for the bureaucrats either.  There's infighting, there's disagreements on how to solve a problem, and there's a bureaucrat who doesn't want to follow the rules.  Doesn't that sound too familiar also?<br /><br />So, you have the imperfect politician, the disrepectful dancer, and the bumbling  bureaucrats, with all three running around in circles and finally with the bureaucrats giving chase to the two, trying to determine some plan.<br /><br />I don't think the story succeeded in what is was trying to do.  What was the story about anyway?  There's the love story.  As a love story, I'll give it 5 stars.<br /><br />But what about the question raised with the Chairman?  Is it a reference to God?  Is the Chairman fallible or infallible?<br /><br />The bureaucrats are certainly fallible, with failings.<br /><br />I can see how some people may have issues with the whole concept of the Chairman, the bureaucrats, and the two lovers, which points to the greater issue of predestiny and ultimately, God.<br /><br />But when you think about it, it is just a love story and Sci-Fi film, with a twist of some overarching hierarchy, to give it drama and action.  I just accept it as that and no more.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|The movie has some slow songs in the musical at times, but if you like Abba songs, and the Greek Isles in a crisp blueray picture, paying extra for this movie in a blueray format won't dissapoint you. Great effort was also made to insure the extras in this BD were also blueray quality which many times the studios skimp on, and this BD is full of extras. Enjoy.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Tres Hombres, released in 1973, was ZZ Top's first Top Ten Record. It couldn't have happened to a better album, in my opinion. This is the Top at their best, their shining moment. ZZ Top finally gelled their sound, their attitude, and their style down to a slick machine of a band, and it shows in every way possible.<br /><br />On the surface, you could say that this is just another blues rock album, but that's exactly what's so special about it. It's one of the best produced blues rock albums ever recorded, with just enough rawness to make it not seem cliched and forced. It has a filthy, sexy groove and an infectious feel to it, thanks to the growl of Billy Gibbons' guitarwork and the rhythm section of Dusty Hill and Frank Beard. Their humor, their attitudes, and their musicianship all shine through, with no artificial fakeness. Plus, all of these songs are winners. Every bar band I've ever seen has to have \\"Waiting For The Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago\\" and \\"La Grange\\" into their repertoire. It's just an unwritten law.<br /><br />Aside from the standout hits, there's some great songs on here too. The insanity of Master Of Sparks, the Sabbath-tinged Precious & Grace, the sheer fun of Move Me On Down The Line, and the Southern soul stylings of Hot Blue & Righteous and Have You Heard? It's just a very consistent album.<br /><br />Another fine gem from them Texas boys, buy it whenever you can.

B005CMSDKA|3.0|(SPOILERS CONTAINED IN REVIEW)  Drone teenager is trained to grow up to become an assassin and kill her mother's killer. While dodging bullets on her first mission and never missing a shot she discovers the outside world, having been locked in a cabin in the woods all her life. The mission to kill her mother's killer does not begin until she throws a homeing becan device which will alert her mother's killer to her location. Duh... yeah that's always a good move for an assassin right? Im believing all this :P The movie opens with some good action scenes but what follows is an action movie that stalls in both story and believable action. Check out the 1991 movie Lafemme Nikita if you want to see this genre done better.

I agree that maybe he's introducing more characters than you can keep up with, but I use the wiki page to keep them straight!<br /><br />If you think of this as one great big story and not just this book, it gets 4 stars IMO.

B000PMLFRA|4.0|Yikes! George Lucas is changing Star Wars. Who would have thought!? But as we start to try and get past things we cannot change (hey, its part of being an adult), we have to actually look at the quality of the release and not fall victim to the little whiny brat inside all of us-- I call him Hayden.    So, should you buy these on Blu-ray? Good question. Do you own an HD TV? Do you or have you ever loved Star Wars? If the answer to both of these questions is yes, then I'm afraid that I have to tell you that you should indeed give George Lucas more of your money. Changes aside, the quality of these discs is unparalleled. These are the new demo discs for your home theater. Previously, these films have only been available in 1080p on Cinemax (what an awesome promotion that was) and then on Spike (which I'm pretty sure is also 1080p but you get commercials so...). Prepare to see details that you've never seen. SEE the finger print smudges on Luke's lightsabre as it is in the clutches of the Emperor. FEEL the roar of the Millienium Falcon as it flies through an asteroid field. The weird thing about Star Wars in HD is that it makes you appreciate the detail of the original films despite the changes.    Look, these changes are horrible. We know that. But the Darth Vader thing becomes more tolerable each time I see it. The Ewoks blinking is a little distracting because you might find yourself looking at the amount of blinking that every character, Ewok or not, is doing on screen. And I'd love for Lucas to have Han shoot first, but he doesnt and if you're really being honest with yourself, this is the best incarnation of that scene yet. Before, it looked like Han was doing some weird head move. That's fixed.    The bottom line is that these films have never looked better and the difference in quality is certainly worth the price whether you hate the changes or don't really mind. Personally, I hate them...but you try to get over things when you're not 12.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Like everyone else nothing happened for the first few minutes. I was stuck with a clock and then everything updated. It all looks really cool. I like the earthquakes listing... But it isn't really helpful. I couldn't turn off the status bar notification.... So I'm uninstalling it.
076115728X|5.0|We have kids in our school that can be super hard on themselves, especially when they make a mistake. Beautiful Oops gives kids new perspective on those so called mistakes. Can I get three cheers for optimism!? Maybe you didn't get the math problem correct or you flubbed up a situation with a friend....well it can be solved. Not only that, but you can GROW and learn from it. Don't we all need to remember that? Are we telling our kids this? This is such a fantastic little read for children.     The focus of the book is art - but you can use examples of other mistakes in life.  The pages are laminated so you don't have to worry about wear and tear. This is something I will be reading K-5. I've never put together lessons on perfectionism and making mistakes. Now I can!
B002T44ZYW|4.0|This book was a pretty entertaining and enjoyable one.I mean Lauren Conrad isnt know J.K Rowling or Sara Spehard(one of my favorite authors.)But she's better than Snooki from Jersey Shore!This had a really slow start I found myself regrating I ever bought this book but by the middle/end I think it's worth every penny!The book reminded me alot of GOSSIP GIRL and the HILLS.I cant wait to read the second and even third book!It took me a week and two days to read but boy I didnt want it to end.Good book read it!This book is for everyone!Not just girl I hate when people put books in a certain category (i.e \\"girly\\" \\"old\\" etc.)People read whatever interests them and when people say things like that a book a guy or a girl really want to read and we put them down by saying things like oh umm that for boy or thats for girl it makes them not wanna read at all with the fear of being judged because of thier interests!OK total nothing to do with the book but yes READ IT....NOW!
159562015X|5.0|I was very happy with the book, the delivery time, the packaging - everything. My code was in it (as it should be) and everything was great! It did read like a horoscope, but I enjoyed and appreciated the ease with which it could be understood. I would order this again and would (and did) recommend this item.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Just replaced WeatherBug for me. But the notifications being set on as standard is a little obnoxious. I don't need to know the weather all day. Very clean and impressive graphics, along with widgets. A must download for all.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Tried it out on my droid x. GPS doesn't use satellites, it uses cell towers which is way slower. All the widgets have a clock on them, taking up space. Widgets are cluttered and I can't figure out which reading is which.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|I launched the app, put in my zipcode which it didn't resolve to a city name, then sat there and watched the clock go tick-tock and wonder why it skips seconds sometimes while it &quot;updates&quot;. After a minute of waiting I thought it might need WiFi 15mbps connection to update initially so I turned that on. Still updating, tick tock tick tock...let's check out the radar - eww terribly fuzzy font and it says &quot;Doppler radar unavailable for selected territory. Only available in the USA.&quot; Umm ya that's where my zipcode should point it to...Back to the main screen, oh look, it's done. It says &quot;Error: there is no hourly weather forecast.&quot; Hmm really? I live in the 2nd largest city in my state and Weatherbug shows me tri-hourly forecasts and has a nice radar and updates in about 2 seconds when you open the app. I have no clue how this app has 4 stars. I am guessing it won't by the end of today. Sorry dev, uninstalling. Now if only I could get it off of my app list in the amazon app store....

0307946711|4.0|Very interesting concept - even though you'd think it would be jarring to skip a whole year at a time, it ends up being a very absorbing book.  A quick read, and an entertaining story that's easy to relate to.  Fun.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Of all the changes George Lucas has made to Star Wars over the last two decades, putting the stink of the prequels in Return of the Jedi's pivotal scene is the last straw. If you care at all about artistic integrity, you will boycott Star Wars on Blu-Ray. Cancel any and all preorders. Hit Lucas in the only place he can feel it: his pocketbook.

1609419693|4.0|Tina Fey provides a comical memoir of growing up, going to school, getting involved in comedy through Second City (a comedy troupe in Chicago), her time on Saturday Night Live, 30 Rock, and then being a mom. I especially enjoyed her narrative of getting on SNL, battling sexism in comedy, and starting up 30 Rock. (I always enjoy these behind-the-scenes looks at programs I enjoy, and this is very good example.) Other parts, like her commentary on being a mom, was less exciting, although even there, the description of the breast milk militants was very funny.    As a narrator, she reads the book wonderfully. Note on content: There is strong language strewn throughout and some sexual humor, so it won't be for everyone.    Seven out of ten!
B003F1WM2K|2.0|This is actually a wonderful book that anyone who enjoys the inspiring life of artists should read.<br /><br />However, the Kindle edition lacks some of the photographs available in the print edition.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|Having followed Yes since 1972, I always look forward to their next release. The diverseness of their range in music is second to none, no matter who is in the band at the time. Fly From Here is more than I expected, in fact more of what I was waiting for....the long song, the melody, the changes within the songs themeselves. All I can say is great job from a group of veterans that produce music and not just putting out something to sell. All you have to look at is the artwork and know that Yes has done it again.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I have read the first 4 books but have not read this one.  And I do not plan on reading it.  I agree with the critique here about this series.  The first 3 books were very good but book 4 was long winded and disappointing.  From the reviews I have read here book 5 is in the same vein as book 4.  I am done with this series.  I am very disappointed with book 4 and will not invest any more of my time and money. If book 6 gets great reviews maybe I'll jump back in.
030788743X|2.0|This is not Da Vinci Code. The book is way overhyped. I do not understand why it got so many five-star ratings. It is one of those books you can read when you REALLY get some time to kill.    Story: extremely predictable. I can come up with more twists out of the hat.    Characters: 2-D, the evils are really evil and the good are really good. the main characters are lack of real development.    Writing: Mr. Cline often digresses far from the story and gives you a lecture on something about the 80s.
0375701427|1.0|I know that this is going to be an unpopular review, as the book has been heralded as one of the best in the last century (it won a Pulitzer Prize, for crying out loud). But never have I been so frustrated reading a book in my life. I'll try to explain why.<br /><br />1. The idea of the story is great, the whole reason I bought the book. I can count on one hand the number of times in the book that you were ever actually reading anything to do with what the story was sold to be. And each time was a couple of pages, at most. Yet, here you had a book that was only a little over 400 pages, and I can count 3 times where the author spends incredible sums of pages describing in mind numbing detail how a manufacturer makes a pair of gloves. That is not an exaggeration, there were three different points in the book where he actually wrote what amounted to a manual on how they produce gloves. I would find myself getting angry, shuffling through pages to find out how long these descriptions would go on, and want to throw the book down when 6 or 7 pages later I was still looking at the description of how to make gloves. Now, imagine that in 3 different portions of the book. And a relatively short book at that.<br /><br />2. I know it might be trendy or artsy to not tie things up...I guess we're supposed to be intelligent enough to imagine how situations turned out, and where people's lives ended up. But I'm a reader. I bought a book where I want a good story. And I want to be satisfied with the story I'm reading. Call me unrefined, but after reading descriptions that caused comatose symptoms in me when it comes to the manufactureing of gloves, the description of a model house, how cows are herded, etc. the least the author could do is maybe tie up a few loose ends. The protagonist's wife has an affair....ok, does he confront her, what happens? The daughter is living in squalor....what becomes of her? The woman that claims to be the lesbian lover of the daughter, but the daughter denies knowing her...is she a fraud, or is the daughter lying? Not one of the questions that actually had me intrigued enough to continue reading just so I could find the answer are answered.<br /><br />I don't know. I can't believe I'm the only one out there that went \\"Huh? This won a Pulitzer Prize?\\" No doubt, the sentences made sense, I didn't see any spelling errors, and the guy is a wiz with grammar....but that can't be what wins you Pulitzer Prizes and put on Best of the Century lists, is it?her...is she a fraud, or is the daughter lying? Not one of the questions that actually had me intrigued enough to continue reading just so I could find the answer are answered.    I don't know. I can't believe I'm the only one out there that went \\"Huh?

B001AQO3WY|5.0|This was recommended by two friends have served in Iraq (2005-2006). I was not there and after watching this i was in total awe & shock.  I strongly recommend watching this.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I kinda understand why this movie gets mixed reviews from movie critics but ravings for its DVD version.It's not the adrenaline pumping, suspenses popping, twists tangling ,your typical fast paced  Hollywood roller coaster  ride that people normally expect for $12+ popcorn and soda cost. the age old Gothic storyline has been adapted and copied for a century, but this adaption is as updated as you can imagine, the original book is rather loosely organized and the story line is tacky from the view of  contemporary readers(it's kindle version is free for a reason).But unlike some big Hollywood productions put on DVDs, you will probably watch the DVD once or twice and put away, this one you just can't get enough of it.    The scenes were spectaculars, and the music is just purely beautiful for the ears. never was a fan for musical before, but phantom got me hooked.  The stars' singing are great too, I can't get the songs out of my mind now.
031236198X|5.0|Be responsible.  Own your thoughts.  Take charge when you have to.  Lessons I heard but didn't always take to heart as a child.  Everyone can't be a follower.  Someone has to lead, and this book reinforces this message in a powerful way, with a cute story to boot.  HR directors, department heads, anyone can find this a tool of reference.
B004ZG5F0K|2.0|So this is a GREAT movie, but when I finally opened it to watch it won't play and I threw out the receipt so I'm pretty much stuck with it. I don't think it was the seller's fault, sometimes they won't play so I guess I'll be re-ordering.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Darth Lucas will do anything and everything he can to destroy the movies which so many of us grew up with and loved.  Don't fix what's not broken.  With every change Lucas makes, he gives the middle finger to the star wars fan base. DONT BUY THIS CRAP.

0156034026|1.0|This is thin gruel indeed (so thin that the publisher has used large type and airy spacing to pad out the book).  The novel, which seems to be partly autobiographical,  purports to be an account of how a successful Pakistani immigrant to the US becomes radicalized until he is a \\"reluctant fundamentalist\\".    The book fails because it is so unconvincing.  The immigrant does well in American society -- he is accepted at an Ivy League university, and gets a high paying job with a financial firm.  But after 911,  he rejects the society that gave him these advantages, returns to Pakistan, and becomes a homicidal fundamentalist.    But why?  Apparently this transformation is brought about by a few trivial events -- he gets extra attention at US immigration because of his origins, and his colleagues at work don't much care for his new beard.   When the US attacks Afghanistan to drive out Al Quaeda,  he is filled with rage.   Nowhere do we get any plausible reasons for why he became not merely so radical, but also a religious fundamentalist -- there is practically no mention of fundamentalist islam in the book, let alone what its attractions might be.    The US, for all its many flaws, gave him a welcome and opportunities such as he would get in practically no other country on earth.  Instead, our hero prefers Pakistan -- a country riddled with feudal inequalities, wretched poverty,  pervasive injustice,  religious fanaticism, paranoid militarism,  ethnic hatreds, endemic violence, utter corruption,  widespread illiteracy, repression of women, child labor, child abuse, and (especially among the Pashtun) rampant pederasty.  What is the attraction of this way of life, and the brand of Islam that is complicit with it?   We never learn.  (The hero continually reminds us that he is no ordinary Pakistani -- no, he is from one of those rare, well-off, respectable families,  so perhaps he has been insulated from the realities of life there?)    Some hand-wringing Americans, eager to \\"learn\\" why so much of the world seems to hate them,  may find this silly novel useful.  They would be better advised to undertake a serious study of the history of American relations with the muslim world,  particularly US interference in foreign governments, support for foreign dictators, and blind support for anything Israel does.   This novel adds nothing to our understanding.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Black Veil Brides \\"Set the World on Fire\\" was an awesome cd. The songs had a good combination of heavy beats and hypnotic melodies that kept the music fun. It mixes a lot of now's darker style with the fun energetic rythem of classic 80's hair metal.

0060558121|3.0|Neil Gaiman is a strange creature. I feel like I should LOVE the guy since he just kind of embodies the `geek' aesthetic BUT he I find him more polarizing then anything else. I've read two Neil Gaiman books in the last month and a half and they literally took that long to read: about a month and a half. I respect his writing talents, like his seemingly effortless talents, and appreciate his tendency to be charmingly strange but I am also unnerved by his overlong plots, odd pacing, and obnoxious attention deficit disorder. Reading one of his books is a test in both joy and madness and, in the end, I think Gaiman himself would get a kick out of that.<br /><br />As I said in my very short review of Good Omens (which he co-wrote with Terry Pratchett), I mentioned that Gaiman's ideas are glorious for short stories and American Gods, one of his most critically awarded books, is exactly the same. American Gods is an epic. Sure, it isn't approaching the 1,000 page region but it's near-600 page length is made to feel like double that. And the way I got through it was pretending I was watching a TV show. Is that considered a success for a book? I dunno. But American Gods, if treated like roughly two seasons worth of 45 minute episodes, is a masterpiece of television. The problem is this is a book and it's all one story that seems to drag on and on.<br /><br />It doesn't mean I don't like it. American Gods has moments of absolute brilliance and during some stretches I was absolutely hooked. But then ADD Gaiman would step in and interrupt the story with a 30 page treatment on characters we'd never see again. Very frustrating. But it is what it is. American Gods is about a man named Shadow who, upon being released from prison, learns his wife has died whilst cheating on him. Along the way to her funeral he meets a man named Wednesday who hires him to be a helper. Shadow, with really nothing to lose in his life, joins Wednesday on a journey all throughout America where they commit bank heists, meet old friends, and prepare for war. The war, you ask? Well, it appears Wednesday and his group of friends are old world gods who have fallen out of favor in the young country of the United States and the newer gods, who come and go like fads, are stealing all the power.<br /><br />What Gaiman deserves credit for instantly is being entirely original. There is a lack of cliches. Shadow isn't given much of a past (it comes in pieces) but he is so intricately written that he is fully three dimensional within the first few pages. The characters he meets that he is unsure of are kept perfectly mysterious. There are no real big reveals in the plot to explain how everything ticks and while this can be somewhat maddening for those who NEED things explained (me, sometimes), it is unique and compelling for those looking for a world that feels both fantastical/mysterious yet real.<br /><br />Until the very end, Gaiman manages to base the plot in some sort of reality. Any type of magic or `godness' is subtle. You always suspect Wednesday and his friends are more then they seem but you are often waiting for the catch or for something to break. It doesn't and I have to give Gaiman all the credit in the world for that. But, like mentioned earlier, Gaiman has excellent ideas that sometimes can't handle being stretched over 600 pages and, maybe noticing this, Gaiman shifts gears heavily throughout the book. Shadow will be in one place for awhile and then go somewhere else and almost live out an entire book's existence in that place. Then he moves again. This is, of course, when he isn't interrupted by tales of Gods that span all types of different time periods.<br /><br />The `interludes' as they are often called, in which Gaiman describes a god who was once prevalent but faded once on America's shores, are actually the best written stuff. . .and if they were isolated short stories then great. But they interrupt the other story he's got going on and while the stories sort of have their place, they are beautiful distractions that, in the end, do not aid the other 530 pages you're reading. I remember at one point reading about 80 straight pages and not wanting to stop but then seeing the `interlude' and getting completely sucked out of the zone I was in. The book would have been finished a lot faster without these distractions.<br /><br />So, once again, I'm bestowing a middle of the road rating towards a Gaiman book and I think I'm going to retire from his novels. I still would like to read his graphic novels (Sandman) but his novels, while intriguing, end up being more chores then anything else. Being amazed just isn't worth feeling like I'm working and sweating.e beautiful distractions that, in the end, do not aid the other 530 pages you're reading.

1401227821|5.0|Today isn't that hard to make beautiful illustrations. With the help of the correct software almost any artist can deliver realistic portraits and landscapes.<br /><br />So although all works delivered by Adam Hughes are astonishingly beautiful in form, that's not what's impressive in them.<br /><br />AH imagines scenes that turn fantasy characters in real figures, real persons. The relaxation seen in Power Girl's face when she's flying on her back, it's the same as anyone leisurely swimming. The pain and shame of Selina Kyle being mugshoted in the police precinct is the same as any master criminal would feel being caught. The mix of boredom and despair on Superman face while Lois Lane interviews Wonder Woman is fabulous! The terrifying madness of thorn is palpable. The \\"I am a goner\\" look of the pilot seeing WW flying toward him!<br /><br />Each of AH works is a masterpiece with hidden meanings, secret stories and infinite drama, joy, pleasure or pain...and frequently with loads of humor.<br /><br />Adam Hughes may be slow to deliver, but he knows his weakness. We, his public, know his strengths.<br /><br />Keep up with the good job Dr. Frankenstein (yes, this is for you AH)...like him, you also created life from characters that don't exist.

B0058EBNAO|1.0|it wouldnt force close from the settings so i tried using a task killer and that didnt work either. also there are better free weather apps out there. i guess it looks nice but widgets are clunky and i already uninstalled.
B000NJVWU0|5.0|I agree with John. Late 70s music rulez, and this album justifies the opinion. IMO 80s music is also great, downhill began in the 90s... melodies, keys just seem to have run out. As for APP: this record's up there with Eye In The Sky and I Robot, if conceptually not better.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|not able to find location remotely close to raleigh to get data.  worthless coverage for a weather app. uninstalled it.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|It does work on Motorola Atrix 4G, located in Mountain View, CA.  First, it had some java errors, could not find data for the location, etc.  After I gave up hope and have not looked at the phone for awhile, it did find the location and updated the weather info. The widgets are very nice.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Forget the appalling ending or obvious plot devices. (I gave up on hope for SK plotting after that Duma Key ventriloquism scene.)

159562015X|1.0|The title of this book might as well be \\"Go to [...] instead\\" because this book lacks any insight without the Web site. I borrowed this book from a friend and found it worthless because she had already used the keycode located in the back of the book. Okay, no biggie, hopefully I can glean....nope, you need that code and it's only good for one user.<br /><br />This book and author intended on everyone having their own copy, which as you know, in a perfect world works, but we have things called lending and borrowing on Planet Earth. I don't remember the last time I picked up Covey's or Carnagie's books only to find out that I needed to buy it instead.<br /><br />What a joke of a book. Don't borrow and if you do purchase new, remember it's only good for one moment and one moment only...your initial submission of the Strengthsfinder test.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|At first I wanted to give this app the benefit of the doubt be side I often see negative reviews by people who just don't understand how to use the app as intended.  My location could not be found by gps and when I put in my zip code manually it still couldn't find me. I tried even putting in Boston since It's not too far from where I live and it still couldn't find anything. If a weather app can't find one of the oldest cities in the country then it just isn't worth having on my phone. Nice concept but needs a lot of work. Uninstalled.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I don't understand how the guy that wants precip% and temp didn't like this. You click on the center of the clock to change what data is displayed. You click on a time to get the next 12 hours of data from the hour you chose.   It's a decent current conditions + 12 hour source, but not a weekly look ahead.

Living in Seattle that is a must, and now I can see those percentages right on the home screen with the clock widget set to percepitations. Plus, Seattle being an area where the Big One is likely to hit, it's great to know if there is a sudden spikes of earthquakes.

1609611543|3.0|The majority of the book covers his research--lots of great information, but the real reason I purchased the book was for the diet because I suffer from celiac disease and am not losing weight.  I was disappointed because the \\"diet\\" portion of book for weight loss is covered in one or two pages, which is basically an atkins diet.  If you have issues with wheat, he gives you a list of stuff in a few pages at the end that covers foods to avoid.

0307279189|5.0|A friend of mine had this book, and I read the first 30 pages, then had to order my own copy so I could finish it! Loved it so much, I actually went for a barefoot run recently. I've never read a book on running before, and am not a runner; however, I so enjoyed the author's take on running as a joyful experience instead of a drudgery that I am considering working up to doing a half-marathon. Recommended, even if you're not a runner!
B004SBX112|4.0|I purchased the paid version of Angry Birds Seasons based on numerous reviews stating tbe banner ads in the free version were sometimes placed in undesirable locations and interfered with gameplay, which would make the app practically useless.  As others have indicated, it's true occasionally there are video ads in the paid version at the start of a level.  However, I would much rather put up with video ads than banners, although I agree that \\"ad free\\" should mean exactly that.  I am a newbie to Angry Birds and find the game mildly addictive.  Recommended download if you are willing to put up with the video ads.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|seems to work ok on Htc Thunderbolt.  radar takes a long time to load.  graphics look good but I dont like most of the clock designs. not really what im interesred in. so many other weather aps out there and many for free that are better. guess it would be ok for free, just not for me.
B003QNXPUK|2.0|I've had the Zagg InvisibleShield for iPhone 4 for over a year now.  While the Shield was fairly easy to put on (especially after repeated practice, see below), and protected well when it was on, there is a MAJOR flaw.  Apparently, Zagg has had problems getting it to bond to the iPhone's glass front and back (according to a customer service rep).  The result is that the Shield peels off after 2-3 months of use.  This has happened to me 4-5 times over the past year, and the Shield gets destroyed if folded/bent and you cannot reapply.  While Zagg will replace it for free, us losers in Canada still had to pay $5 for shipping to Canada and shipping to return it.  Most recently, Zagg has increased the shipping charge to $15 (!!), completely unreasonable for a thin, light product like this.    I've now completely given up on Zagg and will get skins from elsewhere...
B000002HMH|2.0|It's not a sellout, because other than the commerical-minded \\"Until It Sleeps\\" (which is as good as radio-ready hard rock gets), I don't hear a lot of singles on here.  Indeed, it HAD a lot of singles - \\"Hero Of The Day\\", \\"Bleeding Me\\", \\"Ain't My Bitch\\", \\"King Nothing\\", and \\"Mama Said\\" also all received heavy airplay - but I don't hear Metallica trying to be Bon Jovi or Def Leppard or even Nirvana on this album.  I just hear them trying to be a slightly more streamlined Metallica.  Slower, yes, more groove-oriented and less speed-oriented, yes, slicker production, yes...but also amazingly free of any good hooks.      What I DO hear is the most boring album they ever did.  Virtually none of the singles get played today, because they just plain evaporated from memory once they ran their course.  There's nothing on here that sticks in the brain like an \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Master Of Puppets\\", \\"One\\" or \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\".  Their forays into southern rock and country twang ring hollow, and the whole album just seems way too labored over.  It isn't the least bit LOOSE, which of course has never been Metallica's forte (they're about precision, not looseness), but here it just makes the whole thing a downer.  By contrast, the more rushed follow-up, \\"Re-Load\\", is much better with more memorable songs. Even so, those two records represent a noticable lull in their otherwise stellar track record.    If you're a Metallica beginner, start with \\"The Black Album\\" and work your way backwards to \\"Kill 'Em All\\"...then jump all the way to the end with \\"Death Magnetic\\" and start working your way backwards again.  That way you'll finish your collection with this one and know you have them all. If you START with this one...you might not be compelled to delve deeper.  It's just plain a bore.

B0050G3NWG|5.0|Well, I've spent quite a bit of time reading all these reviews. What have I learned from this. Nothing new. The five star reviews are from those who are either old enough to remember the film when it was new, fresh and incredibly important because of its innovations in film-making, or can enjoy a movie for how it influenced the film-making process since its release. The one star reviews are from the young who simply can't see what the fuss is about for an 'old' film which, of course, technically does not compare to the CGI and effects processes available to film-makers today. No &#34;rush&#34; to be had except from thought - but why should a movie involve cognitive work as movies are just for entertainment? Right? The best movie of all time? To make this distinction does NOT involve comparing it to a modern film one on one for technical values, acting, etc because you simply can not do that. Apples to elephants so to speak. But how the film influences the medium, relates to its &#34;then&#34; surroundings, shows innovation - all these reflect the greatness of a film. And it is hard to fault Citizen Kane on these grounds. An audience member's personal liking for the subject matter of a film can not be used to properly rate a film, except for a rating of that person's experience. If a person individually does not like a film, it does not accurately reflect the film's effect on any other person - nor its importance in the scheme of things. So, yes, Citizen Kane has to be considered a great film. The best film - well ----- perhaps.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I've been reading SK for 30 yrs and there are a few books I wasn't fond of, but this was truly awful.  The story started off well enough, but ended up feeling disconnected and almost like two separate stories that shared little relevance.  And the product placements throughout the book?  Really? Why?  Is that how authors get extra revenue these days.  Disappointed.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|Metro PCS Samsung Galaxy Indulge I will buy almost any app for 99 cents. Apps like these are worth it for sure, but in defense of Paper Camera, it has more options than I expected. If I was a camera freak and used this app on a daily basis it might be worth $2. But, to me this is a novelty and I don't mind throwing a dollar at the developer(s) for their efforts. Don't get me wrong, it is a really cool and unique camera app.

B004GBIDVW|4.0|In Hollywood, when you graduate an 80s TV Show into a major motion picture, comparisons will be made.  I did this in another interview that I posted for The Dukes of Hazzard movie, it's inevitable.  How faithful were they to the spirit of the show?  Did they eliminate the bad and keep the good?  In many cases, some TV shows from the 80s had a great premise but were dragged down by the perils of minimal TV budgets, short sighted producers and censorship.  When they get 110 million and a competent creation crew behind them, their true colors can really come through.  Such is the case with The A-Team.    I must say, I'm extremely saddened to hear that the movie didn't do well enough in the theater or even on home video to warrant a sequel.  I think the casting of the four actors was brilliant and the story line aspired to the best aspects of the TV show.  The A Team is a blast to watch.  These four gentlemen have charisma and chemistry beyond belief and they really reflect a brotherhood far beyond the stale and 2 dimensional characters created by their TV counterparts.  That's not to say the actors in the show were bad, George Peppard alone gave the show an aire of respectability.  Dwight Schultz was always in perfect manic form and Dirk Benedict was most likely born for the role of Face.  However, the weekly grind of making a show where automatic weapons are fired and cars jump several feet without hurting anyone becomes monotonous after some time.     Liam Neeson is undoubtedly one of the most charismatic actors of our time.  No one brings his brand of leadership quality to the screen like he does.  So who better to play the cigar chomping Colonial `Hannibal' Smith then him?  No one.  It's so easy to believe that everyone who meets this man feels like they would help him do anything.  That if he asked them to do something, they would do it, no questions asked.  Bradley Cooper is a perfect choice as well for Lt. Templeton `Faceman' Peck, the pretty boy, smoothtalking `get-anything-if-you-need-it' operator.  Sharlto Copley...who is this guy?  I'd never heard of him but I have to say, he nailed the role as Murdoch.  He brings just the right amount of wackiness mixed with competence to convince us to trust him, despite his `verge-of-insanity' characteristics.  Then there's Quinton `Rampage' Jackson playing Bosco `BA' Baracus.  Again, another guy I'd never heard of.  I'm not familiar with the players in the MMA world but this guy really has something.  He played BA with multiple levels of anger and sometimes emotion in just the right places.  I was impressed with Quiton and I thought he filled the shoes of Mr. T and then some.  The best part is the script allows us to believe these guys are a true working team that plays to each others strengths and helps balance their weaknesses.  They're not perfect, but they are smart, competent and with the guidance of their leader, Hannibal, capable of doing almost anything.      The movie chooses to focus on how the four came together and their subsequent story that is the premise of the TV show; being convicted of a crime they didn't commit.  The movie starts with a series of events that bring the four together and solidifies BA's fear of flying, for anyone who thought it was strange that BA (a former Army Ranger) would have a fear of flying, this explains it very well.  It then jumps forward eight years with the four involved in the middle east conflict after running eighty successful missions and ready to be discharged.  Of course, this is where it gets dicey.  During a last minute mission designed to avoid political upheaval and bloodshed by a security/paramilitary contractor group, things go very bad.  The four are arrested and tried under military tribunal, stripped of ranks and sent to separate incarceration facilities.  Six months later they escape with the help of a twisted CIA agent (played by Patrick Wilson) and the chase in on to clear their names.  Jessica Beil plays theDOD officer assigned to track them down and stop them.  Being a former flame of Face, her character goes in full tilt but later starts to lean toward their cause.  Both Wilson and Beil play their parts well as a split of their TV counterparts, Col Lynch and Col Decker.  Oddly Wilson's character calls himself Lynch when he meets with Hannibal.      Joe Carnahan is the director behind this gem and I have to say, after watching Smoking Aces, I wasn't convinced he could pull this off.  Not that Smoking Aces is a bad movie, but it had it's unbalances and it overdone characters to the point where it was almost cartoonish.  But he most certainly did pull this one off.  His direction and attention to character interaction as well putting in just the right amount of humor mixed with the more serious tone of the movie makes for a very entertaining picture.  It takes the best aspects of the TV Show and works it all together very well.  Sure there are a few `Hollywood' moments but they are easily overlooked in the course of the movie.  Again I state that it's a shame  a sequel won't be made due to lack of revenue but maybe if enough people read this review and trust my impressions, they'll give it a try.  If anything, it's a fun movie and at least worth a look.    For Blu Ray fans, the Blu Ray of this movie looks awesome and sounds just as good.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|While this certainly was an emotional journey, and I myself am simply a big fan of drug rehab movies (we've all got our stuff), I have three complaints: Buscemi needed a bigger roll, baseball man needed a much smaller role, and it should have ended when she walked into her apartment at the end. Then again, I didn't write the dern thing so I might as well grin and bear it - and that's easy to do when the acting, writing, and characters are so realistic (yet pleasantly fictionalized) as those in 28 Days. Enjoy this movie! It's definitely worth the watch! Then again, if you absolutely can't stand a few predictable moments or cliches, and maybe you're tired of the superficiality of the big, strong, adorably flawed \\"better man\\" (although they did seem to play well with how that issue ended) among the rest of a good movie, you might just want to rent it for your laptop for a slightly cheaper price. The lessons I believe this movie tries to teach are pretty clear and well-known, but still nice to see: everyone needs a helping hand at some point, life is about more than dulling the senses for the sake of a good time, and sometimes the hardest thing to do is exactly what will heal us - in this case, to face the reality of what we've become and how most of the time we're the only ones to blame...    I am glad I bought this movie; I had never heard of it before, it was just an impulse buy. I just watched it, had to break out the tissues just once, and I'm looking forward to the special features. God bless!
B000KE1P7S|4.0|I know (almost) everyone feels that this is the best JE ever produced, and I'm inclined to agree, but it still not worth 5 stars.  I'm not sure this work will ever be properly adapted to the screen, as its such an emotional, psychological drama.  Its hard to put all of the character's thoughts and motivations into dialogue that works and is believable.    That being said, this is the closest version to the book to date.  There just isn't time to put in the necessary details to fully tell Jane's story, and fully develop her love for Rochester.  Those who don't know the book would be left thinking, \\"Now why, exactly, did these two fall in love?\\"  \\"What's so special about their relationship?\\"  Knowing the book as I do, (I've been reading it every so often since about 1977 -- thank you Sister Beatrice for assigning it in 9th grade!), I can fill in those blanks. Someone who's not a reader will have trouble.  So, my advice is, enjoy this version, but read the book, too.  Its well worth it.    What doesn't come across as well as it could:  The truly terrible deprivations at Lowood; the deep, deep impact Helen Burns has on Jane's outlook and attitude; Rochester's internal pain; Jane's internal conflict once she realizes she's falling for her \\"master\\"; the patient, almost toying way Rochester develops his relationship with Jane; Dame Fairfax's reservations; the wonderful way Jane conducts herself after the engagement by staying true to her character and \\"station\\"; the evolution of her relationship with Diana, Mary and St. John; and the conflict she feels between her love for Rochester and her sense of duty to St. John.    The mini-series does hit the big points, and gets the message across, so its definitely worth viewing -- much more so than any other version.  Zelah Clarke is wonderful as Jane -- plain, but strong.  Timothy Dalton's Rochester starts off a little comical -- so bullying (without the brooding) he's almost a caricature, but later seems to settle in and is perfect, after their relationship has a chance to develop a little.   The supporting cast is good too.  Some scenes are magnificent -- especially the proposal under the tree (but what happened to the lightening storm rending the trunk of the tree in two, but still joined at the base?), and the scene between Jane and Rochester after the non-wedding and Jane realizes she can never see him again.    Each \\"episode\\" here is about 30 minutes long, for a total of about 5.5 hours.  I just think that even 10 or more hours might not be enough to fully develop the plot and characters as they are in the book.  Still, its the best there is, so watch it.  But, read the book, too!  (Its free on Kindle!)
1401324517|4.0|RAFA is a remarkable book which gives amazing insights into the mind of a tennis legend. The way he prepares before a game, his mental state during a game, his methods of handling the disappointments and the successes of the tennis court -  all of this makes RAFA a fascinating read.<br /><br />The book has a unique format in which the first person account by Nadal is interspersed with chapters by John Carlin. The chapters by Nadal mainly talk about some of the important matches of his fledging tennis career, starting with THE MATCH - the Wimbledon 2008 final; his surprisingly strong family ties and its impact on his game; his domineering uncle and coach for 20 years - Toni and of course, his never say die spirit which is visible in most of his matches, among other things.<br /><br />As the chapters go on, the book slowly uncovers the duality of Rafael Nadal - the one on the tennis court and the other off it. The one on the court is a gladiator who fights till the end, never gives up, doesn't know what fear is and ruthlessly decimates his opposition. The one off the tennis court is a soft, insecure lad , a boy next door, who is scared of dog, who is uncomfortable driving a bicycle or a motorbike and one who is scared of flying in a helicopter ! The contrast cannot be more starker.<br /><br />The importance he gives to his family and friends and in turn their impact on his game is mentioned throughout the book. After a remarkable year of 2008 when he won both French Open and Wimbledon and became No.1 for the first time, 2009 was a big let down, when he was dogged by injuries, when he lost in French Open for the first time and eventually lost the No.1 ranking. As he writes, this dip in his career was as much due to the separation of his parents as due to external factors like injuries and loss of form. In fact, according to him, the mental trauma he experienced due to his parent's separation was actually the root cause for most of his injuries during that time.<br /><br />In the final part of the book he also mentions his rather strange relationship with his uncle and coach - Toni. Though he gives a lot of credit to Toni for installing in him the fighting spirit of a gladiator and making him the tennis player he is now, he also mentions couple of incidents where he thinks Toni crossed the line. There are nuggets spread throughout book about their relationship and if you connect the dots you feel as if Nadal is only 'tolerating' Toni because of his gratitude towards Toni for making him what he is now. But again, that is only my interpretation.<br /><br />Overall, RAFA is an inspirational read. Through a living example the book tells that to succeed you have to make sacrifices, to succeed you need to have discipline and dedication, to succeed you have to fight till the last point. Nothing comes easy in this world, but if you put an honest effort, nothing is too difficult to achieve !ook he also mentions his rather strange relationship with his uncle and coach - Toni.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an excellent beginners backpack, it is well padded, has very comfortable shoulder straps and even thoughtfully includes a belt strap to help keep the weight balanced. Inside there is tons of room for multiple lenses, speedlite(s) and various gear. With the padding arrangement you can easily change the interior according to your equipment and needs. There is also plenty of room for filters and other materials. The outside has even more zipped pocket space and even two side velcro pocks perfect for cell phones or *gasp* cigarettes if you are a smoker. Having tried several different types of camera bags I can say for the money this is easily the *BEST* one to pick up as a beginner as it holds so much and even if you don't have the equipment to fill it now it will give you room to grow. Pick one up, you won't be sorry!

B002NXSRVG|4.0|I initially had difficulty in rating this film, as there is much to be annoyed with it.    At the top of the list are the obvious PC alterations to the GI Joe brand.  *GI Joe is an AMERICAN special forces unit, but the film changes that to some UN force so as not to offend the sensibilities of the international market. (Yet, somehow movies about CIA operatives and the like are still successful, without having to change the CIA into Interpol.)  * Cobra Commander's lame mask, because they were afraid that a hood would be offensive because it resembles a KKK hood. Cobra Commander is the TERRORIST leader! Who were they afraid of offending by making the terrorist look like a klansman? The KKK, or terrorists? Who else, after all, would be offended?  * Channing Tatum's attitude (behind the scenes) of initially not wanting to do the movie so as not to glorify the military/war, yet changing his mind when it showed that the script was more akin to a superhero movie. Of course, the movie still had a high body count with a lot of bystanders getting injured/killed. Hey Channing, how many people do you think said, \\"I'd love to see that kind of action,\\" after seeing something like \\"We Were Soldiers\\"? It's actually movies like this that glorify violence and make it look \\"fun\\".  * The black guy portraying Ripcord, a white character. Why not have a black guy portray Stalker, one of the coolest of the original Joes? Because the name \\"Stalker\\" might offend.    Then there were the poor ideas.  * Snake-Eyes in a rubber suit with a mask with lips. What were they thinking?!?! Just put him in a regular, black colored uniform. Remove the lips. He looked like an oversized, alien muppet. And a vow of silence is why he can't speak? Why not leave the original story, that all others have used? He wears the mask and does not talk because he was disfigured in some explosion that damaged his vocal cords as well. (I mean, who is going to admit someone into an elite military force who refuses to talk?)  * The accelerator suits. If they were just armored suits they would have been fine (or if used by Cobra), but making them run as fast as a car? That would rip your body apart if you had some outside force moving your limbs about that fast. (And why did the two rookies get these, while the experienced members of the team sit in the van?)    So why the four stars?  Well I have to admit, despite the above flaws, I did enjoy the movie.  It works very well as a generic action/sci-fi movie and the plot (other than the PC changes) was actually well thought out. The bad guys actually had a clever plan and the twist was that it actually worked, despite the Commander ending up in custody at the end.  So even though there are several aspects about this movie that make me, as a GIJoe fan, cringe (another being the Duke, Baroness, Destro love triangle), I am not such an absolute purist that it kept me from enjoying a fun, reasonably well acted (given what it is), and clever action flick.    If you are one of the GI Joe fans that has refused to see this up till now, I would recommend taking a chance on it. If you are one of those action movie fans that has taken a pass becuase its \\"GI Joe\\", I say the same thing.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|average weather app, could take it or leave it. Radar works for me but clock on widget doesn't update unless I open it, no its not on SD card. Would give more stars if clock updated.
B003HARV4S|4.0|Sorry for 4 stars, I really like this film. But why there are the subtitles and the special features on the DVD disc only? If you have hearing problems and want to watch the film with subtitles or if you want to hear comments you need to switch from the Blu-ray to the DVD. Who made such decision, who is this genius, I just interesting?<br />By the way, the idea that the film must start immediately and run in circle if you don't press the \\"stop\\" is the very strange one too.<br />Beside all of this it's very touching, stylish love-mystic-story with the good video and audio.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|This app is all show NO GO!  the app tells me that Sacramento isn't a recognized US city when I put in the zip code (because the GPS don't work). I love to try these apps for free, then support the developer by purchasing the app once i see that it works as advertised...  But $3 for an app that is pretty useless,  that's not something i will tip my hat to.  Reminds me of Microsoft and how they sell software that is NOT ready for market.
0811876373|2.0|i do not like spiral bound books, but that is just me and does not reflect on the content.However that content has no redeeming health value what so ever...i was quite surprised since so many raved about these balls that they were full of chemicals and other icky stuff...The candy coating i got was way too thick to dip and one can not thin it except with some weird product one must buy online??? I thought this would be a simple baking project to try for my grandchildren but it became very complex very quickly. And as i said,these balls are all empty calories if made the way the book instructs...yuck....
0812977246|5.0|I find it extremely hard to spend time reading badly-written work; that is why I read so few thrillers.  I can't remember any more why I picked op Gorky Park.  It wasn't the film - I saw that later (it is good - and a fair reflection of parts of the book).  My original paperback copy has hundreds of underlined passages - the writing is brilliant; understated, subtle and very satisfying.  It's on my shelf with other novels of the same quality.  Like Marquez.    Start with the first sentence, \\"All nights should be so dark, all winters so warm, all headlights so dazzling.\\"    Here are some random short selections (there are wonderful longer passages too), \\". . . the academician suffered from a resemblance to Khrushchev.\\";  \\"Rubles are paper, see, and vodka is cash.\\"; \\". . . trees emerged into the dawn as wary as deer.\\"  \\"The washwoman's head mimicked the rotation of her hand.\\"  \\"[They] watched [him] with great curiosity, as if he might drink with his nose.\\"  And I haven't even included my favourite (top of p. 120; Pan paperback; 1982).  If you like good writing, no matter the subject, this is the book.
B001AQO3XS|4.0|OK! I just received this dvd via mail from best buy priced @ 8 bucks.  I like the movie so I gave it 4 stars, but for those people that have claimed that the blu ray is outstanding and picture perfect are absolute liars! The picture is grainy all over, you can even see it on the faces in certain dark scenes, so do yourself a huge favour and don't buy this one. I don't regret losing 8 bucks, but why people lie and say something is fantastic when its not is just ridiculous. I have other movies that were made around the same time as this movie and they are fantastic picture and soundwise.  That reminds me, the sound is not great either, sounds too bright, for lack of a better word. Thank you and have a nice day!

0756404738|5.0|I just can't relate to any review that reflects disappointment in this 2nd volume. I loved reading the 1st book as it patiently developed the protagonist, themes and surroundings, and by the end I was hungry for more. On this 2nd book I got so much more.<br />Where this book begins we are already well situated in the setting and supporting characters, and it's fun to see more trials and errors within a familiar land. The book is so generous with it's page count there's pretty much an average novel's length right in familiar territory. But from the 2nd act, it takes us to completely new places, and new characters to explore. And I found it all fascinating, and completely entertaining. Frankly, I couldn't put it down.<br />Sure I was already attached to the characters established in Irme (especially Devi!), but there's so many more to meet.<br />This 2nd act plays as any good 2nd act should. More Thrills, More drama, and though it doesn't answer your aching questions, it brings in clues and more riddles.<br />The book is nearly 1000 pages long, yet it was over too soon. I anxiously look forward to being able to read the final act, which promises to be an epic one. Hell, it's already epic.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|ghis app isnt bad considering it is free, yes theui needs some help and the fact that it says &quot; radar is not supported for your territory and is availible only in the u.s.a&quot; when im in nevada is kinda confusing! like it though!

B005FUTBV4|5.0|RED STATE is - hands down - the most important, relevant, terrifying, disturbing, insightful, unflinching, vital, and powerful commentary on American religious fanaticism any filmmaker has dared to throw on the screen in the history of cinema.  It's also the most shocking, brutal, exciting, heartbreaking, thrilling, exhilarating, nail-biting, funny, hang-on-the-edge-of-your-seat, flat-out BEST piece of filmmaking anyone will release this year.    You finish watching it with the same feeling you had in 1992, walking out of Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.  With RED STATE, editor/writer/director Kevin Smith has taken a major artistic step onto a whole new level of filmmaking and he deserves Oscars for every category he's eligible for this year - Editing, Original Screenplay, Directing and Best Picture.  There's not one single misstep from the first frame, and not one unauthentic beat by any actor in any performance.  It's a film technically superior to every $200,000,000 blockbuster released this summer on all levels - acting, direction, writing, cinematography, sound, sound effects editing, scoring, music editing, special effects -  the whole nine yards.      RED STATE is the ultimate example of less is more - it hits you harder and blows you out of the theater 1,000 times faster than TRANSFORMERS or HARRY POTTER ever could.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|I'm really suprised at how this cd is so offensive.   I liked theorys last cd but this seems to be nothing more than filthy garbage aimed towards women.
0062060554|5.0|To put this review in context, I really enjoy the suspense/thriller genre and like authors like Michael Koryta, Lisa Unger, and Kate White.  I tend to be more a fan of suspense than gore or violence and this book was great for me.<br /><br />Our protagonist is Christine Lucas, a middle-aged woman with amnesia.  What makes her case unusual is that not only can she not remember her past, she can't form new memories.  When she goes to sleep at night it is as if her brain is wiped clean and each morning she has to start all over again.  What is her name?  Who is this man in the room with her that says he is her husband?  Where is she?  What happened to her that caused all of this?  Every morning, her husband is required to answer all these questions and more.  One morning her cell phone rings and it's a man claiming to be her doctor.  He tells her to go find her journal and tells her exactly where it has been hidden.  In it, she begins to read what she has previously written but the really startling words are to be found in the very front:  \\"Don't trust Ben.\\"  The novel covers a week in the life of Christine and some of her history is revealed in the other characters' narratives and in snippets of recovered memories - or not?  Not only is this suspenseful as the reader tries to understand what would cause her to write those chilling words, but the story draws the reader into picturing what it would be like to live a life you can't remember.  The author does a masterful job of showing just how vital memory is to who you are and just how vulnerable you when you are missing that piece.<br /><br />The novel starts out with a bang by such an unusual premise and then keeps building the suspense as the novel progresses.  I found myself totally engrossed and read the entire book in a 36 hour period - I just couldn't put it down.  The only real complaint I have is that the ending pages felt a bit rushed, but other than that it was close to perfect.  Even with that comment, the book ended the only way it could without being hokey or trite.  I finished it at 11:10 last night and my mind wouldn't settle down after reading the ending - 1:30 am I was still awake.  I will remember that the next time I read something by this author; don't read directly before bed or sleep will not come.ly way it could without being hokey or trite.

B004EPYZP8|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer was an ecellent film in my opinion! The story line was good, the acting extremely top notch, and the best surprise for me was that Hollywood can still produce a great movie!!!     In the last number of years, I have been buying English films. As I feel their story lines are far superior to the ones made here in the U.S.     I look at the actors and actresses here in America and find most of the young ones lacking in talent, and purpose. While the older ones still have the ability to put over a film even when the story line stinks! I do not mean to be offensive, but we don't have the Stars like in the past!!!     I have over 4,000 VHS and DVD'S in my collection, and feel I can tell a good one from one that isn't good. The same with the Actors and Actresses in them. You asked for my opinion, and now you have it!  Stan Schaeffer
0618001905|1.0|Ok, I understand reading this if your doing a research paper or project, but I don't recommend it for pleasure reading. Or any other reason.     I read this book for an AP English class, along with The Poisionwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, let's just say there. is. no. comparison. Both were about the Congo, Poisonwood was fiction however. Much better, and still historically accurate.    KLG was a disturbing story that I found somewhat dull. It's not your typical rising action, climax, falling action book, it starts and ends with the same tone (which is hardly any at all) and excitement level. It seems to be all about extensive politics and there are so many forgettable names it's hard to keep track of it all. For what I got out of the book, it seemed to take way too long of a time to tell it.    The author has no point of view and there is no emotional feeling in his writing. And under the circumstances of the horrific events he's writing about, I would expect a little more emotion.    Reading it is physically exhausting and I averaged 12 pages an hour, as opposed to my normal 30-40. There is no compelling reason to keep reading, especially if you aren't knowledgeable about the subject to begin with. The writing \\"style\\" is so hard to understand, it's definitely not kid, teen, or adult friendly. Unless you are experienced with Congo, Leopold and all his collegues, the political journey and geoghrapy of the Congo, you will have a hard time understanding the the heck is going on over the course of this book.    It's tedious reading and analyzing this book. If you have to read it for school like I did, good luck getting through it. Not one of my peers finished the book. It's that brutal.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I like the app except I can not add widgets. it says to press home and select widgets. there is no home or place to select widgets.
B0000CNY5G|5.0|I watched the VHS version of this movie years ago, and have recently bought two DVD versions on Amazon--the Brentwood/BCI Eclipse here and the Digiview version. I have a wide screen TV with a high quality blu-ray player which is supposed to raise the resolution of regular DVDs to HD.    I've watched both DVDs, and clearly the Brentwood is the better print.Significantly sharper and true to color considering the age of the movie (1961).Both are wide screen, with perhaps an inch or so of black around the borders. The Digiview is slightly blurry--it says \\"made in China\\", which tells you something. The Brentwood is darn good, but watch for the blu-ray version which comes out in November.Perhaps the blu-ray will be off the master, instead of the laser disc, as these older DVDs are.    Now,to the movie. I believe Rio is one of Brando's best, most creative roles, along with Stanley in \\"Streetcar\\", Terry in \\"Waterfront\\" and the Godfather in \\"Godfather\\".The guy is an absolute stud at this stage of his career--with a face like a Greek god.A real presence on the screen. As is his talent for creating a character, renowned from his acting school days. He covers his usual great range of emotions with flawless dynamics and timing--from some of the most tender, sensitive love scenes he's ever done with Luisa (played beautifully by Pina Pellicer, at his direction), to the raging bull with his fellow outlaws. The film is aided by an exceptional cast featuring Karl Malden in one of his best roles as the bad guy,Dad,who deserts his friend,Rio(he and Marlon were the best of friends for 50 years in real life), and also Ben Johnson, Katy Jurado and a host of excellent character actors. The cinematography is breathtaking, with the backdrop of the Pacific ocean in on-location scenes. And then there's the musical score--one of best, most romantic in all films--by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer, by the way, also did the orchestrations for the classic movie \\"Casablanca.\\"    \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" has become a cult film. It is said to bridge the old style 50s westerns with the new-style anti-hero spaghetti westerns of the 60s and later. It is apparently Martin Scorcese's favorite Western--which is enough to gain it some notoriety. It grows on you. You watch it a few times, and the performances start to sharpen, the scenery becomes more breathtaking, and the music starts to move you--especially in the tender romantic scenes between Rio and Luisa. Brando had that feminine, vulnerable side to him that all the great ones have, and it shows up in these scenes. Was he,too,revealing his other \\"Eye\\" when he came clean with Luisa about the jewelry?    It is said that Brando's direction resulted in a 4+ hour film which had to be cut by editors to the final 141 minutes. That's a lot of cutting. Brando's ending had Luisa killed in the last shootout by Dad's last shot. In fact, you can see her slumped over a bit on her horse as she rides out of town with Rio. The next scene, which was reshot later after the ending change, shows her riding more upright on her horse.Malden said Brando's original ending was better--it would have heightened the power and irony of the film. But 4+ hours? No. The editors did a good job,in my view, with the cutting, regardless of which ending.It's still a great film--Luisa dead or alive.     A word about Brando's view of the film: he said years later all he remembered was all the women in the movie he made love to off the set while filming. You can count the possibilities--about seven beauties! Including Katy Jurado, an old flame, and Pina Pellicer, who received  a memorable introduction to method acting by Brando which surely aided her performance.

B005COO1X6|1.0|This book starts out interesting enough - a car pulls over to help someone he thinks is stranded - NO SPOILERS HERE - it doesn't work out.  Then the next car comes, then the next. Okay but then what?  Nothing.  This ending left me flat and feeling cheated.  two different story strands seem like they will come together but in the end there's nothing there.<br />I like Stephen King but this is no Christine.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|nice weather app, has lots of details. out of the 4 or 5 different weather widgets I've tried on the homescreen, this one is the best (pleasant looking &amp; simple - the 4x1 widget). got it as a free app but after trying, I would have paid $3. Rating 5 stars as 95% of apps are a &lt; 10 minute novelty, useless, or look bad so nice to be able to give kudos.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is the first installment of a saga. There is no telling how long Scalzi can mine the premise. He says he did not read Haldeman's Forever War until quite a while after people began telling him he ought to give Joe a share of the royalties. I believe him. The novel stands on its own. You don't need to read the sequels to appreciate it.

B002ZG98C8|4.0|A very entertaining action movie. The violence is so graphic, but not in a disgusting way.    The movie is entertaining, funny, weird, and sarcastic.     It has a very \\"Tarantino\\" Feel to it.    If you're hanging with a bunch of friends and looking forward to watching an action fun movie, Machete won't disappoint you.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|incredibly confusing to use. was this made for scientists? gps doesnt work. even tried typing in zip. why did they pick those symbols as buttons? makes no sense.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|So far, I haven't found a tablet based weather app that I really like.  This one is no exception.  Certainly it has the stylish look to it, as advertised, but stylish doesn't often mean functional.  Sure the app *looks* pretty, but it's not very intuitive. The info I need (basically just a temperature and precipitation probability) is all there, but it's not presented in a way that makes any sense.  Putting it all on a round clock works, I guess, but it is hard to follow, and I couldn't even figure out what tapping on a spot on the clock does, except change the numbers around.  It should be a pretty easy task to pull weather data from a server and present it; I shouldn't have to try to figure out exactly what this thing is trying to show me.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This set is great.  Quality or blu-rays are great.  Well, the second and last movie are amazing, the first is still up there.  The set comes in a great case, no extra gimmicky stuff, just a box and all the movies, including a database film, which I haven't got to yet.  I didn't care much for the animatrix other than the uprising of the machines, so I didn't watch this one yet either...  Well, buy this, or don't buy any other, Screw Neo, THIS IS THE ONE.  Or you could wait for the next revolution of video format, but yeah.  I got it on a gold box deal for $28, look for these deals and buy these revolutionary movies.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|Could you believe the only reason (other than De Niro and close release proximity of Raging Bull) I picked up this film was because it was referenced in the anime, Eden of The East (a four star anime).<br />Well, I got it expecting a blood bath of vengeance.  What I got, was a drama that was engulfed in the perspective of Travis (the main character) whose insomnia pushes him to get a job driving a taxi. \\"I drive around all night, I might as well get paid for it.\\"  I'm not going to go into the movie, just look it up on wiki or something.<br />The quality of the film is amazing, the sound... Well, I have no awesome theater system, but it sounds great coming out of my logitech 5.1 surround sound.  Um... special feature are present and you get it in a cool, but bulky case.  I love it though..<br />Wow, I winged it with this movie and I scored big.  Just be careful watching this movie, it makes you feel like crap afterwards.  Like, damn... Life sucks.

B0000252YK|5.0|I give very high praise to this record..it gets a LOT of flack. I must have bought this album maybe 4 times by now. I remember a friend turning me onto the title track when I was in high school back in 2000 and those opening drums FLOORED me. To this day, its a record that GREATLY influences me and is easily one of my top 5 favorite whole albums.    Pros:  -Jake's guitar playing on US is INCREDIBLY unique. You'll never hear anything like it ever again. That's dang near guaranteed.   -TONS of melody and hooks. Few albums have this many.  -The songs are just plain FUN to listen to. This is a perfect jam-out album.   -unusual song structures; songs like \\"Fool Like You\\" and \\"Never\\" at first listen seem to kind meander a bit and go nowhere, but something ineffable happens after you hear them a couple times. I can't explain it but its definitely a good thing.  -That middle part of the title track...where Jake kicks on the wah pedal, and the solo to Secret Loser..UNBEATABLE.  -RIFFS RIFFS RIFFS  -some REALLY cool drum grooves from Randy Castillo. primal. unique.  -Jake's tone is very aggressive; it sounds MEAN. And, thank goodness he didn't use so much flanger this album.       Cons:  -the sound of the drums; Randy's playing is so great on this album, but his kit gets washed out in so much reverb (typical 80's drums)  -they really needed to turn up the bass guitar, another place a lot of 80's music suffers.  -Jake got jipped on the EQ!      If Ozzy decided to pull out the master tapes from this album, and go easy on the reverb with Randy's drums, as well as turn up the bass guitar a bit..this album would be treated MUCH differently by the general rock/metal public. You'd hear a band that's very similar to his original line-up, its just that mid 80's mastering techniques shadows it a bit. Ozzy's band always sounds best with his rhythm section placed forward a little bit; like on \\"Never\\" as well his earlier albums are characterized by. Someone will shoot me for this though..I never liked Randy's guitar tone. It was way too mid-rangey and way too forward in the mix to the point it sounded very cold. Crazy Train!! That's some pretty ugly mixing and guitar tone right there. Jake's tone isn't that far off from Randy's, but Jake's albums with Ozzy were panned and mixed in a lot more evenly as when it came to the guitars.    I urge you all to try to find the Japanese 2007 remaster of this album.
0198326769|5.0|This is a powerful book, and well written. The subject matter is a harrowing one of course, and it is hard to imagine that a book about concentration camps could be a pleasant read. But this book is engrossing, and the friendship between Bruno and Schmuel is a powerful antidote to the evil's taking place.     The ending is profound and powerful. Not a happy book, but one you cannot regret reading.

I finally relented and while I see why she loved it, being a young teen and could never escape the fact that the book was geared towards younger readers despite the body count.  So I will just say that teens will love this and I did not.

B0054N73EY|5.0|I don't write reviews....ever. I simply needed to let people know how amazing this album is. I am a self designated amateur musicologist, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. I've been a hard core music fan for 31+ years, creating my own music for the last 8 and have seen over a thousand live concerts. I am only stating this so you understand the following review has truly received both intense critical measurement and repeated listens (dozens of plays) of I'm With You. This is not a song by song review but a bit of a message to some of the folks who might have previously been into the Chili's and wandered. I gained the notion to write this after letting a few folks who thought they weren't really into the Chilis that much anymore a listen to the new disc. Their positive response spoke volumes and I wondered how many folks out there might not immediately go out and listen to or buy this album.     OK, let's begin...    Along with most of the fans I know I was hesitant to think the Red Hot Chili Peppers could actually pull it all off without John Frusciante in the ranks. Many of you will remember the One Hot Minute album with Jane's Addiction's talented Dave Navarro on guitar. The Chilis are a great band, Daves a great guitarist...it should have resulted in a really great album. Unfortunately, though it had it's bright spots and a hit single, One Hot Minute was clearly not as well received as the releases preceeding it. I personally really enjoy it as a stand alone album but the public was a bit more fickle and a bit let down. The friendly exit of Navarro and later return of Frusciante was page one music news. We knew what we could expect from this lineup and carried high expectations. The resulting 3 albums they crafted together proved it was nothing short of rock and roll magic when these 4 guys decided to make music as a band.     Flash forward to John deciding to again make an exit and news of some relatively unknown, yet not so inexperienced, guitarist planning to join the fray. OK, this should be interesting I remember thinking while my expectations were admittedly low. I just didn't see how they could go from such a prolific player like John that had proved his hit making ability at the Grammy level to somebody... well...  new. I'll admit now that I truly would have been content with WHOEVER it was as long as they released a quasi-decent album every 4-5 years or so as the Chilis, playing the Summer shed outdoor venue circuit once a year and aging gracefully, satisfied and most importantly, together.     I wonder now how I could have ever been anything but optimistic with the Chilis. What I received in the mail was an AMAZING disc of instantly classic songs full of intricate musicianship, thoughtful lyrics, platinum bass hooks and killer layered harmonies. Not only did the Chilis release what I personally consider (opinion) to be the second greatest album of their career (wedged between 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magic and 1999's Californication) but in the process they also  delivered to the public a new guitarist that will clearly become one of the true greats, that guitarist Ladies and Gentlemen is Mr. Josh Klinghoffer. He has an incredibly unique playing style that ranges from the perhaps unconscious scatter jazz funk influence of his long time pal Frusciante to widely experimental solos, runs and chords that recall some of guitar's true sonic pioneers such as  Robert Fripp and Adrian Belew. On first listen there is a good chance you might think Josh's  playing is a bit too controlled or subtle for the funky bombastic songs of the Chilis and perhaps set a bit too low in the overall album mix. However, on repeat listens you will start to hear the intricate chords, warm harmonies, funky and experimental leads and Josh's great vocals that all blend and flow seamlessly in and out of the Chilis melodies. Quite literally every time I listen to the album I  hear something new in Josh's playing. As a guitarist myself it's refreshing to know Josh did not go in with his guns blazing focused on trying to be exactly what people might have expected of him. Klinghoffer has clearly contributed in a big way to the band as an artist while taking huge personal and artistic risks. The resulting sound is both warmly familiar and excitingly new at the same time. It turns out that Josh is the perfect artist to help lead the band into new musical territories while respecting the legacy of the bands much loved sound.         The rest of the band plays like they were a new band trying to get noticed for the first time. They've  really put their hearts and souls into this one. Flea has cited early Rolling Stones as one influence for his playing on this album but I felt his memorable disco funk playing honored the hit making hooks of Chic's Bernard Edwards, circa '76-'80. Here comes a bold statement... ready for it? The bass lines on this Chilis album are more memorable than any Flea has recorded before. There I said it. I don't state that lightly folks, after all this is Flea we are talking about here! Flea recently hit the books to study music for his own fulfillment and that effort has allowed one of the most respected masters of bass guitar to push his throne even further out of reach from fellow bassists. If Geddy Lee listened to this album he'd comment on it's amazing bass lines.     Chad's drumming, as ALWAYS, is just plain rock solid. Tricky, yet highly melodic, syncopated North African counter rhythms add a touch of a world beat feel to the songs where they are present. On I'm With You Chad is accompanied by impressive Latin percussion that is tightly integrated with his drum lines. His lightning fast rolls drive the songs forward surging the tracks into dramatic changes and his thunderous fills give evidence of a slightly more hard rock leaning than alternative or funk; perhaps influenced by his recent work with the hard rock super-group Chickenfoot. At any rate, the drums also seem turned up a bit louder in the mix giving the faster moving songs the power to incite random fits of listener air drumming.     Musicians are amazing. It's not easy folks. However, I would argue being a vocalist is potentially a greater challenge. You not only have to master the ability to sing but you are also quite literally the instrument. On top of that if you are going to write your own lyrics, well... if that's the case now you'll have to master your own mind too. On top of all this you need to maintain physical health. All things that fall to a lesser importance when you can pick up an instrument. This is a lead singers crowning moment as an artist. Anthony has really outdone himself on I'm With You, perhaps more so than any of the other individual Chilis. While I love the last 2 albums the Chili Peppers released I had started to notice that Anthony's smooth stream of consciousness lyrics, while working very well aurally within the framework of the songs, just did not seem as emotionally close or personally important to me as those on some of his earlier albums. The lyrics sounded great together when he sang them but I couldn't seem to internalize them as much as the lyrics on albums like Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Mother's Milk or Californication. I do think Stadium Arcadium is an outstanding album with it's own peak attractions but it didn't touch my life in that other worldly spiritual way the way the previously mentioned classics I've cited did. Police Station is a great example of Anthony Kiedis's gold medal vocal victory. The visualized stories and imagery created by Anthony's lyrics and delivery really pull you into the song. On Factory of Faith and Look Around the lyrics create an emotion inside the listener. Factory of Faith casting an instantly uplifting sense of hope and new beginning (how fitting) and Look Around providing an inner sense of flight and movement with an overtone of laid back carelessness. Every song on this album has lyrics that are plainly honest, highly witty, phonetically musical and incredibly artistic. Kiedis sings so confidently and clearly that you almost feel his voice is travelling in a separate audio track across the music making the whole mix sound incredible and far better than a listener could expect for such dynamic and sometimes dense music (many thanks to Rick Rubin). How Kiedis could have lived the roller coaster of a life he has had, going through so much personal turmoil, only to be able to create something of this critical weight is astonishing.    So that's my honest take on the album boys and girls. If you took the time to read this diatribe I can only hope you took one thing away from it: that you do not want to miss this classic album. It is a must have for any serious music fan's collection and a great choice if you're a casual fan too.
B001GJOL22|5.0|One of the best blu rays I have ever seen (and are a lot).  Excellence in Audio and Video  Rush as always rules, this friends just get better as time goes by.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Nice,  useful app.  Would give it 2 more stars if the location worked properly. My current location based on gps works on and off (gps in my phone is working fine and has signal). If i manually input a location, it searches my gps for a minute then comes back empty. Also it would be nice to be able to do a quick location search without saving it. I live in the sf bay area and frequently travel based on where the weather looks good, so i search a lot of places and dont like going into the settings every time.
1595828095|5.0|This collection is something that's been lurking in the background of my consciousness for a long time and it's amazing in it's fruition. Bernie (Berni?) Wrightson arguably did some of his best work for the Warren line. Here, you can see his strong professional work at its prime and also see hints of what's to come with his later  Frankenstein illustrations. His exuberant love of the horror medium seasoned with irony and dark humor and visceral gore are in full force in these stories. His line work was the envy of the industry from crisp hair thin lines to meaty brush work and deeply spotted blacks Bernie was the artist to follow. His structure was massive and his anatomy was dramatic and skewed to the purpose. The design work in panel layout and panel composition and pure drawing skills were the hallmarks of his well deserved status  The reproductions, while not archival quality, are solidly represented here. Even the inking work he did for artists Howard Chaykin and Carmine Infantino's sequential work are present in this collection. Best of all are the frontispiece illustrations from both Creepy and Eerie magazines. These incredible drawings needed to be collected because they are among the finest works in Bernie's career as an artist of the horrific, macabre, heroic and whimsical monstrosities. These illustrated, sequential tales and evocative full page illustrations are Bernie Wrightson firing on all cylinders to wonderful and unparalleled  effect. The bargain price for this quality hardcover mens someone's getting a copy for Christmas.

B0058EBNAO|1.0|It doesn't work on my EVO 4G.  I select a city and I get an error when trying to get the data.  I've tried different cities, and used GPS for location but no luck.  Rebooting the phone didn't help at all.  I'll be uninstalling this one.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Liked this app..it has nice handy features.. Amazing widget.. Need improvements in accurate data and how to use.. Am on atrix
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Nice start, but unintuitive interface. (you have to go to the menu to pull up the radar screen. Really?)  Maybe they'll fix it in the future. Willing to wager on it for free, but would have uninstalled in less than 15 minutes if I had paid for it.  Tested on samsung infuse, rooted, running infusion 1.8 kernel, infused 1.5.3 rom
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Works great, beautiful app great UI fast and accurate too. Right after I opened it, within seconds it had my city weather up to date.<br />I love the notification system too.<br />LG Optimus S with Gingerbread 2.3.5

B005KAH7QU|5.0|It is really not possible to classify this film. Wrapped in the action movie genre, it is really a composition with each piece and scene crafted for effect. Unlike Inception and Avatar it does not rely on CGI special effects. Real people, real situations, for the most part. It shows that Saoirse Ronan's Oscar Nomination at age 13 for her role in Atonement was not a fluke.  Beauty and evil, innocence and horror are all in display, often in the same character. A child one moment, a hunter the next, vulnerable then detached. Add a Peter and the Wolf type theme that's bound to get stuck in your head and an excellent use of music in the film.  When I saw the movie in the theater, I liked it but was very conflicted, which is what I believe the film was trying to achieve. It was a film I continued to think about for awhile after seeing it. Not earth shattering but an effective morality piece whose message did not smack you in the head.
B000J103OI|4.0|It's Working Girl all over again with an overbearing boss this time in the world of fashion design. Anne Hathaway is sufficient in role of aspiring writer who is convinced being a secretary in a high scale fashion magazine will open many doors.<br />The nemeses is her cranky and inner boiling high tempered boss played by Meryl Streep.<br />Anne gives a suitable portrayal as clunky type freshman to a world of high design, but picks up tips with a fellow coworker who has been in the business, and even gets hit on by another high profile celebrity in the business, thus leaving her decision to relish in her new upscale life while ignoring her real friends, and boyfriend.<br />The challenge of being a number one secretary to one of the most notorious fashion model magazines with hardcore nails in the journalistic business almost makes her go for it, until Miranda, the boss, confides an observation of similarity. It is this revelation which makes the successful secretary drop everything, when accused of doing or walking over anybody to simply get ahead. Well made moral, and makes you wonder who the real lucky ones are in the scheme of things. The Miranda's, or the typical everyman.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|There's a pretty steep learning curve involved in replacing your keyboard with a keypad for gaming, but in the end (months after buying it) I am satisfied with the G13 for playing MMOGs.<br /><br />I will say that I have not yet managed to become comfortable with playing shooters using the keypad. I still default to the keyboard for those.<br /><br />That said, my MMO performance has improved as a result of having my common keys bound. I used to be a very heavy clicker, only binding a very few \\"reaction\\" type abilities. As it stands now, I have all but my \\"mundane utility\\" keys bound, and I'm much more able to move quickly when under attack as a result.<br /><br />For someone who was an excellent player even clicking, this has brought my level of play up even more.<br /><br />The software is a bit troublesome at times, and the documentation isn't fabulous, but as a package it is definitely worth buying if you are looking to commit to making  switch in how you control your games.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Hats off to the devs..does exactly what I needed and then some. Fantastic integration with box.net  Too bad that it doesn't work on some phones but give this thing a try..very handy.
0786948523|4.0|This review is copied and pasted across all of the 4th edition products I purchased as it relates to the system as a whole. The individual books are all decently made, and have reasonable (though far from perfect) editing.<br /><br />For those who grew up playing Dungeons & Dragons (as I did) this 4th edition of the game is not what we are used to. This does not mean it is a poor game, by any means. It does, however, mean that what you are buying is a \\"modern\\" interpretation of the classic game. It feels much more like a video game than a pen and paper role playing game.<br /><br />In the end, this is not a bad product line, but it is a better one for younger gamers than for those of us who are older and who were heavily exposed to earlier editions.
B0034G4P8K|5.0|There is a real plot behind this one and Sam is not just a sidekick for the robots this really is his story and the robots also have a good story of their own and some good new characters.  Now they have come to the end of the road with Michael Bay and his vision for Transformers I think it would be nice if the next batch of Transformers movies go back to basics and the G1 Transformers where the robots don't have this skeletal look and are more like the original toys in both appearance and basic plot.

B0055EDBIE|5.0|When I first heard 5, back in 9th grade, I hated it and had buyer's remorse. Then it grew on me and became an album that has defined a period of my life, a classic, an album that brings back memories and emotions that I felt back in high school. I felt the sameabout this new record. I had buyers remorse and was ready to hang it up, but then, guess what? It grew on me and more and more I started liking the new songs. You have to give Lenny's music a chance, he is very creative and we are not used to that in the USA. We like songs and artists who fit in boxes. Lenny can not fit in a box. The man is too big.     LENNY!!!!!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I only started seriously listening to Joe Bonamassa during this year.  Initially I regarded him as just another wannabe guitar hero emulating the styles of Stevie Ray, EC and other noterary guitarists.  I've been listening to Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne and I enjoy their stuff but nothing of theirs fairly compares to the electric excitement and fire that JB has to offer. I think Joe is an a world and league of his own.<br /><br /> This DVD is an excellent showcase of the wide variety of styles he is capable of playing in concert or even during one of his solos.  He has obviously mastered the blues rock styles of his heros like Clapton and Page but if you listen and watch closely, you will hear country & western speed picking, dreamy acoustic guitar and jazz inspired licks.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into each song on this visual collection, but I want to mention what I regard as the two highlights of this video.  The first is a guest appearance by \\"god\\" himself, Eric Clapton.  How ironic that this relatively young guitar slinger who was inspired to play the electric guitar when, at age 10 or so, he watched Cream's farewell concert of 1968 recorded at the very same venue and told his father I'm going to play there someday. EC's appearance is akin to the Pope visiting St. Peter's whilst an up and coming young priest might be saying Mass . . . what an honor to be there.  What an incredible honor to have a life long resident of the Royal Albert Hall show up and play a song with you!<br /><br />The second piece of this DVD that really captured me is JB's high powered version of ZZ Top's \\"Just Got Paid\\" during which he makes a perfect segway into a Jimmy Page Led Zep medley.  And then he returns to the rockin' riff of the original tune just as seamlessly.  Although Joe can seemingly play anyone's solo note for note, his covers are elegant nods to the greats of classic rock while he languishes his own special blend of musical herb and spices to make such gems unmistakably his own.<br /><br />Given JB's guitar virtuosity, it is almost easy to overlook his vocal skills.  I think his voice is as distinctive and full of variable range to keep any listener attentive and entertained.  But what I love about Joe the most is his humbleness and humility.  In the interviews I have seen including those on this DVD, he remains accessible and in good humor despite his rise to stardom.<br /><br />This is an excellent piece of musical and visual entertainment.  Buy it and enjoy it over and over again.JB's guitar virtuosity, it is almost easy to overlook his vocal skills.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|Wanted to see this since I heard Bana, Blanchett and Ronan would be teaming up with Joe Wright. Love the film's visual tyle and enjoyed the film except for one intense fight scene that abruptly ends without giving you its conclusion until later in the film. Smart action film.
B0000004V2|1.0|.... and I don't.  The first couple of songs are nice enough, but the rest of it is a disjointed and inaccessible mess.  To their favor, no one can accuse them of selling out and losing their indie cred with an overproduced pop album, but there's a difference between being \\"off center\\" and \\"way out there.\\"  I know many folks go bananas for the Stone Roses, but I just don't see it.  Were they an overlooked band who never got the recognition they deserved?  Not really.  They have their cult following, and that's all a band that focuses more on being cool than producing listenable songs can expect.
B0012GN0JE|2.0|Jeff Beck's Flash In my opinion, was not one of his better albums.   \\"Gets us all in the end\\" is a hard driving rocker.   \\"People Get Ready\\" with Rod Stewart on vocals is a Classic!  Take these 2 tracks out of there, and this was a new sound experiment   gone south! Too much of that New Wave sound which was becoming increasingly   popular in the 80's. Just not my cup of tea.   But if that sound is you Go for it! Jeff Beck is still one of the All time  best Guitarist's that ever played an ax.
B003TZ9EGO|1.0|When I bought this cd, I was hoping for some fun remixes of my favorite Gaga music. Unfortunately, I cannot listen to the remixes on this cd. I enjoy dance music, and I thoroughly enjoy Gaga, but the remixes twist Gaga's music into songs that are hard to recognize as originally hers. The distortion of her voice, the wacky rhythms, and the twisted melodies make this a cd I no longer listen to.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|Breaking Bad, the third season: I purchased a used video of season three, the video was in excellent condition, delivered quickly.  More importantly, is that I loved the third season, but of course, I am prejudice because I am a big time fan of Bryan Cranston.  He doesn't disapoint us this season,your left with a cliff hanger ending,and a must mention, is the beloved Aaron Paul, who still  is one of the greatest supporting actors of our time!  This series will delight all their fans!  I don't know how they do it, but  they keep you entertained and you feel like you are there with them scene by scene!  The writting, scrips are great and I sure  hope that they can continue this way for many more seasons.  Suprisingly enough, there isn't much of an advertising campaign for  \\"Breaking Bad\\".  I first learned about this show on AMC through a friend.  I've told all my friends about this show and like me  they too where unaware of it.  However, after they watched just one episode of \\"Breaking Bad\\"  they too hunger for more!    Buy it or rent it is my recommendation, and no my tape is not for sale, as its in my library with all the other seasons!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Try using foreca.com, instead of intellicast.com on the location setting. Also use wifi first, gps is not functioning properly. Hopefully future updates can fix this.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|I'm searching for a good weather widget, and this is definitely not it. The widget was cluttered and info was poorly labeled. there was also a really ugly picture of a flaming ball that I assume is supposed to tell me its sunny out. Tried to change the pictures to &quot;classic&quot; but no change. Also slow to load weather info even though i was using a zip code and not current location.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Even though the radar loads a little slowly I am giving this app a 5_star rating because it packs so much very good info in such elegant UI.   The weather clock is brilliant. Even though I got this free as FAOTD I would absolutely pay for it knowing what I know now.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|If you are looking for an all in one Weather App with, USGS alerts, then this is for you. If you are looking to replace a weather app and you like simple then this is not for you. I can only say I'm a radar guy, and Weather Bug has a nice radar. It ran fine on my EVO 4G, and the reason for 4*, was the battery drain, on the EVO, I can't handle that. Otherwise it's a nice all in one App.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Works on EVO but kill other weather processes services widgets, ie weather bug &amp; twc. The gps should locate you then. Once gps is found, other features seem to work without problem. The weather radar seems to DL larger chunks of data, maybe a setting. Missing move app to SD card, you can flush radar data but still I would rather have it on SD card. Many options are there just need to find them, better documentation. Provides lots of data which can be toggled by touch. More detailed data like wunderground does, might be too much for someone who's happy with default weather app. Alerts bar can be configed but easily too much with clock bat sig bar etc. Most GUI has very good detail, widget defaults to low transparent view so less detail. Not as bad as some have quickly reviewed. Check settings if you find something you don't like about it.
B005LLSLPE|5.0|Sure was a long wait (again!) but well worth it! The jet-fueled premier of the 4th run was incredibly satisfying in itself, and promises much more over the next several weeks -- like tying up at least some of the purposely left loose ends from the preceding seasons as well adding new twists.  Katey Sagal is as fierce & fabulous as ever; didn't think it was possible, but the ensemble cast seems even more relaxed & enmeshed than before, very believable that they have known each other for ages, thru all kinds of stormy weather. A consistent show strength has been to demonstrate the cohesiveness of the club while illustrating the concerns, doubts, resentments that flicker thru & between individual members or associates -- these actors all seem to have a gift for nuance, and the camera work complements it well.  My experience has been that at least 2 viewings are required to even begin to pick up all the glances and grimaces that further the story, not to mention verbal & visual allusions. For instance, I noticed that the Asst. U.S. Attorney has pictures of Otto & Juice under the heading \\"Plan B\\" on his office wall of shame (mug shots & photos of Samcro and everyone living or dead ever associated w/ the club). So the 2nd time I watched Juice more closely (and what I saw makes me kinda nervous...and very anxious for the next episode!)
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I really love every song on this album.  This is definitely Britney's best album yet and most sexy and fun!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This was the Amazon free app for a day and it actually is really good. The earthquake information is really cool mainly for the fact that I live on the east coast and we just had that small quake. Also, the app is just gorgeous and the plethora of widget options is really nice.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've tried a couple of other apps including weather channel and the default Droid X motoblur weather app and this is by far the most responsive and useful. Has lots of great information and, being located in the Pacific northwest, the inclusion of earthquakes is a nice extra touch. Another reviewer mentioned the low-res clock widget. I noticed the same thing, but A. it didn't really bother me and B. the 4x4 widget is too big to be practical for my usage. Overall, I highly recommend this for someone looking for more weather info than standard or a smooth clean interface. My one issue is I haven't been able to find a way to change the color of notification bar's temp notification. Not a big deal, and to be fair I've only had about ten minutes to play around with it so far.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Why don't you stop, George? Where's the love for your craft?    With the additional, ADDITIONAL changes to this latest release of Star Wars on Blu-Ray, it's become evident that Lucas has lost his way and is no longer in love with film, or story, or really knows how to create anymore.    A quick review of the the changes to the original trilogy: An audio change to the original krayt dragon call made by obi-wan to scare away the tusken raiders (ep iv); jabba's door is...bigger (ep vi); a new cgi creature with hemorrhoids (seemingly) is added in Jabba's Palace (ep vi); Vader says \\"NNNOoooooooooo!\\" when tossing the emperor down the shaft (ep vi); Oh and let's not forget the ewoks now blink...wow.    Now, that ewok change...no big deal, that's fine. But the other changes, plus the first few changes made since the Special Editions/Prequels came out, have shown me that Lucas lives in a cold, cruel world of his own making. Imagine, back in 1977, a true artist surrounded by peers and friends who constantly gave him feedback, structured notes, important insights, and original ideas to fuel his creative process? And he, in turn, giving BACK to them by listening, learning, and allowing a wonderful story to emerge that people all over the world fell in love with?    That artist was George, but no longer. George, stop tinkering needlessly! This blu-ray release is the most disappointing of all Star Wars releases. Bring back the original theatrical releases and let's make the galaxy right again.
0316077046|4.0|I definitely think that this book was a good continuance of the first book. Beautiful Creatures left you on a cliffhanger...both action-wise and emotionally. I was a little irritated with Lena gallivanting off with Mr. Mysterious, but I loved the new addition of a witty character. I really think that this book gives you more history and information about how that world actually works. ...\\"The Order of Things\\" if you will.<br /><br />Again, Amma & Lena's quirky Caster relatives really keep things interesting, as usual. The ending is absolutely something that is work the 500 pages before it.<br /><br />This Southern Gothic series is quickly becoming one of my new favorites. The characters, plot, and premise (all very well developed) make this story refreshing if you've grown weary of the usual suspects...fallen angels, werewolves, and vampires. Don't get me wrong, I still love those creepy-crawly beings, but it's always nice to have something extra-extra-ordinary come along once in a while to offer some relief to the barrage of the overused supernatural/paranormal beings.<br /><br />This Casterful [magical] adventure is worth reading...especially if you love a good twist of an ending that will completely blindside you!
B002ZG9788|5.0|Totally underrated by the critics. This remake puts the Harry Hamlin cornball, costume drama to shame. If you love Greek mythology, this will surely satisfy. The CGI effects are spectacular--Hades, Scorpiochs, the beheading of Medusa by Perseus, Zeus and his court, Pegasus, and the Kraken terrorizing Argos. Sam Worthington excels in this action role as he first starts out as a humble fisherman (until his family and boat are destroyed by Hades)  and morphs into a fearless, fighting machine. He volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus and unleash hell on earth. You feel the positive vibes and won't be disappointed.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|at first glance I thought this would be a good app. I read the reviews for it and most of them said negative things about it, regardless of what I read I tried it out anyways. it downloaded it and installed it no problem, but when I opened it all it would say and all I could see it said searching for my location by gps, it never found it even after being connected to WiFi and my gps activated it never found my location. the closest it got to my actual location was about 15 miles from me but it never showed the map or anything besides my so called &quot;location&quot;. I would not recommend this app to be downloaded for anyone because it doesn't work. and its not like i have a bad phone, I have the HTC evo 4G. I hope the makers fix the problems with it, it seems like it has potential. But for now I'm gonna have to give this 1 star. if I could I would give it no stars, its just a waste of space and effort. ^_^
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I thought Firefly was better than the movie (that you should watch 1st if you buy both).  Firefly was a series on TV.  It wasn't my favorite series but it is pretty good.  I think it got better as it went along.  Unfortunately, like most of this type of series, it only lasts for 1 or 2 seasons & doesn't really have an ending.  You can kind of figure out how it \\"would end\\".  It's different enough to be worth the watch.
1594744769|4.0|Young Adult Lit is straddling redundancy, what with all the bestsellers of its genre as of late containing the tired subject matter of vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural themes.  Though Ransom Rigg's debut novel treads some of the same territory, it brings something new to the table with its eccentric, somewhat haunting, and intrepid tale of a gifted young man who comes to believe in the impossible.<br /><br />\\"Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children\\" pits 16-year old Jacob Portman in a haphazard quest of self-discovery when his grandfather Abe whispers a cryptic message to him before dying a strange death.  \\"Go to the island,\\" Abe beseeches him, referencing a remote place in which he spent part of his youth as a refugee during World War II.  Though Jacob has long since dismissed many of his grandfather's stories of the place as tall tales, he nonetheless promises Abe that he will make the pilgrimage, a bizarre sighting the night of his death propelling him forward.<br /><br />Once Jacob sets foot on the British island of Cairnholm to locate the orphanage in which his grandfather stayed those many years ago, he quickly finds what he's looking for but all is not as it seems.  Where the story goes from here is by turns magical and terrifying, the rules of time and space not merely bent but broken.<br /><br />Many gifted individuals populate the story, \\"peculiar\\" being the operative word for much of everything about them and around them.  One is invisible; another can conjure fire in her palms.  There is a boy who is capable of raising the dead, and a girl who levitates.  Riggs endows the book with a plethora of possibilities, much of his inspiration derived from bizarre photos (there are over 40 of them) collected from various sources that he includes in the effort to pace and enhance the story. Not that it needs enhancement - the steady tempo of and rich description within Rigg's first-person narrative is more than sufficient.<br /><br />His main characters are well-rounded and likeable.  Jacob is a typical teenager, coming off as a sullen slacker in the beginning but experiences tremendous growth throughout the course of the story, making the book somewhat of a coming-of-age tale.  He comes to understand that he is far more responsible than he thought, that he is an honorable man (despite a falling out with a friend), a gentleman, and incredibly valiant even when fear of death threatens to paralyze him.  His love interest Emma is a plucky and astute young woman who is wise beyond her physical years, ready and willing to fight as fiercely as a man to protect herself and her young and anomalous flock, her steely front belying a wounded heart.  The remaining cast of characters gets limited expansion, and this is understandable.  Too much history on a company that large would've bogged down the narrative, disrupting the flow and possibly boring readers.  After all, the story is about Jacob - they are mere sidebars in the proceedings.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />I have only one significant gripe about this book, and it's that I'm a bit disappointed in the inexplicable turn of events the author creates in order to give his characters a happy ending.  He offers no discernible explanation for the time loop failure that allows the children to start aging again as normal and this can come off as an easy out to people who want that question answered.  But reason is probably too great a thing to ask in this case, considering the book's fantastical subject matter, and who could really begrudge themselves or others a happy ending?  This is fiction after all, and though great fiction is often logical and pragmatic, the story and/or the author must be allowed on occasion a few minor rebellions.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're craving the simple and expeditious storytelling that YA novels offer but don't want another formulaic supernatural tale that publishers seem to be churning out en masse these days, give Ransom Riggs a go.  Though the new kid on the block, he's sure to become an old favorite.the block, he's sure to become an old favorite.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I didn't care that much for this movie.  I did watch it before watching Firefly.  Thought the acting and general program was better in Firefly.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I really like the graphs, but its a bit clunky. The current temp was not right for my current location. I'll stay with weatherbug, thanks.
B004LP3AYI|2.0|I own the paper back books of the entire Sword of Truth series and beyond. The books are absolutely some of my favorites. That is the BOOKS and not the kindle issue. Error after Error after Error. Spelling mistakes and mistakes in wrong words used greatly annoys me, seeing that these errors happen several times per page. It disrupts the flow of reading. These errors were not made in the paper back books, they were made during the conversion to Kindle. Whomever proof read before publishing obviously was not interested in there job.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|This is not accurate at all. It tells me cloudy at 53 degrees when in fact its in the 60's with clear skies. Sometimes the temperature on my top tool bar tells me something different than what the widget is displaying.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|A very nice app that combines multiple pieces of information into a simple, easy to read package.<br /><br />For those complaining about updating location issues, check you phones location and security settings along with the applications location settings.  For me, WiFi often identifies my location as Los Angeles, CA, 30 miles north of where I am.
0307394549|5.0|This is a great cookbook.  I have gotten rave reviews everytime I made cookies from this book (Christmas, NYW, Easter, brother's wedding).  At a New years party, the other guests though I bought the cookies from a backery.    Regrading the people who gave this book bad reviews - I can only assume they are not very good bakers.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I love Johnny Depp! I couldn't wait to watch this movie again! I seen it in the theaters and bought this for myself as a bday gift and have watched it 4-5 times already at home by myself or with family :D  I couldn' wait to get this once it came out and when I seen amazon had a great deal on pre-ordering I took advantage of it and wasn't disappointed! Plus I love animated movies too!

B00004S8Q9|5.0|Rest in peace Ray Gillen, truly the last Golden Voice in Rock. Jake E Lee admitted this album wasn't meant to be released (it was meant to show Atlantic Records what songs the band were developing). But the only indication (to me) that it's incomplete is that Ray's lyrics are clearly unfinished (a good portion are nonsensical and aloof). Yet Ray's stellar vocals remain, in my opinion, almost flawless. The album is very 'jam'-driven (it sounds like everything was recorded at once, in one room, and I mean that in a good way). The band is, of course, tight and if you look up any of their 'live' videos on you-tube, you will see that their talent belies the media-labeled genre ('hair metal'). A must-have for any rock and roll fan; and if you are a Badlands/Jake E Lee/Ray Gillen fan, this is one of those albums you 'take with you if you can only bring one thing'.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Right so I can get a moon phases app for a buck or just look at a calendar, but then what kind of a smartphone user would I be?<br /><br />This weather app has everything you need, want and more! Very customizable widgets to avoid clutter. Just not a very good radar. Not on the Motorola Atrix anyway. The app stopped responding after trying to load the radar for about 3 minutes on an ok wifi connection. Probably something the developers can fix and update for us if the ratings and price aren't ran into the ground.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|App takes a good while to do gps location and update. Works fine HTC MyTouch 4G slide. Massive power drain on battery though. Uninstalled after a couple hours as my preinstalled accuweather app is good enough for me.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I had a very hard time deciding how I felt about this book. It resolved the main issues, so there were no loose ends, which was great, but it wasn't enjoyable like the first two books were. I will say that I appreciate that Collins didn't try to end this series as though it were some kind of fairy tale. It's not some nice, sweet story, but rather a violent and disturbing one, and as such requires the reader's heart to break a little. A lot of people die. A lot. But more importantly, I think, those who remain seem so broken. I always loved that Katniss was never written as though she were indestructible. She's very human. But, the problem becomes that by the third book, she's been through so many horrible things that it really takes its toll. It's really hard to enjoy a book when the main character, whom you've grown to love, becomes so damaged that you know she won't completely come back. On the other hand, I don't think this final book was intended to be necessarily enjoyable, but rather to reflect the horrors of war and human cruelty. I wish that it had been done differently, but I'm not sure how it could have been. This book just lacked that certain je ne sais quoi that the other two had in abundance.    I had the sense, when I finished the book, that the last third of the book was a waste of time. I don't want to put any spoilers in here, but let's just say that a lot of horrible things happen and a lot of people die trying to do something that they never get to do. You spend almost a third of the book following them as they try to accomplish this task, losing people along the way, and it just felt like such a waste at the end of it. I'm not saying that it should have ended perfectly as they wanted it to, but there should have been some kind of personal resolution to it, which there wasn't.    On the more technical side, this book did not read at all like the other two for me. The first two books I just flew through. This one, I felt more like I was trudging along, praying for it to end. I had to re-read a lot of sections because I would get through several paragraphs and then realize that I had no comprehension of what I just read because I got bored halfway through. I suppose it may be the content rather than the writing itself. There is much less interaction in the book and more politics and war and darkness. I hated the epilogue. I wish she had just left it out. It seemed like it was thrown in there to try to make up to the readers who did want that fairy tale ending. It was very cliche. I would have rather imagined my own future for Katniss rather than being told at any rate.    This book also read more like it had an agenda. One of the things I so loved about the first book especially is that it gives you so much to think and reflect on without being forced to do so, but this book felt very much like \\"Here! Think about this!\\". I feel that it was ended as it was to reflect this agenda rather than just following through with a character, if that makes sense. She also lost sight of her audience. The same person who will love the first book is typically not going to love the last because they are so disjointed. I love the first book. I don't hate this last one, but I certainly don't love it.    Ultimately, I can only give this book 3 stars, although I still recommend it as it is necessary to finish the trilogy and the other two books are so worth reading.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|I have a Nexus S 4G phone with stock Android 2.3.5. When I tap the &quot;update&quot; button to update the current conditions I get an error message in red that says &quot;Error: Can't...&quot;, I can't see the rest of the error, please but the weather doesn't update.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These and the V6 (more-or-less the same); nothing approaches. Sadly, nothing. Confirming another reviewer, I have more expensive cans, and lots of cheap ones. These are the ticket, period. I guess it's \\"possible\\" something could sound all-around better, but I've never heard it.<br /><br />To clarify, these aren't \\"a little\\" or \\"slightly\\" better,\\" they are leagues-and-bounds better than everything else I've listened to. Plus, comfortable! And portable! Everything and everyone else in my life should deliver like these little bastard ear-cans do.
B0013USZHG|4.0|excellent!! mind blowing!! if you follow gustavo dudamel and his amazing work this is a MUST! its worth buying!his mambo version is magnificent!
B004PUG7MG|5.0|I thought that this album was great. I loved the Alice extended song the most. While her other albums were good I just found this to be my favorite so far. This album has quite a few soft spoken and somewhat depressing songs just like her first, but the few that are more outgoing are just as great! I hope Avril continues in the music industry since she is still quite kickass. Avril's last album made her seem a little softer and probably was more for High Schoolers while this album seemed for High school and older with it's deeper meaningful songs.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This processor simply SCREAMS. I think I might actually be able to hear it?  No, really, it's that fast. I upgraded from a 3.9ghz q9550 quad-core, and the transition is AMAZING. My q9550 @ 3.9ghz was about equivalent to an X6 1090t at stock clocks... however, this i7 seems to have doubled my computer's responsiveness. So, that means it's very, very, very fast. I'll post some hard data benchmarks on here when I get my cooling system optimized.  So far, I've seen anywhere from a 10% to a 40% increase in gaming performance, depending on how CPU-reliant the game is. I've nearly doubled my FPS in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood (very CPU-dependent) and GTA4 (also very CPU-dependent), while I got a modest 5-15FPS boost in Crysis 2 maingame (not-so-CPU dependent).   The good news is that this processor only hits about 60*C with a 4.2ghz overclock, using a modest watercooler and a good case. I have a Corsair H60, and I'm seeing about 60*C. I went pretty light on the thermal paste (Arctic Silver), but adding more won't change too much. Make sure your system is ready to handle the heat. I've maxed out at ~4.7ghz, but decided not to tweak voltage over 1.3V.  Pros: + Unbelievably, freakishly fast.    + Actually pretty dang efficient (~3-5 watts idle, 70-80w max load).    + Very overclockable.    + Runs relatively cool.   Cons: - Some applications are too old-fashioned to use Intel Hyper-threading. Bummer.  - Intel HD graphics are useless. AMD APUs actually have a GPU.  - Doesn't wake me up in the morning and make my breakfast like a good little computer.  - Boxed cooler just takes up space (wouldn't it be awesome if you could save $15 and just buy the processor?).  In the meantime, I strongly suggest getting this CPU if you have the need or desire to build a killer machine. If you don't want to break the bank and get the best machine out there, check out the i5 2500k, which is also a totally killer processor.   Current Setup:  i7 2600k @ 4.2ghz (100.0fsb x 42mult)   Corsair H60 Watercooler  ASUS P67 Sabertooth REV.B3  8GB OCZ DDR3 1333mhz  EVGA GTX 470 (JET ENGINE)  Antec 1200 PC Case (Awesome)  Cooler Master 1000W PSU  WD 500GB 7200RPM + WD 1TB 7200RPM HDDs
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This set was suppose to be good, it had potential. But a tweaked digital master from 2004 can't do any wonders.   And that's not the worst. It's Lucas's tinkering with the movies with every release. This is the 3rd homevideo release since the Special Editions came out in -97, and the movies had been quite different every time.  Enough is enough.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|free is too much for this app. Absolutely will not update or if it does it errors out saying no hourly uodates available. Stick with Weather Bug.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I preferred it from The Weather Channel and Weather Bug. My wife was not fond if out because of it's lack of simplicity. I recommend it if looking for an alternative.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|You will love this movie! It has a great story and I like the Uncut version better. I am a Robin Hood fan and was thrilled when this movie came out. It is good for all ages (no sex,no drugs, but yah its got violence) LOVE this movie and I am hoping for a sequel!!!! :)
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Great Album bout it for my wife, she was not too into Nicki Minaj as much until i gave her this album now she loves it and is alwasy playin in her car.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I bought this microphone to use with my Kodak PlayTouch (Zi10), unfortunately the quality of the sound is much lower compared to using the built-in microphone of the camera.  I would definitely look at other microphone options if I were you.<br /><br />Microphone placement doesn't matter, clipped to your lapel or held directly in front of your mouth the recorded volume is still extremely low compared to the built-in mic.
B003L77TZI|3.0|Great Album bout it for my wife, she loves it she had been wanting it for a while. from her playing it all the time i myself noticed that there is more to it than just california girls
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Very detailed. Gives you  just about all the weather info you would want. Nice widegets. Nice graphics. Kudos to the dev's. I use it on my Gtab running HC. Excellent!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Entered my zip code, waited a minute, and a  clock popped up with hour-by-hour temperatures in my town.  Looking at the settings, this apo provides an enormous amount of information about weather.  Reliable and stable.   Worth  the money.  (atrix)

B000AS4L16|5.0|A true documentary masterpiece!This documentary must be the most detailed ever made about the holocaust, The interviewing of people who where actually there,including Nazis,gives the audience of this documentary a completely believable insight into the holocaust, never seen before. It may be long, but anyone who wants to know the intricate details and the truth about the holocaust then this is a must see. A proof that the holocaust happened for all to see and not to forget!

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Considering the source material, especially over the last few years with Secret Origin,The Sinestro Corps War & Blackest Night, this was a major letdown to loyal fans. As much as Reynolds may appeal to the ladies he is not a character actor, and never fully embraced what Hal Jordan is about. The most exciting scene in the movie is the conversation between Abin Sur and Sinestro in the early minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from here. How they managed to take all the heart out of the scene where the ring is passed to Hal and Abin dies, I'll never know. It's an event that still reverberates in Hal's thoughts and actions to this day in the books, and in the movie it's rushed and no compassion is felt for Abin. Although, Mark Strong's interpretation of Sinestro is as honest and genuine to the comics as can be. It would be worth a sequel just to see Strong occupy the spirit of Sinestro again. Anyway, there's always the possibility of a reboot in hopes of getting a more faithful, deep and heartfelt representation of Green Lantern. The only downside to that is losing Mark Strong as Sinestro, who was the movie's most loyal portrayal of any character in the books.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|The ap works as promised. You can scan a document quick and easy. The quality is not perfect, but it isn't on the office scanner either.  My only complaint is that the default pdf size is huge as usual. If you have adobe puerto this is no problem, but otherwise you're going to have a hard time sharing pdfs by email.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|It took me such a long time to write a review for this masterpiece because there's just so much to say about it and a movie this good deserves a good review. This movie is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, along with Rear Window, Vertigo, and all the others. I'd have to say this is my favorite Hitch movie, next to Rear Window.        First, I'll start with the performances, which are beyond Oscar-worthy. Janet Leigh should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress back in 1960, and Anthony Perkins wasn't even nominated for Best Actor, which I think is a huge mistake. I think Norman Bates is one of the best movie villains of all time. And all the other performances (Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam), are amazing, too. The film opens with amazing credits by none other than Saul Bass, into the opening scene, and scene after scene is filled with sharp dialouge, great characters, and a very eerie feeling out of all the dreary black and white, and finally halfway through the film, after the amazing parlor scene, there's the infamous \\"shower scene\\", with the shrieking violins, composed by Bernard Herrman, the camera cuts (77 different camera angles/took a week to film, and the scene is only about a minute!), and the pure terror of the scene. I really envy the people who saw it back in 1960 not knowing what was going to happen.       The film is basically two acts. The first act ends an hour into the movie, after the ten minute clean up scene, with no dialouge, right after the shower scene. The remaining 49 minutes build up more suspense until the crazy ending, which literally sent a chill down my spine. In fact, it's my favorite scene, next to the shower scene, of course. And for anyone who hasn't seen the film, I won't tell you the rest of the ending, but it's just so creepy and disturbing. It holds you right until \\"The End\\"       I haven't really said anything about this film that hasn't been said, but I just need to say this is the best suspensefilm of all time. The music, the acting, the black-and-white, the disturbing story (based on the Robert Bloch book), the infamous Bates Motel, and of course the shower scene. This is one of my favorite films of all time, from the best director of all time.        The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely wonderful. It comes in a hard plastic case that snaps open like a book. The Disc 1 comes with the film, and some special features, including a vintage newsreel of the release of Psycho, the shower scene with and without music, lobby cards, production photos and notes, the original 6 1/2 minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel, and some re-release trailers. The Disc 2 comes with The Making of Psycho, an amazing 1 1/2 hour documentary that tells all about how Psycho was made, a half-hour documentary about different directors talking about Hitchcock's influence (how it influenced thier own movies, along with showing clips of Hitchcock's own movies, which I really liked). It has different directors talking like William Friedkin, Eli Roth, Martin Scorsece, etc. I love watching that special feature over and over. The third feature is a fifteen minute excerpt of the legendary 12-hour Hitchcock/Truffaut interview. They both talk about Psycho, while it shows clips from the movie. The fourth and final feature is an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled \\"Lamb to the Slaughter\\", which is one of my favorite episodes. I love that show!       Altogether, \\"Psycho\\" is one of the greatest films of all time, and this is the greatest release of this movie (other than Blu-Ray). If you haven't seen or bought this movie, do it NOW!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|So after reading mixed reviews i decided to try it out on my droid x. Im currently using weather bug elite. The gps searching issues that most everyone is having was the same for me as well. I turned my gps on and walked outside to get a signal and it took almost 5 min to update, but it did update my location.   Really the only complaint I have is the inaccuracy of the temperature. For instance my weather bug elite says the current temp is 84, my thermometer outside says 82 and this app says it's currently 73? Even after updating! I will uninstall this app. I won't give this this app 1 star like most do when they run into a problem because I feel the app is pretty solid just inaccurate in my case.
B004G600A4|5.0|I rented the movie from Redbox because I never got to see it in the theaters with my daughter, but we loved the movie! Especially Rapunzel and the animated horse Max who had it in for Flynn lol.  There were parts I laughed and cried at, but overall it is funny to watch for both kids and adults ( love crude humor)
B0058EBNAO|2.0|The app would not look up my location by GPS, so I decided to put in my zip code. Hit refresh, but nothing happened. No weather data of any kind. I'm using a G2x
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie for any educator, anyone who knows anyone autistic.  The story of a dedicated, determined  Mom and 3 cheers for Temple.  More movies should be produced like this - True stories with hope - Making a difference!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|All I have to say about this app is WOW! The amount of information and the setup are the best I've ever seen. Great, great weather app! Awesome widgets! Droid Incredible with Verizon.
1572814349|5.0|This deck is gorgeous. Out of all the decks I've touched, read, and sampled this deck spoke to me. The gilded edges are beautifully done and the cards are sturdy. Amazing!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Great looking application with 17 widgets tons of varieties and customization options. At first you may have to click the red on screen button on the top right of screen to change from default provider intellicast to Forcea. Or atleast thats when it finally gave me information. It also removed no data errors and such. Than I changed to the broken default location, went to menu and manage locations or whatever it is and deleted it to make sure it wouldn't try to get the data constantly and bam. To change locations just swipe up.  All and all it replaced, Weather Bug and Fancy Widget (the crappy amazon pro version the developer refuses to update. em) I dont have a radar wallpaper or widget but Weather clocks definitely make up for it.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Works incredibly well on my Samsung Exhibit 4G. I really like the detailed information and great looking widget. This has replaced my current weather apps. Used to use two apps for weather, but this does more than both combined.<br /><br />To the people having problems getting this to work,  it uses gps by default to get location. It CAN use networks or manual locations, but you have to make some options changes.  Easy enough to do,  and easy enough to customize unless you are btain dead or are hopeless with tech.<br /><br />Very good app I will be using for a long time. Glad I caught it on free day! Would be worth it even if I had to pay.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have seen this movie about 50 times! It is my all time favorite movie. I have noticed that they are starting to release some other Miyazaki films on Blu Ray so I hope this is one of them. I will be the first one to buy it!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|so much info, can be overwhelming however once you take the time to read how it works its very cool! you can also set alerts for earthquakes, view other locations to check on family it even puts the temp on your toolbar, very cool. for those that say doesnt load info, turn your gps on and go outside. it has to find your location for inital setup i think. it took about 5 min before it started loading all the info. be patient :) works on HTC EVO shift
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app works terrifically! I use it often to scan and email various documents. It works very well with dropbox. I tried several other similar apps but this was the best one by far!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|at least until my android got a new software update. now I can't even type more than one letter using switfkey. time for an update?
B0058GYP5W|5.0|I purchased this as a MP3 a few months back, and will get the CD as well. This soundtrack is one of the rare ones that becomes an extension of the film, and the film isn't whole without it. Amazing music, for a amazing film. Buy it!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well written book, kept reading every spare moment for 3 days.  Loved how the story weaves in and out with historical references, scientific and alchemy references and realistic human folly.  Really loved the fact that the author did not use \\"explicit sex\\" or \\"explicit bloody violence\\" to make the story exciting and thought provoking.  The characters could be real as they moved towards each other slowly and with trepidation to \\"know\\" each other rather than jump into bed.  Did not know the book would be continued,so am looking forward to the next one to continue unraveling the mystery.  Thank you for a wonderful read.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|Using Samsung Galaxy S on TMobile in NYC.on Cannot load data. Either on wifi or 3G. May have something to do with our broken GPSs. I selected Cell tower location only, but still no go. In any event, this makes this app unusable for me.
0374531269|4.0|A book that made me have to keep reminding myself that this happened and the person doing it is just a child. The bravery shown by Ishmael Beah to share with the world his story of being a child soldier and all the horror that goes along with it, is unlike I have never seen before. He doesn't seek forgiveness or makes excuses he just tells his story as it happened to him. The only thing that stops me from giving this a 5 star rating is abrupt ending, it left me feeling that something is missing, but maybe that's the point.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|Looked for this earlier in the week but only saw the Audio CD version -- I was worried it was one of those annoying iTunes-exclusive releases.     Enjoying it so far!    (Not sure why it has a release date of April 2011 or why I found it under the unavailable Import Audio CD)

B0056BMK6K|4.0|John Locke's book isn't going to turn the average self-publishing author into a millionaire but it does contain useful information on ways to advertise and market e-books.  My sales have increase because of some ideas he presented and most people who are not marketing specialists will benefit.  At the price, it's one of the best investments I've made in learning to sell books and that's as advertised.  If you're looking for a way to become instantly wealthy, this book won't do it and if money is your primary concern, you should probably find a different career.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Locke<br /><br />John McClenny<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005H6GWD6 God's Blood, God Seed (Full Circle)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0053H154K Wolfbitch]]<br />[[ASIN:B005HFQ3O0 Dubious Companions - The Road to Ruein]]<br />[[ASIN:B0055ILXQM Barely Bound: Tales of Horror]]<br />[[ASIN:B005HFKFE4 A Witch's Dozen]]

0061784788|2.0|This is a typical blockbuster of suspense from this author, with one exception: the proselytizing.  The author has the grace to admit, in the end notes, that he has always been interested in Mormonism (or, as they prefer to be called, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints; LDS for short). I think the author is kidding himself just a little bit; he strikes this native Utahn as what the locals refer to as a \\"dry Mormon,\\" in other words, he just needs water (baptism) to be the real deal. He not only winds the Mormon religion all through this story, he also valiantly attempts, over and over again, to excuse the many holes in it. He does that so many times and with such fervor that this reader concluded that the book was much more about the author's interest in Mormonism than it was about anything else. The \\"anything else\\" part includes, among other things, Thomas Jefferson, secret codes, gold-plated buffalo heads, and the author's usual lineup of favorite characters.  If you don't mind having Mormonism shoved in your face by the author, you might even enjoy it.  As someone who has had it shoved in my face way too many times I have to say that I did mind, and I did not enjoy it.
B0059R5Q08|4.0|I have such conflicting feelings about this movie.  I LOVE it, but it is driving me crazy!  The actors are PERFECT!  Mia is just who I envisioned Jane to be and (Rochester) is pretty easy on the eyes :)  (I am willing to overlook that minor inaccuracy from the book) and their chemistry was the best I've seen so far. My favorite scene was when Rochester tries to win back Jane.  I could watch that scene a thousand times and never get sick of it! The cinematography is BEAUTIFUL! Although, sometimes it seems like there is more time spent on the scenery than is neccessary.  Again, I can overlook that.  It does seem a bit misjointed though.  It jumps from the middle to bits and pieces of the beginning and then jumps back toward the end.  I understand what Fukunaga was getting at for effect but still, if someone was watching this for the first time without reading the book, I could understand them getting lost.  Again, I can overlook the detail of the book broken up, but what I CANNOT overlook is the ending!  GRRR!!!  I had to watch the last couple scenes of the BBC 2006 version in order to feel any sense of closer!  It cuts off soooo abruptly and TOTALLY misses out on one of my favorite parts of the entire book (aside from Rochester begging for Jane to come back of course).  AHH!! Even after watching a different version, I still am a little taken back.  I will probably watch this again before my rental period is over (with 2006 on cue), but I don't think I would ever buy it.  I am just too upset about the ending.
1400079144|1.0|Don't waste your time or money with this boring novel. The Da Vinci Code, it seems, was a one-time hit, to expect this would be another hit is a wasteful wish.    Boring, repetitive, flawed, pointless, nonsensical and aimless!    1 star is way too generous.
B005869U6G|5.0|I like this album quite a bit.  I am a fan of all Incubus music, from their harder, messier starts to even their most recent softer songs.  Personally, I think this album is more similar to Morning View than other recent albums - but is still unique and stand alone.  I believe it combines techniques the band has been experimenting with in the last three albums and puts them together in an elegant fashion.  I think the sounds in each track BLEND extremely well together.  It's a smooth album.    But truly, the reason why I'm a fan is that it still remains unpredictable.  It still sounds like Incubus, yet it's FRESH.  Their experimenting has allowed them to develop songs where unexpected sounds, whether it is an instrument or an off-note, are introduced seemingly randomly yet works perfectly.  This is something they've always done, but in the past it would seem somewhat jarring at times - for me it was not always refined.  I think this album is very refined.    It also intriques me and makes me curious about the music, and I think it is their most inspiring album yet.  Let's put it this way - I am a writer in my spare time and I've had writer's block lately, but If Not Now, When? gave me lots of ideas while I was just playing it in the background.    This album has made me more excited about Incubus than I have been in a while.  Eliminate all expectations of it before you listen to it.

0553801473|5.0|Warning Some Spoilers !!!<br /><br />I finally finished the book. I can breathe a sigh of well earned relief. I no longer have to worry about getting near the internet and accidentally reading a spoiler. All in all as usual, I am left unsatisfied by the book. Not because it lacks quality or because it lacks anything really. It is just that I wish more could have happened.<br /><br /> I would happily trade  that useless page describing the Shield Hall for one more of Dany learning to ride her dragon. I would be ever so glad to to have spent a little more time with  Theon as he and Jeyne escaped Winterfell, rather than the massive pile of \\"back story\\" pages. I would desperately like to understand  \\"Where in the Sam Hell\\" the Arya Stark story is  going. That poor girl has been on a journey that deserves a rest,for crying out loud.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers are unhappy with the dead not staying dead. I agree with this. I would especially have liked to see Catelyn Stark stay dead. I understand that Martin won't ever be kind enough to let all my fovorite characters live. I accept that, but the \\"bringing back the dead ploy\\" is getting a little thin.  I never understood, nor agreed with Martin, that this should have been allowed. I am a little tired as well of some of the time wasting side stories. The prince that was not a Dragonlord but thought he was as an example. We could do with a lot more action from the main characters and he coulda just sunk that guy in the sea, for all his story did to advance the plot.<br /><br />Regardless of all those legitimate complaints, all is forgiven. This man writes better in a fog of haze and dragonblood than most authors could ever dream of doing. We should all recognize that Mr. George RR Martin is  a modern day writer of genius and classic quality. The likes of which, we are very lucky to have available to our generation and for generations to come.<br /><br />Now to just wait 6 years for another book.. SIGH

1439165653|1.0|I was eager to read this book. Food, India, Paris, and glowing reviews from Anthony Bourdain, Tom Colicchio, and Susan Orlean. There was no way this book could disappoint.<br /><br />But it did. Yes, there are sensuous descriptions of food (sometimes oblitered by the gratuitous grossness mentioned by another reviewer), but what's missing here is a credible narrative and characters. The narrative is full of holes and just doesn't hold up. Things happen out of the blue, making this novel more a fairy tale than a serious piece of fiction. Example: Having ended up (somehow) in a mansion in the French Jura, which the family has (somehow--where did all this money come from?) converted into a restaurant, the young hero of the story is pressed into service as head chef for the Grand Opening lunch. For a hundred people. Even though he has no experience whatsoever as a chef. Or even a cook. His father tells him that because he was always hanging around the kitchen in India as a boy, he'll be able to handle it. And, of course, he is a huge success.<br /><br />Then there is Madame Mallory. The chef who owns the Michelin two-star inn that just happens to be across the street from the mansion the hero's family has bought. She's drawn as a witch, a crone--she's straight out of \\"Hansel & Gretel.\\" And you just know that, although she despises the Indians across the way (she's a racist, of course), she will soon take Hassan under her batlike wing and teach him the secrets of French cuisine. How do you know it? Because it's the standard cliche.<br /><br />Oh, it's a film script, for sure, and I'd be surprised if the book weren't already optioned. But it's not a novel. If you want to read an excellent novel that turns on the story of an immigrant who learns his way around a kitchen--as well as around his own heart--put this book down and read Rose Tremain's brilliant \\"The Road Home.\\"
B0058EBNAO|4.0|havent fully played wuth this app yet. but just wanted e eryone t know location works on galaxy 10.1 tab. you have to wait a little longer than the 60 sec the program says itneeds to find location but it doesnt take to long. there r alot of good weather apps around and with widgets you can almost just take the better parts from them all. i kinda like how the weather clock forcasts the weather from hour to hour. it gives u a better outlook on how to plan your day according to the temp.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|app not work when I first installed it. I cut it off I waited a few hours while the tab charged up. when I turned it back on and went to the app, it worked perfectly. this is not the first time I have turned the tablet off and back on again, and a app works perfectly. I'm sure most of the people who gave a bad review, now finds the app is working correctly.<br /><br /> thank you amazon for the free paid app of the day. it adds another level of excitement to my tablet.

B001LMU182|2.0|The following review is of the blu-ray disc itself as a product and NOT of the movie. When I was a wee lad of 13 a friend of mine loaned me an long-play VHS tape with a whole bunch of Anime on it. After skimming through a project A-Ko movie and some Dragon Ball Z episodes I decided that I did not care for Anime as a whole and was about to turn off the TV when the first few seconds of AKIRA came on and....     ...blew my teenage freakin' mind.     So you can imagine my joy when I discovered that Akira was out on Blu-ray and I could now watch my favorite movie of all time in stunning HD awesomeness. Only problem was that once I popped that bad boy in...it wasn't the same movie.     For reasons I do not understand the original dub of Akira was never even transferred over to DVD (to my knowledge and if you know otherwise....help a brother out). So the movie that I fell in love with doesn't exist anymore except on VHS. Why? You're guess is as good as mine. The original movie had awesome voice acting and is literally ingrained in my subconscious. So yeah...the fact that there are not only new voices in the mix...but new dialogue as well = not ok with me. There is no reason that the original dub should not (at the very least) be included. I want to watch the Akira I \\"grew up\\" with. I don't care how accurate the new dub is to the original translation and neither does anybody else I think.     Sure the old dub was a little goofy at times, but there are parts of the new dub where characters mouths are moving without any dialogue! WTF?!? I wanted to see my favorite movie of all time - not a \\"different take on it\\". I was able to watch the Japanese version without getting too worked up and it was interesting to see the differences in the dialogue that honestly help the movie make a bit more sense with respect to the book...but I don't want that. I want the Akira I knew and loved.     I don't understand this phenomenon of re-releasing movies that were perfectly fine to begin withnew scenes and dialogue (Suck it George Lucas BTW). Do we need a high-def version of the Mona Lisa as redone by another artist?     No. Why? Because the original has a charm and uniqueness that can't be replicated and the minute you do you remove what makes it special.     Same deal here.

B0058EBNAO|2.0|This app takes a lot of memory, but can't be moved to the SD card.  I uninstalled it.  Developers need to know that if an app can't go to the SD card, then It's not going on my phone.  It's just poor programming.
0736083863|5.0|I purchased this book to assist with my education as I began my pilates instructor training program a few months ago.  In my experience, many pilates programs require students to read Anatomy of Movement by Blandine Calais-Germain and Trail Guide to the body by Andrew Biel.  Although both have been very useful books which I'm sure I will continue to refer back to for many, many years, the information can be a little intimidating if you are new to the study of anatomy.   Pilates Anatomy is wonderful for beginner anatomy students interested in learning pilates anatomy because it keeps the focus in an area that most readers are already familiar - Pilates.  The book is written very clearly and concisely.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|I love Romantic Comedies, but WOW!  This one is awful!!  None of the characters are likeable, nor is anything they say or do believable.  There isn't a single funny joke, and the ending is just plain silly.  This is the worst Romantic Comedy ever!!  Don't waste your time.
B005KGPC4S|3.0|It's okay for a B movie. I feel the \\"crazy religious people gone rogue\\" story has been done already in some form, so I was hoping this movie would bring something new to the table.

B003UESJHO|5.0|The stories surrounding this instant boxing classic is really what makes the magic happen. Mark Wahlberg spent over a year of his life preparing for his role as Micky Ward, researching the boxer's life and times in Lowell MA and training for this authentic portrayal. He gave place to Christian Bale, who found his niche in history with an Oscar performance as Best Supporting Actor in playing Ward's brother, boxer/trainer Dicky Eklund. Ward's Rockyesque rise from club fights to the world title is paralleled by Eklund's triumph over crack addiction. The authenticity of the flick was guaranteed by the true-life figures in the tale remaining on location in Lowell for consultation as Wahlberg sought to make this saga as accurate as possible.<br /><br />For those who want to see Ward at his absolute best, get a video copy of his first fight with Arturo Gatti. It is an astounding \\"Fight of the Century\\" that would be the icing on a magnificent cake presented by master chef Wahlberg.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|... but none exists.  I'll stick with my laser disc copy.  I threw away the fully legit copies I bought (several btw, not just one bite at the apple) because the only way to see the Cantina scene with the original music and where Greedo is murdered in cold blood is to steal the film -- that is, if you care about aspect ratios and image quality anyway.  When there is a bluray version of the original film, I'll gladly buy a copy.
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|This novel is amazing. The story line is so clean and easy to follow and is full of things that happen in a real teenage girls life. I love how moral Anna is and that she respects St. Claire's current relationship instead of jusst throwing herself at him and hoping he will leave his girlfriend. I love all of the characters and especially love all the drama that happened. The ending couldn't have been more perfect and i just wish it was longer, because i couldn't get enough of this book. I recommend this novel to anyone who loves those feel good stories and anyone who loves YA.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I recently updated to the newest version and got all new levels past the Carnival. They're pretty fun. I've come to expect a good time from Angry Birds so I'm happy to say I'm not disappointed. My only concern (which I suspect is user fault) is that I've gone through looking for all the fruits and I'm missing 1 or 2 here and there. I've hit bushes and everything I can think of, but can't find them all! Other than that, I've not had any issues with glitches, force closes or levels not finishing. So I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a time killer.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|Honestly one of the only apps that deserves a comment in my own opinion. Has loads of image filters; I personally love the sketch up, neon, pastel, and a different one that looks like pastel but more like colored pencil (not comic boom). Any person interested in pictures and art would love this app!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Initially I downloaded the version with ads. But I ended up getting the ad free version because the ads do sometimes get in the way of your view while you're playing. Regardless, this game is pretty fun. Plus with the latest update the Mine & Dine levels are done. Just went through them today and they're pretty fun. I think the ad free version is totally worth the .99 cents. Of course when you pause they still advertise for Angry Birds merch, but can you blame them? Atleast it's not on the screen during game play.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|I wasn't too sure I'd like this game. But with the different play modes, it's really fun. I love getting combos and having to avoid bombs just makes it that much more fun. Cut the fruit, get more points for multliple fruit slice combos and even the freeze, double points, fruit frenzy fruits help make this that little bit more fun.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Everything went as according.  However Im not sure if i overlooked it or if they did not mention...I recieved the widescreen edition, which i totally detest.

B0058P7KUA|4.0|This game is pretty cool. You need both hands to play with the controls and it may take some getting used to. But once you get the hang of it, it's pretty fun. The levels repeat do repeat, same story, different time and place. But the actual zombies and characters are pretty funny looking and the different weapons you can use really make this game a good time.
1609611543|4.0|I ordered this book for two reasons:   One: My mother always said that my migraines were likely caused by wheat (or wheat intolerance) and   Two: My diet consists of too many carbohydrates, and I am always looking for ways to change that, but wasn't quite sure how to go about it. I tried a couple of all protein diets, but could not maintain eating like that.  So, this book was meant to educate me.  I must say that the premises put forth here are an eye opener for me. If I looked at the content of the book and had to make a statement about it, it would be \\"wheat is evil\\". That was news to me, but digging into Dr. Davis's experience and studies, the reasons become quite clear. He covers the influence of wheat on weight loss, Celiac disease, diabetes, migraines (a little tiny bit), osteoporosis, mental issues such as schizophrenia, body pH, aging, heart disease, and skin conditions, among many others.   I was a little overwhelmed by all the effects, I had always understood wheat to be good for you, certainly not as the cause of all sorts of afflictions. I did quite a bit of discussion with women on an internet forum I belong to, and listening to them, many of the claims in the book were verified, one by one, to my great surprise. One of the cool things about testing the content for myself, is that it takes only a short time to realize beneficial effects; eliminating wheat results in rapid changes. That is all good, I can try this for a few weeks, and see how I feel.  The book is not the easiest to read, there is a lot of detail, and it seems somewhat repetitive. However, it is worth plowing through all the chapters, because there is something to be learned from each chapter. Very, very interesting and thought provoking.  The last 1/3 of the book gives you a method for eliminating wheat from your diet, and comes complete with recipes, which look good.   I was disappointed, though, at the end, when the author gives a long list of other foods to avoid; I had thought fromreading the previous chapters, that you did not have to worry about anything but wheat, which is not true.   At any rate, by reading the book you can come to your own personal conclusions, and give it a try if you think it is will benefit you.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5<br /><br />'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.  Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.  Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.<br /><br />While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.<br /><br />Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, \\"feel-good\\" character of Skeeter. No book like \\"The Help\\" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.<br /><br />There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would \\"The Help\\" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits!<br /><br />While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually--they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenessince there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if \\"The Help\\" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive--do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's \\"abusive\\" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?<br /><br />Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).<br /><br />Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him?<br /><br />For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.ther big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal.

B0056HTEC2|5.0|Hugh Laurie is much more than just a very talented Actor...in this CD, he displays a total commitment to the Blues. His arrangements are spot on. As you listen to the haunting arrangements, you can almost smell the sweat, smoke and whiskey...kudos Hugh, you've arrived in Bluesville.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|While I admit the show is fairly entertaining, the dialog is so horrible I couldn't continue to watch this show. It's like their lines were written by teenagers just learning to cuss...really who writes dialog like this?? Too bad I was really wanting to watch this...
B003VQM2M4|5.0|I've been a long time Nick Cave fan and even if I think his Golden Age has passed, the man is simply incapable of making a bad album. When Grinderman 1 came along I was excited as hell, could he possibly go back to his Birthday Party roots and rock out like he hasn't done in a long time? Well, yes and no it turned out, there's about 4 songs on that album that made it worthwhile, while the rest were okay, but on the whole it was nothing too special. So then Grinderman 2 was announced and I kept my expectations a bit lower. To be honest, I figured it would be more of the same.    Oh how wrong I turned out to be.    I am not kidding when I said this may possibly be my very favorite Nick Cave album. I could easily give every song 5 stars, with the exception of \\"When my Baby Comes\\" and \\"What I know\\", which I would both give a solid 3 stars. I'm not one to go and review every song, but as a whole this album feels so diverse, so explosive, so funny, so scary all at the same time. As far as I'm concerned I'm now more looking forward to Grinderman 3 than the next Bad Seeds album. I've listened to the entire album more times that I care to count and I can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its impact yet.     I used to think it almost blasphemous for a somewhat dirty and raw album like this to be better than the Bad Seeds older albums, classics like the Boatman's Call, Henry's Dream or Tender Prey, but then I started thinking: why couldn't a new album be better than those revered works? It took me a while to be able to admit it, but yes: Grinderman 2 is the best album Nick Cave and co. have made. I say bring on Grinderman 3!

1400079144|1.0|I have enjoyed Dan Brown's other books and understand that fiction is fiction so I haven't read his novels expecting to find great truths for life, philosophy, theology etc.  I'm just looking for an exciting story and chalk up what he spouts in this regard as fantasy and enjoyed the ride previously.  Unfortunately, I think in this book he officially crosses a line and genuinely no longer can separate fact (or myth) from fiction. I think he needs to pick what kind of author he honestly wants to be and come clean.     To me it appears that he now truly believes that what he has his characters share in a story is indeed spiritual and theological masterpiece for the ages. His characters \\"insights\\" on the Bible, for example, are just plain wacky and \\"out there\\". Talk about preachy and scary. The length of time in this book he spends going into great detail about all this theosophical and theological stuff is evidence to me that he really thinks he is a great sage with wonders to share.  Piffle. Just writing characters with apparent authority in a work of fiction does not validate the words that those characters speak.  I felt insulted that he would push his worldview so strongly in a supposed work of fiction. I couldn't even finish the last few pages it read so much like some cults' dogma.  If this was instead a heavily Christian themed story camouflaged as a mainstream novel, people wouldn't put up with the pages and pages of spiritual propaganda that this guy puts out.      But, I must credit him for succesfully selling his new age and mystical musings to the masses, but I for one will no longer be buying.

B004EPZ08Y|4.0|After the atrocious disaster of the last film, death returns to eliminate the survivors of a deadly bridge collapse and decides to twist the rules in a new way. The film took more of a serious turn on things in terms of character development with likable characters and decent story with a twist at the end that will blow you away.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|Not bad. I downloaded it as part of the free app for the day. Don't know if its worth the 3 dollar price tag, but its a good app if you want a stand-alone, in depth weather app.
B0058EBNAO|2.0|I was expecting many big, flashy and unique features from a paid weather app (especially at $3. 00) but Elecont fails to provide anything unique. Not only does it lack distinguishing features, but the basic features it does provide are presented poorly and work poorly. Menu systems are inconsistent (some use Os style dialogs, others use app specific radio buttons, and yet others are in the programmer's own messy and unintuitive style). Function has clearly fallen victim to the attempt at eye-catching style.<br /><br />A painfully obvious attempt has been made to appear graphically lavish. The unfortunate result is a garish and messy lack of style with weather graphics that take up too much space without being beneficial. The old adage of &quot;Keep It Simple, Stupid&quot; is applicable here. You don't force style, you let it grow around the function. This app fails as both form and function are sorely lacking.<br /><br />Given the wide range of free weather apps and services there seems to be little need for an unnecessarily bloated app that promises the world and fails to deliver. Not worth your time for free, and certainly not for $3.00 until significant changes are implemented to address location issues, inconsistent UI and put it on par with the host of free professional weather apps.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Why are there so many negative reviews for a product that hasn't been released yet? I can't wait to pick this up on monday (12th), as I live in the UK and have two days booked off work to go through the whole set!    Stop reacting to something you haven't seen yet! The clips on Youtube were examples only. It sounds horrible yes, but I'm not going to pass judgement on something I haven't seen yet!!
B004FOA84A|3.0|It's been ages since I played adventure-type games (way back in the TRS-80 days! Although I did mess with Myst some). I was interested in trying The Secret of Grisly Manor when I saw it because sometimes I'll be sitting in a theater early, waiting for a movie to begin, and working on an adventure-style game on my 'droid will make the time go by faster. The game play isn't bad at all here but the story is a little on the weak side. That may be so it can be squeezed into the memory of a cell phone however. I am grateful for the memories it brought back and I hope adventure games get more complex and involved as time passes.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|Nothing real spectacular here. Just a fun movie with better then average special effects. This movie reminds me of the Roger Moore Bond movies. Yes on one level they were bad, but entertaining nevertheless.
0553386794|1.0|I attempted to read the first book of this series a number of times due to some mass delusion about this series. Seems to me people are using this series for some kind of mass acceptance of some kind rather than being sincere about how horrible the beginning and layout is. When I read I like people and places to be gradually introduced. I do not want to be teleported instantly from person to person place to place between each breathe.<br /><br />I read novels for entertainment.<br /><br />If I want random and complex I will spend my time with DNA, Physics, electromagnetic energy particles and think about looking through a pair of glasses that see everything and everyone as atoms and molecules and quarks as packets of 3 dimensional computer code. How anyone can compare ice and fire to being equal to any of the top fantasy authors works is incredible.<br /><br />There are much more enjoyable leisure time reads than this. Many of the better series are finished so they can be read in entirety. I say skip this melted ice and heatless fire series and skip the mass delusion about how great this series is.
1451629184|5.0|Everyone knows the basic facts. I read the whole book in about 3 hours in one sitting. Despite not having a ghost writer AFAIK, the book is very readable, she did a great job of making her story easy to follow. The gory details are all there, I expected her to hold back much more than she did. In the end I'm happy she seems to have a bright future ahead, and is not overwhelmed by the past.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Finally was able to get the app to reflect local weather, however as with most apps it doesn't seem to auto update properly with Gingerbread.  Graphics are nice but there seems to be to much information that I have a hard time finding what I want to see.  Radar is slow to load and always seems to be over an hour old.  This app is close but not significantly better than weather.com.

B002RAREAK|5.0|I never thought that Usher could make a cd that would capture my interest the way that 8701 or CONFESSIONS did, but along comes this disc and I just gotta say that I totally love it!  The techno parts aside, everything blended well and nothing reminded me of HERE I STAND.  You wanna dance, it's there.  I wish there were more slower grooves included, but guess what...once you pop it in, just let your jam instincts kick in and your groove central take control.  This cd may not be as big as the two that I mentioned before, but for me, it sure does come close.  LOVED IT AND IT'S STILL IN CONSTANT ROTATION!!
B00540G3G6|1.0|This film is great, but the 3D enhancement is horrible. I would advise fans to stick with their original 2D purchase. The 3D enhancement is not a very visiable addition.
B004UXUS64|5.0|Genre:  Classic Science Fiction/Drama<br /><br />Premise:  After a young woman, Rhoda, drives drunk, killing a wife and her son, leaving the husband a widower, she tries to find worthwhile motivations and actions thereafter.  A second Earth has entered Earth's orbit, an Earth where an identical version of Rhoda (and everyone else) may have made similar or dissimilar actions starting on the evening before her fateful decision to drive drunk.  Rhoda is given the rare opportunity to fly in a spaceship to the other Earth and see if she can live in a world where she did not make her fatal mistake.  Rhoda is also given the option to stay on her original Earth and try to make amends with the widower she harmed.<br /><br />Review:  Not since 2004's \\"Primer\\" have I been so impressed with a group of new writers and filmmakers putting together such a thought-provoking and well-made film.<br /><br />The script is tight, linear, and clear, never needing to rely on flashbacks or long parallel-universe explanations and exceptions (as is so often the case in sci-fi stories).  The cinematography is great.  The storyboarding is solid.  The use of the ever-enlarging Earth in the day and night sky is a beautiful and effective visual device.  Not since the two Suns of Tatooine have I been so impressed with an environmental backdrop.<br /><br />The sound design for the film is fully integrated with the screenplay progressions.  The writers and director fully intended viewers to be using more than simply their visual senses.  The narrative about the Russian cosmonaut's sound dilemma is poetic and consistent with the film's questions and themes.<br /><br />The film editing is concise.  The camera work is never distracting, it never took me out of the story flow or broke the pleasant illusory suspension of disbelief (other critics complained about the frequent use of handheld shots).  The costume design is fitting.  The set design is consistent with the tones of the film.  I noticed the monochromatic color post-editing in several scenes, but if you're not a film buff, then you probably won't be distracted by it.  The monochromatic color filtering is consistent with the scenes' emotional intents.<br /><br />Performances:  The acting is solidly anchored in Brit Marling and William Mapother's performances.  This is a close-quartered and intimate film that capably takes on universal questions.<br /><br />What from outside the film helps someone understand the film?  The lead actress co-wrote the screenplay.  So, watching the performance with that knowledge is kind of like watching a singer-songwriter perform one of their own songs.<br /><br />Surprisingly poor about the film:  Nothing.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD:<br /><br />Some of the morals and themes of the story:  Sometimes your most worthwhile competition will be yourself.  The film asks the question:  If you caught up with your identical self 5 years from now, and if you had to ethically compete with you, would you be embarrassed by the quality of your decisions and actions?<br /><br />The film's ending most likely implies that Rhoda on Earth 2 killed John's family on Earth 2.  Rhoda on Earth 2 also probably won the essay contest.  But Rhoda on Earth 2 maybe didn't make the same decision to offer John the opportunity to reunite with his family.  Alternatively, John on Earth 2 may have declined to accept the ticket offered to him, so the other Rhoda on Earth 2 could have a chance to start anew in a world without her actions' horrific consequences.<br /><br />One of beautiful tragedies of the ending is John travels to live with the other John.  John, arriving at Earth 2, likely realizes his wife and son are also dead there, and he left a woman, Rhoda, who truly cared for him and gave him the most valuable thing she had: a chance at a different and better life.  John travels to discover his \\"new Earth,\\" his new start, has no version of Rhoda in it.<br /><br />I found the ending uplifting as I implied that Rhoda on Earth 1, the Rhoda we followed throughout the film, likely made a final decision (choosing to offer the valuable ticket to John) she was happy with, arguably a better decision than the decision made by Rhoda from Earth 2.<br /><br />A concept that can be implied from the ending is:  Sometimes it may be better to stick around, trying to make the best of the poor circumstances that remain rather than to leave with the primary intent of trying to escape your past.<br /><br />Is there a timeless question?:  What if you are a uniquely beautiful person with unique opportunities to improve your life and the life of the few people around you?  If you are such a person, and if you've made horrific mistakes in your past that you can never undo, then is there still honor in doing the best you can with what you have left?  What if your most worthwhile competition is not other people, but instead is you?  Can you compete with the quality of actions an alternative version of you might do?  Can anyone more capably compete against you?<br /><br />What I learned:  I get so frustrated watching TV and Movies these days, feeling so often that I've been there and already knew that.  This film knocked me back and slapped me upside the head.  It gave me inspiring concepts and motivation.  For bright people, it's often hard to find engaging and quality companions and contemporaries.  This film dared me to compete against any lazier version of me.<br /><br />There is so much more to learn from this film than I've discussed herein.  And I look forward to hearing others' perceptions and assumptions about this film.  This film, like many great stories and mysteries, doesn't answer all the questions.  Instead, it poses worthwhile questions.<br /><br />Something worth knowing about the movie you may not already know:  It was made for less than $200,000.<br /><br />In reading other reviews, I thought the criticism too often criticized the film for not being a film or story this film did not intend to be.  And that's often invalid criticism.  Some reviewers didn't like that the film lacked an ending with clear and narrow definition.  They didn't want the film to be like life, with loose ends and indefiniteness still ahead.<br /><br />Responding to Roger Ebert's review: Ebert gave this little film an impressive 3.5 out of 4 stars.  I agree with most of Ebert's comments, however, I don't think this film is \\"less profound . . . than Tarkovsky's \\"Solaris,' another film about a sort of parallel Earth.\\"  I love Tarkovsky's \\"Solaris.\\"  I even love Soderbergh's and Clooney's \\"Solaris.\\"  But \\"Another Earth\\" is not a closely comparative plot arc.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|I am a huge fan of TNG and I owned all of the individual seasons on DVD.  Some years ago, I had a house fire and lost them all.  I thought buying this package would be a quick way to re-establish my collection.  But half of the discs wont even play in my dvd player!  My dvd player is about one year old (this post is in 2011) so I see no reason why these discs should not work, and yet, I cannot watch most of the latter seasons because the discs are unplayable. I have a region one player and the discs are formatted for region one. They will play for about ten minutes (four episodes on each disc) and then the DVD player shows a screan saying \\"disc is unplayable.\\"  Additionally, Paramount offers no replacement discs for the malfunctioning ones.

159420229X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author writes some articles on the memory championship circuit, and meets people who convince him to train and compete in the US memory championships. This is not a how-to or self help book on improving memory. Foer writes about his memory training, people with exceptional mental abilities, people with profound amnesia, and historical ways of writing and remembering, tying all these things together in the story of why we remember and forget. The author's journey from average human being to mental athlete will teach you something about memory, and how to improve yours.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a reader-reviewer at Amazon, shortly after I reviewed [[ASIN:1594202958 A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness]].  Normally I defer to other reviewers for something like this, and just do a short review for the record to join the other 100+ DVDs for smart people that I recommend at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, but in this instance, I am not satisfied with the top-rated review; they do not do the combination of acting, story, and cinematographic representation justice.<br /><br />I watched this movie twice, the first time on background (a second screen), suffering through very low sound until I finally realized that it is imperative to use the DVD software controls to set it on stereo (at least for my configuration--if you get very low sound it is not a defective DVD, you just need to run through the audio settings); and then a second time.<br /><br />Here are some of the things I would itemize about what makes this one of the most extraordinary movies I have watched in my 59 years.<br /><br />+  The story takes second place to the human acting, the human portrayal by the actress playing Temple Grandin.  This is one of the most nuanced amazing performances I have ever seen, from body posture to eye control to voice to everything.  This is a phenomenal performance.<br /><br />+  The cinematographic depictions of how Temple Gradin \\"sees\\" are perfection in every possible sense.  The use of angles and measures and black and white rapid motion design sketches combined with very rapid run throughs of everything she remembers (e.g. all the shoes she has ever seen in a couple of seconds) are stunning in their effectiveness at teaching what the autistic person is seeing.<br /><br />+  The cinematographic depictions of how Temple Gradin \\"hears\\" and fears loud noises and how she relates one instance in front of her to hundreds of other instances in memory, many of them deeply frightening, it perfectly blended into the movie.<br /><br />+  The other actors, from those who understood and supporter to those who mocked her and blocked her, are all perfection in themselves.  This is practically a Norman Rockwell depiction--a panorama--of America.<br /><br />+  The specific scenes from stockyard to town to school are all enchanting--not the perfect word, but on second viewing, this is a movie where every single \\"bit\\" seems perfect to the moment.<br /><br />+  I am deeply engaged, often moved, and occasionally in tears as I see both the genius of autism, the genius of the actress, and the importance of the theme.  More than once I think to myself that this specific movie should be shown to every schoolchild and perhaps more than once.  If Stephen Hawkin in one stellar example of an almost completely disabled person who embodied genius, then Temple Gradin--and this movie's telling of the story--is a second.<br /><br />Over-all I would say this is a \\"triple\\" six-star movie: six plus for the actress, six-plus for the combined script-writer and the team that put this together, and six-plus for the utterly brilliant integration of every aspect of the cinematography.<br /><br />I've tried to think of other books and DVDs that I might fit into here to use the Amazon link feature that I like so much, but none comes to mind.  This is a \\"one of a kind\\" movie as best I know.

0470901071|5.0|This book is:        -Easy to understand;        -The information are exact, that is, doesn't leave doubt.        -Well elaborated;        -very complete.         I am liking. I think this book covers everything about CCNA exam.    Thank you.

B0058A11AK|5.0|I'm not a die-hard Streisand fan.  I love lots of what she's done, and actually always like her in her movies.  But, her albums for me, well, some I really like and others, mehh, not so much.  I have to admit that I have always respected her willingness to change, expand, grow, and try new things.  I also know for most of us, we want our artists to stay in exactly the place we found them and fell in love with them; it's a real push-pull.    Lots of her albums, I've given away.  I just wasn't in love with them; some of her music has been too over the top for me.  But this one?  This one is just wonderful.  It's a testament to her gift and her vision.  She loves these songs and it shows in each track.  I love the sublime tempos, the quality and depth of her voice, the arrangements, and the Bergmans are exceptionally complex writers that make their songs worth repeated hearings.  All of it comes together to make a collection worth owning.  And, for those who may like her earlier works more, it does remind me of the velvet tones she is obviously able to still produce.    The world is so hectic and harsh these days...what a gift to have something that you can wrap yourself in like your favorite blanket.      Thank you for this collection.  It is silky, soft, satisfying, sultry, and superb.

0553381695|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" brought us into the world of Lord Stark, King Baratheon and pulled the rug out from under us (I'm not going to say how or why exactly as it will spoil the surprise if you haven't read the first book)with a major unexpected series of plot twists and turns.<br /><br />The second novel in the series \\"A Clash of Kings\\" shows us the Seven Kingdoms as they splinter and fall apart with different Lords declaring themselves kings and various houses forming new, sometimes unexpected alliances as they vie for power unaware or in denial that a long winter stands before them after a series of summers.<br /><br />As a comet the color of blood trails across the sky the one of the Lannisters remains a prisoner of the Stark family while the Stark daughters one of which is being held \\"hostage\\" by the boy king Joffrey and his mother. Robb Stark suggests a risky truce with them. Meanwhile, the conflicts continue to spiral out of control between the various factions wanting the Iron Throne of Baratheon.<br /><br />As with his previous novel (and the sequels), George R. R. Martin spins a tale both involving and with enough action to satisfy fantasy fans. While there have been comparisons to T.H. White's \\"The Once and Future King\\" and J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy these are superficial at best--Martin's novels are MODERN fantasy stories geared towards adults whereas the previously mentioned novels can be enjoyed by anyone.<br /><br />Martin has embarked on a powerful, involving fantasy series that promises to reach out beyond the literary ghetto of the genre. Keep in mind, though, that there canvas is quite large and the first time I read \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and even \\"A Clash of Kings\\" I had to take my time with the series because of the large cast of characters (and I had to reread \\"A Game of Thrones\\" when \\"A Clash of Kings\\" came out on paperback as the HBO TV series hadn't appeared yet).<br /><br />Highly recommended but not for those who have a hard time keeping track of a wide variety of characters.haracters.
B0058EBNAO|3.0|This app is ok, but many things need to change in order for it to be great. First, the radar sucks. The functionality needs some serious work.  What I also don't like is the fact that it gives you multiple sources for weather, but it doesn't allow the ability to remove one of those sources. The temperature for both sources is off, but only about two or three degrees, so I can live with that.  All in all, the app has potential, but needs some work.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I love this series and having the DVD enables us to watch it at our convenience.  Now we are ready for Season 6!
0312430000|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for a birthday present and she read it in 2 days. She said it was a great book, unfortunately I can't get her to lend it to me so I can read it myself. If his other books are anything to go by, this will be good too.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|Being about 30 years old I didn't know what to expect from the blu-ray of Das Boot.  The picture is very good, while the remastered sound is excellent.  I had just gotten my subwofer back from the repair shop.  Das Boot gave it a good workout! (Yes it does work) A brand new english dub is perfectly sycronized and sounds good.  The original German is also included plus there are some great new and old documentaries.  A great package.
4770031246|5.0|This was an excellent book to help me be creative in packing my son's lunches. Everyone that I have shown the book to have loved it. While I may not follow all the ideas it has gotten me out of a lunchtime rut.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Well, I think it's perfectly safe to assume, no one thinks this is the best Indiana Jones film. That doesn't mean it sucks. It has good points...and really weird special effects. The parts of the movie that don't have the weird CGI are totally fun and worth it. The ending is overly flamboyant and it was clearly messed up, at some time in the production process. With all that in mind, do you really want the Collector's Edition??? No. You want the movie, with as few extras as possible, if just to prevent any more upset fan anger, directed at Ford/Spielberg/Lucas.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|the development of the lost and awkward young main character, Jacob, is endearing and the interesting characters that crop up along the way make this book hard to put down. if you like quirk and a thrill you'll dig this read.
