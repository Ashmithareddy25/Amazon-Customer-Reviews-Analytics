B008IJTFYW|5.0|This a wonderful app. I am so happy I found it. It was recommended to me because I have a difficult time falling asleep. I put the timer on about 15mins and before I know it I am sound asleep. It has beautiful soundscapes, white noise, ambient music, and the most beautiful melodies to help calm and relax you. Thank you for being a free app! (But would of bought it if it wasn't.) Enjoy! Sleep Well.
B004DN3VEM|5.0|The Album is Great...3 diferent versions of each one of the songs...but Wait!!!!It is Rising it is just a master piece, to pay 20 for it is nothing...compared to the hours and hours of good music that Blackmore, Dio n party did on 1976, if you have any doubt about buying this...well stop thinking about it just buy it....to listen diferent version of Stargazer has no price!!!<br />the only bad thing about it was MovieMars-CDs...there was only standart shipping and I took over one month for the album to arrive
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Even though many people seem to prefer Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is probably my favorite Jane Austen novel. It's a story that illustrates that true love never dies...<br /><br />And if you want to see a great movie adaptation, nothing beats the version with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.
B0079J26XO|1.0|While I am able to hear the CD on a reg. system my OPPO player cannot \\"read\\" the SACD layer. Working with OPPO on this. Would NOT buy other EMI products.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Well written novel about a little known episode in French history and  it's long term effects on multiple families over several generations.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|For those of you familiar with this title on pc or iPad, prepare for dissapointment. It contains less than half the mini games and bonus features of all the other versions but costs the same price. Did I mention android was one of the last platforms to receive the title. We are getting screwed.<br />No  survival modes. No Zen garden. No endless modes. No begouled. No slot machine. No izombie. No last stand. No zombiquarium. No seeing stars. No buttered popcorn. etc. etc.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I fell in love with this game about a year ago. I bought my kindle and was heart broken when I found out they didn't have this game. I found it today and I am so happy. I haven't put it down.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I can't say the three shorties (stories) were a bad read at all. They were entertaining. Only thing is I've been spoiled by Mr. Connelly's Bosch and Lincoln Lawyer and more. I must say how he crafted short stories, gave important information, set-up the story and brought it all together is proof Michael Connelly is a fine - no, - an excellent writer. I'm still a big fan!
B008XG1X18|5.0|what's not to love about saving all your favorite finds in one spot? I'm crafty, stylish, funny, artistic, and resourceful or so says my pinterest boards.  go get one, you'll love it!
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|This is the ultimate cash in, a game made so poorly it feels like a joke. But this is no joke... It's not funny. Not funny at all.<br /><br />Stupid lightweight hollow plastic blocks that will not stack on each other. They are made so poorly they don't even have flat surfaces. The designs they show on the cards are often impossible to build. Really. There is one card that asks for 3 square blocks, but the game only comes with 2. And there are other cards that expect you to deny the laws of physics.<br /><br />This game is worthless. I wish desperately that I could have my 20 dollars back, then I could just buy some wooden blocks and have actual fun knocking them down.<br /><br />Zero stars if I could.
B000I9X7R6|5.0|Would you pass the ultimate test of survival? Few experiences in this world could be more terrifying than a grizzly attack. You really need to count on the people around you when nature tries to destroy you. What the billionaire protagonist in The Edge suspected, however, was even more frightening. He paid close attention to clues to understand whether one of his companions wanted to save him or betray him. This movie is a wonderful and rare blend of raw adventure with complex human relationships.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This reading material held all the correct insight that I truly needed and wanted! Nonetheless this book held an immeasurable amount of knowledge concerning exactly what I desire to utilize it for. I am grateful for the free upload from the distributor! Thank you!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Surely some of you can recall this game from your favorote amusement park. Remember when you stood there watching those coins and tokens defy gravity hanging perilously over the edge? It's back in this app for your enjoyment and aggravation.
B0029LHWL8|1.0|This novel lacks a plot that is believable, or makes any kind of sense. While stranded in a lifeboat on the ocean both Pi and the tiger would have died of thirst, malnutrition, or exposure before making landfall. The author is unable to decide how the book should end so it merely tails off while Pi babbles anything that he thinks his interrogators might like to hear or might believe. In spite of the blurbs claim that the book might even make you believe in God, it completely fails to help its readers believe in the Life of Pi. If Yann Martel intended to write a book in the style of magical realism he fails at that as well. Instead of winning the Man Booker prize in 2002, no award should have been given. The novel should have been thrown in the trash, and the Booker prize spared the loss of integrity and prestige caused by giving an award to such a poorly written piece of prose. In short, there is no redeeming value to this book.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|takes some time to figure out the best way to do this but the simple tap function of this game makes for easy fun gameplay. i dont know how much i will keep up with this to get the daily prizes but for now im having fun and the characters are so cute!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I thought this was a great app for the whole family!  It is the same idea as Where's My Water, but with a whole story!  My final thoughts on Where's My Perry: great app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this AccuWeather  for my Kindle.  It helps to know what is coming when you live in Tornado Alley in OK.  It has not steered me wrong yet.  I also like the wind direction indicator.  My husband is a hunter, and needs to know precisely which way the wind is blowing. So this app from Amazon has been very helpful.  Thanks, Jo Brogan
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Ur Personal Stalk-er. Great game 4<br /> stars but it cost money for hints (and I need more than 3 I mean. condone!
B005CW5E3E|4.0|One of my favorite blues albums is Johnny Winter's Nothin' But the Blues, from the late 1970s.  This one is in a similar vein.  The music here is very raw and soulful, the way blues should be.  Winter does not perform the same extended pyrotechnic guitar solos that he did on some of his live albums. But the honest, simple sounds on this album remind me of why Winter is one of the blues legends. If you like Robert Johnson, you'll enjoy this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because every game has its own challenge in it and for the most part they are ALL different. I like things that are challenging..
B008FTAAG2|3.0|Not a terrible album, but not as good as Beautiful Tragedy was. If you're a fan of ITM you shouldn't have a problem listening to it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a little hard to follow at first . But it quickly picked up and I couldn't put it down. So many twist & turns. If you purchase this don't stop reading, I promise it won't disappoint you in the end....great read,!
B008MAI0WK|4.0|The book is well written and easy to read and understand. Lots of details on setting up your Raspberry Pi and using it in different roles.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't rate this 5-stars is the Kindle edition is kind of hard to use to jump around to different areas when a problem comes up. I would normally use sticky tabs to mark the areas I need to return to when I'm looking for specific details.<br /><br />The book is great and does all it promises.
B008359QFY|5.0|1st Note: I've seen every episode of season 1 with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />2nd Note: A few hours ago, I rewatched the intense season finale of Once Upon A Time to warm up for Season 2 which premieres one week from today on ABC with new episodes available the day after they air with XFinity On Demand and online at their website.<br /><br />The first season of Once Upon A Time has been a thrilling rollar coaster ride, with every episode providing a great story and all of it building up to the most action-packed, romantic, epic, heart-warming & heart-breaking episode of the season. I decided to watch the final two episodes back-to-back, and I'm glad I did so, as the 21st episode ends on a shocking cliffhanger that leaves you aching to watch episode 22. And should you choose to follow the same path I did in viewing the final two episodes back-to-back, the reward is much greater than if you watch one episode a day or so apart. The acting in the series is excellent and the writing is top-notch.<br /><br />Not only is the entire season family-friendly (no graphic violence, mild-to-moderate language and no sexual situations), but the storylines are absolutely excellent. There are cleverly placed references to the classic Disney movies which have been made out of these fairy tales. Disney has graciously allowed the use of their characters in the films for this series, and it's not a gimmick. Trust me. And there are more surprises in store, dearie...<br /><br />Rated TV-PG (mild violence and mild-to-moderate language)<br /><br />Magic Is Coming Sunday September 30 at 8/7 central on ABC.
B005EHILV4|5.0|This was the least expensive mixer that had really good reviews.  I am using it for webcasting/screencasting and find it fairly easy to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o) No drivers to install.  Windows 7 immediately saw the device and installed.<br />o) Shows up as input and output audio devices.  This lets you hear audio from the computer such as in VOIP calls.<br />o) Behringer website has extra downloads for the audio tweakers<br /><br />I didn't see in the pictures where the mixer got power.  And since my microphone (a CAD M179) requires phantom power I was concerned it wouldn't be able to provide enough.  What I found is that since this is an analog mixer the USB connection covers the power requirements for the mixer and the mic.  Analog mixing means the audio is mixed through the dials and switches.  Only at the point of output does the sound get digitized and redirected back to the computer.  I don't know if analog in a mixer is considered better or not.  I am not an audiophile.  But I can tell you I am very happy with the results.<br /><br />The mixer provides a means to monitor your voice which has been very helpful in tweaking sound levels.  Since everything is controlled on the mixer you don't have to configure monitoring through software.  This greatly simplifies my setup.<br /><br />The ability to cut low or high pitch helps cut background noise from the various computers running in my office.  I can definitely tell the difference.  Nice and quiet.<br /><br />Besides webcasting/screencasting, I am also using the mixer for VOIP phone calls.  I am able to completely tweak the volume the caller hears and what I hear from the caller in this one device... and separate from my computer.  Having the controls external of the computer means I don't have to hunt through menus in the VOIP software while talking with customers.<br /><br />In summary, I am very happy with the purchase.  Sound is good.  Features are above what I expected.  This was a great purchase.<br /><br />Edit: I installed Behringer's drivers and suddenly my mic dropped down to almost silent.  I had to turn the mic, gain and main mix WAY up for anyone to hear me.  It took editing the registry to completely get rid of the driver.  Lesson learned.  Don't install the Behringer's driver!  Also, one more note... their tech support hadn't responded to me after two days.  So don't expect much from them for support.<br />------------<br />Update: After a year of use I am still very happy with this product.  I have taken it on the road and recorded hundreds of hours of audio.<br /><br />Key features I like: 1) No external power supply.  2) No more mixing through software.  3) Sturdy and portable.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I read this book and really liked it. In fact, the pragmatic side of me is refusing to find offense in a chapter of the book that would highly offend others with loved ones with Autism. This book was fascinating and will change the way I think and behave.<br /><br />And then the other shoe drops...I never would have read this book if someone had mentioned the chapter using Autistic as an adjective. And maybe it would have been my loss, but when you live, breathe, and lose someone to the quiet of Autism, you lose a part of you--even if they eventually become high-functioning and casually indistinguishable from their peers. I can't imagine how hurtful this book might have been to someone with a newly-diagnosed child or an adult family member struggling to be independent.<br /><br />Let me include some quotes. This is how Autism is introduced: \\"...the way that people with autism see the world gives us a very good sense of what happens when our mind-reading faculties fail.\\"<br /><br />(I guess the fact that I still capitalize Autism--when I know it's not technically capitalized tells you I'm not as far removed as I pretend, but anyway....)<br /><br />Gladwell goes on to describe studies on those with Autism and layer by layer establishes that the subjects of these studies lack social awareness including missing social cues and relating to people as objects and often as tools. For those unfamiliar with Autism, this could be a really good look at the symptoms and thought processes of some in the Autism spectrum.<br /><br />For those familiar with Autism and those who've just read this book on how stereotypes color our blink reflexes, his use of the term \\"normal\\" to describe those in the studies without Autism or just everyone without Autism--grates. In a clinical sense, are Autistic people abnormal in some ways? Yes. Would you ever describe someone's loved one as abnormal? I hope not.<br /><br />And this is where this book fails in my opinion. Gladwell's distilled use and portrayal of Autism as a set of abnormal symptoms often displayed in cases of heightened emotion where people behave rashly and even kill innocent people--is insensitive and possibly even offensive. Our society needs to stop seeing Autism as a clinical term and as a set of symptoms and, now, in a blink--Gladwell has just reinforced them as abnormal.<br /><br />He doesn't imply that Autistic people are unintelligent... in fact: \\"Peter is a highly intelligent man. He has graduate degrees from a prestigious university. His IQ is well above normal...\\" But then: \\"But because he lacks one very basic ability--the ability to mind-read--he can be presented with that scene in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and come to a conclusion that is socially completely and catastrophically wrong.\\"<br /><br />Catastrophically wrong.<br /><br />He says an Autistic man's inability to get the commonly-accepted message in a film as catastrophically wrong.<br /><br />Gladwell then goes on to relate many negative, violent, and often fatal situations where \\"They didn't take the necessary steps to steer clear of temporary autism.\\" \\"What police training does, at its best, is teach officers how to keep themselves out of this kind of trouble, to avoid the risk of momentary autism.\\"<br /><br />The chapter's primary focus is on the 1999 shooting of unarmed Amadou Diallo by four policeman--who fired at him 41 times when he went to get his wallet out. The police officer was \\"not mind-reading now. He's effectively autistic. He's locked in on whatever is coming out of Diallo's pocket, just as Peter was locked in on the light switch in George and Martha's kissing scene.\\"<br /><br />A police officer who kills an unarmed man is not effectively Autistic, but using the word in this way is effectively offensive to those dealing with a disorder that now effects 1 in 88 children.<br /><br />Having said that, Gladwell in his typical brilliant way presents the subject of split-second thinking very well through-out the book. I can see what he was trying to achieve here in this chapter by relating it to Autism, but not all disorders can or should be boiled down and dissected to using a part to present the whole. His clinical portrayal of a disorder as only a sum of symptoms can be and probably will be offensive to some. At some points, he swapped out the term \\"mind-blind\\" and I wish he'd stuck with that.<br /><br />For the record, I couldn't bring myself to knock off a star for this because it's obviously the viewpoint of someone not personally affected by Autism. He didn't get a five star rating because I thought his concluding points in this book weren't as strong as he finished in Outliers.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Very moving and compelling given it's a true story. I definitely recommend it for a feel Good Friday or Saturday night movie at home with your partner.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a great read.  Can't wait to start the 3rd book.  It's so sad the author has died and there will be no more!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read soooo much about this book I had to see for myself, and I must say, I am breathlessly reading it, enjoying every minute of it. It is not high literature, but it is a great book, and I have a great time reading it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Perfect for procrastinaters like me. Graphics are well done. And the prizes are perfectly placed. Makes you want to keep coming back for more. Like it a lot.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love it.so much fun and people like the person who said we were stupid I don't like you at all
B000I8G5C6|5.0|This is one of those movies I can watch over and over again - fresh, funny, and sweet. With Will Smith as the charming ladies man and love doctor, Eva Mendes as a sassy gossip reporter, and a hilarious Kevin James playing a hapless romantic who employs the services of the love doctor, this romantic comedy never fails to entertain. Highly recommended!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Glad it is finally on kindle fire. Really love this game. Fun to play, the different rooms and levels are interesting. Don't really like the upside. down rooms.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so fun<br />I love that you can sell items that u win and don't even pay for. its just like the arcade in cape cad
B004I8WD6E|5.0|No. Not just the best inexpensive case (it's so cheap!). This is the most durable, efficient and well-designed case for this phone. I went through a few before settling for this one. I'm actually a bit sad for having to let it go along with my iPhone 4. (My contract is up so I'm getting the iPhone 5 soon after the craziness at the stores is over.)
B007Q35PLI|1.0|While the acting was amazing the story was not accurate and even the true story is hideous. This is about a woman who in her heart and mind wanted to ease the suffering of factory farm animals. She could not bare the what they were going through, what she ended up doing was making it easier on the workers and making it easier to slaughter an innocent life. This woman is being made out to be a hero this she is not. I gave it one star for the actors the lack of other stars was for the lack of truth and heart in the story.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I hadn't read Treasure Island in years but when I saw it on kindle I was successfully tempted.  I was entranced all over again.  The isolated inn.  The dark night.  The blind pirate tapping up the road. The BLACK SPOT! Stevenson was certainly a terrific writer and spinner of tales.  Then off they go to the island where that parrot-shouldered, peg-legged character Long John Silver weaves his way from one side of the mutiny to the other.  And do you remember old Ben, the marooned pirate in rags, dreaming of \\"cheese?\\"  It was great fun to read Treasure Island again and I highly recommend it. Read it aloud to your kids!
B000VSYDRM|5.0|I had never personally understood the term \\"sleeper\\" when referring to movies....and movie I have ever seen that worth the time I spent watching it was well known and much discussed among friends and in reviews, etc.  This movie, on the other hand, I still have not heard anything about, and haven't seen any marketing related to it ever.  This was a movie that I rented one weekend where absolutely nothing that I wanted to see was available, and somehow I ended up with this movie.  I have never been any more pleasantly surprised about a movie in my life.  From the beginning, this movie grabs you, and overwhelms your senses with over-the-top everything - the bits that are meant to repulse you do so liberally.  THe bits that should shock you do so with room to spare.  The movie surprises throughout, from the appearance of several of my favorite actors (DUstin Hoffman) to the subject matter and the meticulous way that the viewer is presented with the eventuality of the plot.  By the time I finally saw where the movie was heading, I was so enthralled with the movie that I could not turn it off.  Never before have I been so disgusted and so delighted with such a dark, black movie.  THis is a movie that you will either love or hate, or a little of both.  FOr me, the bits I hated only served to pull me in more completely for the bits that I loved.  This is an incredible movie, and should be placed at the front of your watchlist.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|WOW... took me some time to build the will to get it, so I tried the Kindle sample..... what a wise choice.....<br />it's really a surprise people love this.... almost on the first page the silly poor girl stumbles and nose dives into<br />the so called Mr Wonderful's office - wow ....I was sure it would be a omgoshwhatawaste book....
B008602KQI|5.0|Love the books and love the movie.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  Enjoyed the ability to watch on my iPad using Amazon's movie service.
B00932A2MC|4.0|If you are looking for a good action movie that doesn't take a lot to keep up with what is going on, then this is your movie.  The plot is predictable and there aren't any real surprises (except that I would have thought Liam Neeson would have a bigger part in the movie), but it is a good sit back and relax and watch some great special effects kind of movie.
B0018Q4DTY|4.0|Just as great an album as I remember from back in '96. I would advise anybody who liked Outkast's SouthernPlayalisticCadillacFunkyMusic album to buy this one. Great Album. Get It!
B006VRDZ44|5.0|Prohibition, gangsters, docudrama-like storyline, and Steve Buscemi.  What more could you ask for?<br /><br />Best of all, I can bypass the HBO monthly fee and order it in HD from Amazon, streamed effortlessly to my TV via my Macbook.  Most awesomely recommended.
0345803493|5.0|I love the book. Only wished it didn't have to end. Have read all three and loved them all.  Hope she wrrites a 4th one.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I had to buy this after watchng it on YouTube, was afraid it might get pulled from there. Wonderful voice and Adele is very funny! Love the way she is so personable with her audience. Thoroughly enjoyable!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was definetly one of my favorite books. THe author did a really good job of making the main character skeptical without making her cynical. I knew the book was sad going in and that definetly helps. Its about a young girl who has terminal cancer and she feels like she doesn't do much with her life. Then she meets a young man named Augustus Waters. But this isn't just a love story. Its more about finding who you are and what that means to the people around you. I loved this book and i strongly reccomend it, especially to people looking for a good cry.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent His words I believe.I found it interesting the way he integrated different aspects of his family life (though not much), training, and missions.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|After over a year of only getting the Administrations version of the raid that killed UBL, which sadly was significantly different than the author's version, it is good to get a first hand account.  The book is well written and easy to read and adds an original source to our history in this sad chapter of tragedy for our country.  The broad background account of the training and previous missions gives the reader great insight into the skill and courage of these unique warriors. The author tells the story in a matter of fact way that keeps the focus on the men and the mission and there is NO SPIN.  Thanks Mark Owens to you and all the great men and women in our military and government who do their jobs faithfully to protect our values and way of life.  Well done!
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Atlanta is deserted except for the dead and the dogs. Sheriff Rick Grimes broadcast a message on the portable radio. Atlanta is dead and they are moving on to Fort Benning, Ga. They load up into the mobile home, jeep and motorcycle and move on to find help. He is trying to leave a message for Morgan like he promised he would do.<br /><br />The interstate is blocked with a wreck and stopped cars and they weave their way into a maze. The mobile home breaks a radiator hose and they have to stop and repair it. The sheriff's wife is nervous as the cars remind her of a grave yard and they are on guard for zombies. They search for fuel, water and food. A zombie is coming and suddenly a whole troop of them appears.  There are hundreds or more and they begin moving through the cars looking for food.  The sheriff and his fellow surviving humans  have to hide under cars and under dead bodies to not be found.<br /><br />The zombies pass but a straggler sees the little girl, Sophia. She gets up and runs into the woods and the sheriff goes after her and so do the zombies.  The sheriff finds the little girl and tells her to hide in a washout in the river. He will come back for her after he kills the zombies....<br /><br />This series is just one of the most intense and graphic shows on TV.  If you like zombie films and stories you will love this show and this season is really good.  This zombie show is so innovative in its concepts. Zombies going into a church because the bell rings and they are clinging to their human behaviors and memories. The special effects and makeup are great and the story line is intense and scary. The personalities and the interaction between the characters is well written and acted out.<br /><br />This is one of my family's favorite shows and we enjoy it a lot.  I recommend it to you.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|i am a total Tudor fan and Blanchett does not let you down.  Elizabeth was her own person during a time of complete misogyny.  this movie gives her credit.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a very fun game.There is only one problem. Whenever you have music playing and you open this app the music stops playing. Other than that there are no flaws.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Downloaded this album for my 9 year old nephew. Transferred it to his ipod so that he could listen to it. Now he wants me to buy him more mp3's! Lol!
159562015X|1.0|The book is okay but unnecessary. The online test (what I had to purchased the book for) didn't make sense and it moved way too fast, there is no way it can be accurate.
B000WXVJ6Y|5.0|Loved the whole album. I was able to hear how she does different types of songs and to see a little more of how talented she is.
B00884GR0W|4.0|It was nice, but once you start out, you die a lot because of lack of weapons. Overall, nice game.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Heard this on the radio and decided it was a catchy tune. Downloaded the single to listen to the whole song and will soon be buying the whole album.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|You drop coins. Game pushes coins into previously dropped coins, which then go down lane. Much like bowling, there are gutters that pushed coins can fall into. If a coin makes it to the end, it will drop through a hole. The game will make happy noises. You get a gold star flash on the screen.<br /><br />Repeat.<br /><br />Over<br />and<br />over.

B003G8W0GK|5.0|I've been waiting for the new season to start and really have been wondering when it would. This does give you a little glimpse. Glad that the new season has already started!

B007URVZJ6|4.0|Very easy to follow. Uncomplicated. Had no trouble. The digital format allowed me to jump around so I could review my work and make corrections.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This series of books has helped me get my youngest son to read.  I couldn't get him to read Harry Potter but anything dealing with Percy Jackson and Demigods he can't get enough of.  Thank you so much for the series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|:) hate to run out of coins.  waiting and very impatient, but over all is fun.  better than wasting coins at an arcade.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Title says it all.Battery doesn't work regardless of how long it's charged. The hiss from this unit is unbearable and unacceptable. Does not work properly with any set of headphones regardless of manufacturer and/or ohm impedance. Absolute rubbish!
B008476HBM|5.0|No matter how many times i read this book i always find more that i love about it!  darcy and elizabeth are a most amazing couple, they dont make them like that any more!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This album is really amazing.  She got bad reviews on her SNL performance, but this album more than makes up for it.  Her voice is so sultry and down-right sexy.  Her music and singing talent makes you think of American music from the '60's.  Her voice can range quite a bit.  Some songs even have a bit of hip-hop element to them, but not in a corny way.  You simply have to listen to know what I'm talking about.  This is by far one of the best albums I've heard in a while.  I can't wait for her next one.
0140143505|5.0|Dear community: today is Monday and I read this book on past Saturday. Despite the numerous reviews it has I want to share with you what I felt during the reading. And in one word was charm. And the origin of this charm lies in the love we feel for the books in themselves, I mean as living objects. I expected an epistolary novel and that's what I got. Letters that come and go between New York and London, talking deliberately and passionately about books, which is to say, paper quality, covers, typography, printing, inks, illustrations, and so on. As a book lover you will feel very excited as long as you share the same heartbeat acceleration as Haniff transmit when it comes to books.<br /><br />Guys, friends: my wife shake her head when she sees me reading hidden in the last corner of my house. The living room is full of guests and I'm not there. Nobody can understand that. Helene Haniff would have smiled and comprehended this incomprehensible failure in loving words printed in a piece of paper more than, say, words \\"printed\\" in the air. If you love books as she loves them you'll feel part of this fellowship of the book. I think that's what she wanted when she decided that the letters could be published despite the fact that this wasn't intended in the first place, because they were written to establish correspondence with a bookstore, nothing else.<br /><br />You can trust me, just read the reviews, the titles at least, and you will discover the same charm everywhere. Then do it, get it and read it.<br /><br />And (if it is the case) do not forget the guests in your living room.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was burning up the battery in my Kindle while reading this amazing book. I am a member of the Happy Bookers Book club and I have chosen Gone Girl for my book to read and discuss. It was hard to know whether to 'pull'for Amazing Amy or Naughty Nick and definitely a book you could re-read. Best book I have read in years! My favorite all time book used to be Beach Music but Gone Girl is my new number one best read.
B002RI97IY|5.0|While Tolle's writing style can sometimes be a bit expansive, his break down of Buddhist practice into it's simplest form makes the actual practice of being present with whatever is arising at the time, whether enjoyable or trying,much more easily understood. While to some the practice he proposes may seem simplistic, this is no-head-in-the-sand, rainbow jumping, chrystal swinging fringe idea...it works.
0307950689|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Suspense, thriller, conspiracy... What more can I say? This is the best book Dan Brown has EVER written. Buy it! You will not be disappointed.
B0031R5K7M|5.0|I couldn't put my book down, you get a great picture of what the author is describing. Almost feels like your following Eragon around like an extra mind behind theirs

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is by far one of my most favorite games. Runs very smoothly! I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who's looking for an addicting and fun game.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This is the first book by Marian Keys that I have read and I am looking forward to reading more. I found this book very compelling and entertaining. On one hand it was an easy read with lots of humour and fun dialogue with lots of wit and clever insights. On the other hand it educated me about addiction and I would say that the author has done a lot of research on the subject.<br />The book is a really easy read yet the characters are well drawn and I really cared what happened to them. I was fascinated to see how even the minor characters developed and had their own story.<br />Entertaining, funny and educational!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee lived through something so horrific, most adults cannot contemplate it.  To be an 11 year old child and to go through what she went through and come out as well adjusted as she did, is amazing. As an adult, I cannot imagine being sane after 18 years with these animals. It is hard to believe there was a woman that actually helped and supported this twisted man. Thank God Jaycee is alive and well and was able to hold on to the things that were important to her, like the love of a mother.  I believe the thought of being with her family again helped her get through this ordeal.<br /><br />The book was well written and her memory is amazing.  Some parts were graphic, but this is what the book is about....just how awful this was for her. I would hope that writing this afforded her the opportunity to say goodbye to those horrible 'ghosts of her past' and get on with hers and her daughters REAL lives. She is an amazing young woman and I also hope the sale of this book is tremendous.  This too, will help her with her REAL LIFE!!<br />Good luck Jaycee and daughters......may you all have wonderful lives~!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|The book is a revealing meditation on the first hand experience of decline and loss after the diagnosis of cancer.  There is an intermingling of hope and resignation, and musings on what are the most important moments in life.  As such, the book provides an exquisit insight into the mind (and a great mind), during the final stages of life.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I loved all the misic on this CD..as I was listening to it... I could almost see the movie in my imagination! Buy this CD it is great listening! 5 Stars!
0307895475|5.0|This guide is amazing, it tells u everything about stuff in the game! Its pretty thick and a nice size with 800 + pages. 200+ are just for dawn guard and hearhfire . It also has a nice large 2 sided map. Only problem is, it's connected to the book and a little tricky to get out without tearing anything. Other than that... I definitely rate it 5 stars!

160774273X|5.0|I've purchased many bread baking books over the years but none come close to this one.  The method used to get a starter up and going are clear and easy to follow.  Mine was ready to use for baking in 5 days!  The recipes are complete without being long winded and turn out incredible loaves.  Check out my first loaf in the pictures section of this review...  they really do look like the cover photo!  If you are a beginner this book is great and will lead you through all of the many techniques needed to make great bread.  If you are an experienced home baker it will take you to the next level.  For those of us lucky enough to live in Portland and eat at Ken's Artisan regularly, reading the story of how his bakeries came to be is fascinating, amusing, and inspiring!  Happy baking!
B001J3U22S|4.0|I haven't read Dune because I haven't gotten to it yet.  Therefore, the previous reviews slamming this book because it is 'NOT DUNE' hasn't stopped me from reading any of the prequels.<br /><br />It's a space opera, plain and simple - and it's a GOOD one.  I do think the authors tend to repeat themselves a bit and I did find myself glazing over during some of the introspective passages but generally, my imagination was caught in a tractor beam for the duration of my reading.<br /><br />Now, I'm going to invalidate anything I've just said: I grew impatient and read the next book's cliff notes on Wikipedia so I can skip ahead.  I'm excited to read the original novels and the prequels were meant to give me the setup.  The skipping ahead may have been a result of some real life pressures that have made me impatient and I was also disappointed with the Kindle Price.<br /><br />If you have the patience, I recommend reading the prequels.  The stories are fantastic but the characters are relatable and I continually find myself rooting for both sides of the conflict.  The periods of total immersion in another time and philosophy experienced by picking up these individual novels make the trip worthwhile.  The key (generally & specifically when reading prequels) is to forget the bigger picture and series.  Just enjoy the ride.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My breath is gone and my heart is racing fast and All I can say is “The game is afoot“
B0091REZMW|2.0|Any time a game says it's. free,  it just isn't.  Some cost more than others and this is one of them. Not only that,  but you have to get facebook friends involved as well in order progress in the game! I wouldn't mind paying for a good game if I knew what I was getting into beforehand!  Another negative is you're kind of stuck with the game indefinitely as they are continually. adding to it. This would be GREAT if I could just play the game by myself!!!
B009CCBCU4|5.0|This was a story that enthralled me from page 1 ! A chance meeting by 2 young men turn to life altering choices later in life.Family secrets destroy the world of one young man, while the other young man furthers his ambitions and his fathers . Soul mates meet and are separated by traditions and family . This is a time if the growth of the powers of the soon to be glorious Aztec nation. It is both heart rending and enlightening and it was so hard to put down that sleeping became an option !
0525952926|3.0|With all the possibilities offered by WW2 to a competent author like Follett this book truly failed my expectations.  A five star book is one that keeps me turning the pages - I put Winter aside several times and read another book, returning to it again to - eventually - drag myself through to the last page only because it is the second of a intended trilogy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the best memoir, read of non-fiction I have read in months.  This is a perfect read for travel or vacation.  I finished patriotic and inspired!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Got a clean cut on my second attempt. Only about 3 dozen bottles to go! Now all I need to do is find the time. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it would be nice if it had some sort of stand to fit into to steady it.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|This is a wonderful read, takes a day, gives you the herby jeevies about bugs.  Michael Crichton get you thinking, thats his niche.  I love his books and this is no exception.  No Dull moments, fast read.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought the movie was very good.  The characters were great and very close to the book.  Would definately watch it again!

B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall-E is one of my favorite animated films. Great for young and old alike. Whenever my family needs to be reminded to \\"get off the couch, potato\\", we watch Wall-E. Always works, for a while anyway.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love the character development in this program.  Within one season, I have connected with each character in different ways for different reasons.  As the story unfolds, I am more and more intrigued by the possibilities of scientific discovery.  Of course, there is the humor vis-a-vis the wealth of material for conspiracy theorists!!
0143119680|3.0|This review does contain spoilers, please read with caution.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness is a real puzzler. I enjoyed the book and plan on reading book two (Shadow Of The Night) but found the book to be frustrating.<br />What I did not like about A Discovery Of Witches:<br /><br />Length:<br /><br />This book is way too long! For being so long, it has little action. At well over 500 pages, this book seemed to drag. I did have a hard time putting it down but I am not sure if it was because I enjoyed reading it or was just waiting for something (anything) to happen.<br /><br />Characters:<br />A Discovery Of Witches has a lot of characters which can be confusing at times. This is especially the case when so many are introduced at the end of the book. Deborah Harkeness might go into further detail about these characters in subsequent books but as of the end of this one, there are a few who seem pretty random. The two daemons introduced near the end (who also have a forbidden love and a forbidden pregnancy) are a great example. They both literally move right in but we learn very little about them<br /><br />Plot:<br />The plot is all over the place. It starts with being about alchemy and Asmole 782, jumps to issues with forbidden relationships and all the different creatures, and ends with some kind of stand against the man. It felt like there were so many story lines (many of them interesting) with little to no resolution. I hope these issues are addressed in the subsequent books.<br /><br />Love Story:<br />I do not read books for the titillation (not a fan of erotica or romance novels) but having a destined greatest love story ever in a book and all the main characters do is heavy petting is boring. Even with the lack of sex, the love story seems off. Mathew is so overprotective and gushy, it made me want Diana to break up with him.<br /><br />Diana has such a personality change in the later parts of the book that it seems like she is bent on becoming subservient to a man she has known for a few weeks. I understand that Mathew is a vampire, old-fashioned, but Diana is a modern, educated woman whom I would hope would  have her own voice. There is a lot of talk of obeying Mathew, couched in the hew is a vampire and the head of household, which really did not make it easier for me to read or understand. It made me as ragey as New Moon where all Bella can do is moan about heartbreak. I like my fictional women strong and independent, able to function without the help of a man.<br /><br />All of these issues aside, I did enjoy A Discovery Of Witches and do plan on reading the follow-up Shadow Of The Night. I have hope that tighter editing and more of a focus on moving the plot forward will lead to a better book two.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie but I'm also one of those rare women that likes a good action flick. Beyond the believable blowing stuff up bits, and the scenes all over the world, I was most affected by the idea that the things the characters were doing in the movie are real skills of people walking around among us. I repeatedly found myself saying: \\"That really happens?!\\"<br /><br />I thought it was well-produced and unlike you naysayers, loved that the producer/directors cast real Navy SEALs to portray the characters in the film. I thought the acting was good! It's like you've all never seen an action movie before. The acting may not earn Oscars but the story was made real by the fact that SEALs were the ones doing it.<br /><br />That scene where the SEALs disappear into the water, then one catches the bad guy as he's shot by a sniper so there isn't a splash in the water? Chills. That's talent, boys.<br /><br />It actually makes me bummed that I live in San Francisco, where the men are meek and techy. So if any of y'all know some late-20's-30's real men, send 'em my way!
0525478817|4.0|This is my first John Green book and if the others are as good as this one, and I suspect they might be, then the wild popularity and best-selling status is much deserved. The ability to write a story centered around teenagers who have cancer, one being undeniably terminal, and not allowing the reader to feel bad for them is a rare talent.<br /><br />Death and dying is such an uncomfortable topic for most people that they usually can only deal with it in platitudes. One of my favorite parts are the expressions all over Augustus's house (home is where the heart is and such.) It seems so lacking in light of the real life drama that Hazel and Augustus are living with.<br /><br />The Fault Of Our Stars is filled with characters that feel very real. The dialogue throughout was perfect, witty and quick. The kind of conversations you remember from your teenage years when you could talk on the phone for hours. I loved that the characters themselves deconstruct death in such a way that the reader is left knowing the hole left is with the living. Referring to the dying as a grenade which wreaks havoc on the survivors is such an interesting way to think about it.<br /><br />The love story was beautiful without being cheesy. It is nice to read a Young Adult novel where the characters themselves are not so overly dramatic as to make their romance more akin to that of a harlequin novel (I'm looking at you Twilight.)<br /><br />I loved everything about The Fault In Our Stars, especially the ending. It was perfect without wrapping the story in a neat bow. It is sad, but you can believe that the characters are all the better having known each other.
B0087HT36U|2.0|i had a great time playing this for a while.  as you move to the higher levels it gets slower and slower and finally no response.  i had to remove the battery 3 times to restart phone after freeze.  so now i need to remove it.  galaxy s
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee is an amazing young lady.  When reading this book remember that she wasn't afforded the luxury of school.  I think she did a great job writing this book.  I can't imagine going through what she went through.

B0084IHVC0|4.0|We owned this movie on VHS and it was one of my wife's favorites.  The Blu-ray edition is excellent with terrific picture and sound quality.  It was reasonably priced for a combo pack.  If you love 'The Aristocats', this is a must-have product
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had the most despicable characters.  I did not care if Amy was gone or not.  Though the book was well written, I had trouble slogging through it because I did not connect with the main characters or most of the supporting characters.  All of the twists did keep the plot moving.
1439102813|5.0|This story is told from the Alzheimer patient's point of view. Alice is in fact the narrator of her own story. It is sweetly presented and conveys how the disease progressively takes over the patient's life.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it a lot. it is very handy an easy to use. you can use any version you want.
B006Z2XTBY|3.0|Author of note William Boyd tries his hand at a crime thriller and delivers a decent, if rather unfinished, story.  This is one of those novels that you enjoy throughout --Boyd's usual original and interesting characters, good pacing with a lot of interweaving of different protagonist vs. antagonist perspectives, skilled e evoking of place and atmosphere, etc.--but at the end you're left asking a dozen questions about unresolved character relationships, unlikely actions/reactions and whether the author intends to write a sequel (which is badly needed, in my opinion).<br /><br />\\"Ordinary Thunderstorms\\" (still not completely sure if the title is apt) is more or less the story of a decent, intelligent 30-something scientist who inadvertently walks into murder cum industrial crime situation (think Le Carre on the latter subject) who panics and goes underground to avoid the police and the murder victim's killer.  He is quickly the focus of both police and murderer's attentions and is gradually forced into trying to resolve the original murder himself.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the range of characters that author Boyd sets at play.  What works less well the over dependence on random chance for the action scenes and the counter-intuitive decisions by the protagonist and other principal characters.  By the end of the book, you're thinking--wow, this is really some fine writing, but what about all those holes?!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very poorly written. Boring and repetitive. Insulting to any normal and intelligent woman. Story of an intelligent naive college graduate who is so insecure that she falls for a sadistic masochist.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I didnt give this movie a chance when it first came out. Decided to watch it  because red box never has decent movies available. This movie should be watched by all. Instant classic. I will own this movie and rewatch again and again. Im crossing my fingers they make a sequal, I will not miss it in theaters this time around.
B007STBUIW|5.0|A glorious restoration, looking better than any previous incarnation on home video. JAWS hasn't looked this good since 1975! I can finally retire my laser disc copy (thank God!)
1402270275|5.0|Looking for an epic steampunk romance? Then be sure to check out Bec McMaster's debut KISS OF STEEL...a stellar steampunk romance that will seduce and entertain readers from beginning to end.<br /><br />Honoria Todd has done everything to prevent falling into the dreaded hands of the immortal Blade, legendary master of the rookeries in the dangerous district of Whitechapel. Becoming fascinated with the spirited young woman and wishing to know her darkest secrets, Blade does everything to force her hand. Eventually Honoria is forced to ask for his protection, but it comes with a price, one that she isn't certain she can pay. Blade will do anything to keep Honoria close in order to ensure she is safe from their mutual enemy, the Duke of Vickers. The monster within Blade is slowly climbing to the surface as the overwhelming cravings threaten to take hold, both for blood and revenge. Just as he fears it might be too late, Honoria could be the salvation he's been waiting for.<br /><br />There are plenty of words you could use to describe Bec McMaster's debut KISS OF STEEL. Yet somewhere along the line you would have to include fabulous, stunning, amazing and stellar. This breathtaking novel opens the reader's eyes to a Victorian London people can only dream about. Steampunk has been the ever-increasing phenomenon in romance, yet Ms McMaster gives you a reason to love it relentlessly.<br /><br />Bec McMaster's efforts at describing such a new world would have been enough, yet she was still able to throw absolutely amazing characters into the mix. Honoria Todd was an intelligent, resourceful young lady doing her best to survive in a cruel world. You slowly see the desperation of her situation seep in as the story progresses, but it's the way she clings to an undying hope of a better future that makes you admire her character. At one point, she feels like she is selling her soul to the devil himself, but she still carries on trying to make it through another day. She nevergives up and protects those she loves at all costs.<br /><br />The one crick in her armor seems to be the stoic yet dangerous immortal Blade...an intimidating foe and an all-consuming lover. You have to love a hero so close to the edge of losing control, yet willing to fight to keep it together for the stunning heroine in his life. If first impressions were anything to go by, Blade would be the last person anyone could trust. Yet as his character develops, you begin to fall in love with him just as easily as Honoria. Like Honoria, he is a protector, ensuring the safety of his people at all costs but that doesn't mean he is completely made of steel. He has vulnerabilities too, and that makes him that much more appealing as you discover the strength he uses to overcome anything in his path.<br /><br />One aspect, out of many, that I loved about KISS OF STEEL was the development of the romance. Ms McMaster starts out this story establishing strong roots to develop her world and characters. The romance storyline is always there, and slowly but surely the author brings it to the front lines, stoking the fire between the two protagonists and flirting with the sexual tension. Eventually, of course, their sensual romance unfolds in greater detail, but I felt it was beautifully done. This novels perfectly blends in the romance so that it doesn't overwhelm the adventure, yet still delivers an emotional and scorching love story.<br /><br />Bec McMaster has a prose that is infectious and addictive. You walk into her world and it instantly comes alive. The gritty streets, the anger and despair...all of it described in such vivid detail you feel as though you are really there. She builds a world of endless mystery and intriguing complexities that keep your mind whirling throughout. The backstory is a little overwhelming at the beginning, yet all the detail only helps to create a unique world in which the characters live. You quickly fall into this world, like Alice through the rabbit hole, and are guaranteed to love every minute of the adventure. The hours simply fly by with this book in your hands and you can't stop the thrills if you wanted to because you won't be able to put it down.<br /><br />I simply loved KISS OF STEEL! This novel is a must read for fans of steampunk, paranormal, historicals and of course a good romance. It is one of the best steampunk novels I have read and certainly a novel to treasure. Ms McMaster has certainly hit one out of the park with her stunning debut and one can only hope this is just a small sign of what's to come. I eagerly anticipate the next novel in this series and hope that adventure is just as wild as KISS OF STEEL!<br /><br />Lisa Jo @ The Romance Reviews
B008J05EL8|1.0|There should be a notice on the OfficeSuite App page telling of this &quot;option&quot; to BUY more fonts that should be included in the initial app! Good job Mobile Systems, Inc. I think you have more &quot;1&quot; ratings than any other I've seen!
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Excellently directed by the champ Marty Scorsese, SHUTTER ISLAND is a black and white psychological thriller that lets in little light as to what's really happening in an institution for the criminally insane off the East Coast (Boston Harbor) in 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Danials and his  partner Chuck Aule arrive at Ashecliffe Hospital due to the disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. A wretched storm prevents Daniels from leaving the titular complex. Lead psychologist Cawley refuses to hand over records; Solando's Dr. Sheehan has left after the disappearance of Solando, and Danials and partner are barred from the lighthouse with word that it has already been searched.<br /><br />Daniels starts having migraines, waking visions of his involvement in Dachau massacres of Germans at the end of WWII, and disturbing dreams of wife Dolores Chanal being killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. To the viewer, all is running amuck with the storm raging, Daniels' mind slipping from reality, and not knowing if the so-called doctors are true-blood loyal practitioners. The overtones of dark, threatening, evil faces with patients attempting to warn Daniels to \\"Run!\\" and hurricane forces continue to perplex us, especially when Daniels breaks into another compound where a naked inmate attacks him. Supposedly, he learns from patient Noyce that lobotomies are being performed and everyone on the island, including Aule, is playing a game designed for Daniels.<br /><br />Finally, we discover what's up (but that won't be revealed here). It's a shattering, unshuttered experience--and one we think Daniels won't ever understand. This is not the kind of movie you watch for a happy, uplifting experience, and a cherry on top. It's a mindful film, one that will haunt you and touch you inexplicably at different moments in your life. It will be a film you will watch a second time, but a few years down the line. The acting is inspired, and the faces of the actors will be impressed on your mind for some time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book during the summer, and then my book club selected it as our September book, so I read it again!  I really intended to only hit the highlights on this second read, but I was immediately pulled back into the story and probably enjoyed it even more as I watched the twists and turns develop.  It's a \\"he said, she said\\" concept, with more than the usual surprises.  Both main characters have major flaws and it is hard to work up much sympathy for either one...until...<br /><br />A chilling ending; I can recite the last few sentences by memory and shiver every time.  If you have read \\"Defending Jacob\\", it is equivalent to the sentence in that book--\\"And then the girl disappeared.\\"<br /><br />A rollicking two-time read for me--highly recommend to fans of both mystery and personal relationship genres.
B00993FEUK|2.0|Paranorman has its moments - but sadly without the minds of Tim Burton (James and the giant peach- Corps Bride,Frankenweenie),or Henery Selick (Nightmare before Christmas -Coraline) THE MOVIE LACKS HEART.This was well animated in some parts but looks rushed to make a fast buck.I love stop motion animation from King Kong to Frankenweenie but VERY SADLY this is a movie to skip because it is nothing like what we have seen in stop motion in the past-sloppy.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this cd.  Adele has an incredibly strong and powerful voice. The absolute best voice I have heard in a long long time. If you love a truely beautiful voice, singing fantastic music,look no further.  You won't be sorry.

B000FCKC4C|1.0|this book is dreadful. it is the emperor with no clothes on walking down the street all over again. only gullible people desperate to be mystical could enjoy it. it is a fraud. crap what more do you want me to say. mind your money.

B008ANFRGQ|5.0|In my honest opinion, this is Steve's most mature work to date.  When I told him that, he said, \\"I'm glad.  I'm 52.\\"  Yet to me, that's utilizing all 52 cards in the deck... and using all 52 white keys on a piano... operating on all eight octaves.<br /><br />In this 2nd installment of his Real Illusions concept trilogy, I was much more impressed than the 1st one... which I didn't quite care for (except of the song \\"Building the Church\\")... as it seemed like he was trying to do too much outside his wheelhouse of excellence.  In other words, the first one tried too many new toys.  This second one resonates just right though, and I highly recommend it.  It hits on all eight cylinders of a finely tuned touring machine.<br /><br />Interesting to me is that its liner notes tell of this being a multi-layered melange based upon the amplified exaggerations of a truth-seeking madman who sees the world through his own distorted perceptions.  What I find fascinating about that is that 13 years ago, 2 months after I spent 9 homeless months in LA trying to get an agent for my screenplay titled \\"Distortions,\\" I met Steve Vai here near Detroit and told him about this screenplay of mine that puts a supernatural presence in mirrors that can show us our inner truth in the mirror's reflection when we need a sign to change towards our destiny.  I then asked him if I could play percussion in his band someday and had him sign the only CD I didn't/wouldn't sell during those desperate days - \\"Passion and Warfare.\\"<br /><br />So with that screenplay now published as an Amazon eBook for the Kindle, and having met Steve 3 days ago on the last day of summer 2012 with his EVO Experience here near Detroit, I'm honored to have told him face-to-face how grateful I am that his music kept me alive during those dark days... now with 22 eBooks published... and that I consider him to be \\"The Rachmaninoff of Rock (Guitar).\\"<br /><br />He smiled and said, \\"I'll have to remember that one.\\"<br />He should... simply because it's true.<br />The Story of Light simply rules!<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Brian Shell<br />[[ASIN:B004CYF3V6 Distortions]]. simply because it's true.<br />The Story of Light simply rules!<br /><br />Warm regards,<br />Brian Shell<br />[[ASIN:B004CYF3V6 Distortions]]
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a well-written novel (considering the narrator is a dog). Having grown up with a dog in the family all of my life, I found myself sort of understanding and believing Enzo's point-of-view throughout the book which made it all the more real to me. Although the main plot of the novel is quite sad and heart-wrenching, I thought Stein did a thorough job of portraying the real meaning of family and the unanswerable wonders of human life. I also think that the author weaved in some underlying life morals, possibly comparing life to Danny's profession (racing). Whether it was intended or not, that's how I interpreted some of his text. Overall, I really enjoyed reading The Art of Racing in the Rain, and would recommend it to anyone who loves a little bit of heart warming and humor in regards to family, love and loyalty. Also, if you have a dog it really might make you look at them differently and maybe even give them a little bit more respect and love than you already do.
0812993292|4.0|From page 11;<br /><br />\\"Harold glanced in at people's windows, and sometimes they were empty, and sometimes people were staring right back at him and he felt obliged to rush on.  Sometimes, though, there was an object that he didn't expect; a porcelain figure, or a vase, and even a tuba.  The tender pieces of themselves that people stake as boundaries against the outside world.\\"<br /><br />You know by now from reading the other reviews, that Harold sets out on a walking journey to find his long lost friend Queenie before she dies. But with each step Harold takes, he is setting out on his own journey to understand his past and how he became such a fearful and timid person.<br /><br />Each step brings Harold closer to the truth and propels him forward to have a second chance at life.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and quirky story of a man on a mission to find himself, all under the guise of finding Queenie.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|I read every book Phillipa Gregory writes and am never disappointed. This is one her best and reads like a modern depiction of greed and power, which goes to prove that basic human nature is evident throughout history. It is a revealing account of the struggle among royalty to maintain supremacy at all costs, including murder and mayhem. The author manages to make history come alive with colorful accounts of researched facts of personal foibles and warring factions, interwoven with dates and events which would otherwise simply be another dry accounting of history. A must read and difficult to put down. I look forward to her next one as they all seem to get better and better.

At first I was put off by the \\"requirement\\" to read a book about Iran. this is a very enjoyable read and lets you in on the insights of Iranian culture. by the end of the read I was more and more in depth with main character, Marjane and it was one of the highlights of my homework!

0062011847|4.0|Sam Vimes, commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, has never been on Holiday.  His wife, Lady Sybil, convinces him to take the family to her ancestral home in the country.  Sam has never been away from the city and is like a fish out of water.  He doesn't understand the servants, all the towns' folk see him as the enemy and the upper class want him out of their jurisdiction.  If there is one thing Sam is it's a good copper and he can tell a crime has been committed in the shire, he just has sniff it out.  What is does find are goblins, a species considered to be vermin, but they turn out to be much more.<br /><br />I like the Sam Vines character.  He is tough and totally devoted to justice.  Sam can't understand the difference between the classes.  To him everyone is equal, which isn't true in the country where you have the upper class, the serving class, and the poor workers.  What he really can't take is discrimination because of appearance and cultural differences.  He has the most diverse City Watch on Disc World.  Sam has hired trolls, dwarves, vampires and werewolves, as long as they are good coppers he doesn't care what they look like or how they act.  So when he becomes aware of the plight of the goblins he is ready to fight to improve their situation.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the City Watch Disc World books in general.  I can't connect with the characters.  This book was different because it was mostly Sam Vines, Lady Sybil and Young Sam and it took place outside of Ankh-Morpork.  Of course like all the books in this series the story is funny, but I also felt for the goblins.  Terry Pratchett is very good at relating social issues in a humorous manner.  I enjoyed reading this installment in the series.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Look, none of these movies have been very good, but they are fun, fairly faithful to the books, and  filled with very attractive (and a few even talented) actors.<br /><br />The negatives are easy to harp on (startlingly mediocre special effects, incredibly cheesy dialogue, crazily short scenes and timing that seemingly goes awry), but the question is one for each moviegoer: are you on board for the ride?<br /><br />If you are, you are going to enjoy it; the movie moves along, explores the big emotions of love and jealousy, and it is a critical part of the overall Twilight experience.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good movie and aren't really part of the Twilight universe, my guess is that you won't really enjoy it that much.<br /><br />But if you are the latter, why are you watching the fourth movie?<br /><br />I am looking forward to the final installment.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|My last review, I believe, was The Nines with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa McCarthy. It was a perfect example of the ego Hollywood often indulges themselves in as they think they create a masterpiece, when, in fact, they create the thing I dislike most about Hollywood, besides their incessant awards for themselves, and their complete love of themselves. The Nines was a totally self-involved mess.<br /><br />I expected the same thing from Black Swan when I settled in to watch what I thought would be another self-loving example of the constant hubris we have to suffer through when we expect something excellent and truly perfect because of the reviews we read not just from other people like us, but those reviewers who actually make a career of opining about movies and often (in my opinion again) get it completely wrong. I decided to sit right down while still reeling from the waves of emotion that rolled around me over and over again throughout this absolutely amazing movie! Yes, I am surprised. THIS is what we expect to experience from the Hollywood community when we take the time, pay our money and expect to become immersed in a tightly wound emotional roller coaster like Black Swan, or something else brilliant because they spend so much money putting these entertainment pieces together for us. This movie is simple in its presentation, but devastating in its production.<br /><br />Black Swan is the story of one girl's dark journey as she is suddenly given the title role of Odette, the White Swan in the ballet, Swan Lake, along with the role of the White Swan's evil alter ego, Odile, the Black Swan. The young lady who had the part was replaced by our dancer and the underlying reason is that the other girl had simply gone over that imaginary line we know exists in performing in the Entertainment Industry that one becomes simply too old to be visually effective enough to fulfill the expectations of particularly sensitive Hollywood upper management. The part is extremely nuanced and taxing, almost as though the dancer is experiencing a manic-depressive episode. The part would be difficult for a very skilled ballet dancer. For a dancer with great but untested potential, the part could and does create an intense schism.<br /><br />Natalie Portman is no doubt one of Hollywood's brightest stars. She seems to stay under the radar, living a somewhat normal life, but managing to pick very good roles as she makes her way along the barbs and shards of glass laid own for anybody who tries to make it to the top of the heap in a city full of people who love no one more than themselves. Her portrayal of Nina Sayers, the young girl suddenly thrust into the spotlight in an extremely stressful role, is about as close to perfect as I think I have ever seen in a movie such as this from the Hollywood crowd. She manages to confuse everyone, the director of the play, the other dancers, even the young lady who plays who we think is the antagonist, Lily, portrayed by Mila Kunis who herself is excellent, but almost gets lost next to Ms. Portman's fantastic portrayal of Nina as she sinks lower and lower into her mental crisis of faith in herself to pull this performance off. Most of all, she manages to confuse us, the audience, as we can't help but be pulled into her vortex of self doubt and paranoia as the rehearsals continue up until Nina's first performance as the White/Black Swan. *******SPOILER ALERT********** Read no further if you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know what ensues from this point. I found my own heart pounding as she gets ready for her performance. We see her taunted by Lily, telling her she can't do it, her own mother (played wonderfully by the always amazing and terribly underrated Barbara Hershey) is genuinely terrified in the few scenes we see her in. The drama played out in Nina's dressing room between scenes is nearly as frightening as living through the performance itself.<br /><br />To say I was blown away by this movieis putting it mildly. As I wished I could have given The Nines a minus 100, I wish I could give Black Swan a plus 100 for making it into my top ten favorite movies of all time. Perhaps it is because I went into it with no expectations that this movie moved me in a way a Hollywood movie hasn't touched me in a very long time. I, too, was terrified for young Nina as she entered the stage and pulled off this performance with camera work so astounding, I felt like I was actually living inside of the ballet WITH Nina.<br /><br />I rarely find a movie as dark and serious and dramatic as Black Swan anything but a downer and usually try to avoid them. But there was something that drew me to this movie. Due to the fact that our nearest movie theater is 45 minutes away and for one reason or another, I was unable to rent it until this weekend when I added HBO to my line-up simply to watch Game of Thrones, Season Two and Season Five of True Blood (my apologies to Amazon.com - PLEASE do not pull this review because if you had it in your line-up of movies offered to rent, I would have seen it already, but you don't so, this isn't my fault. In fact, it's SO good, if you had it, I would buy it and add it to my growing Video Library collection through you!).<br /><br />Black Swan, in my opinion, which, of course, is always relative, is a rare gem of pure genius from the realm of the self-loving Hollywood crowd. It is what we go to the movies for - pure, unadulterated, nearly perfect entertainment. Now after reading this, it probably won't live up to someone else's expectations, which is par for the course. But DO watch this movie if you love ballet, enjoy a great psychological thriller, a seriously crazy twist at the end which I sure did not see coming, and some truly amazing performances from some of the best performers Hollywood has to offer. This movie is why I am a movie addict. I can't remember the exact saying, but one has to kiss a lot of frogs to finally find that perfect gem that makes it all worth it.is putting it mildly.

B002V092M4|5.0|The first in Le Carre's Smiley trilogy, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is not a spy novel. It is a novel that has spies in it. The prose is contemplative and subtle, the characters frightfully english a la Cambridge in the thirties. They are mostly older now, and what we see running throughout the book is disappointment. The heady years of world war II are over, the cold war is in full swing and we discover that more than one of the idols of that heroic time have feet decidedly made of clay. This is a bona fide work of literature - the themes are universal and touchingly revealed, the writing clever and contemplative and the verisimilitude of the world of Smiley and his shadowy confederates convincingly drawn. A delightful surprise for those who have been dismissing Le Carre through years of seeing him in airport bookshops.

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest and was very excited to finally see an Android-based app that I could use on my Kindle Fire (I've been awfully jealous of my friends with iPads who could pin with ease using the Apple app).  Unfortunately, the app is very glitchy.  Pretty much every other time I open the app, it freezes and I have to force close it and try again.  It is very slow (though, to be fair, downloading photos on websites on the Kindle Fire is slow in general, so this may not be the fault of the app).  I hope that the bugs will be fixed with an update soon, as I really do enjoy using the app when it works properly.  It is user friendly and pretty easy to understand. Once it is fixed, I'd definitely give it four or five stars.

In City of Bones both Clary and Jace must find a way to get back the Mortal cup from Valentine and deal with the heartache thrown their way.<br /><br />After Jace is put on lockdown because of his connection Valentine the latter takes the opportunity to steal the Mortal Sword, the second Mortal Instrument.<br /><br />City of Ashes starts off a little slow but halfway through picks up drastically. All of the adventures and battles in this book are as badass as the characters. The secondary characters have their moments in the book and you quickly get attached to them. You get to see a little more of Alec and his growing relationship with Magnus. You meet Maryse and Robert Lightwood and all though you dislike them at first a little after a while you can't help but admire there love for their children. All of their children. Simon comes to terms with the changes he is experiencing and see him grow as a stronger character. We also meet the Inquistor, Imogen, who is hell bent on getting her revenge on Valentine, at all cost. And of course there is Luke and his growing parental authority and protection of not only Clary but Jace as well.<br /><br />While dealing with all the things going around them Jace and Clary must learn to accept their new lives and learn to deal with the consequences of being offspring's of Valentine. They must also deal with trying to avoid the feelings they have for each other when people around them are hell bent in making it impossible.<br /><br />I have to admit I didn't enjoy COA the first time around so didn't get too far. What a mistake! After getting past the rough patch I was quickly consuming every page. I even found myself crying tears at the end of this book and then wanting to shake the characters and smack them (you will have to read).

B001NLL93W|5.0|\\"People aren't born good or bad. Maybe they're born with tendencies either way, but its the way you live your life that matters.\\"<br /><br />In the third installment of The Mortal Instruments we finally get the answers to all of our questions. Are Clary and Jace really related? Is Jace really as evil as Valentine? Does Jocelyn wake up? Why are Jace and Clary so powerful? And so many more.<br /><br />City of Glass starts off a couple of weeks after its predecessor, City of Ashes. The Lightwood's have been summoned back to Alicante. Clary is set to find the potion to wake her mother from her coma. Everything is set. But Jace has other plans...<br /><br />In City of Glass we start off with Jace trying to keep Clary safe from his father Valentine and the Clave. But things don't' turn out as planned. When Jace is forced to leave New York and bring along Simon, the story begins to unravel for him.<br /><br />On the other hand, Clary being her usual stubborn self and not liking that the Lightwoods and Jace have left her behind, creates a rune to open a portal to Alicante. What she doesn't expect is Luke coming along for the ride. After arriving in Alicante a series of events are set in motion and we are taken on the adventure of a lifetime!<br /><br />Let me sum up a couple of things that stood out to me in City of Glass:<br />1. Clary's stubbornness- Although at times she was a little rash in her decision I liked that she wasn't letting anyone push her around. She was pretty badass as well.<br />2. Jace punishing himself because of who his \\"father\\" is-It was heart-wrenching seeing how Jace continued to feel like he was a monster and push all the people that loved him away. Finally when things are revealed you can't help but love Jace even more than what you already have.<br />3. Alec finally growing a backbone- During the series Alec was not one of my favorite characters. To me he seemed whiny and annoying. That changed when he began to finally just be himself and also a leader of the Lightwood children. And when he finally saw what was in front of him.<br />4. Magnus's help to bring Jocelyn back-His devotion to helping Alec and the gang was immense. I loved Magnus from book 1 and I'm glad he was a constant in each book.<br />5. Luke's undying devotion to helping and protecting Clary- I LOVE LOVE Luke! He was, after Jace, by far my favorite character in this series. His love for everything and everyone concerning Clary and Jocelyn was heartwarming. He was sweet, attentive, protective, authoritative and everything else an adult figure should be.<br />6. Jocelyn's history with Valentine- Finally being able to fully understand the background of Valentine and the Circle was very information and answered many of our questions. Although Jocelyn doesn't play a huge part in the series he story was the most helpful.<br />7. The slight glimpses into Valentines \\"nice\\" side- We all expect the villain to be incredibly evil, and although Valentine is that, we got to see little glimpses of how he was in the beginning. He was a man with a vision, consumed with jealousy and power.<br />8. The Clave- I enjoyed finally getting to finally see what all the fuss and hype was about the all knowing Clave. It turns out they aren't all knowing. And some are not people that should lead the Shadowhunter community.<br />9. Clary/Jace/Sebastian triangle- Although there really wasn't a romantic triangle there was a triangle. The introduction of Sebastian was an interesting one and one that I didn't see coming until about a quarter into the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the action that was in this book, from the fighting scenes to the history of Valentine's Circle. All of our questions are finally answered as well as new ones arising. New characters are introduced that are a huge part of the story and one that will have everyone on the tip of their seats. The devotion of all the characters is endless.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered my about City of Glasswas the new questions that arise at the end. I look forward to reading more of the books but hope that the series isn't dragged on and that Clary and Jace aren't thrown into another whirlwind dilemma.<br /><br />With all that said. If you enjoy paranormal action packed books, romances, and paranormal beings, pick up The Mortal Instruments. You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />[....]t hope that the series isn't dragged on and that Clary and Jace aren't thrown into another whirlwind dilemma.    With all that said.

076115678X|5.0|The Curly Girl Handbook is all about how to properly take care of naturally curly or wavy hair.  I found some great insights while reading the first chapter like the preference for straight hair is a subtle form of racism and that 65% of women have curly hair. Yet most hair products are made for women with straight hair and thousands of hair straighteners are sold every year. I felt a big shift in attitude as I was reading about my own curly hair and how I should accept my hair (and ultimately me) for who I am and stop trying to change myself. I related a lot to the stories of women throughout the book that felt different and ugly. There's a quiz at the beginning of the book to help you find out if you need a paradigm shift in your life. I answered yes to half of the questions. I didn't think it would be that many. I answered yes to things like almost always being unhappy with the way my hair looks, having constant frizz, and blow-drying my hair then not washing it for a week. I dog-eared so many pages of this library book and referred to it so much that I went ahead and bought it. I refer a lot to the homemade hair product recipes and I want to try them all.  So far, I've only made the Lavender Water to spritz your hair to recurl it and I love it.<br /><br />The book helps you identify your curl type and the specific hair-care routine that goes along with it. I have wavy hair! I have always wanted wavy hair like Megan Fox and I have wished for the longest time to find some way to harness my pretty waves.  I'm going to grow my hair out again and I'm feeling more pretty and confident every day. I thought it was so funny how she describes hair stylists straightening girl's hair for a special occasion and then curling it with a curling iron. That's how my hair was done for my wedding!<br /><br />The writing is kind of cheesy. The author sticks in the words \\"curl\\" \\"mane\\" and \\"hair\\" in lots of places that they don't belong. And there was a lot of focus on long curly hair- not a lot of extra tips for short curly hair. But other than that I love this book.  I've stuck to this hair-care method for 4 months now.  I love that I don't have to worry so much about my hair.  It's looking better and better every day.<br /><br />Major changes I made from reading this book:<br /><br />*No brushing.  I go through my hair with my fingers while it has conditioner in while I'm showering instead of brushing.<br />*Use a t-shirt instead of a towel to dry my hair.  A towel will catch and pull your curls apart and make it frizzy and dry.<br />*No shampoo. I used conditioner instead of shampoo for a month.  I use sulfate free shampoo now because my hair type does well with it.<br />*Use gobs of conditioner.  Curly hair is dry and that's why it will frizz out - it's trying to get moisture.  Use lots of conditioner to moisturize it and your hair will be curly instead of frizzy.<br />*Use the right products.  I use alcohol free gel in my hair, silicone-free conditioner and sulfate-free shampoo.<br /><br />If you have naturally curly hair, you need to read this book!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is my third Nicolas Sparks book and I have to say that unlike the others The Lucky One took me awhile to get into.<br /><br />After Logan Thibault finds a picture or a beautiful girl, while on tour in Iraq, he is called Lucky by his friends. As Logan suffers the lost of fellow friends he sticks to his belief that the picture is not lucky. But something prevents him from parting from it. After five years, because of a friend, he decides to find the girl in the picture. When he finally finds her Logan will learn what his destiny is.<br /><br />Elizabeth is struggling to take care of her nana, her nana's farm, being a teacher, being single parent and trying to put up with her ex-husband crap. She wishes for the love and comfort of someone else but isn't hopeful. She doesn't know that her life is about to change.<br /><br />When Logan starts to work on nana's farm he isn't looking to fall in love with the girl in the picture. As Logan spends time with Ben, Elizabeth's son, and her nana, she starts to warm up to him. After finding that spending time with Logan is peaceful and comforting Elizabeth starts to fall in love with him. Logan realizes that he's always been in love with the girl in the photo. But Logan is keeping secrets from Elizabeth and she can't understand why. Until Clayton, her ex intervenes...<br /><br />Clayton doesn't care about anyone but himself. And he wants Elizabeth as a friend with benefits. He doesn't want another man around his ex-wife or son and will do anything to make sure it stays that way. To top it off, Clayton hates Thibault with a passion. When he discovers Logan's secret Clayton quickly shares it with Elizabeth hoping that he would be her shoulder to cry on and in the process hook up with her. Things don't work out that way.<br /><br />As we take a trip down Logan's life you learn of all the good and bad that happen in a Marine's life. Although life in the Marines was filled with very sad times, I enjoyed reading them and many times caught myself in tears. I found myself enjoying the flashbacks more than the present. The only thing in the present I enjoyed was Zeus, Logan's dog companion, and Ben. Ben was enjoyable to read about especially the times he spent with Logan and Zeus.<br /><br />The love story is wonderful but the love between the characters themselves was very flat. I wished that they had more interactions and there were more dialogue instead of so many 3rd person monologues. Because of that I had to give The Lucky One 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />[...]enjoying the flashbacks more than the present.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is one of the finest apps on the market. I love the audio aspect and the ease  it offers in getting God word on a daily basis.
B00622BF40|4.0|A modern classic, especially if you love Dancing With The Stars.  It's cute and hilarious.  One of the characters reminds me of head judge Lynn Goodman.

B00701QRI6|5.0|I 1972 I was feeling a little down. We had moved several times around aL.A. and I always had trouble making new friends because I was a little different (I still am). My dad, sensing I was a little down, took me to the record store. We went to buy the sound track to Mad Dogs and Englishment but discovered that the new Santana album was out. We bought it immediately and the record store gave me a press pack for the film instaed. We also bought Grand Funk's Survival album. I don't think I've ever heard it to this day. I played Santana three thru to the other side and then bought a new one every couple of years.<br />It always takes me back to the days of the Drive in movie when my dad would give me drum lessons in the car before the movie started. I learned those rhythems inside and out and those were the best days of my life. I also learned to love Clint Eastwood movies, saw the new one yesterday. He's a wonderful story teller.<br />Anyway, it's my all time favorite Sanatana album followed closely by Moonflower.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book. This guy is a true hero. It's the media and the politicians that are saying this guy is unpatriotic that are the traitors to this country.
B004FQX59I|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT AND VERY DETAILED MOVIE THAT DEFINITELEY PROVES THAT PROVES THAT J F KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED BY THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL CIA COMPLEX.  AMEN

B007J4T2G8|5.0|An Interesting and intriguing read.  You will fall in love with Grey and understand his effect on Ms. Steele.  I read it in less than a week, even with the busy sked i have.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|must say she has a lovely voice wife really loves this album.A 1 buy great addition to any music library
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Clockwork Angels is Rush at their best. I was very happy to hear a return to their roots with strong guitars and powerful drums. As always, the lyrics are a bit...intellectual to say the least. The digital booklet contains fantastic \\"steampunk\\" art. This was my first Amazon digital album purchase. I have to say the process was seamless to integrate the music with my iTunes and Google Music applications, and the sound quality blows away anything I have purchased from iTunes.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book seems to me is more for women than men.  It is also extremely repetitive with only the locale for the \\"action\\" changing.  I doubt I will read the other two books of the trilogy.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I never read military novels. With 23 years of service, I have had enough. I was, however, drawn to this, and I was not disappointed. It is not just about the killing of bin Laden, though I imagine that's what most come for, it is about Seal Team Six and the people who are drawn to this work. They are a special breed, and I'm glad we have them. This was just a joy to read, and I feel inclined to look at another about the Seals. Any suggestions from those that liked this would be appreciated.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of my childhood when we would go to the fair and play this game.love it!<br />Now I can play it anytime.
B007MD2RHC|5.0|I work at a High School and was charged with finding an epic song to play in the background for a \\"Day in the Life\\" video.  I had just watched the Cloud Atlas Trailer and something had stuck with me.  I tracked down the composer and it led me to this album.  Using the track Remember Me in the video fit perfectly and some of the staff watching actually got teary eyed.  The rest of the album will probably get used in other videos as well.  Great music!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app is very simple and quick to use. I will recommend this to anybody cos its handy and very simple to use.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|The tales and ballads told in these latest songs by Bob Dylan are some of the best in his musical career. His voice may be getting more gravely with age but the powerful and poetic words that Dylan puts to music bring the stories to life and make you want to listen to them again and again to pick up on all the details he writes into his music. Whether it's a winsome tale of woe or a jivey up-best contemporary beat you will enjoy the music on this CD. A definite must-have CD for Dylan fans; but those who have never enjoyed the creative stories of Bob Dylan will be glad they bought this CD to experience one of our most talented lyricist and musicians!!!! Worth every penny of the price.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pintrest. you can spend hours getting inspired and learning how to do many things. there seems to be a few glitches in the app. sometimes it has a hard time loading, but overall I like it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The movie of The Lorax carries a very powerful message about taking care of the planet that all of us share and live upon. It also delivers a message about what greed and self-centeredness can do to impact everyone. The famous Truffula trees are back in this movie along with all those great hilarious animals that Dr. Seuss always used to tell his stories. A good family movie which can become the springboard for some discussions about ecology and selfishness. And you can't help but recognize some of the characters' voices done by Taylor Swift, Betty White, Danny DeVito, Ed Helms, and many others. This one will be one that your children will want to watch again and again because of the well done animation and the entertaining music in the movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app for Android hit a home run for my daily needs. Kudos to YouVersion. User interface is easy to use, and customizable. The scriptures are translated in many languages, and there are a bounty of reading plans to choose, and can be shared via Facebook and Twitter. Thumbs up!
B006P0FIB0|5.0|Do you ever watch a remake where you say to yourself \\"that's not the way it's supposed to be!\\"  Well, not this movie, it's exactly what the three musketeers is supposed to be.  It's funny, it's dramatic, it's silly, it's the whole feel of the old movie. How refreshing!  Our grandkids thought it was weird for a sword fight movie, the problem with the young generation, everything has to be blood and gore,  and really does the good guy  win much anymore, can you even tell who the good guy is half of the time?  How often do we go to see a movie and leave with kind of a sick feeling.  Watching this show gave us one of those feel good moments, the way the old musketeers made you feel, when it was over we just felt like smiling.  Bravo.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great way to pass the time. easy to play. coins come every 30 seconds. better than the real game. get when its a faotd
B0079WAZVG|5.0|\\"Criminal Minds\\"  Season 7 continues to deliver the high quality episodes you have come to expect from this show. The ensemble cast is a tight knit group that has only gotten better over time. This season is no exception.

If you are new to this series and enjoy a good dramatic program, you will find it all here, in \\"Criminal Minds\\".

B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a retired Navy Chief and former Cryptologic Technician, I found his book to be outstanding. It is one of the best books I have read. I put it on par with James Patterson's books of which I have read all of them. I found it hard to put the book down.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Absolutely awesome movie. Worth every penny. I am retired Navy, and enjoyed the movie for what it is: winning through never accepting defeat.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent story telling. Read it now before the movie comes out. It has already been optioned by Ridley Scott. Destined for Sci-Fi greatness. I really enjoyed it.

B004X80QNG|1.0|This company is deceptive about the app's ability to synch with a Kindle Fire.  It doesn't work.  After using it on my iPhone for a year and loving it, I am very disappointed that they don't make this more clear.  I'm going to find an app that will work on both devices I use and delete this piece of crap.<br /><br />- disgusted in NC
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It's rare to find a book about Special Operations written by an actual Operator.  Operator is the politically correct term for everybody that works in the trade of special warfare and intelligence gathering.  I read the book in part because I wanted to get a first person perspective on what it's like to be a Seal and I also wanted to know about the raid that killed UBL.  The portrayal of life as a special operator I really enjoyed.  The author gave a first-person, first-hand account of what it's like to carry out different special operation missions.  He didn't glamorize war or killing.  He carries out his missions with his operators simply because the operations need doing.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book is the UBL raid.  This was where I was truly looking cold hard facts and details.  The author supplies plenty of details about the raid, just like he does about the previous missions.  Unfortunately after reading it just once I find it hard to believe that much of the raid hasn't been rewritten. In the initial planning for the raid Mark Owen says that he was placed on one of three teams that would assault the Bin Laden compound.  His team's primary job was to clear the guest house which he does.  Afterwards the author is seen in several different places.  He is in a chicken coop, then on the bottom floor of the compound and then on the top floor of the compound not long after the first rounds have been put into UBL.  It just seems to convenient that the first team, was delayed getting into the compound.  The first team is supposedly delayed enough getting into the compound that the third team is able to enter the compound first and catch up to the first team.  The third team is also the one that had to deal with getting out of a crashed helicopter.  Mark also says that he was not moving the fastest after getting out of the crashed chopper.  There are just too many inconsistencies for me to believe that this is what actually happened on the UBL raid.  Everything else is believable.  I believe that the author may have bragged and exaggerated about his role in the mission.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I have read only The first book and I found it very exciting and breathtaking. I consider that there are parts very sad and cruel, especially where they kill each other.
B0063IH60K|5.0|tyvm for game being fun and not easy all the time. u can take from the ace piles to make all piles work most of the time :-)
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|A must read for those who are interested in observing and understanding complicated, family life situations and dramas, which result in the creation a whole host of enduring childhood traumas.  This intense story reveals what PTSD - Post Tramatic Stress Disorder in children can look like, and how PTSD and unexpected circumstances impact the shape the young adult personality, as well as - emotionally, spiritually, and their individual world view.  Gripping throughout....
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed the inside workings (those not secret) from the SEAL prospective. I personally know a SEAL and know their work is so very necessary. They risk a great deal for us and this account made me appreciate them even more.
1607053888|3.0|This book is full of great designs but the instructions are confusing.  I have been sewing and pattern making professionally for several years and I found her instructions poorly written.  The provided patterns are a jumbled mess.  If you are looking for inspiration on some new bags to make and can figure out how to create them yourself then this book has some nice ideas but the price is too high for what you will get out of it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this seris. Can't get enough and plan to buy the Season 2 when it comes out in January.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|Great Album and who doesn't LOVE Bon Jovi??!!  Love every song.  Listen to \\"It's My Life\\" every single day at least once.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Much like transformers but not as well done or as sexy. Still, fun to watch, especially with surround sound.  Potential is there for a sequel.
B0087HT36U|3.0|i have never had to rate a game before to play its final level but that is what they are asking me to do which is probably why this game has so many reviews.
B005USZYDU|3.0|A fun read, but not one of Grisham's best.  I'll still look for more of Grisham's works to read in the future.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|Very pleased -- the discs appear to be brand new and the inner case also. The outer case is a little scuffed, but not a big deal.

B00005TQKQ|3.0|This product will clean a video head but don't rewind till you are at the end for maximum life of the head cleaner!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked this one the best out of the trilogy because it all tied together and you finally find out what happens at the end. The other 2 books were needed to get to this book but I felt like this book was the most interesting. The overall trilogy is extremely far fetched (as in the sexual details and ALL of the events that happen to the characters) but the overall love story is worth reading.
B008XG1X18|4.0|not too bad of an app. works well if you want a quick look at pinterest.  not so great at the pinning and repinning of pictures.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so good, I could not put it down.  I finished reading and immediately purchased the next two books in the trilogy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is great. I love looking for new ideas and projects to try. I have gotten many of my friends and family addicted to this app
B00932A5QA|5.0|Loved the book, the original movie, and this one.  Didn't see ST2.  I really enjoy the CGI.  It removes the overhead of bad acting, and political correctness (an oxymoron), and allows me to focus on the story which in this case is a good one.
B008XG1X18|3.0|love pintrest but many times on my kindle it will not open. I have to force close it and try 2 or 3 times then it works. once open it works great and is easyto navigate.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I have learned a tremendous amount from this book.  I teach students who are at risk in a small school district.  This book's insights have given me much to think about as far as what motivates these students.  I want to read more about this.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I my kindle and love pinterest! if only it would work... lots of issues, doesn't work, error messages. please please fix!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I know some are going to want to smack me for this, but I enjoyed this book better then I did 50 Shades. Don't get me wrong 50 is good, but this book had so much more depth to it. And the writing was amazingly better. The characters Eva and Gideon are so wrong for each other that they are perfect for one another.<br /><br />The story, emotions, sex, love, etc that the author details draws you in to the point that you are holding your breath waiting for the next thing to happen. It is never boring.<br /><br />I can't wait for the second novel in this series.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is being presented as a first book.  This is hard to believe.  The writing style of the trilogy is easy to read.  The story through all three books grips you and is hard to put down.  The buzz is that it is chick lit but it is a lot more. The deeper psychological unraveling of Christian's healing is fascinating and draws you along in empathy with the characters.<br />Previous reviews made much of the repetitiveness of the sexual scenes but it is so well presented that it will only trouble you if you are looking for something to criticise.<br />If you want to read the books for the erotica, go ahead but you may discover more, you will enjoy well written novels.<br />I am sure EL James did not try to write classical novels where the prose is very good but you fall asleep before you get to the plot.  Neither did she write for the school prescribed books list.  She wrote to entertain and to enlighten.  The subjects she touches on are so well presented almost as if she writes from experience. Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book grabs you from the first page and never lets you go. It has enough twists and turns to keep you reading way too late into the night. Just when you think you know who the villan is, the author leads you to another conclusion. Can't wait to read more by Gillian Flynn.
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|Very dissappointed in the case. Mainly because the Kindle cannot remain in the case while reading. Loved the green leather my regular Kindle had. Wish the fire fit in it. I would have returned it.{Still in plastic wrap}but could not find paperwork, In addition, I live at the beach and cannot use the Kindle Fire due to the glare. MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|but it freezes a lot. I wish I was able to use this app without having to constantly &quot;force close &quot; and reboot in the middle of pinning.
0385344333|3.0|The first book in my original kindle from years back is a Jack Reacher novel and I have long been a fan. But looking at the polarity of reviews on this one, I almost passed but felt I owed it a read. The criticisms are just - the book has long boring stretches, the number games get old real fast, and it is repetitive in places. (Are there really that many folks that know the area code, population, size in square miles and ranking in GDP of most major metro areas?) The story gets a bit convoluted in places and it did not seem the ending jelled properly, but there are the moments that Reacher is known for that made it worth reading, so I'm, coming down in the middle with a 3 star rating.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I started Cassandra Clare's Infernal Devices series and really enjoyed Clockwork Angel and Clockwork Prince, so I thought I'd start the Mortal Instruments and give those a try.  The first was very entertaining and featured modern day angels and a gifted orphan like the Infernal's series.  Likable characters and plenty of action.  Will be reading the next very soon.
B008CP92ZO|1.0|I think there is exactly 40 minutes of decent film here, the rest looks like they were literally making it up as they went along. You can tell that some scenes were being improvised on the spot and they made the final cut, which tells you something... Like I said, there is 40 minutes of good stuff here, funny stuff, but the rest of the sheeyit that was interspersed into the film made it hard to watch. Literally. There were some scenes where my friends and I were asking each other \\"what the eff is going on here? I can't stand this anymore, can I fast forward past this to the next scene?\\" extremely disappointing, especially when considering the talent that was cast. Oh well, at least I didn't waste $12 in the theatres on this dreck.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works much better than trying to pin through the browser on my kindle fire.... and is it just me, or have they improved this app from when it was first released?
1452110581|5.0|I took one look at this book, rolled my eyes, and thought, \\"Jeez, not another stupid book full of cute cat photos and saccharin-sweet inane text.  When will they stop putting out this crap?  Why do people buy it?\\"<br /><br />I picked it up anyway and started reading from a random page.  When I was done, I turned to my companion and gave a dramatic reading.  I flipped to another page, and then another.  I immediately bought a copy for a friend as a birthday present, but gave it to her only after I'd read it from cover to cover and committed a couple of the pieces to memory.<br /><br />\\"Why Are You Screaming?\\" is a masterpiece, but \\"Seriously?\\" is my favorite.<br /><br />I must say that I remain slightly skeptical about it being written by cats.  The whole opposable thumb thing just seems like a big limitation.
B005LAII80|5.0|I don't have much to add other than to say that it's unique, awesome, fun, funny, ultra-violent, absolutely true to the source material, and you're going to kick yourself for not seeing it on the big screen when you had the chance.  A throwback to the edgy, modestly budgeted renegade cinema of Carpenter, Cronenberg, Verhoeven, et al.  Think: Robocop + Escape From New York + Mad Max + The Raid.  Didja like alla them?  Love alla them?  Than odds are you'll flip for this too.  GO SEE IT!  (Or if you're reading this a few months down the line) GET IT! WATCH IT! LOVE IT!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a great pleasure to meet Christian and Ana and to be able and get lost amongst their passion. I found the action great through out this book. Wishing one day we could clone the good things about the very sexual Christian. Cant wait for the next.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|This story repeatedly surprised me with a completely unexpected turn of events<br />so that it had my interest from beginning to end.  It is a wonderful read<br />with interesting characters - some larger than  life but it takes nothing away<br />from the mystery  loved it as an absorbing read
B004PYDBVM|5.0|This book started slow. The introduction is not the story and the first chapter is just a set-up. When you get into the story, it pulls you in and you are constantly hoping that the protagonist gets out, but also realizing that thousands of people are still in that situation. The book still comes to my thoughts weeks later.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is his best book and character of Harry. Bosch jumps out and grabs you. Couldn't wait each night to open and read it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Just wish I could get more coins without using resl money. Refuse to spend real money. But it is fun and strangely addicting...
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom is one of our favorite games. We originally purchased the game as a DS for our grand daughter. After playing her game we went out and purchased one for ourselves. When we saw it was available for Kinddle Fire I ordered it as a surprise for my wife. She has had hours of enjoyment playing on her Kindle Fire. The action is so mush better on the Kindle Fire than the DS. Bob B
0345803485|5.0|Before reading this book, I read a number of the reviews.  I have to say that the reviews that stuck with me the most were how poorly written the books are and how essentially they are lacking in substance.  Of course, I knew the nature of the books and was aware of the content.<br /><br />Initially, when I first started reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I thought that it was like an adult Harlequin.  It didn't strike me as having much substance either.  Of course, you get swept up in the sexual relationship between Anastasia and Christian; but after finishing the book, I have to say that it is so much more.<br /><br />It strikes me that the book is reminiscent of most relationships between men and women.  There is always the inner turmoil, the doubts, the apprehension, the fear, the love, the desire, the passion.  There are the things that we dare not speak for we fear knowing the truth or we fear rejection.<br /><br />I'm reminded of a quote:  \\"You're only as safe as your secrets;\\" and let's face it, we all have secrets.  If we're not hiding something shameful that we don't want others to know, we are hiding the truth of who we are and what we really want.  Once again, one of our greatest human frailties is the fear of rejection, the fear of not being loved.  We all want to be loved.  It's an innate part of us all; and no matter what we do to build walls around our hearts, it's just something that cannot be denied.<br /><br />Anastasia struggles with self-confidence.  Christian struggles with fear.  Christian is the supposed dominant, but he's the weakest one of all.  While Anastasia struggles with loving someone that she doesn't feel worthy of, Christian struggles with loving someone that he doesn't feel worthy of.  While Anastasia feels the love, Christian tries to deny the love.<br /><br />And so the struggle continues.  It's the ever-evolving struggle of the relationship between a man and a woman.  It's representative of all relationships on one level or another.<br /><br />The very ending of this book is the unraveling of all the secrets and all the fears.  I have yet to read the subsequent novels but will most definitely be reading them soon.<br /><br />We are only human.  Despite the fact that this is our greatness, it is also our greatest weakness.  We struggle only to surrender; and sometimes, we just need to find that special someone, who can give us what we didn't know we needed.<br /><br />As a woman, I have always had to be a responsible person.  No one else was going to take care of me, so I had to do it myself.  This has made me very independent.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of weak men in the world; and I don't think there's anything sexier than a man that is strong enough for me to feel willing to relinquish control.  We all want freedom from control, and this freedom comes from letting go.<br /><br />It's never just about sex.  We are much more complicated than this.<br /><br />We all struggle to surrender.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Great action movie. I'd buy this one to watch over and over. Beautiful filming,realistic and just outright fun to watch. Totally got into this movie.
B0018QBAXG|5.0|Fly Away Home is a wonderful family film.  Great ending!  I have watched it several times with my grandchildren and they all love it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Amazing, thrilling, intelligent novel from beginning to end. I couldn't put it down and it had me on the edge of my seat.
067101756X|5.0|Mr Corso provides many facts and examples of what happened after the Roswell incident. I could not put it down.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The is a must see/own movie. As well as getting a digital copy, you get a free copy for your cloud, so you can watch on virtually any device you want.  I plan to buy the other two Hunger Games sequels when they come out as well.
B0044KU7KU|1.0|Well in short, not good at all, not my chemical romance style, if they felt like getting back to the basic's at least go back to decent music like three cheers.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A modern turn on 1984? The characters were well developed and the action never stopped.  This will most likley become a young reader classic.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|and I think they should at least warn you (big flashing red sign) that you will loose everything you had previously saved when you update!!!  I had so much important information saved in this program and I will never be able to re-create it unless the company has some special way of retrieving the data (which I doubt).  I never would have updated it had I known the repercussions.  I've always told people how nice this app is but now all I can tell them (and I tell everyone) is to get it off their machine or at least never update it (but why have a program if you can't take advantage of their updated versions that either fix bugs or are just improved).  This will also make me stay away from the company in general (in case they write other programs that do the same thing).  This truly sucks!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good book of the three. Just like the other two, it is very suspenseful, but also a bit out there. A lot of vivid information, and obviously it can not be true between two people. Overall I enjoyed the book.
B00448SE4S|5.0|This is a great film, very enjoyable. My husband and I can watch it over & over again and not get bored. It has everything you would want in a film: action, romance and comedy.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am not a fan of games, however, once I tried this game I became addictive. It forces you to be sharp and react very fast. Excellent application
1439153663|5.0|I don't usually write reviews because: A- I love books and usually enjoy every book to some degree, and B- because we all have our own opinions and I don't like to sway somebody one way or the other. That being said, I loved this book. The characters were so well drawn. I literally cried tears at least four times. It's a beautiful story, tragic, like most of American history is.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Fun movie to watch. Complex subject would require several movies to build great charcters and plots. Would be great as a movie series. Should build off this and make another movie.
0307341577|5.0|I started reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl on a recommendation in a magazine article. I couldn't put it down. I went on to read Dark Places and just finished Sharp Objects. Amazing books!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I thought the book was so hilarious.  A little too much football & Phil. Eagles towards the end, but well done!  The Dad is a character I wish would have changed for the better..
B001FJ2UQC|4.0|Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?<br />Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was so pleased with Gone Girl.. Been recommending to all of my friends who are trapped in the \\"50 shades \\" genre.  Get out!!
1402270275|5.0|Bec McMaster combines the very best of the old style vampire story with the faster pace of the more contemporary in her novel, Kiss of Steel. It's an entirely successful combination with the wonderfully eerie backdrop of London's Whitechapel district creating a detailed, yet, never distracting backdrop. Honoria Todd is a clever but believable (especially for the time period) main character...and `Blade' is both frightening and devastatingly attractive. This is a vastly different - yet somehow the same - London that we've imagined a thousand times as presented in the Victorian era, only ...this is a London with a culture of blood.<br /><br />Even though this will appeal to fans of the paranormal - the story isn't confined to realms of paranormal, nor predictable in any way. The Duke of Vickers is an unexpected dark force in this - so the story is vastly more than the trial between a vampire and his victim. There are the ever-present dangers of the dark side of London, the endless sensual appeal of \\"Blade\\".<br /><br />Indeed, Honoria must battle and barter for her own protection - little imagining how she is insidiously being snared along the way. On the other hand, it seems easy for her enemies to underestimate her. But, who is the enemy? Everyone, and no one - this is a complex tale and few things are as they seem.<br /><br />Kiss of Steel is more than a romance, and more than a vampire tale, although it will appeal to both. It's ultimately Honoria's story, her battle for triumph... or surrender. Riveting! Put it on your Must Read list.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! It made a very....um....pleasurable place for my imagination to visit! I read the trilogy and wish there were more books!
B0072OFM28|5.0|19.99 for this? why not its awsome, shipped really fast but anyone looking to by this needs to watch the earlier seasons I saw them a year or 2 ago and after watching the first episode I want to watch them over before going on it
B0044LEBY2|5.0|This 2-disc album contains all of the greatest John Williams film scores and themes. Everything I was looking for was included.<br /><br />There are also a few songs included that I do not care for, but this is not detrimental to the album's value as a whole. It's still an amazing collection of brilliant music. Well worth the price!
B008LY9AWG|1.0|Michael Connelly's Mulholland Dive wasn,t a complete story.  It fell well below his normal page grabbing murder mysteries that he normally writes.  A waste of time and money.
B000ZELISO|4.0|I'll start this off by saying that I loved the first two Harry Potter movies.  Then they made the unfortunate mistake in their replacements of director, composer, and Dumbledore over the next couple installments and I grew increasingly frustrated with the series.  They cut out important parts of the book to focus on things that didn't even happen!  How could they cut out the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth movie?!<br /><br />Anyway, the film series has gotten a bit better since then, but it's weird when I'm kinda happy that Dumbledore died in this movie... I really disliked Gambon in the role.  This one seems to take CGI and effects to a new level, to the detriment of other aspects of the movie and plot.  Still, if you're a fan of the series, get it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android is very handy for those free moments when waiting for an appointment. For times when I don't have the kindle with me, I can just read my book on the kindle app for android. I love this feature of my new phone.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|Featuring two of the cast members of Monty Python, this movie is bound to be a delight.  The lineup of Cleese, Palin, Kline, and Curtis make for a delightful couple of hours as they romp through this zany, somewhat vulgar, and hilarious plot.
B005LAII7G|5.0|The original \\"Judge Dredd\\" was released in 1995. Being eleven years old during its release may have contributed to its enjoyment, but there are definitely fond memories of \\"Judge Dredd\\" being a typical action movie that was over the top, had ridiculous humor, and was entertaining for the silly movie that it was. If there was a movie being released with a big name that was both big in size and in name like Sylvester Stallone then you pretty much knew what to expect back then. The downside was that it went down a different path than the source material; a mistake the remake \\"Dredd 3D\\" now hopes to rectify.<br /><br />In the slums of a futuristic city, judges have replaced the police with high tech weaponry and possess the combined powers of judge, jury, and instant executioner. Karl Urban (\\"Star Trek,\\" \\"The Chronicles of Riddick,\\" \\"Doom\\") is Dredd; the judge with the biggest and baddest reputation in the city who's perhaps known best for his untamed anger. Dredd is ordered to assess rookie judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and take her out in the field for a day; a sink or swim situation. But when they go to investigate a triple homicide at the Peach Trees city block, they're ambushed by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and the Ma-Ma clan.<br /><br />Upon seeing the trailers and TV spots for \\"Dredd 3D,\\" you probably noticed how similar it looks to \\"The Raid: Redemption.\\" Peach Trees, the 200-story city block in \\"Dredd 3D\\" is an awful lot like the 30-story tenement run by Tama in \\"The Raid: Redemption.\\" The surprising thing is \\"Dredd 3D\\" does its own thing and manages to be at least as good as \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" because of it.<br /><br />The humor is a lot more subtle this time around; it's usually very dry and closer to satire than the original \\"Judge Dredd.\\" The \\"hot shot,\\" \\"admirable,\\" Kay's (Wood Harris) fantasy about Anderson, and the bum at the entrance of Peach Trees scenes all come to mind. \\"Dredd 3D\\" spends a lot more time being a straight action film with some pretty great sci-fi elements.<br /><br />The SLO-MO drug is a really fantastic addition to the film. Not only is it an interesting drug, but it results in some of the best sequences in the movie. The slow-motion effects are incredible. Simple movements look beautiful, you get to admire the mayhem of explosions and the carnage bullets cause to the finest degree, glass sparkles like fine diamonds, and blood pools and splatters in ways you haven't seen in ages. \\"Dredd 3D\\" is so gloriously violent; it doesn't hold back with any of the gore. People are skinned alive, tossed off 200-story buildings, their eyes are ripped out, they're shot to death, and thrown through windows. It's bloody marvelous!<br /><br />The unexpected aspect of the movie is how smart it is. The Anderson character in general adds quite a bit to the story. Her interactions with Kay, especially the lecture he gives her and the head games she plays are really well done considering what she's capable of. It's like \\"Dredd 3D\\" takes several concepts that have the potential to be blown out of proportion, but keep them all grounded and the final result is more spectacular because of it.<br /><br />Maybe it's because everyone was so dead set on Dredd keeping his helmet on this time around, but Karl Urban really seems to fit the role of Dredd better than Sylvester Stallone. Revisiting \\"Robocop\\" before seeing this may have also contributed in its extreme enjoyment. The truth of the matter is this is one of the best remakes to come along in quite a long time. Fantastically violent, well-written, and constantly captivating with great 3D effects, \\"Dredd 3D\\" is one of the most superb action films of the year. Ignore the box office results for its opening weekend; this is the type of movie that demands to be seen in theaters.eat sci-fi elements.<br /><br />The SLO-MO drug is a really fantastic addition to the film.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is much more easier to play on my Kindle Fire than on my iTouch. The graphics look amazing! Great way to pass the time. Don't listen to the One-Star raters. They didn't play the game long enough... lol<br />Definitely reccomend!!!!!! &lt;3 \(&bull;_&bull;\) (/&bull;_&bull;)/ \(&bull;_&bull;)/
B00846REIS|1.0|Okay, I bought this book because i loved 50 shades and kinda wanted something close to it.  Needless to say, not only did she totally steal someones story and put her name on it( is this legal?) but she ruined it to boot.  I am trying my hardest to get through the rest of the story but the characters are just making me sick, and the sex scenes are ridiculous and not half as good as 50 shades even though she stole everything else??  people loved the book because of them and thats the one part you totally botch?  terrible read!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I find my self talking to my screen and my heart racing as the coins hang over the edge. its pretty fun and easy.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|With that said, I really liked it.  I heard it in a record store (they still exist, I swear) and liked it.  Yes, smoking destroyed his voice, but I thought it was creative what he did with his sound to adapt to his voice.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Totally awesome as well as a fun read.  I am now reading the Street Lawyer and I now agree with some other reviewers .... it does not stack up to his earlier stuff.  But the Litigators sure did.  You know a book is great when you are sad to finish it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun and addicting! oft passes the time and I love how you gain coins when off line
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Everyone should have to read this book.  I'm thinking of making it a New Years resolution to read it every year.
0525953728|2.0|More of a rambling editorial on the politics and rivalries between the Seals and other special op branches. I wish there was some interesting comments about the contents of the book No Easy Day vs.the drama unfolding about its release.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I've bought this as a gift twice, for two different people. That's how great it is. I already own a USB Turntable, but this one is better than mine. Also, I was really impressed with how well done the packaging was.
0345803507|5.0|Loved the book! Would definitely read it over again along with the first two. The author knows how to keep you guessing on what is to come next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works great. the pro version will probably do more but this is great for doing the boys homework. can't beat the price!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love this game, it is very addictive.I am not a gamer, but I play Angry Birds every chance I get.
0525953728|5.0|Great read.  I had to force myself to put it down a couple of times.<br />My thanks to the forces for all they do.
B002S5PMQM|5.0|This vinyl selection bring back so many fun-warm-never forgotten memories.<br />Description from the seller was perfect....each selection has its own meaning and they are special for each of us, but 'Maggie Mae' makes those of us who experoence want to go out and dance!<br />Great selection; price; and perfect shipping amd handling....
B009329Y30|4.0|Overall it was a good movie to watch with my wife...Would recommend to my friends.  This is a test of the emergency broadcast system.
B00828HWJE|3.0|I thought that Van Damme would play a larger part in the movie and was sort of disappointed because he had not played more of a part.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read. too good to be true, but isn't that why we read.  I want to have a lover so well skilled.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I love the Dunphy/Pritchett family. Where else could you find a non-traditional, blended family that is filled with such joy and laughter? Mind you, this extended family has its issues but they stand as one united family when times are tough. MODERN FAMILY is one of the best, if not the best, comedy on TV. Season 3 did not disappoint. Jay is the patriach of the family and is remarried to a much younger sexy, saucy Colombian wife Gloria are raising her son Manny. Gloria is actually slightly younger than Jay's daughter Claire. Claire and Phil are a married couple with the \\"traditional\\" family - two daughters and a son. Claire's brother Mitchell lives with his gay partner Cam and their adopted Vietnamese daughter Lilly. Hence, we have the modern family - a blended mix of cultures and non-traditional families together as one big, loving family.<br />The show is incredibly well-written and the cast is a pure delight. They all live near to each other so the lives of parents and children and cousins constantly merge. Gloria with her feisty Latina temper and heavy accent brings a special love and joy to the family. Goofy Phil Dunphy is the kind of silly but loving father that we all wish we had had. Gloria's son Manny is the glue that binds everyone together. This 13 year old is wiser and more mature than any of the adults. The show does play on stereotypes at times--the fiery latina and the effeminate gay men, yet somehow it is all done in good fun and respectable good taste. There is no meanness to the humor. Just sit back and roar with the laughter. There is a particularly finally episode of the family spending the day at the Disneyland Resort. Don't miss this season!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|At first I thought this was a kid's game, but I couldn't be more wrong. This game is Tetris meets first grade math which seems so simple yet is very challenging and fast paced. I love this game!
B0090EIILU|4.0|I laughed my butt off watching this movie. There's alot of stupid humor, but there's alot of higher level jabs in there too. It's worth a watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing you can build a lot of stuff and is really good for long trips if you like making your own world then download this
B006S039YU|5.0|Great classic Disney movie. Tells the story of a young girl who decides to serve in a Men only military to protect her father.
030758836X|4.0|I read this book on a whim. I don't usually read mysteries (why I don't know, crime TV shows are some of my favorites) but this one caught my attention. It's not the fastest paced book but I didn't get bored because while there are some pretty intense things happening within the plot, the psychological standpoints of the characters are what really engaged me.<br /><br />I read a few reviews before reading the book that said the book made the reader jump because it was so intense, but that definitely didn't happen to me. In my opinion it's not an obvious make-you-jump thriller, but an intense, disturbing, realistic view into the skewed psyches of two people who are indisputably intertwined in a very destructive manner.<br /><br />If you're interested into a story with lots of twists and interesting, twisted-yet-believable characters, this is a great read.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is awesome. You really have to plan your attack at times. Makes you think but not too hard. Cant wait for the update! Definately recommend!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|Really cool guys need to get this because you can see all the awesome and funny pictures that were posted and you can post your own
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is the perfect combination of relaxing and challenging, can play for 5 minutes when in line or for 1/2 hour if I've got that kind of time.  No pressure, just fun.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I can see the comments and pictures it deserves 5 stars ok you here me people you here me you here me
0984725113|3.0|Race Against the Machine does a good job of laying out the economic problem of unemployment and the changing nature of the workforce in America. This is information that is quite well documented elsewhere in the economic and sociological literature; nevertheless, the review is concise, clearly written, and makes its point definitively. It would be helpful, however, to have a discussion of the way that advancing computer technology relates to the increasingly sophisticated way that robotics are advancing the evolution of our technological society. Both of those factors are having an impact on the level of unemployment, the type of employment available, and the capability of many types of jobs today to provide a sustainable middle class income for many people. The prescription for solving some of the current employment problems becomes rather superficial in that it provides broad generalities for improvement, such as \\"Invest in education,\\" and \\"Hold teachers accountable for performance by, for example, eliminating tenure.\\" Questions that remain unanswered are, for example, what pattern the educational structure should take to make it relevant in the 21st century or what factors make up a \\"good\\" teacher these days. On balance, the book is worth reading, but one might wish for more depth in the way that many of our current economic problems might be solved.
B0098VXE50|2.0|The first hour of the movie was pretty solid. Visually great, story setup well, acting was solid as well (except for the two main characters). But for some reason the story went from being dark to horrible. The only saving grace was the solid acting done by nearly the whole cast. I don't blame Kristen Stewart, because there was scenes that she did well, I blame the writing. Like I said after the first hour the movie it becomes just a joke. Theron was good, but even her scenes seemed awkward and childish by the end. It is almost like the director said, \\"Okay I think we have the kids nice and scared, the parents are hooked so now we can give them the same old story but with some little twists along the way to finish it.\\" Seriously? Even the seven dwarves were something unique and great to watch, until she bites the apple. Basically right there the movie needs to be turned off and you need to create your own ending. Just horrible after that. So watch the movie until she bites the apple and you may be able to ignore some the problems that plauged this movie prior to that moment.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|It wasn't terrible.  I guess I just expected more.  I was quite disappointed with the ending though.  Why is it that Snow White doesnt end up with the Huntsman?  Makes no sense to me when they set it up for them to be together - I mean geez he is true love's kiss.  Just saying, that should have been thought out more.
0312867123|5.0|Very easy to read. Great story line. I was hooked, and able to read it in two days. I highly recommend to readers of all ages. Anyone who has seen the TV show will love the book. It is very different but the concept of the flash-forward is what makes it so interesting
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Perfect access to and total control of my pc  can watch videos perfectly on my gtab without having to mess about transferring and converting files, just don't have the sound because my pc is xp an there are known issues with sound streaming on xp. I just use my wireless headphones instead. Can play flash games no problems what so ever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest on my computer and also on my Kindle! It makes me feel so cool and crafty to pin my favorite kinds of things!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|When I first got \\"50 Shades of Grey\\", I was excited to read it, since I had heard so much about it.  It's a shame that I wasted time reading this trash...time that I will never be able to recover.  There were spelling and grammatical errors, as well as formatting errors.  Those are just the technical issues that I had problems with.  As for the rest of the issues, the story line is far-fetched and quite frankly unbelievable, and whoever accepted this piece of trash as an actual book needs to have his or her head examined.  The ONLY reason this book has garnered so much popularity is because the author is a TV executive in London and could therefore afford to spend money on marketing.  Apparently, even when it comes to something such as this, you could be holding a pile of manure, but if you have enough money to offer someone, they no longer smell the crap.  Please save yourself the time and money for this book.  I managed to slog through book one, and the thought of reading books two and three was enough to give me a raging migraine.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Its my fault. <br />I expected the book to be like a movie. it didn‘t progress as quickly as i thought it would.
B00932A2MC|5.0|If you liked the Transformers, you will love this movie. This is one I have to add to my collections of Transformer movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|games addictive!  it keeps u coming back. leveling up is easy, and its easy and fun to play on the kindle.
B0096YBEIS|5.0|Since 1991 Fourplay has produced the finest smooth jazz available.  Consistent, interesting, entertaining, exceptional quality, great production.  A class act all the way around.  If you are a fan of their music you won't be disappointed here.  It's more of the same great music they have been making for over twenty years.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|I thought their first album was mediocre at best - but Beacon is so much more accessible. Two Door Cinema Club really shows some depth and their instrumentals alone make Beacon a must listen.  I was a fan of the first album to a certain extent, but there were tracks I would definitely skip through, whereas with Beacon I listen the whole way through and enjoy every track.  Def. worth it.
B005URBC6Y|4.0|Pretty good book! The beginning started off very slow but once the secret was released it was a lot better.
B0058VW36U|5.0|best game ever love it and you would love it to you shouldget it to because its just fun. You should try it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I absolutely love these types of movies/series. I have the whole collection so far. If you like these kind of series/movies, you'll like this series and be hooked on them. I don't know why people are so judgmental and such critics about these things. If you like it, you like it, if you don't, you don't. Just because certain people are such \\"critics\\" doesn't mean it's not for you. I know if I went by what a lot of other people post on items, that I wouldn't get to experience things for myself. Plus, I know what I like.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Easy to learn but challenging to master. I found this one for free and an seriously considering buying others by this developer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|IT IS So GREAT GAME YOU SHOUD GET THIS APP AND YOU COULD GET IT AND GET COINS FOR FREE
B0090EIILU|1.0|Another disappointment from Cohen; Predictable sketches and worn out cliches make for a dull viewing.  Would not pay money for this product.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Good album, I can just listen to it all the way through.  I would recommend this album to anyone that wants to listen to a different sound.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I really enjoyed the film as a reader and as a movie watcher. The documentary really helps you understand the film, such as the fighting scenes and why characters were left off the film.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really really really fun. i love this game. makes you think to place your coins so that you can get the Max pay out when the coins already on the platform fall
B0086DBE62|2.0|I would give this movie 2.5, and only because Julie Roberts is in it.  It was a little boring. I just did not like it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My 12 year old son and I read this simultaneously and we couldn't put it down. Rick Riordan is one of my top 5 favorite writers and this series was very exciting. Can not wait for the third book in this series.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was very interesting. I started reading the free part and got hooked right away! I had to buy the trilogy! I don't read alot at all and I couldn't put this book down! I would recomend this book!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Was a great movie with great special effects that flowed very well; would easily recommend it to any sci-fi fans.
1577314808|3.0|The book has good qualities to it.  However it lacks in understanding how someone attains a greater state of absorption than simply feeling connected to it all by being aware of what is arising for the senses.  It has a very borrowed Buddhist slant to it.  This has been around in the states for like 90 years so its really nothing new.  Having been a practioner of meditation for several years as well as having met people who have practiced meditation for 40+ years utilizing the techniques that he espouses, this comes across as more of a pop culture phenomena, a sort of arm chair path to awakening.  I doubt this will be helpful for people to have legitimate spiritual realization or awakening.  More often it will probably produce more people just reiterating the often misunderstood phrases like \\"I am in the moment\\" or \\"it is what it is\\" or \\"be here now\\".<br />There are definitely better resources to read on the subject matter.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Is Jack getting a little tired in his old age? Is jack getting a little too politically correct? He has not bedded the lead female character; he has not \\"taken on\\" a bar-room full of \\"baddies\\".  But he is still as sharp as ever and he still has his toothbrush in his pocket - love him! Unfortunately, I cannot get past the vision of Tom Cruise (5ft 7.72) playing Jack Reacher (6' 5\\").  ??????
B000W178XO|5.0|It's a great album with a ton of hits from the Man in Black! If you are a Johnny Cash fan then this is a great buy if you are missing some of his hits.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|i think that it is really good because you really need to use your brains and skills to find a way of how. to get out of the floor. like James bond.
B008VKNEJU|5.0|I'm just echoing other reviewers' sentiments: this is a classic album, one that of course most folks will not hear.  That's just the way it is with truly good music nowadays.  But maybe I'll be wrong :)  Either way I hope Jessie Ware and her fellow musicians on this album get the attention they deserve because this album is doing radio and the music industry and our ears a favor.  What I love is your hearing all the eighties sounds we've come to love and respect such as Sade, Loose Ends, Soul II Soul and great pop R&B, but it's all Jessie Ware, not some lame copy.  This is going to be on some serious rotation for a while.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This has got to be the best \\"B\\" movie ever made.  Infact, it is a lot better than some of the \\"A\\" crap that Hollywood put out this year.  My advice is to not spend your money on any of the offerings Hollywood put out, but, instead, buy a copy of Iron Sky.  These Finnish Filmmakers have done themselves proud.  Support them. :)
0394800184|4.0|I read this book to my children and they enjoyed it. They loved the pictures and the simple story. After reading the story, my children liked to repeat \\"Are you my mother?\\" when playing. The illustrations were well done. I recommend this as a good bedtime story for children.
B008645YEE|5.0|I really love Hans Zimmer! The Dark Knight Rises is a great soundtrack to a great movie! I would recommend this to anyone!

B0064TVQ5E|1.0|The tiles were way too small. It was hard to play. Its too bad because I love this game. sorry
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought this book was true to the series in tone and quality.  It provided much background information that helped round out the characters.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This is the first effort I have read by this author. Very pleased with the product. Pace was fairly fast, characters were very interesting. I have purchased the next book in this series.

0380713802|3.0|I purchased this book because I was looking for something \\"light\\" to read on my morning commute... The book has its moments and it is enjoyable- however, I did find it surprising how Bryson, who obviously travels frequently and extensively, seems not very sophisticated and frankly monotone... His descriptions sometimes are stereotypical (like when he describes Naples-when was the last time he actually went there???)...Certainly not a great travelogue, but entertaining at times. Despite the shortcomings, I still enjoyed reading it on my train : )
030758836X|3.0|This book was amazingly suspenseful.  Every chapter ended with a scene that made you want to continue reading.  I loved that there was twist after twist.  However, after I finished the book I was so disappointed.  As another reviewer put it, I felt cheated. So let that be a warning - the ending is not going to be satisfying to you, I can pretty much guarantee it!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|This is Carrie Underwood.  No matter what she sings, she's gonna sound good.  That being said, her last album was pretty underwhelming for me.  Very few songs stuck with me, and once those became overplayed on the radio, I found that I never listened to it.  This album, however, was a big improvement.  The songs are powerful and emotional, as well as catchy.  It's got a little bit of everything we've already come to know and love from Carrie, from the emotional family-dedicated song to the power ballad love song to the gritty pay-back song.  However, she also ventures into some new territories with up-beat classic country songs and laid-back chill tunes.  So basically, it perfectly toes the line between what we love already about her without becoming monotonous in the slightest.  I definitely recommend this album!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I struggled with this movie at first. I thought Chris was selfish and irresponsible, and that his pursuit of his own truth did nothing but leave a trail of pain in his wake...and he just didn't care. But the film is so beautiful and compelling that by the end I felt it delivered exactly the right message - that happiness is nothing if not shared.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I seek out books that will induce me to leave my body.  I place my Kindle on the exercise machine let my mind travel away from the gym and into the author's storyline. Discorporation* enables me to lose track of time and go beyond my physical goals.  If one's reading goal is to leave one's mind, NO EASY DAY is the book to read.<br /><br />I decided to read this controversial book after seeing the author interviewed on 60 MINUTES.  The author didn't seem like hype and he wasn't surrendering secretes.  In fact, the book seems to be retelling the tale that the American public witness from the media.  Author was extremely upset with the gross inaccuracies the media spewed to the public.  However, I am beginning to wonder; did the intelligence community systematically leak misinformation to the media to throw the international watchers off track?  According to the author, ABC News' military analyst Richard Marcinko offered an extremely inaccurate physical description of SEALS.  The description bordered on silly! Was Marcinko stupid or was he presenting misinformation to protect the SEALS?  I fear the latter is the more accurate scenario.  If yes, the author is naïve.<br /><br />Eighty percent of the book addressed the topic of how SEALS are trained.  Boy that was fascinating!  It is easy to be overwhelmed and lose track of time.<br /><br />Right or wrong, NO EASY DAY is a wonderful book that will move the mind outside of one's body.  It will induce the reader to make a donation to The Navy SEAL Foundation!<br /><br />*The term is \\"discorporation,\\" coined by Frank Zappa which means the mind leaves the body.
B003L20ICE|4.0|Annette Bening is nothing short of incredible in this film. She completely embodies the dominant matriarch of a family struggling to stop her family from slipping away in the wake of change. In one particular dinner scene she plays the full gamut of emotions - insecurity, happiness, relief, suspicion, betrayal, shock - in one flawless fell swoop. This is a great 21st century family drama!
B0090EKRKU|4.0|Its must watch movie about environment , how capitalism will take advantage of situations.<br />Direction was so nice and depicted the sensitive isaues in very funny manner.
B0086700CM|2.0|really fun until you buy everything in the store at which point it gets a little boring.  it would be better if it had more levels
B005TVYVI2|2.0|I have gone through 1 of these pro models (and 2 of the older blue models) and all three have died on me.  I love the concept, it is a great training tool, but I am done throwing good money after bad.  I might try the wetronome next.  It sounds more reliable (though far less user friendly).
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Feels more like they sold a \\"1st Draft\\" when they decided to split a single book into three to create a trilogy.  The story was purposefully drawn out to create the trilogy and that's why there are so many errors, thus making it frustrating to read (misspelled words, grammar errors, punctuation to name a few). The errors are riddled throughout the books; it's embarrassing and funny at the same time. My friends and I decided to make a game of it to see who could find the most.  The storyline was ok, main character \\"Ana\\" was whiny in the same way I found Bella in Twilight. On the plus side, the adult toy industry is booming and young & old gals finally have permission to let go of their inhibitions, at least once in their lives.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I have played this game for hours and just love the it. Only one drawback, they need to make more levels.<br /><br />Amazing physics at play. Great game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this book twice and I did not read any big secrets.  I am pissed that his real name was leaked..  I also believe this is a story of the sacrifices our military make.  They should be paid a lot more than the  politicians who do nothing but sit on there butts, and the military should make the decisions to strike.  The book is an excellent read and I think the man who wrote it should be  commended for what he and his teams have done. My father retired as a Lt Col in the air force he doesn't talk much about what he did but the never liked  the\\"hurry up and wait\\" the government insisted on. I was raised on bases and I saw first hand how some of these guys trained, it is brutal and yet they do all they can do for what?  Not money,Not glory, but because they are making our lives safer.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Stunning, heartwrenching, funny. Hitchens observes his last days in a way that only he can. Read this book. Especially if you are a Hitchens fan.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I know this movie wasn't that spectacular.... and I'm not quite sure why..... but....<br /><br />I thought this was the one of the funniest f***ing things I've ever seen.<br /><br />And I'm still laughing.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|So far I like Angry Birds. It's fun and each set gets more difficult. I would definitely recommend it to others.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Take out the garbage of all the stuff you have been told. This book is spot on with diet, nutrition, and working out. Must read for those who want to get to truth and a beget body. Awesome value.!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have to say this is a great app. It has some great  features, it's easy to use, and looks nice. The interface is clean and easy to read. Well worth the buck.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found the first book of this series to be gripping for a reader, I never wanted to set it down and kept hoping for the odds to truly be in Katniss' favor. I did not care for Peeta's character too much though, like Katniss I saw him to be almost too weak and needy at times during the Games. <br />I loved many of the other characters though, Rue and Cinna especially. Both seemed to provide Katniss with  sense of humanity within her guarded character. I was very upset by lite Rue's death, but as Katniss had realized it was better she died  then instead of having Katniss have to kill her off.<br /><br />Overall I loved the story Collins has written, though the writing is obviously for a younger reader than myself, it was still very heartbreaking and enjoyable to read.
031620157X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. First of all, I loved the coverart and the whole design, it makes you feel like you are really reading something special from the get go. The story itself is easy to follow yet still very adventurous. I loved almost every character in the book, and that does not happen often. I still find myself wishing that I could have Lilly Pad tea with Froggy, but...this book is the closest I can get to that. I cannot wait for the next book in the series, it's such a great story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am not a navy seal and do not know anyone who is a navy seal. I enjoyed reading this book. The story was compeling.  I am impressed with the skills and dedication of the navy seals.
014241493X|4.0|This is such a good book and anyone who has ever read a John Green book can tell that this is one of his. He puts so much literary emphases in his work and I love that! This book has a great plot, but a somewhat unsatisfying ending. Overall it was still an enjoyable read and a great journey to take.
B0086700CM|5.0|great no glithes ignore all bad revews and get app only problem is there are no levels if that is fixed it would be perfect. it is a amazing app a must get
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend and though I liked Adam's version of Madworld, I can't honestly say I was a fan of his other tracks - That is until my girl insisted I play Trespassing on our recent road trip from Spain to the UK. By the end of our drive it was me, not her, insisting we play Adam again.<br />I am now a huge fan. This is one of the best albums I've ever heard, if I could give it six stars I would.<br />My favourite track? Outlaws of Love, brilliant.<br />By the way I'm a fifty six year old feller, and love his music.<br />Jack
B0067FGYGQ|5.0|Sharon Van Etten is not just another indie flash in the pan. An emerging star whose songs are original and have great pop sensibility and something very personal and feminine that gets under your skin.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game ROCK'S its amazing you should try this game if you. didn't its so fun follow. us on twitter and face book
B007X10OLE|4.0|The music is wonderful, but, after I bought it, I was disappointed to find that Amazon is selling a version with less songs than the version at Target and other stores. The quality of the sound is excellent. It pushes you to go looking to download the rest of the songs without paying for them - is this what the record industry wants?<br /><br />The music is great and voices are extraordinary!
B00633PFQC|5.0|Great read, really takes a fresh look at the economic way of thinking.  Short book, but every page has something worthwhile.

068485743X|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Noah Lukeman gives the reader a inside look at what helps writers get their books published. He lets the reader know what the agents and publishers look for in pieces of work. I found this book very helpful and will be using it as a reference book when writing my books. I would like to be a published author someday so I want to know the ins and outs of the writer/writing life. I think this book has helped in that way. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to write, or wants to be a published writer in the future.
1475143389|5.0|If you're looking for a book that will lay out in very specific terms, how to build healthy muscle, including step by step guidance on specific exercises, how to train (using different types of sets of exercises to reduce the chance of injury),  frequency, and other specifics on weight training, this book delivers.  In addition to all that, this book lifts the veil on the mystery and hype on supplements based on the author's practical experience.  I also like the fact that the author elects not to continually reference the supporting research throughout the book and bog the reading down to a technical level (if I didn't have some degree of confidence that the author knew what he was talking about, I never would have bought the book).<br /><br />I am looking forward to ordering \\"The Shredded Chef\\",  so I can get some great ideas on some recipes and dishes that I can make to help me with my continual efforts on getting lean and building muscle.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I actually saw the movie first before reading the book. Normally I do quite the opposite, I read then watch the movie, but I'm kind of glad that I watched the movie first, because the movie made me what to read the books. I wanted to see the differences between the movie and the book. I wanted to see those details that the movie left out.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about Panem, and how it was separated into 13 districts even though district 13 was destroyed. It's almost like the 13 colonies of the United States. I liked that each district had a specific job that they were supposed to do. It was interesting to me that they took two teens every year and placed them in an arena to fight to the death. It's sad that they do that, but at the time I found it interesting. I look forward to reading the other books in the series before the movies.

0312360258|4.0|This was one of those books that were suggested to me by a friend. They told me that if I like Harry Potter that I would like this series. Though I don't know what this series has to do with Harry Potter I'll never know. I guess it's the fact that this series has a school that houses vampires, like Hogwarts houses witches and wizards. But I like the way that P.C. and Kristin Cast present the transformation of becoming a vampire. It's not the traditional way but they don't sparkle like the vampires of Stephenie Meyer's books. I like how they kept the vampires traditional in the sense that they only come out in the night. I like how they are surrounded with other people who are in the same situation that they are. I love the main character Zoey. I would highly recommend this series to those who like vampire stories.
0439023521|4.0|[[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]]<br /><br />This book is amazing. I think it's good for almost all reading levels. I probably wouldnt recomend it for children under 11 because there is the use of violence, but that is truely up to the parents. The Hunger Games is a great read and keeps your attention through out the story. I could not stop reading it.<br /><br />At first I was kind of weary about reading a book where children are killing each other to win a competition. It turns out to be a wonderful story. Suzanne Collins really invests everything into this book. She creates an amazing connection to the characters. There were many instances where I could feel what they were feeling and just understand what was being said. There is a wonderful use of imagery and tons af detail used through out this book.<br /><br />If you have not read this book yet I highly recomend it, even if you have already seen the movie.
0545128285|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this companion book that was well crafted by J.K. Rowling. This book is only 111 pages. But this book gives more insight to the Harry Potter world. We are also able to read into the mind of Albus Dumbledore a little bit with his commentary on the wizarding fairy tale classics. I think out of these tales my favorite would have to be \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" and \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\\" I'm sure for anyone who loves Harry Potter has added this book to their collection but if you haven't, I would highly recommend that you do so. This is a great little book to learn more about the way witch and wizard children grow up in their magical community.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|Very enjoyable read on the Korean Conflict/War.  Should be the first book anyone who is getting started in reading about the Korean War.  One of the few books that takes on the Command Leadership in frank and understandable terms.  Halberstam takes on the the MacArthur myths and failures. Many of us now in our late 60's and early 70's remember the reverence and respect that our parents passed on to us about MacArthur and WWI & WWII which was truly earned.  But the story of the Korean Conflict is a story of MacArthur's cult and failures.  This book takes on the leadership and lets the chips fall where they may.<br /><br />Lest We Forget - Semper Fi!
0142418471|4.0|I really enjoyed the cover; it really set the tone for the story. With this being my first John Green and David Levithan book, I didn't know what to expect. I was a little confused in the chapters not noticing at first that they were different. The alternating chapters also alternated with capital letters or no capital letters at the beginning of the sentences throughout the chapters. Once I realized that was the style to determine which Will Grayson we were learning more about, then I was okay with it. I should probably mentions that it only took me about 5-6 chapters to figure it out. I really enjoyed the story to the end. I had a half of the ending right. I felt like I knew that the Will Grayson dating Tiny was going to show up to the play, but I had no idea what he was up to when he and Gideon were planning something. I really liked how the authors wrote about a subject matter that goes on with most teens, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual, and they created a story where you get to see what the characters do and how they deal with their choices. I really enjoyed reading this book and I look forward to reading more books by each of these authors. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it, but like either of these authors.
B00005NMVP|5.0|This CD brought back awsome memories of way back when! I was so happy to have found it! I don't know what you do or how you do it but you did and the music is Perfect! Again!
8876250441|4.0|So this was the fourth and final book to the twilight Saga by Stephenie Meyer. I'm not sure how I feel about this one. With vampire stories there's always a rule that vampires can't have children even if it's with a willing mortal or human. I didn't really like how they broke the book up into Bella and Jacob sections but I see why she did it though. I enjoyed reading about the wedding scene. This book like the others, I wasn't able to really put it down. This book is 754 pages and I believe I read in two days only because my husband said that I had to slow down on the reading with this series. He said I was becoming zombie like...LOL. It's okay though. I still enjoyed reading the book just the same. However, with this book and the build up of the final battle with the Volturi, I was expecting a little more from that scene. I mean I know Bella was their saving grace, because she had a shield ability but I still felt like there should have been something else going on in that final battle. But it is what it is, that is how she wanted to end the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the first three books, and wants to know how the series ended.
0062183591|3.0|I found the book to be an easy read and it does describe the subtleties of dishonesty. The studies were well thought out and it does a very good job of pointing out how we really can be dishonest. It does give me insight as to how I've cheated at crossword puzzles and even taking coins left in the pay phones. The book is worth the read but I still give it only three stars.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally, someone has the guts to stand up to the lies spun for our so called president.  It tells the American people they were never going to see Osama Bin Laden as he was always goung to be buried at sea, honoring his Muslim traditions.  America needs to wake up and this book might just be the answer for some.  As for disclosure of classified information that is crap, just another way DC is trying to keep the truth hidden.  Release your college transcripts and ccertified birth certificate if you have nothing to hide mr. president!!!!!!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|The product that I purchased arrived in excellent condition. The price that I paid for the DVD was extremely reasonable. I would order from them again and/or recommend them to other amazon customers.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|If you like to see a lot of revenge and killings, this DVD is good for you. Everything seems to go well at first as they kill just about all those responsible for the death of innocent Israelis but it's not long before out of the five men in the mission, only two are left alone in the mission and that is when things go wrong.  Avner goes back to his wife and little girl but lives in fear for his family.  I like that Gila Almagor was in this movie, even if it was just for a few minutes, she played Avner's mother.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does what it says it does. There are free apps that work similarly, but few with as much style.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Most of the movie and actors were great but Kristen Stewart was a big disapointment. She seems to play the same part, use the same expressions in every part she plays. Its hard to tell one part shes played from another. Everyone else was spot on.I really expected more from this movie.

It has The Wonderful Christmas one Too!'
B005IQZB14|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down.  Cheryl Strayed takes you on her intense journey on the PCT. Her emotional struggles to make sense of her life coupled with her daily physical challenges leave you cheering for her to reach her goal.
B0088WFZQG|4.0|I'm the kind of guy that thoroughly enjoys a good military action/drama, and this did a fantastic job of keeping my attention and having enough drama for my wife to stay interested. It may not be the highest production value action flick of its time, but it did a great job of not watering anything down.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I learned from this film things I didn't know about the Lincoln assassination, but probably should have. There were times (only a few) when the film dragged a bit, but the production quality made up for that. I recommend The Conspirator to anyone who's interested in history, the law, and the constitution -- if that viewer is also able to be entertained by an intelligent script with very little action. One complaint: several fine actors had roles that I wished gave them more screen time.
1452101426|4.0|Gave it to my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.  Great illustrations and wow the information that is in this book.<br />If you love to draw or just interested in animation this is a book to get.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Have been reading for several years books written by the men and women who serve and have served our USA.  I naively thought Bin Laden had to have been hiding in Iraq when the Bush administration sent our men and women to Iraq as I thought and still believe our sole responsibility was to find Bin laden and rid the world of him. I admire these patriots who put themselves in harm's way and am ashamed we do not do enough to take care of them when they return home.  We send these heroes to  countries that are centuries behind what we believe in and ask more of them than we should.  I enjoyed the book and credit and salute all the Seals as well as all our military for going into harm's way.  Though I am a Republican, I do CREDIT Barrack Obama for making the decision to rid the world of this man as well as the Seals and all our soldiers who finally eliminated the mass murderer that Bin Laden was. I may disagree with some of the things our present administration has or has not done...but if Obama had not given the ok...Bin laden would not be swimming with the fish...he has found out no virgins were waiting for him..but really Obama deserves credit also and does not get enough credit for it!!  The book is well written and very interesting when we see and feel what they go through while in theater. If for no other reason than a major portion of the book will go to non-profits providing service to our soldiers...I hope everyone buys this book. it is a good read.
B006CBSE86|5.0|Nightwish's 'Imaginaerum' is one of their best albums ever. Tuomas Holopainen, one of the best keyboardists in the world, appears to have congealed wonderfully with the almost new singer Anette Olzon meaning to me their earlier album 'Dark Passion Play' felt like it was written during a discovery phase of their musical relationship. The music in 'Imaginaerum' is solid, tight, bright, dramatic, and gorgeous and does a great job at creating wonderment in one's senses that Nightwish can invoke. If operatic metal / progressive metal is your desired atmosphere, I highly recommend 'Imaginaerum'.

B006885EFE|5.0|Owning Band of Brothers is like owning a piece of history.  I feel this series gives us an indepth view of what WWII was really like.  These men were not glorified by Hollywood.  You really get the sense that you're seeing the truth, good and bad.
1416987118|5.0|One of the all time classics. I've never met a child who didn't love this book! It is great for drama, rhythm and music activities. A must on every child's bookshelf!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Its addicting....really! So when I saw a free download for my kindle, I had to have it. Quick....easy....painless! Hours of simple fun on long trips....and I can say it actually helps problem solving skills for the kids.....trajectory....prediction....stategies. Best of all...no internet connection needed once downloaded.
B006LSZECO|4.0|And i love go sleep! <br />Very entertaining! It is truly a great book! I hope they make it a movie!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it so much because u can play over 127 games<br />it is awesome I love it. play it
043635005X|2.0|Under the description of this book it was labeled as hardcover. It was very much not a hardcover, it is in fact very paperback. It also took quite a while to get here. Bad form.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Two thumbs up.  My husband is in the Navy, so [[ASIN:B009329ZF2 Battleship]] was a movie we wanted to see for the ships if nothing else.  We missed it on the big screen (cue the screaming baby), so were eager for the video.  To our surprise, it was much better than we expected from the previews.  The plot is pretty good.  Great action, although it does get a little Transformers-esque over the top a few times.  Fun characters with enjoyable dialogue, which for me is what makes a show.  We liked it enough that we rented it a second time to watch with friends.  If you like Sci-Fi action with some jokes, this is for you.<br /><br />As a warning, while waiting for Battleship I rented [[ASIN:B007X16YCM American Warships]].  It is a bootleg version of the same plot (using a WWII museum ship to fight aliens) but with cheesy acting and almost no special effects budget.  I would only recommend it if you enjoy MST3K-ing movies.  In that case, American Warships is a prime candidate.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Not only are Claire Danes and Damien Lewis excellent in Homeland, but this show will educated you on what is happening to our country.  Can't wait for season 2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an awesome trilogy finished it in 3 days. Wish there was more. Looking forward to the movie!! I would recommend to everyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a very good book! I'm only 50% done and I'm already hooked! I know what series I'm addicted to! Hey reader chick or dude, you should buy this, you won't be disappointed ;)
1400052181|5.0|What an accomplishment and a massive undertaking for Rebecca Skloot to take on as an author.  Congratulations!  I never wanted to put it down.  What an amazing story that needed to be told.  For the unsophisticated, C Average, \\"arm chair\\" authors whose best writing is their critical, Amazon review, I have a question for you.... how is your novel doing?  Too many haters are quick to criticize an artist's work.  As Billy Bob Thornton says in the movie \\"Woodcock,\\"....\\"There's a lot of losers out there!\\"  I tip my hat to you, Rebecca Skloot!  It is brilliant!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was very excited to read this book and continued to be as I read it. I had a very difficult time putting it down.The ending though was a little bit of a let down. Throughout most of the book I had chosen sides but felt a bit deflated at the end. Although\\" I got it\\", I was expecting a bit more of a redemption. Looking forward to reading her two previous novels.Some have said they are much better.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a wonderful time waster. it is played just like the real coin sizer game. and for those who say it is stupid, you obviously grew up too fast.
B000002KCI|4.0|Being a long time Neil Young fan and looking back Zuma is one of his better albums. Some of  his stuff does not wear well. Long simplistic guitar solos or pathetic whiny crying .<br />(i like some of it still) Looking back his albums are spotty containing GREAT songs I just purchased TRANS trying to recapture the magic on CD . A couple of great songs with filler . same old same old FREEDOM CD (another so called comeback i believed it) the same way . RUST NEVER SLEEPS another one trick pony . In some ways i guess Zuma is his last good album. This review was written in 1999.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The story of the book is well known, but the way it is written is personalized enough to make it most readable material, including the negative aspects of military life - i guess.  I found that the relative humor of the story takes this book beyond the story/history into a kind of novel or the reverse.  Highly recommended and hope all those that participate in these kind of actions are as sensitive to the people they hurt - unwillingly or not as the characters in the book seem to be.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is an amazing book I read it and never wanted it to end.....Without giving any clues away...these people are made for eachother...there were a few times I cried while reading this book...I feel like I knew the characters....this is definately a writer I will definately follow...cant wait for the next book....So worth the money!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Definitely an enjoyable read about the most significant special op of our time.  Also provides great background on the process of becoming a SEAL and the elite squad SEAL Team 6 (DEVGRU).<br /><br />Enjoyable read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I picked up the Hunger Games at a book exchange in a hostel in Ecuador and even with all the sight seeing, bird watching, and various tourist activities I still managed to finish it in 4 days.  I liked it so much I didn't think I could handle the flight home without the 2nd book so I downloaded it (and kindle for ipod app) about 5 minutes before the plane took off.  It really made the plane rides and the layovers bearable, actually almost unnoticeable...  until my batteries ran out.<br />I really did get into this book and had a hard time putting it down.  I finished reading it in 2 days (and I'm not a particularly fast reader).<br />I highly recommend it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great sequel to a great game.  It builds upon the previous title by adding more complicated puzzles with the same unique esthetic. Strongly recommend.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I think it's great. easy to navigate.  User friendly.  quick return back to main page after pinning.  I prefer it over my ipad.
0375842209|5.0|I am the type of person who doesn't like to read that much but when I read something it must be something that peaked my interest and this book definitely peaked it. I would recommend this book to everyone if you like history.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|The Kill Order was a fast read and answered the questions set up by the other books. I'm glad they were written this way, with the prequel being the last to read. It fits in great with the other three three books in the series.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|The main character is arrogant and a brat. Pay attention to the way she talks. What high school student talks like that? I hate when they make students or even adults have a dialouge that never would happen
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! Especially on the go! Worked great! Only issue is a little easier access to my own boards. Other then that, it's awesome!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is really good if you like games like this then I recomend this game for. it is a great game for everyone. you can build and control your own city and it is really fun
B007HJ9UHG|4.0|Liked the story content and the graphics--did not like the nudity or sometimes very violent scenes.  Do not think that the nudity contributed to the story line.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|So much fun!  Reminds me of Sims.  Plenty of activity and not-too-hard challenges.  Really is an enjoyable game to play!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I do not get premium channels (just basic), so I can't watch the series in real time.  I couldn't wait to watch the sixth season of Dexter.  I sat down and watch and watch.  The ending makes me excited to see the next season.  Good value for the money!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really did not want to read this book because of the bad reviews...just didn't want to spend 10 bucks on a bad book.  So when my friend loaned me her copy and told me I had to read it...well it really was BAD!  How did this even get so much media attention?  There are so many other books that are great and they don't get this kind of hype...does the author know about bdsm?  The characters were flaky the writing was horrible...I am so glad I saved my money!!  If you're thinking about buying this book...don't.  I could barely finish it; i was hoping it would get better...just got worse!
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Very intelligent and insightful, but also very academical. Heavy on the referrals and some name-dropping with what seems like personal vendettas or the likes, complete with some degree of patronising. Most people who read this will likely already be atheists, but many more should find reading it worth the effort. In some parts laugh-out-loud funny.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having this pinterest app. especially for recipes on the kindle. makes cooking easy. worth the free download for sure.
B004UID2LC|4.0|its a great app. i have a lot of music for my kindle fire because of it. but sometimes it stops working.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|awesome. I'm completely addicted. a classic dungeon crawled complete with loot system and skill tree. the lack of a class choice Sucks but considering its free who cares.
B005S0HNU2|1.0|I didn't like it because I didn't get it!!!!!! I was told they didn't have one in stock that would work in the U.S.  I would love it if you could try again.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|This is the best dance music station ever! It always plays the ASOTs and that's pretty nice! If you like trance and progressive make sure you get this.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Fascinating story, bit there are some things better left to the general imagination.  My exposure to people in this sort of business has always revealed a very strong professional \\"Need to Know\\" approach to what they did.  Like most intelligence gathering, it is the small pieces of information that are used to form a real picture, and in this case I believe that a bit of the store was given away.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good for those times when you need to pass some time. The music is actually my favorite portion of the game
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|A person would have to be extremely gullible after seeing JFK to ever accept that Oswald acted alone. Just have some serious questions is all I ask of pundits, because in my mind after reading a 108 books on the Assassination, that whatever LHO did on nov. 22 1963, whether he was on the 6th floor shooting at JFK, or shooting at Connally, or being a decoy either shooting a couple shots into the grass divider, or sticking a rifle out the window, or being on the 2nd floor getting lunch or a coke, there is no chance whatsoever he did this on his own.Imagine if your own father was killed under mysterious circumstances, maybe a city councilman say in a legal dispute, and was shot to death.You were then told by the coroner that it was an open and shut case. that there was an investigative panel, and both the back wound and the head wound were raised 4 inches from the original Autopsy, FBI and medical reports, would you just accept the official verdict with no questions? Well that's the unbelievable nonsense that you must accept in JFK's death.Also remember that Dr. Burkley, JFK's doctor thru his atty. in 1977 to the HSCA said that\\" others besides Oswald must have participated\\". There is no record of any follow up - imagine that, he didn;t say maybe, he said must, and was the only physician to see JFK at both Parkland and Bethesda Naval Hospitals. Burkley, a full Admiral was not called to testify before the Warren Commission.If some one at least reads a couple of the following books they will be informed-A Farewell To Justice Joan Mellen-Last Investigation-Gaeton Fonzi-Man Who Knew Too Much Dick Russell-JFK And The Unspeakable James Douglass-LBJ Mastermind Of The JFK Assassination Phillip Nelson.Important thing is as it says in JFK\\" DON'T LET ANYBODY DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU\\". One last thing I wanted to add was-I don't care about anybody's opinion on the tramps, unless they've read Man On The Grassy Knoll By John Craig. Like wise for Jean Hill JFK Last Dissenting Witness, &Beverly Oliver's Nightmare in Dallas, because people  make ill informed, snotty comments, even learned published Authors, without even being familliar with what they are talking about.
B0045JYHQA|4.0|I remember when this first came out. We had heard on the news that Janis was just finishing up her (really) second album (the first 2 were technically Big Brother), a follow up to the Great Kozmic Blues album, and before the album was finished, she died of a drug overdose (a lethal combination of reds, and booze). Paul had to get as many as the songs that he could get together to put out an album. One song that was on the original release that was (mercifully) taken out, and replaced with other outtakes discovered was a song called \\"Get It On\\". The song was Janis at her worst. This version of the album is not bad, but there is an understandable lack of polish. No less than 4 extra bonus tracks, but one of them is an old Etta James hit called \\"Tell Mama\\" which she does justice to (thus the extra star). This may not be as good as her Big Brother Albums, or her masterpiece of Kozmic Blues, but it is a good album, and is worthy of being in anyone's collection of Janis. And it would prove to be much better than most of her post life releases.
1451627297|2.0|I was very disappointed in this novel. The premise was unbelievable, the writing mediocre at best, and the liberal slant hard to take. I didn't get past chapter 10. Don't waste your time on this.
B005E94WB0|5.0|I've been using this for 2 years and love it!  It hasn't shown any major signs of wearing down and has kept my Voyager pro safe and clean.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is awesome and it was referred to me by my BFF.  We started another book club because of this book.  Happy reading.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|It seems to me that the use of checklists has been going on in business for quite a long while, along with the idea of team work and total quality management. I think that the primary interest in this book would come from the medical community, but for someone who is used to these theories of management, it's nothing new.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love the product, especially since it's on my Kindle Fire.  The story is great, and I can't wait to continue reading more of it every day.  I don't like how it's set up in the Kindle because the chapters are by names and not numbers.  If my place is lost, it's murder trying to find it again in the story, and it's happened twice already.  The story has loads of intrigue, graphic violence, and sexual content, but the story line keeps you wanting more.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Nice game i like it. Takes some thinking to get higher score and use the tools like the cross hair feature.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An exciting and intriguing read with history thrown in the mix!  A very good book -  think it would make a great movie!  Didn't want to put it down, and very easy to visualize the characters!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|relaxing music.  .  . challenging. . .fun.  This game is a great way to wind down after a busy day at work.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read The Shining in the Spanish version in the early eighties during a family holiday and I thought it was terrifying.  I was in my early teens and it was one of the first full-length adult novels I had read.  Later, when I saw the movie version I was disappointed.  Although the hotel in the movie was pretty it had not the magnificent grandeur I had imagined.  Also, the orange, yellow and black carpet was wrong and the elaborate wallpaper was missing.  I was not surprised to miss the hedge animals and see them replaced by a maze.  Surely the hedge animal scenes would not have been realistic, given the limitations of F/X at the time.  Danny Lloyd was great as Danny Torrance, Jack Nicholson of course was excellent as Jack Torrance, whereas Shelly Duval was not as good-looking as I had imagined Wendy Torrance.<br /><br />I have just read the English version and enjoyed it very much.  Whereas as a teenager I had focused more on the predicaments of Danny and the gory bits, as an adult I remarked on the existential conflicts of the Torrances and the consequences of their complex relationships with their respective parents.  The melancholy sense of a place where the past is always present was also appealling at this stage.  Another bonus is that (like most other King work) The Shining is a virtual time capsule of American popular music, TV commercials and brands.  I never knew what Doctor Dentons were until I read about them in The Shining, and the music everyone listens to is a good summary of the late disco era.  The notion of a child's soul being trapped forever in a playground, to be tortured forever by a malignant presence, was scary 30+ years ago, but now is more pitiful than scary.<br /><br />The Shining bears re-reading.  I think it is a better work than The Stand, which for some reason is viewed as King's magnum opus. Now I'm annoyed because in the movie someone says that The Overlook Hotel was built on an Indian burial ground, thus muddying the waters with PetSematary.  Needless to say, King uses no such subterfuge to explain how The Overlook came to be.  He doesn't have to.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game was a pleasent surprise. once you get the hang of it you really get hooked . I love the achiements and spend a lot of time improving on what I have done. buy this game you wont regret it.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Legos have exceptional quality! This is no exception. My kids love this. Whatever they build with these they come out nice and cute. I recommend it.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. I think it is better then the demo, because you can save changes. Thats why I like it.
0525953728|5.0|Wonderful book, loaded with details. I don't disbelieve his account, but it seems a little exaggerated. He seems to be magically be present in all of the most exciting points of the Bin Laden raid. I had to re-read a couple parts because I felt like I missed something, although I hadn't. He was here and then there, and then he magically is standing over Bin Laden's body and he was the one that performed all the milestones of the raid.<br /><br />Either way, great read. I do like his brief pitch against Obama taking too much credit for the raid. I particularly enjoyed the details concerning the thorough intel for the raid.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen (not the author's real name), does an exemplary job relating events leading up to, and including the killing of Osama Bin Laden.<br /><br />This is such an easy read and so well told.  I could easily have been sitting at a table with the author having a cup of coffee, or a beer and sandwich, listening to the author unload and relate events he has been unable to disclose to anyone.<br /><br />He lets us know first and foremost, that even though the SEALS are so highly trained, they are human.<br /><br />I'm not one to see a movie twice, or re-read a book, but this is an exception.  My son proudly served in the U. S. Army, and I've sent a copy to him as well.<br /><br />Thank you Mark Owen and all our U. S. Military Special Forces, for your dedication and service.  I sleep better knowing you serve our country.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I've read all the Temperance Brennan cases and I particularily liked this because of the local and the rich assembly of residents involved. Reichs never fails to deliver on the forensic details that make it a page turner. Her reckless actions are a bit frustrating at times but it always moves the storyline forward at a good pace.<br />Can't wait for the next one.<br />T.U.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|It's been far too long since we heard from that Little 'Ol Band from Texas.  Nearly 10 years, as a matter of fact.  2012's \\"La Futura\\" has been in the makings for some time, and after all that wait, has it been worth it?  Yes indeed.<br /><br />\\"La Futura\\" returns ZZ Top to the very basic, gritty sound of a three piece band grinding away, seemingly live in the studio.  The sound is sparse, primal and groovy.  One thing that plagued later day ZZ Top albums is too much post production, giving things a slick digital sheen.  If you've seen ZZ Top live, you know that the sound of those albums doesn't do the band justice.  What they do best is blast away with loud, fuzzy, gritty blues rock.  \\"La Futura\\" makes the wise move of just putting microphones in front of the band and letting the band sort the rest out.<br /><br />So what about the tunes?  There are plenty here that will stick in your head long after you turn the stereo off.  The album opener, \\"I Gotsta Get Paid,\\" is a grooving nod to a hip hop tune, with Billy Gibbons' snarling guitar and weathered vocals front and center.  The band sounds loose, locked-in and having fun.  \\"Chartreuse\\" and \\"Consumption\\" are cut from the same cloth; both hard-charging boogie blues-rock that the band excels in.  \\"Over You\\" is somewhat of a curveball; it's a slow ballad with Gibbons crooning/croaking over a lost love.  With Gibbons' ragged vocals and ever more ragged guitar solo, this one really works as a guy laying his heart on the line.<br /><br />\\"Heartache in Blue\\" gets things back on the boogie train, with a funky, syncopated guitar groove, highlighed by the harmonica of blues artist James Harman.  There's a great moment at the end of the track with Gibbons and Harman trading guitar and harmonica licks.  \\"I Don't Wanna Lose, Lose You\\" finds the band plowing straight ahead with a four-on-the-floor guitar showcase, and a chorus that will get stuck in your head.  \\"Flyin' High,\\" is somewhat of an oddball track for ZZ Top; the guitar riff is straight out of the AC/DC handbook, and the chorus is reminiscent of something from an arena rock outfit like Journey or Def Leppard.  It doesn't totally work, but it's interesting to see a veteran band like ZZ Top taking a gamble.<br /><br />\\"It's Too Easy Manana\\" is a slow crawl of a tune, built upon Gibbons' sludgy guitar.  It's also Gibbons' finest vocal performance of the album; he draws out each line, giving them inventive twists and turns.  Just when you think the tune is drawing to a close, the band kicks in to a double-time groove, just to wink at you and remind you that they can boogie at the drop of a hat.  \\"Big Shiny Nine\\" is one of the few uninspired tracks on the album.  The band gives the straight-ahead rocker its appropriate gusto, but the track just kind of lays there.  \\"Have a Little Mercy\\" is a great way to wind things down.  It's built upon Gibbons' stuttering guitar and his raspy growl (with fine backup vocals supplied by Dusty Hill in the background).  It's a simple, meat-and-potatoes blues rock song, but really, what could sum up ZZ Top better than that?  Again, just to show you how easily they can do it, they break the song down into a blues shuffle at the end.<br /><br />There are two bonus tracks on the edition of the album being sold at Best Buy, \\"Threshold of a Breakdown,\\" and \\"Drive By Lover.\\"  In my opinion they don't add a heck of a lot to the album, but they don't do anything to diminish it, either.<br /><br />\\"La Futura\\" is a fine addition to the ZZ Top catalog.  It doesn't really break new ground, but really, does ZZ Top really have anything to prove at this point?  They've been delivering the goods for 43 years now and \\"La Futura\\" is a portrait of them just keepin' on.  Those looking for some bold new statement from the band after nearly ten years away might be disappointed, but for those just looking for ZZ Top doing what they do best, \\"La Futura\\" fits the bill just fine.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. just returned from a cruise where they had this but I am doing so much better with this version. Guess it's because there is no pressure!
1416511946|4.0|Nikki Sixx was the epitome of rock and roll debauchery.  His autobiographical account of the madness which was his life over a frenetic one-year span is both disturbing and somehow a bit humorous.  This is an incredibly talented and articulate musician on one hand; a whining, spoiled and unforgiving addict on the other hand.  His daily journal is filled with a bit of matter-of-fact drug-riddled raunchiness, yet at times is so poignant, I felt a degree of sympathy for what he was going through.  He obviously held a lot of deep-seated animosity over his dysfunctional upbringing; blaming a father he never saw and a mother who was a bit detached and weird.  But, other kids have had it worse and came out somewhat \\"normal\\".  Not Nikki; he was as volatile and outrageous as anyone I've ever heard about - including Keith Richards.  In fact, Sixx makes Richards come across as wholesome as Pat Boone.<br /><br />Despite the obvious personality flaws the author possesses, his account of what his crazy life was like was fascinating; his frequent trips in and out of addiction got a little tiresome, but for the most part, still worth reading about.  It's weird, but in the end, I somehow felt better that he survived it enough to warn the world not to do what he did when he was on top of the rock and roll world.  It was a long strange trip which may or may not have ended.  With this guy, nothing would surprise me.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read all of Mitch Alborn books.  They are all very good, but this book was the best.  I could hardly put it down.
B008KL2ITW|5.0|You know those types of books that you find where people either love them or hate them?  On those books you will find a ton of 5 star reviews, a ton of 1 star reviews and only a few in between.<br /><br />This is that type of book.  From my 5 star rating above you can quickly see that I am in the \\"I loved it camp\\".  Now, I do not usually use a book review to get up on my soap box but I really do feel that I need to use this platform to express my opinion about this book and these types of books and the `bad press' that they get.<br /><br />It is easy to tell from the book synopsis and from other reviews that this book is a love story filled with angst.  It is also very clear from other reviews that it is the kind of love that is filled with high emotions, the kind of love where they need each other more than they need the air they breathe and that there is a controlling element from one or more of the characters.<br /><br />Why may I ask do people even start a book where these subjects are clearly stated if they know they do not like these types of books?  They end up reading half (or less) of it, saying something like \\"Nope, can't read anymore...\\"  And then they continue to review the book and give it a 1 or 2 star rating.  How?  Why?<br /><br />I completely get that not everybody likes the same type of books. And if you start a book, finish the book and want to give an opinion on it then I will read that opinion, take it all in and then a discussion can be formed with the differing opinions.  But when somebody goes out and starts a book about a subject matter that they know from the start they are not going to like (i.e. men with control issues...)  I just don't understand the logic behind this?  But to actually go and put out a review and star rating on something that they never finished.  Nope, I do not agree with this.  Or if you read the book just because you `want to see how bad it really is', why bother?  Life is too short and there are too many books that you know you will enjoy out there, go read one of those.<br /><br />If you go through my past reviews you will see I tend to give a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews, it is very rare that I will give a 3 and I honestly do not believe I have ever given a 2 or 1.  This in no way means that I am a soft reviewer.  I tend to only read books on subject matters and in genres that I know I am going to enjoy; therefore the book would need to be truly awful for me to not like it enough to give it at least a 3 star rating.  I would never start a book on a subject or in a genre I did not like, going in knowing that I wouldn't like it, not finish it and then give a low star rating.<br /><br />I do feel bad that this review has had to start with such a long rant but I just feel I owe it to this book and other books like it, to press to the point about the negative reviews out there.  There has also been a lot of talk about the author lashing out about the negative reviews.  I will not be giving my opinion about that as I am here to review the book, not the author.<br /><br />Now, with that out of the way let us get on with the awesomeness that is Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster follows Abby (aka Pigeon) and Travis (aka Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox').  As mentioned above the book is filled with angst, an all consuming love that goes up and down like a roller coaster... it is wonderful and you will enjoy the bumpy ride.<br /><br />In the synopsis this is how Abby is described, \\"The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe.\\"  I really think this synopsis needs to be updated.  To me this does not describe Abby at all.  I never got the impression that she didn't drink.  In fact she makes a point to show on several occasions that she can down `em with the best of them.  And swearing?  There is swearing but I never noticed that she wasn't doing any of the swearing so it is not exactly focusedon her not doing it.  It is not like she is always scolding Travis or her friends when they swear.  What is clear is that Abby has gone away to college to get away from something in her past.  At first I got the impression that it was just an old boyfriend, somebody she dated for a long time, he wanted to stay in Kansas she wanted to move on... But soon you realize it is much more than that.  Her past is messy, filled with gambling, family issues, debts and the mob... you can understand why she wanted to get away and to create a new identity for herself.  Then enters Travis into her life...<br /><br />In the synopsis this is how Travis is described, \\"Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos.\\"  This is spot on!  On the outside he appears to be the bad boy, is involved in underground fighting, smokes, drinks and is a serial womanizer.  However, it does not take long at all to find out that he is also kind, part of a fraternity, is very intelligent and studying criminal justice.  His mother died when he was very young and it was him, his father and his three brothers.  That is a lot of testosterone and it is how he learned to fight from growing up with them all.  Because of the lack of a mother figure growing up, I feel this is why he has no problem with having sex with a woman and kicking her out of his apartment soon after. He doesn't get phone numbers, he doesn't let a girl into his bedroom (the above will normally take place on the living room couch) and he is not ashamed of this at all.  Then enters Abby into his life...<br /><br />Travis' cousin, Shepley, is dating Abby's best friend America.  Once they meet it is obvious that they like each other but because of Travis' reputation Abby is obviously guarded around him and the whole 'bad boy' thing is exactly what she does not want to get into.  Rather than push his luck he decides to try to be friends.  Abby is different from the other girls and challenges Travis, she doesn't bat her eyelashes or twirl her hair to get his attention.  He wants to be close to her so if that means becoming her friend, something that he has never done before, then that is what he sets out to do.  Abby and America decide to stay with Travis and Shepley when the hot water boiler at their dorm breaks down.  Abby is under the impression that she will be in the living room or that Travis will be.  But she soon finds out that he has every intention of them sharing his bed... only as friends though.  He helps her study, they start spending more time together outside of school, and she starts defending him around the school when she hears others talking badly about him.  The stay was only meant to be for about a week but because of a sly little bet between Travis and Abby it turns into a month.  Then enters Douchebag into both of their lives...<br /><br />Douchebag (aka Parker) is a love interest for Abby.  He is part of Travis' fraternity, good looking, rich, planning on going to Harvard, drives within the speed limit and obeys all traffic laws... and is boring as heck.  *snore*  Travis calls him Douchebag and it just stuck with me.  Even when I saw his real name on the page I found myself saying Douchebag, it just fits perfectly.<br /><br />Travis is overprotective and very jealous.  It is apparent he has a temper but he never lashes out at Abby. Yes he has no problem with throwing a punch or pushing the guys that come around Abby while they are out but again I was never in fear that his anger would turn on Abby.  He tries to allow her the space to date Douchebag but it doesn't last long. To Travis' credit it is made more difficult because Abby does play him.  She gets closer and closer to Travis and for whatever reason refuses to see that he cares for her more than she could ever understand.  The she forces herself to try to fall for Douchebag knowing that it is not who she wants to be with.  Travis and Abby are together, they are apart, they are together, they are apart... It is like a giant tug of war with your emotions but again you will find that you love every moment of it... even when you are screaming at your book or Kindle.<br /><br />There are moments in the book where I wanted to smack them both, there were moments in the book where I threw my Kindle in my side drawer refusing to read anymore... then only five minutes later get it back out to keep reading.  I laughed (a lot), I cried, I smiled...  Last night when it was time for bed I was at 82% and there was no way I could stop.  I finally finished and realized it was 3:00am and had to be up at 8:00am for work, I regret nothing!<br /><br />This has to be one of the longest reviews I have ever written but I feel very passionate about this book and I in a way take offence to the negative reviews that are out there from people that either didn't finish the book or started reading it knowing they would not like it to begin with.  This just doesn't seem fair at all to the author or the work they have put out.<br /><br />In wrapping up... let us be honest, Travis is messed up in his own way and Abby is messed up in her own way.  There could never have been a more fitting title for a book because together their relationship is a Beautiful Disaster and it works for them.<br /><br />\\"You're trying to save him, and he's hoping you can. You two are a disaster.\\"  I smiled at the ceiling. \\"It doesn't matter what or why it is. When it's good, Kara... it's beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Side note:  It has been confirmed that Jamie McGuire will be publishing [[ASIN:B008J2AH7C Walking Disaster]] (another perfect title) next year.  This will be Beautiful Disaster written from Travis' point of view.  Yes.. I did just audibly sigh.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A must read! Couldn't put this one down! Would love to know if he is going to write a sequel to this one, because the reader is left hanging - but still an amazing book.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I rarely buy TV shows on DVD, but this one is worth it.  I love going back now knowing what I know to see how the stories are woven together.  Great writing and the BEST costumes!
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Disneys Aristocats is one of my favorites and never gets old! The music is terrific too! Classic family fun! I could watch this movie over and over!
B0092MKTL2|4.0|I really enjoy this album. over all, I only disliked one or two songs, but the songs are still good and they sound good with the album. If you like this style of music, I would say this is a must-have. You get a lot of different sounds out of this album so you don't feel like your listening to different variations of the same song on repeat, as it can seem like with other albums in this genre, and there's songs that are good to relax to or also songs that are really energetic and exciting. it's a good album to even put on in the background when you're doing homework or cleaning house, whatever. I approve
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great.....love it a lot and love to play it. definitely worth downloading. go on and get it now
B0095T3ES2|1.0|Based upon what I heard and read about this movie, I thought it would be hilarious.  I was wrong.  There were a few funny parts, but overall, I thought the movie was just sad and depressing.  I'm disappointed I spent money and time on this.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I looooove this game. keep me occupied. people would think its Boring but it anything but! Ah its so much fun! get it!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this because my wife uses it all the time . She thinks this is the cats meow.  The graphics are great
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game that requires no thinking at all. Nice way to kill some time waiting for the doctor or in line somewhere. nice graphics and interesting in game upgrades.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wonderful read - insightful and inspiring. The educational content interwoven with an adventure novel made this a book I couldn't put down.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|First I would like to express my gratitude and respect for the work that these Men do and the honor with which they serve.  We are a better nation for their sacrifice and work.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and although I did not serve in any special warfare role, I felt the book showed an objective and factual perspective.  It was educational to read and better understand the training and preparation which is accomplished with our Special Operators.<br /><br />I think that everyone who would minimize the risks and work that our Special Operators accomplish should read this book.  I was unaware of the manner in which their \\"deployments\\" are scheduled and executed.  Once again, to understand that these Operators have to \\"manage\\" their family and social life, along with the uncertainty and extreme stresses of their jobs proves the resiliance and perseverance for which all SEALS and Special Operators are known.<br /><br />The raid on the bin laden compound, although informative, for me was not the highlight of the book.<br /><br />If you are hoping to read about secrets and special protocols, don't spend your money on this book.  However, if you want a realistic glimpse into the life and activity of America's most outstanding heros, this is a must read.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I've been an avid Reichs fan since Deja Dead was released many years ago.  I've found that, unlike Patricia Cornwell, Reichs has stayed at the top of her game with engaging narrative, fresh plot twists, and the depth of her characters.  Like any author of any series, Reichs has had her better installments and some that, while certainly still good reads, were not among my list of favorites.<br /><br />Bones are Forever is one of her best yet.  It was a real page-turner, and I found I couldn't put it down once I had begun to read.  It's really amazing that, even though I've read and reread the books in this series many times, I still find myself unable to predict the twists and turns of each of her stories.  She's an amazing author as well as a well-regarded scientist.<br /><br />What's left now?  Waiting for the next installment, of course!
1936608898|5.0|I've read many a book on the topic of Paleo and I recommend this one HANDS DOWN to anyone that wants to learn more about the way I eat and why.  The reason?<br /><br />- This book lays out the science first.  Solid science.<br />- This book focuses on the right thing - health, not history.<br />- This book recognizes that there will be shades of gray in how out current knowledge of nutrition is implemented, based on a person's budget and health status (amoung other things).  they equip you with the knowledge to make your own choices instead of being your food boss.<br />- This book will help you understand your body and make you say \\"So THAT'S why!\\".  Any resource that educates instead of dictates is a winner in my book.<br />- It is intensely practical and approachable.  They make it as easy as possibly can be to transition into this healthier life.<br />- It's funny. You will smile and giggle many times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|glad this app was finally added to facebook. I am addicted.  I am on at least once a day. like all the different ideas on here.
B00005JLRT|4.0|i seem to be a minority here but i will admit this is the worst \\"Next Generation\\" movie but not for the reasons of the many, the only reason i took away a star is because of data's makeup yes i know he's older but still i swear they used different makeup than in insurrection or before and it shows!! OK few... now that thats out of my system my review continues.<br /><br />positives<br /><br />- as reviewer _Lee Neville_ said \\"There is definitely a sense of goodbye with this film\\" Sad i Know.. but they had to end it somewhere.<br />-all of the main cast returns including some unexpected ones :)<br />-Peace with a long standing Enemy Race<br />-does not feel like an extended episode (for example Insurrection and The Final Frontier, note i am not hating i enjoyed those movies,like all of the rest)<br />- finally a wedding for two main characters(if you know TNG you know who)<br /><br />The Space in between<br /><br />-guest star admiral ( i liked the show but promoted before Picard really :( )<br /><br />negatives<br /><br />-some bad makeup<br />-some great scenes that were cut (paramount director's cut please :) )<br />-story could have been better<br /><br />all together i think people should give this movie a shot (or a second if you've seen it)
159514188X|3.0|This book would be a great book for teenage children. It addresses tough issues like bullying, sex, rape, and suicide. It can really be an eye opener for children to see how what they do and/or say, whether big or small, can have an unexpected impact on other people. This book goes though Hannah Baker's thoughts leading up to her suicide and the thirteen people/reasons why she felt the urge to commit suicide. I, a college-aged female, felt myself struggling to get into the book, and found myself rolling my eyes to some of the ridiculousness of the book. I would not recommend this book to friends around my age but would recommend it to children in middle school to high school, as well as parents with children that age. It does give a wonderful insight into the mind of a confused, unhappy teenager longing for someone to just reach out and help which could be life changing if the right person read this. I liked the structure of the book and how it was written. The perspective of Clay Jensen, a boy who got a set of tapes from Hannah explaining in detail the thirteen reasons, and his thought process while listening, kept me involved and forced my attention and my mind to think. Other than that, this book was good, but not my favorite, by far.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked it very much, no new book in the works was mention so I feel a bit cheated for a conclusion but  George R.R. Martin writes a great yarn.  I highly recommend his work.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is perfect for a day when you have nothing to do. It is so much fun and easy for any age. I believe everyone should have this game.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|The best travel book on Australia. Every \\"down under\\" traveler should read the first several chapters; they capture what \\"most\\" tourists visit. But Bryson's book also gives so much more -- what the \\"return\\" traveler and long-term visitor need.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This is the greatest cd actually one of my favorites. It has alot of her hits from alot of her albums. If u loved donna the wat I did u have got to get this. It has some songs from albums that I dont own yet but they are very good! I love could it be magic, srring affair, try me which is a long version and all of these will be played repeatedly that I assure u! I hope u get a chance to get it as u wont be dissapointed. I have played this cd so much I might have to order a spare! It was a great price to and was bought on amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Warning!! Hard to put this book down after the first few pages. Make sure you start it on a weekend or you might be phoning in 'sick' to work.
0470876417|5.0|Just what my daughter needed for College. Came on time. Price was good considering the cost of books these days.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, loved it and have started enjoying the next book in the trilogy just as much too.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|A long awaited disc for a faithful fan, these songs do not disappoint.  The Darkness are BACK and stronger than ever!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought this was better written and more exciting of the three. You have to read the full trilogy to enjoy the story! Happy reading!
B005FKGZK4|4.0|Although it didn't have enough suspects to be as \\"mysterious\\" as some of the other Sherlock Holmes stories I've read (the \\"big reveal\\" of the villain was not surprising at all), this one was still a fun read.<br /><br />My favorite part about the book was the atmosphere. I wonder if the moor where most of the book is set is a real place. If so, I want to visit. Rocky tors, misty swamps, ancient dwellings made from stone, and the occasional large stately mansion. I'm ready to buy my plane ticket to London.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I started reading I thought this is going to be a bore, but it turns into a great story line with lots of \\"mind work\\" for the reader. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first it seemed like the book was a little slow and not much happening, but several chapters later I couldn't hardly put the book down. It kept me guessing at every turn and was very exciting. I guess the downside was the ending---did I miss something !! It left the reader hanging(or it least it did me)It was very suspenseful reading other then for the end.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Like so many others here, I had fairly low expectation.  These expectations were based solely on theater reviews and lack of success at the box office.<br /><br />I won't bore you with any details! Simply put, the movie exceeded my expectations, and I agree with the masses here at Amazon; this movie deserves the 4+ star review average it has received!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Any open-minded adult can overlook the abundant sex, and likely even expose their naivety regarding sex, to understand the story is about the need to control.  The story enlightens us as to the possible depth and fragility of the emotionally disturbed mind.  This, along with a well written plot, makes for good reading.  Book two gets us to the deep-rooted cause and some beyond.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|The story is, agent George Smiley must come out of retirement to find a Soviet spy who has penetrated the heights of British Intelligence. This sounds like the plot to a good action movie or heart-pounding thriller, but this movie is anything but that. It's truly a thinking man's thriller.<br /><br />The cinematography and score were fantastic, just beautiful and really captures the quiet Cold War dread hanging over England. The acting is similarly great, a who's who of British talent led by Gary Oldman.<br /><br />The story is told through a series of flashbacks, reminiscences, and the perspectives of several characters, as Smiley uses his past and those of other agents to gradually solve the puzzle. It's not for everyone, as you have to pay a lot of attention and there's almost no action.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is so exciting and it just pulls you into the scenerio.  I am not usually a book reader, per say, but I can't put this book down!  I am up to Book 3!  Highly recommend it!  Great reading!
B000001DQI|5.0|After almost 40 years, it may be a little late for this comment, but simply put, this album is one the the masterpieces of popular music ever recorded.  Perfect from start to finish. This was one of the first albums I ever purchased, back in late 1973, and it changed my life. I still have that double vinyl album carefully stored away, and when I occasionally take it out, I remember the hours I spent as a teen looking at the pictures, reading the lyrics and listening to the brilliant songs.  For music fans, perhaps we all have that defining moment when something just clicks that never forget, but is never duplicated, and this was mine.
B00846REIS|1.0|I am forcing myself to finish this book even though it is painful.  I think the writing is poor and I have yet to find anything interesting in the plot.<br />I read 50 Shades of Gray and that was ok, I thought this might even be better, but it is actually worse.  I can't wait to be done so I can move on.  I am bored with it. The characters are poorly developed, actually not even developed at all, so the only reason I would recommend this book is for the erotica and if that is what you are looking for, I am sure there are a million Harlequin Romance novels that are better!
B004FEFZU2|1.0|So frustrating when the 3D Disc is not functioning well. It get stuck at 0.22second.How can you solve it?<br />If you are talking about a replacement, can you provide me a guarantee that that will work?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Sierra Hotel!! This is a no BS documentary.  I felt like I was along side the operators during the whole book.  Congrats and I wish I had a fractioon of your guts.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|[[ASIN:1451629192 A Stolen Life: A Memoir]]This was a very captivating story. It was a story that needed to be told and I pray Jaycee continues to heal and bloom. She has a fabulous attitude. Some spirits cannot be broken.
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Dark, depressing, bad horror type book writing. All idea is probably to bring attention for marketing /sale . Would not recommend.

B003O86FMW|5.0|catching fire is an easy read, picks up where the hunger games left off. Ideal for the lazy reader or a teenager.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Very true to the book, and most exciting.  Visual effects very good, and excellent portrayal of characters.  Really gave life to images as read.  Highly recommended!
B006VREPSY|5.0|Every Boardwalk Empire episode I've seen has been amazing. This show has it all; plausibility, good story lines, amazing acting, amazing cinematography and atmosphere.. is that twenty words?
B00006EXDM|3.0|Here is a compilation of great songs from their early years.  My favorites are Sympathy For the Devil, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Jumping Jack Flash, Brown Sugar, and Heart of Stone.  I used to own the LP and there was a lot of hiss in the background.  For some reason, this album was poorly dubbed and the quality of most of these songs sound like death warmed over.  It would have been better if they left the Midnight Rambler live version out and replaced it with two other of their famous songs instead.  The CDs are overpriced have too much bass and hiss ABKCO or London Records was never a good quality record company to begin with. That's my opinion because I had a lot of Stones on vinyl. Still, if you're not picky about the sound, you can put both disks in your CD changer and rock for a while with old many old Stones classics.  Better yet, see if your local library has it instead.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the best super hero movie I ever seen. Great action and comedy thrown in. The hulk is bad ass in this. Joss Whedon did this movie justice. Seen this three times in theaters this is a must see. Iron Man, Captain Ametica, Thor, and The Hulk all get there moments. Even black Widow and hawkeye get there moments. Loki is awesome in this movie as being the villian his character evolve even more from thor. The battle seen at the end is Epic the camera circling around them I get chills every time. Can't wait to own the 3d edition blueray for I can watch on my 3d tv.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No.Easy Day an informative, interesting, easy read. This story gives the layman an inside look into an important event in modern history. It's done in a first person account that bypasses the normal media spin and give the acts as they really happened. You will not learn any secrets of the Seal Teams, but you will feel a great admiration of what and how they do their jobs. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be reading it again soon.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and avidly read it from beginning to end.  It is not a great piece of English composition by any means, however IT IS a fabulous piece of escapism.  The sexual content in my view was exaggerated in the media.  It didn't offend me at all. If you are going to the beach, or on a plane and need an easy read - this is the perfect book to choose.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This app downloaded quickly and runs perfect on my kindle fire. It is very fun and a little addicting. It is almost completely like the real game but with prizes and puzzle pieces you need to collect. I just wish that you could gain more coins instead of only 45. The limit does go up but slowly. The coins come after 30 seconds online and I like that I don't have to spend money. I would reccommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thought the way the author wrote the book was fantastic, I felt myself get lost in the woods with Katniss and feel her stress and pain. Great book.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|What a pity that such great music has been almost completely ruined by a terrible recording. This is surely one of the most highly compressed recordings of all times.
B007SXB498|5.0|Wonderful novel.  Loved it almost as much as Pride and Prejudice.  I have loved everything that Jane Austen has written.
B0058EA3MS|5.0|Another Year and another film by one of my favorite filmmakers, Britisher Mike Leigh, a person who understands the human comedy,  allowing us to laugh as we groan inside at characters not unlike ourselves.  Tom and Gerri (yes, people make fun of their cartoon names) are a quietly happily married couple, intelligent and alert to the world.  Like many of us, they garden and recycle and wonder if it does any good as they bemoan the corporate control of the world.  They have a 30-year-old son, Joe.  But the movie is mostly about Mary, Gerri's friend, a receptionist at the office where Gerri is a counselor.  Mary (played superbly by Lesley Manville) hangs out a lot at Tom and Gerri's.  Hoping to find freedom, she buys a car, but no one who drinks like she does has any business with a car.  She thinks a man is the answer to her search for happiness, but she has no sense of who is a possible partner for her.  Along the way of her growing awakening we meet other characters, the most wondrous of whom is Tom's nephew, who shows up late and seethingly angry at his mother's funeral.  Leigh does not shy away from embarrassing scenes, causing us to squirm at situations like those most of us have endured at one time or another.  This is the opposite of an action film, and what a treat that is!
B006B31B80|5.0|Very entertain ing I was  hooked after first episode ! It has action romance suspense & some scary sense!it is a little bloody ok a lot but still worth watching . The main characters are really easy to like and root for. I can't wait for season 3!
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Fighter tells the real-life story of junior welterweight boxer Micky Ward, of Lowell, Massachusetts.  In 1995 HBO produced a documentary, High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell, that chronicled the plights of three crack addicts.  One of its subjects was Micky's older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (played by Christian Bale, who won an Oscar for this performance).  Dicky was also a boxer.  He had \\"gone the distance\\" with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978 but has turned into a self-destructing wreck.  The wonder of the film is Micky's relationship with his family: his brother, who is his trainer; his dominating mother (Melissa Leo won an Academy Award for this role), who is his manager; her second husband; and Micky's six sisters (who still live at home and behave like a Greek chorus backing up whatever Mom says).  Then there is Charlene, his new love, who is as tough as his mother and trying to get Micky away from this crazy bunch.  This film deserved its acclaim.

B000ZN802W|4.0|After graduating from Emory University in 1992, Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire savings account to charity and made his way to Alaska to live in the wilderness.  He also abandoned his identity (becoming Alexander Supertramp) so he could not be traced by his family (parents and a sister).  His body was found at a remote campsite, along with his diary, letters, notes, and a handful of books about survival.  To create the book Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer used this material and interviews with Christopher's family and the people he encountered along the way to Alaska.  Sean Penn created this fascinating 2007 movie from the book.  I found myself moving from admiration  to frustration as I watched this young man proceed on his journey.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie is a classic. Brings me back to when I was younger watching this movie with my family. Good times.
B007RXC3A8|4.0|With Stones Grow Her Name, Sonata Arctica seems to have lost their focus somewhat. It's not that this is a bad album, it's just that it doesn't live up to the [rather eclectic] standards I've come to expect from Sonata.<br /><br />They continue on in the style of Unia and The Days of Grays, but lack the unique and new feeling of the former or the solidness of the latter. There are definitely some great songs here, but some of the others suffer from repetitive lyrics syndrome (repeating the title of the song over and over), something I'm a bit surprised at from Tony.<br /><br />I give this album 4 stars, but really I'm giving about half of it 5 and half of it 3. On the 5 end would be 'Only the Broken Hearts,' 'I have a Right,' 'Somewhere Close to You,' and 'Alone in Heaven.' The rest of the album is a mixed bag--definitely worth listening to, but it just doesn't manage to pull it together like those tracks do. My largest problem with the Wildfire tracks is less their execution than their aim. As sequels to the original Wildfire they confuse me since they don't seem to have anything to do with it.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Why would I want to watch a film about kids killing each other!!  It's inhumane!  I don't understand why people like this kind of thing.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|A little hard to first get into, but after it was hard to put the books down.  Took me about 30 pages to get into it because of the complexity of the plots, characters, etc.  Will probably re-read the books.  Extremely fascinating.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This book reminded me of an old Twilight Zone, Valley of the Shadow, about a town tucked away in the middle<br />nowhere that wouldn't allow anyone to leave. I could go on about that plot, but you can Google it. For this reason alone, I discounted two stars. And while I understand that nothing is ever truly original, the scrip parallels were distracting enough to warrant a deduction. Other than this, The Pines is well written and filled with great action sequences that will provide great entertainment value. I read it in a couple of sittings on my Ipad.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Anyone who loves hello Kitty buy this app now! It has the cutest decorations and characters also you can custumize your cafe. The only thing I didn't like was how you cant buy other characters unless you buy coins. Otherwise great app and you should definetly download it, its free anyway so why not.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. It was light-hearted, fun, and entertaining. If you liked the original \\"American Pie\\" movie you will like this one. It was fun to see the characters we fell in love with from the first movie \\"all grown-up\\". Would watch it again!
B007MDB71O|4.0|Very good movie!.... Interesting theory about mars and Earthi history.  When you see the beginning you can't imagine the rest... good story, the graphics and audio are exquisit if you buy a blu ray version!
B000SEI230|5.0|I typically don't like love stories (and generally I do not like Nicholas Sparks books), but I downloaded a free sample of this book and after reading the first 2 chapters I was hooked! It really is a great book, the story is great and it's an easy read. It does have a lot of religious content which I normally wouldn't like, but it works with the story line. I would highly recommend reading this book.
B005LZW8FO|2.0|When I saw the trailer I was thinking that this movie will be a good movie because the sobject is very interesting, but the movie waste it!... It's not a Sci- Fi movie, it's not a drama movie, it's not a romantic movie, it is in middle of all so if you have expectations with this movie, don't be so critic.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Music is utterly fantastic. I recommend everyone see the movie Looking For Sugarman. The music falls into place after that.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I seen this movie at the theaters and liked it. I liked it then so I bought it when it came out. I like the heroin of the movie and that it shows the depravity of mankind. I also liked The Road, Lord of the flies, Orwells \\"1984\\", etc.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Just downloaded this app and I cannot download for some reason. This is frustrating someone please give some advice. I also would like to preview the videos before I download.
0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day is no better or worse then the many books on the shelf that talk about Special forces. Yes it has the UBL assassination story but as the author said it was just another mission until it was over. It is a fast easy read about men who serve the government and corporations of the United States of America with blind allegiance; And they do it very well. As far as getting any top secret info, as the author says, it was checked and sanitized so it does not divulge any secret info the government did not want out. In someway I would venture that it was produced in cooperation with the government for our consumption. Why would we kill UBL? He would be way more valuable alive unless we screwed up. My congratulations to the marketing department of Dutton and the US government. They are the real story of the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|omega this is so alsome I mean you win prizes and you can sell them and get coins for and then when you run out of prizes or coins they have this shaker you can shake it so you can shake the coins down.  very alsome game
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Animation director Brad Bird's live-action debut is crackerjack escapism. \\"Ghost Protocol\\" (2011) represents the best entry in the \\"Mission: Impossible\\" film series, with assured pacing, memorable set pieces and solid performances by Tom Cruise and Company. Too bad Ving Rhames is relegated to a disappointing cameo. Otherwise, a stellar example of why we go to the movies.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Another great season of Big Bang Theory.  It is very enjoyable, and fairly priced.  It shipped promptly, and I couldn't be happier :)
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I will wage in here among the 100+ reviews and the Dylanologists. I think this is a Dylan classic. The dark mood and long story-songs are pure genius Dylan and so wonderfully crafted. I just want to hear this over and over again. I've been diving into the Dylan back catalog thanks to the recent move by stores like Best Buy, Barnes & Nobles, and even Walmart who are discounting back catalog CDs as low as $4.99. Barnes & Nobles in particular has been responsible for expanding my Dylan collection. Although I've been listening to him and buying his records for decades, it's only been in my latter years that I have come to appreciate his music, even reaching back to the '60s. Tempest is such a grand, sweeping musical opera that I can't stop listening. I want to catch every lyrical nuance. Of course, Bob doesn't make it easy. His voice is really rough on some cuts, then later he sounds like a younger Bob. If he would just quit smoking.... but it is what it is. In any regard, this is a great, late Bob Dylan masterpiece.
B00932A66Y|4.0|Good film.  Saw with subtitles.  Interesting story and plot.  Not as twisted as I thought, but nicely shot.  Who am I?  Dr. Suess?
B004G5ZXVQ|3.0|Yes, I am a long-time REM fan, having bought their first full LP (yes, vinyl) when it was still their only full LP. Bought every one after that until about Reveal and I didn't like them so much. Accelerate was OK. This one is OK. It's a good listen, with echoes of past glories. A fitting final album from a band that meant so much to so many people. Almost like a retrospective in some ways. I hear Murmur. I hear Green. I hear Automatic For The People. But it never rises to that level. If you're looking for an REM CD to buy, you could do a lot bette, but you can do a lot worse too.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Plug it in and you have EVERYTHING the Beatles ever did at your fingertips. Enjoying listening to these great quality recordings. I don't have the CDs but I'm enjoying this little apple. I wonderhow this thing can still be available???
B008PE9GSA|4.0|First ZZ Top record I owned: the 45 of Tush with picture sleeve. So when the band borrows the Tush riff for not one, but TWO songs on this CD I don't mind. It's fun Texas guitar boogie and that's what The Top do best. Dirty guitar and growling vocals, with the best rhythm section ever behind it. I like this one! It's no Deguello, but it comes pretty darn close. You won't be disappointed with this one. Although Amazon will hate me for this, go to Best Buy and get the exclusive edition. It includes two extra songs that you have to hear.
B0090EIILU|4.0|I guess this movie didn't do very well in the theaters, but I thought it was funny all the way through - indeed, the best of Baron Cohen's work to date (aside from my all-time favorite the Ali G show).  This was one of the funniest comedies I've seen for a long time.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|It's an interesting read and one that can be read quite quickly. It brings up a few discussion points, especially about memories. Our bookclub talked about what memories we have or think we have because of photos we have seen, or stories that we have been told about. It would probably make a good, suspenseful movie.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|The Wanted Man is the worst book I ever read by Lee Child. What happen? Has he lost it? Has fame gone to his head? His movie coming out December 2012 has big question mark in my estimation. Tom Cruse  playing Reacher is totally rediculos. I like Tom but lets be real Reacher 6-5 Tom lucky if he is 5-8. I'm not even going to see the movie it would not be realistic after reading all of Childs books. Another author bites the dust.[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]
B00881VLCE|3.0|Im pretty good with puzzles so love this. Its fun and challenging. Its a great way to pass some time.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|not a bad little time Waster. no complex controls no bloated manuals just old fashioned way to waste a quarter in the arcade without going to the arcade. I use it to kill time while my houses are building and gardens growing. worth a look if you are of a generation that remembers the penny arcade or the one at the mall.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series of books is one of the most addicting reads I've had in a long, long time. I have to admit, I was fairly shocked with the detail put in to it, but I think that is one of the reasons it's so addicting! Each chapter left me wanting more.
B004HF0PEU|5.0|This wonderful collection of studio recordings (mainly produced by Walter Legge) supplies a rich portrait of the \\"middle Arrau\\", painted just before the starting of his great Philips period. The majority of the items has already been published as single CDs or in other box-sets, but something has been newly remastered and something else is now difficult to find. Besides, some pieces will never be recorded again (in studio) by Arrau: Schubert's \\"Wanderer\\" and March in E - D.606; Chopin's Sonata No. 3, Etudes, Allegro de Concert in A and Tarantelle in A flat (rec. 1939), Debussy's Tarantelle Styrienne (rec. 1939) and, therefore, they represent invaluable documents.<br />Something is mono, something else is stereo (see for details the track-list below), but the general sound quality is very good, even if not excellent.<br /><br />The concert \\"companions\\" are an elegant and essential (but not cold! on the contrary!) Alceo Galliera (Beethoven - all the 5 -, Grieg, Schumann, Tchaikovsky No. 1, Weber's Konzertstuck) and a warm and flawless Carlo Maria Giulini (Brahms Nos. 1 & 2), both conducting an attentive and precise Philharmonia Orchestra. While Giulini's fame does not ask for any adjunctive comment, Alceo Galliera is today quite forgotten, if not considered nothing more than a good conductor or accompanist. This last point must be considered a cursory mistake. Indeed, Galliera performed and recorded together with the greatest soloists of his epoch - Arrau, Lipatti, Schnabel, Gieseking, Benedetti-Michelangeli, Anda, Haas, Haebler, and then Oistrackh, Fournier, Thibaud, Brain, Goossens, and, more, Callas, Schwarzkopf, Moffo, Gobbi, Gedda, Alva, etc. - therefore, if he is actually an accompanist, he is the accompanist of the Masters! Anyway, Galliera's performances are here excellent and very very refined, in the pattern of the best Italian conducting tradition, that is \\"drying\\" the orchestral score to its essentiality (that does not mean simplification, but improving musical meaning without overwhelming soloists' parts) and keeping it within its functional role, not trying to unnecessarily attract a spotlight on the \\"Maestro\\" and on his \\"bravura\\". As a matter of fact, if you attentively listen to Galliera's conduction, many passages, with the most elegant easiness, catch and masterfully express the composition nuances within a context-sensitive and meaningful approach.<br /><br />In any case, the added value of this box-set is that it supplies a complete anthology concerning with Claudio Arrau as passing from the sparkling neoclassical approach of the 1940s' and of the first half of 1950s' (the zenith of this \\"first period\\" is, in my opinion, represented, on disc, by the famous recordings of Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1, Fantasia in E minor on Hungarian Folk Songs and of some of his Hungarian Rhapsodies, see: [[ASIN:B0000029P6 Piano Concerto 1 / Hungarian Fantasy]] or [[ASIN:B000065EQK Liszt: Concerto pour piano No.1]]), to the warmer and metaphysical interpretations of  the 1960s' and over. Therefore, here the recordings span from 1956 to 1962, but, in the last CD, there are also some retrospective recordings, very interesting for a stylistic comparison with the \\"first Arrau\\": the famous 1939 recording of Schumann's Carnaval (still considered a reference performance), the rare 1938 recording of Chopin's Tarantelle, Op. 43, and the 1939 recording of Debussy's Tarantelle Styrienne and Jardins sous la pluie.<br />Someone thinks that in the sixties Arrau (born 1903) started  his slow decline. This is not my opinion at all. The recordings here presented are superb interpretations of absolute value and, also if Arrau would have retired after their executions, many of them would be still unsurpassed. On the contrary, here Arrau has not still reached his zenith, but he is starting a fundamental period of transition towards it, where transition does not necessarily mean something poorer or less valuable. As a matter of fact, here, doubtless, Arrau still has (and, for a long time, will have) his virtuoso maximum strength and valuably enriches it with some marvelous new bud, another crop of his long-life \\"recherche\\". He is winning his enduring struggle against ego and vanity and his performances will be increasingly driven by soul and transcendency. Surely this sort of engrafting is difficult, risky and delicate and asks for courage and attentiveness; here, someway, we clearly feel that something will be soon overshadowed (not denied!) and, on the other side, that something has not yet completely accomplished and that none (Arrau himself!) can be sure of the forthcoming achievements. Indeed buds will not wither; indeed, in the brighter and warmer light of a different and higher kind of consciousness, gorgeous flowers will plentifully bloom.

B0053O89K6|5.0|I think House is arguably the best and certainly the most influential character on network television and this last season is amazing... you should have it...!!!
B00866JL96|4.0|This is a beautiful story about love, about dedication, about honor and loss.  I was moved by it, and easily can recommend the DVD to all the women and men who feel that love stories are wonderful to read or watch.  Buy it or rent it, you will enjoy it while holding the hand of your girl.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I purchased the novel after seeing the 6 minute trailer for it and reading the reviews posted on Amazon. I initially thought the book to be boring and all over the place, but it eventually won me over.I enjoyed the story of Sonmi-451 the best and the story of Adam Ewing the least.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I enjoy this game as much a my grandkids do.  It helps pass time when you are waiting for appointments or to keep kids busy when traveling.  If you are frustrated listening to these cute little birds as you fling them across the screen is an amusing stress reliever. Angry Birds Seasons is fantastic when you want to get into the holiday spirit.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Give this game a try! Time flys when you are playing. Its hard to walk away from this game. enjoy
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest has really cool craft ideas and is funny sometimes I found amazing recopied I might just try decorating my room like this lady on pintrest
B008XG1X18|4.0|love this app but it seems whenever I try to open it its blank and crashes and I have to reopen it. almost always the 2nd time I open it it works fine.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|The book is a basically a bunch of advices from authors' own business experience.<br /><br />If take 100% my feeling about the advices would be following:<br />10% - this is extremely smart<br />30% - this sound useful, I need to think it over<br />30% - does it really work that way ? hm...very contradictory opinion<br />30% - bullshit<br /><br />The problem however that any of you might come up with own, similar or very different percentages. So what is the value of this book for the business reader ? I have no clue. I have read and I forget it next day.<br /><br />I have very few reasons to recommend you this book. Probably the only one is a following:  you are on a long flight and need something to read. It does have a very simple and easy to read style.
B0055PMURG|4.0|Great movie! I was a little irritated that when I tried to download the movie to my kindle the 1st time it did not work. But other than that NO issues.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This story of Walter Isaacson will teach you thousands more real world things than generic management and leadership books (\\"work productively, be a great leader\\" type  of stuff... ). The author did a great job in putting together pieces of Job's life, no matter whether there were white, black of grey.<br /><br />Personally, I felt that \\"Wow, that man is certainly not my hero! \\". And it's absolutely great when you get deep emotions while or after reading! It usually comes a sign of a outstanding book for me.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated that story happened modern time. I mean it wasn't a 18thcentury or so, Apple story happened basically in front of readers' eyes. What could be more fascinating that reading about the genius and the inventions, that have been changing the world you live in during past 20 years...<br /><br />My favorite quotes form the book (about brand, focus, meeting with Obama, legacy in a company, firing people) I posted in my blog.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Loved it n hated it.  Reason I hated it. It drove me crazy when I couldn't get the gold crown especially when I got it all down with one rock
B000V39KDO|4.0|I thought the film was very good as it had a kind of \\"mystical\\" qualiity that tranferred the viewer to another dimension that maybe (or not) we would not mind living in.<br />The story line iteslf was accurate on the basics of the historical narrative but also the producers did take some liberties in order to enhance the overall context.  I do not recall that the priests of the oracle were anywhere near the evil ugly beings that the film suggested....the Spartans were a religious community ...no need to demonize their beliefs.<br />I did not realize that the king was Gerard Butler...I thought he did a great job.  Lina Heady was also good however I think she has been type cast into this type of genre.<br />Overall, the film was quite artistic and very good for people who enjoy this type of adventure.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Great read, eye opening, and maddening to know that all of the information is out there to address the serious obesity issue and instead we opt to advertise the surgical gastric bypass route.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I very rarely give a book 5 stars and to date I have never given a book by an Indie Author 5 stars. However this book is so well written and compelling, I had no choice!<br /><br />There are plenty of plot reviews of this book and I'm not one to give spoilers, so I will simply encourage everyone who has even the vaguest interest in Science Fiction to buy this book. Get the omnibus edition like I did - you won't be disappointed.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|A fabulous book!<br />With beautiful grammar, this book follows the unique story of a girl who has grown up with both a rough and a beautiful background. As the book slowly reveals information about the girl's upbringing, the reader increases in understanding of the character, creating something beautiful.<br />Honestly, I LOVED this read!
1892005034|4.0|I did like this book, but I've also had some communication training before and this was pretty similar.<br /><br />One of the things I didn't like about the book was that it focused more on what works rather than what does not.  To me this is like people who say America is the land of opportunity.  Yes, many people do find success, but most don't.  Success, when less than 1% are successful is the exception not the norm.  The same is true in communication.  There are many situations the author points out where it works, but if it really worked then he would be more successful and there would be a lot less conflict. :)<br /><br />Most books on assertiveness will give you similar advice to this one. I would recommend Nagle's books on Principled Non-Violence, which is more about the heart than the words.
B004P8ITGU|5.0|Although a book which seems to be appropriate for young adults as well as adults, this is a light story which follows Theodore Boone as he lives as an only child to a parent of lawyers- growing up in his parent's office and the court house-, and the adventures that happen to him. I really enjoyed
B003HKN52A|4.0|I loved the intensity that is shown of Elvis before a performance. This showed a side of him that I never knew. I believe that he really gave his all and it was very important for him to connect with his audience, He really needed that validation. Wish he would have known that he had it all along.
B0065GC0BA|2.0|Although this book was a light chick flick read that was ok, it was predictable, and very unlike the blurb- which made it sound like the girl would have an odd mind knowing the number of steps for everything etc.<br />It was ok, but not the best chick flick I've read, and disappointing
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I think this app is good it can help me tell how much battery I have and it reminds me that I am low on battery it is really cool
B0031R5K8G|5.0|Taken from the perspective of an odd and highly intelligent young man. Although originally set of a mystery, the author is taken on the journey of the innocent as he learns of life, love, and family. A GREAT book
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie is the clear example of how a movie should be.  Thor is just amazing, great storyline, some funny scenes too.  It is a must have.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Concise and informative and convincing description about dangers of high glycemic diet. Great motivation to improve one's diet.  Not too much science but enough to convince anyone who has no chemistry background
B0006VBFM0|5.0|I love this watch.  It perks up every outfit and draws compliments whenever I wear it.  Also, it goes with a lot of outfits because of all the colors in it.  And let me add, the fact that the numbers are large  and in white against a multi colored background makes it very easy to read!
B002UM5BXW|2.0|Perhaps \\"disdain\\" a little strong, but it rhymes with Bourdain. After enough people suggested I read Kitchen Confidential because of my behind the scenes reporting (positive) in the restaurant industry, I broke down and bought the book. Was interesting in first 50 pages, but got tiresome and repetitive over the praising of drug heads in restaurant kitchens and slamming of \\"clueless\\" owners.  Yawn.  Struggled to finish. Too many good things to read than waste my time with this mea culpa.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book cant wait to read book  two i really enjoyed reading cant wait to watch the movie again .
B001CDZZI6|3.0|It was a quick read and quick test to get a good summary of your strengths.<br />Not sure it was worth the price .  It was better than most tests online for free but still kind of general.
B0011E9LBI|1.0|Rented this movie - streaming.  1st hr was great.  then the movie stopped.  had to restart from the beginning.<br />Generally love Amazon, but this was a bad experience.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Best book i have read in quite some time. i cant wait to start the next book in the series
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love that this app exsists but it doesn't seem to show as many things as going through the actual web site.  I do experience fewer problems with my Kindle Fire freezing up thought!
B00684J49U|5.0|I love Greys Anatomy so when season 8 came out it was a no brainer to purchase it. This season follows the cast as they go through their residency review/exam and leaves you with a Cliffhanging season finale that makes sure you can't wait for the new season.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book, could not put it down. I loved his writing and      <br />suspense. I cant wait till there is another book by him.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Beautifully designed cover and disc first of all - very subtle and sophisticated.  Great album by a group that won't have to spend alot of time<br />reaching for the top - fully formed, with a really riveting lead singer.  I'm not a music critic, but there was only discovery and no disappointment in all aspects of this production....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I THOUGHT I WAS PLAYING THE GAME AT THE ARCADE OR LIKE A CHUCKEE CHEESE OR SOMETHING. ITS VERY FUN AND I HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOR A COUPLE HOURS NOW
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I wanted to know the truth about what happened the night Bin Laden was killed and this book certainly reeks of credibility. It gives the reader a first person view of the years of preparation and work that went into making the mission a success. Enough of the detailed planning and execution of the assault is provided without sacrificing the security of this country or the individuals involved.  I highly recommend this book for those interested in what really went down from a soldier's perspective, and in my opinion, our real heroes.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not live up to all the hype for me.  Was not the page turner excitement I was hoping for.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had to get the book because the premise sounded very interesting. I was very disappointed in the pacing in the first 1/3 of the book and the last 3/4. I had to force myself to read a chapter a night until I hit about the 1/3 mark, which is when I started to not want to put the book down. The same thing happened towards the end when the pace slowed down considerably and I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop that really never did. It turned out to be ok, I did not hate the ending as a lot of other people did. It seemed almost a natural end to the two characters that I had grown to despise and wish death upon to spare the world from their lunacy.<br /><br />Nick and Amy are two of those people that really bring out the best and worst of each other and it's never pretty. Amy starts out in the novel bugging me because she seemed like one of those women who \\"try\\" to get things perfect just so they can have the world feel sorry for them when it doesn't turn out so well. At least once we start learning about the real Amy it was somewhat exciting, even though her actions were horrific. Nick was an extremely self-centered person who seemed to always want to be in control, except he was able to find excuses to blame other people for the consequences of his actions. Neither person is a person one should root for really, which is what made the novel so exciting once we learn who Amy really is.<br /><br />I did find some of the novel unbelievable, which is one of the reasons I just can't rate it higher. There are little things here and there that really took me out of the story to say, \\"Come on! Really?!\\" The pacing is the other issue that I took off a star for. While the middle is really solid, the dragging at the beginning and end really bothered me. And like I said before, neither character is one you really root for, but it is one heck of a ride!
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|I'm very happy to finally have Raiders of the Lost Ark on Blu Ray, but the conversion isn't as good as I'd hoped.  It may be that they can only work with the quality of the original 35mm, and bringing a ton of clarity to it reveals flaws.  Most of the early part of the movie in South America is grainy as if the lighting was poor.  And you can see the focus go in and out during some of the cave scenes.  The color also seems a little over-saturated and the blacks are a little heavy.  I'm sure it's better than standard definition, but it didn't come out as well as the Blu Ray release of Star Wars.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app provides good information! The information is handy for monitoring equipment during travel. A must have for someone on the go!
B007JF8NRQ|5.0|LOVED season two just as much as season one!!! Won't say more so as not to give anything away for those who have not yet viewed all the episodes.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|EVeryone in this film did a wonderful job.  I had the most sympathy for Kenneth Branagh's character as I think being late and making people wait is pretty inconsiderate and unprofessional.  After watching this, I will read the book it is based upon.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Some of the major characters died but there wasn't much lamentation about it. To be honest I was a bit disappointed by the end.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The final book tells how it all ends.  It has it's ups and downs but all in all it was a good read.  If you have read the other 2 I definitely recommend you read this as well.  I cannot wait to see the movie version of this triolgy.
B0051T46XM|5.0|There are reviews on here complaining about having to read subtitles... if that is one of your main complaints, you have no business watching films. Part of watching film is to be exposed to foreign films and other cultures. If you can't watch a movie with subtitles, you shouldn't really be watching movies period, instead, you should learn to breathe through your nose. As far as people complaining about the premise, get real. Movies are invented and designed to be escapism and entertaining. Not all movies are supposed to be thought provoking or contenders for stupid ass academy awards. This movie is for people who like fantasy, fairy tales and foreign films. If you like any or all 3 of those things, you'll like this movie. This movie goes to show what can be done with a modest budget and still somehow look like a 15 million dollar plus, movie. While not much can be said about the cinematography as it is all shot on digital camcorders, the shots of the Norwegian country side, pacing and effects layer an otherwise simple plot, (hunting trolls) and make it very entertaining and watchable. The acting is good and seems genuine and not cheesy, the tension builds rather well and the third act is well done and not predictable like most Hollywood movies. People on here reviewing this movie negatively are probably the same people who go to the theater to watch Fast and the Furious 6. In other words, they don't know s#*% about what makes a good movie. Watch the trailer, if you like what you see, you'll like the movie even more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so awesome I love it I have become addicted to it did I meantion that I love it
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I saw this with my girlfriend when it was re-released in 3D this year and we ended up liking it so much I knew I had to get it for her. While most of James Cameron's movies tend to be the same (two characters in love from different places who struggle to stay together i.e. The abyss, avatar and true lies) I like his movies a lot. While they push the boundaries on cutting edge technology and effects, they aren't just some blockbuster, special effects extravaganza for the sake of making money. They are stories with meaning, value and intent. The special features on this are a testament to that statement with specials like the hour and a half long documentary, the final word. This is a bunch of scholars, navy men and engineers along with James Cameron discussing the eye witness accounts of RMS Titanic survivors as well as tracking the debris field of the wreck to find out exactly how the ship sank and came to rest where it did and how maybe knowing all of this could have resulted in less lives being lost during the sinking of the ship. There is also a great chunk of 57 minutes worth of deleted scenes and plenty of other features. This movie pops on Blu-Ray and is well worth the affordable price. I didn't care much for this movie as a kid but as an adult I really liked watching this and like it more and more as I learn about how it was made. Plus, it's got female nudity so that's a plus.
0307463745|5.0|Read this book if you're trying to do something. Read other books if you're trying to read something to help you do something.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I had seen parts of this film before, but finally went ahead and \\"rented\\" a video here and it was simply delightful. The first 10 minutes or so is one of my favorite pieces in any \\"children's\\" film, although this is obviously meant to be a movie for all ages in the real sense of the phrase. The voice acting is wonderful, the characters funny and experiencing a journey, and the jokes don't get too trite or overly simplistic. Great fun for everyone whether you've got kids, want to watch something fun on a quiet night in, or are looking for a nice group movie. Highly recommended! The Amazon streaming quality was quite good, although occasionally a little choppy. However, I'm not sure if that was their fault or the internet connection. Watch it ASAP!
B00932A2MC|4.0|Is it the best movie ever no, but it is entertaining.  I thought putting the USS Missouri back into service was a little over the top.
B008XG1X18|4.0|the app is really User friendly. would recommend anyone who pins like crazy to use the app! I think I would rather use the app than going to the actual site!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Love this series. I love being able to watch it on my lap top as well.  Acting ifs great and the plots from each season keep you interested.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book was a great read! I now know what all the hype was about. Loved the other two as well!
B008FOB124|5.0|After years of separation DCD is back together with their gothic west meets east world music with songs warnings of life's dangers. Brendan Perry in the 1st set of songs sounds a little older & worn out, that it took me a while to retune myself to know it was him singing. Lisa Gerrard is still in top form with one of the world's unique eerie alto/soprano voices. A few reviews on Amazon write that this CD is more of a Brendan Perry affair but I disagree, the same portions exist as they did before. Maybe it's because Brendan Perry sings in words while Lisa Gerrard sings in sound chants which make Brendan Perry SEEM to be more upfront. Some reviewers write that the poetry is not up to pare, but then again the last song \\"All in Good Time\\" blows my mind about setting sail into the Sargasso sea waiting for the wind to climb the spiritual heights of patience while praying for lost souls below. Recording is top notch as always with small details within ear shot. Only complaint is that the music is basically Minimalist Classical music written within a Dark POP style. In other words: most songs start out very stark, add instruments & or sub themes all within a timed drum or cymbal beat, then the main singer comes within a minute of the song giving the main tune. Past CD's were less repetitive & had more advance melodies. This CD has better music & words than \\"Spiritchaser\\" which I could never get into. Maybe it went one step too far beyond what Dead Can Dance can normally express. In all, the reunion is a true Resurrection experience.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|India and people starting over.  I looked forward to the film because of the wonderful actors, as well as the premise on which the film was based.  I was surprised by the movie, but not disappointed.  It was a little depressing but uplifting at the same time.  A dichotomy to be sure.  I love Judy Dench.  She NEVER gives a bad performance.  The movie shows a \\"never give up,\\" and \\"it's never too late,\\" attitude.  It's a film about people finding themselves, after pretending to be someone else (wife, mother, husband), for most of their lives.  It's a movie about making amends, facing the truth, letting go and healing.  It's about taking a stand. It's about finding new love and reigniting love that was lost.  It's about young and old people needing each other and working together in order to make new and successful lives for themselves.  I liked it and if you watch it, I hope you like it as well.
0393327345|5.0|The book Fight Club is wonderful! Not a lot of people know that the movie, made in 1999, was actually based off the book. As an avid movie watcher and reader I really appriciated the fact that the movie was very similar to the book. More often than not, you can take direct lines from the book and find them word for word in the movie.  If you are looking for an extrordinarily out of the ordinary book, look no further!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Wonderful music and if you haven't seen the movie, don't miss it. I feel compelled to complain about the recording. I ripped the cd to wav files and took a look on Audadcity and and Foobar. Foobar has a dynamic range meter. The recording engineer just couldn't resist compressing the crap out of the music to make it louder. DAMN him. Foobar gives the music a dynamic range of 7. This is not the worst I have seen, six is, but pretty bad. I would like to punch him right between his tin ears.

B009157BWU|5.0|this is a film for any age group.  It was as if I were in the jungle with this little fellow, and did not want to leave.  The story is beautifully told, and I highly reccoment it to anyone with a heart!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I looked forward to this movie for a long time as my husband and I don't go to theaters very often. I was somewhat disappointed in this film.
0525953728|5.0|I haven't read a book since I was in High School over 20 years ago. I'm more into Documentary films and have never really been into books. I saw this Seal (Mark Owen) on one of the segments of 60 Minutes and have read a ton of reviews about this book here on Amazon, and ever since then I have been very interested in this book.<br /><br />My own opinion - This book is written well enough to where I understand everything he is trying to get the reader to understand. Its not a difficult book by any means. I remember when I was reading books back in the day (20+ years ago) my mind would wander and my focus was not 100% into what I was reading. I have found when reading this book my mind is so focused on the story he is telling and I've never been so excited to read a book, until now. We all by now know the Seal's real name but I'm not gonna mention his real name. aka Mark Owen has done an outstanding job with telling his story within this book. I am very (110%) satisfied with the purchase, and very happy that I'm into reading this book. I never want to stop reading because I want to see what he has to say next.<br /><br />Mark states in the Author's note:<br />\\"I've also taken great pains to protect the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the teams as they wage a daily battle against terrorists and insurgents around the world. If you are looking for secrets, this book is not for you.\\"<br /><br />If you are looking for a great book that keeps you wanting to read more and has a great storyline, then this is the book for you....

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I had no expectations of this film, other than a hope that it would be done right. To stick like glue to the source material would have killed it immediately, as the book was originally written in serial form, requiring an absurd amount of cliffhangers for a motion picture. Fortunately the liberties taken were done with integrity, and remained faithful to the spirit and soul of the original text.<br /><br />I was totally immersed in the epicness of it all, such that there were only a few moments were I was reminded that \\"that has to be CGI!\\" - and that was usually after the fact! That's pretty impressive for a film that has multi-limbed creatures in it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour. Buy it. Watch it. And enjoy! My 13 and 11 y.o. sons and 9 y.o. daughter loved it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A very controvertial topic. A good read which kept you interested all the way.I would recomend the book to anyone. Love this Author.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The mysterious looking cover of the book lured me into reading the reviews of the story and that lured me into buying the book.<br /><br />\\"Pines\\" was my first choice on my new Kindle.  Crouch is a new author for me and I enjoyed his talented imagination.  His story was a real mystery for me because I was unable to figure out what was taking place and why.  Loved sitting on the edge of my seat with his \\"page turner\\" and I'll be seeking out more of his writings. The story was unlike anything I've read before.  You can be sure that I will seek out another of his novels.  Thank you for your unique imagination Mr. Crouch!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Not even Liam Neeson can save this dismal tale set in Ancient Greece in the time of the gods. To fair, it's not Neeson's fault that he has such horrible storytellers - an even worse director and special effects that are so painfully obvious, you feel like you are watching a computer game rather than a major motion picture. I have all the respect in the world for the leading actors of the cast but this is just such a monumental waste of time. You can't care about the main characters much less the villains, the sense of danger is laughable and the single redeeming feature of this entire film is 'release the Kraken!!!'

B008MAI0WK|2.0|It is very simple at all. Maybe it is so because it was supposed to be read by children. As other buyers said, this book must be the missing basic manual attached to the Raspberry Pi.

B0028O34SG|5.0|This production and performance of Le Nozze di Figaro recorded in 2006 at the Royal Opera is, arguably, as close to perfection as anyone has the right to dream of.<br /><br />There are so many superlatives that it is almost too difficult to know where to start. However, one must try ...! To start with, the production by David MacVicar is one of his most inspired, brimming over with good humour, drama and relevant incidental detail that add considerably to the suspension of belief so essential and critical to any stage production. In this production every single character comes alive before our very eyes and with total credibility. This is a notable achievement and needs to be recognised and applauded.<br /><br />The cast are uniformly excellent and are all in fine voice and, most importantly, are of that generation that can really act as if in real life rather than acting that they are acting as so often used to occur. Clearly the current generation of singers represented here have been properly taught to act as well as sing and additionally, to be very camera aware. Consequently we, the home audience, benefit from this adjusted emphasis within training apparent in so many recorded performances. These are true singer/actors and in this production they are a particularly gifted team that gels from the first to the last moment. This summary also applies to the excellent chorus. Throughout the performance one is aware that the audience is fully engaged with much amusement to be heard at the appropriate times as well as spontaneous and enthusiastic applause at points such as the countess's fine `Dove sono' in act 3 to mention but one such moment.<br /><br />To expand - Edwin Schrott and Miah Person make an ideally matched Figaro and Susanna. The same can be said for the coupling of Philip Langridge and Graciela Araya as Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina while Jonathan Veira provides a highly amusing Bartolo. The highly experienced Gerald Finley is a strong but properly misguided and repentant Almavira and Dorothea Roschmann gives the countess a greater dignified authority than often occurs and therefore is shown to be the correct wife for the count. Rinat Shaham delivers a youthfully inexperienced but lustful Cherubino and seems well partnered finally by the Barbarina of Ana James.<br /><br />The orchestra is in excellent form and the whole production sparkles under the forward and attentively detailed conducting of Antonio Pappano.<br /><br />The recording is very well captured with crisp and detailed imaging that is fully involving without being invasive. Enough space is allowed to enable the production to breathe and not to become claustrophobic in visual effect. The sound is excellent and is presented in 5.0 surround sound as well as stereo.<br /><br />There is an interesting booklet that contains an essay by MacVicar. The extras also feature short interviews with MacVicar, Pappano and principal cast members as well as an illustrated synopsis and the usual cast gallery typical of Opus Arte productions.<br /><br />To conclude, I would suggest that this disc offers a performance and recording that amounts to a very special audio-video experience indeed and one that is likely to give a great number of purchasers considerable satisfaction, enjoyment and musical reward.a and Dorothea Roschmann gives the countess a greater dignified authority than often occurs and therefore is shown to be the correct wife for the count.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Loved the fantastical story line. I loved the pace as well. I was a little disappointed in how things were resolved, but loved the book nonetheless.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My daugther told me about the books & I thought, why not give them a try.  I really enjoyed them, enought to read the series twice.  Now I have my husband reading 50 Shades of Grey & we will see what his reaction is!  I definitely would not advise someone underage reading them but would recommend them to all of my friends!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game! I couldn't put it down. Great animation. Creative story! I cant wait for the second installment! I am sure the second will be just as great as the first!
6305428050|5.0|This is a very humorous and entertaining family-rated movie that will be enjoyed over and over.<br /><br />Humorous because it could be so true in your own home.
B005HSL626|2.0|sort of cool but not the best but I guse I don't play it that much.but still its not that fun.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Too immature for words!!! This book appears to have been written by a a junior high student who had spent way too much time on an adult toy site. The writing is poor, and the plot is one-dimensional. Half of the book was her blushing, biting her lip and clenching her pelvic muscles, and the other half was using terms such \\"as on my sex\\", \\"over my sex\\" and \\"in my sex\\" etc.  The author needs a class in biology or at least street slang.  How dense is the main character?  The small rounds scars on his chest are cigarette burns... you idiot.  The characters are unbelievable, and the plot inane.  I fell for the hype, but I can promise you I wouldn't be stupid enough to buy the next volume.
B004MPESSY|4.0|Descent remake of a classic 70's film.  This one was a bit more graphic than the original, but it you can handle it....it was good!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think most of the games are fun. it gets addicting after a while. I would definently recommend this to others.
0805095535|2.0|Winter Journal by Paul Auster starts out very entertaining - it is, after all, my own time line and childhood.  But Mr. Auster quickly gets the reader bogged  down in his on heavy baggage of life which I found quite dreary and I labored to get through the rest of this thoroughly uninteresting autobiography.  I once again got sucked in by up front advertising on a book only to be quite disappointed by the complete reading.  I tossed it out - not even worthy of recycling the paper it was printed on.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I am not impressed with the MicroShell case cover.  It shows every finger print and the stand is not as impressive as they made it out to be in the video.  It does however keep the Kindle safe from damage to the screen.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app! Large selection of free puzzles in many genres enough to satisfy most tastes. Easy to use and would highly recommend.
0345803485|5.0|This book was great! I read it in two days and was so anxious to get the second one! It has a great story line and I love the characters in it. I'm sure all women would like to find themselves a Christian Gray!
B007M45PMU|5.0|This album is fantastic.  The Lumineers effortlessly take us from subtle, mountain-top born melodies to foot-stompin' choruses.  The song writing is inspired and the performances and production value are top notch.  Highly recommended.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|I am a huge fan of the books and the other movies, so I loved it. However I should point out it is a bit choppy in the transitions, might be a little confusing if you don't have some background knowledge of whats going on, and a few things to be questioned... All the negative aside, it is a wonder piece of CG work, the graphics are amazing, the fight scenes (some are a little stupid) are mostly awesome and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in seeing some bugs die and not really caring why.
B008OHV5HS|4.0|Threshold have returned with their long-awaited follow up to Dead Reckoning. In the meantime they've undergone some changes, particularly the departure (and subsequent passing) of lead singer \\"Mac\\" and the return of original singer Damian Wilson.<br /><br />At first I was a bit worried about whether Damian was the right choice - his voice can sound a bit unique and and while it works well in multi-singer projects I have found it less successful when he's the only singer on an entire album. However, he exceeded my expectations here. Damian shows a versatility to his singing and sides to his voice that I wasn't aware he had - there were a few places I had to check the liner notes to see if they'd brought on a guest vocalist. He really knocks it out of the park with his performance - by far the best work I've heard from him.<br /><br />The rest of the album is pretty much what you'd expect from Threshold. They've found their identity and stick to it. There are some similarities with their earlier album Extinct Instinct but with a more mature and developed sound. They don't break a lot of new ground or deviate too much from what they've done before, but rather focus on doing what they know best with a few minor tweaks to the formula. They sometimes get classified as \\"progressive metal\\" because they add a bit of complexity to their music, but they aren't really \\"progressive\\" - I'd consider them more technical/symphonic.<br /><br />The sound and production are great on the album. The songs are individually fairly strong with a good mix of hooks, melodies, and technical playing, though some are dragged on maybe a bit longer than necessary. Overall I really like this album and think most Threshold fans will like it, even those who weren't big fans of their early albums with Damian Wilson.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|An amazing followup to The Xx, Coexist invokes a subtle meditation. I listened to the pre-release stream while working to familiarize myself with the songs, and although I left it at a background volume level, I found the hooks getting stuck in my head (in a good way, not an obnoxious Top 40 way.) It's hypnotic to say the least, I'm not sure what people were hoping for in a second album, but this is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />I can't read a review without wanting to put my headphone on and zone out for a little while. Great for long drives, work music, background music during dinner, impromptu late light listening parties, and any other time you want to de-stress.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I saw this movie with my 7yo daughter twice, and she liked it - but not even remotely as much as she loved \\"Ratatouille\\", \\"Happy Feet\\" or \\"Over the Hedge\\". Me however, I enjoyed it a lot, because most of the jokes are targeting adults, rather than children.<br /><br />The hero, Barry Bee Benson, is a sceptical bee, reluctant to accept his fate, which is well resumed by this exchange \\"You want to work us to death?\\" \\"Precisely!\\". So, rather than working all his life in just one place and doing just one job, he will look for at least some adventure... and he will find plenty of it. And he will find love... purely platonic, but intense, with a woman - human woman.<br /><br />The movie is smart and funny, and although it is not a masterpiece, I five star it without hesitation. There are many reasons for that: the trial \\"All the Bee's of the world vs. All humankind\\" is a delight (with Sting and Ray Liotta being called as witnesses...), the scene of morning take off of the pollen gatherers from the hive is a great remake of the similar scene from \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\", and the final race in plane looks almost as funny as the \\"Airplane!\\". You will certainly also appreciate all the jokes on bees/other insects tragic love stories...<br /><br />One advice however - really young children (younger than 6) will probably get a little bored with this movie. But considering that there is in average one gag or joke every 30 seconds, you will still get a fair deal.
0345803485|3.0|The following is adapted from Dave Barry's \\"Guide to Guys.\\"<br /><br />Joe and Ben are on the golf course on a Sunday morning.  The night before, Joe had his first official date with Elaine.  The entire exchange is as follows:<br /><br /> Ben:  \\"How was your date with Elaine?\\"<br /> Joe:  \\"Fine.\\"<br /> Ben:  \\"Get laid?\\"<br /> Joe:  \\"Yep.\\"<br /> Ben:  \\"Great.  How `bout them Chargers?\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Elaine is having lunch with her friend Dolores.  For two and a half hours, Elaine will recount, and Dolores will demand, every detail of the encounter--every word, touch, gesture, sigh, and silence; what she thought it meant and how it made her feel.<br /><br />Ana, the virginal 21-year-old protagonist in E. L. James's novella, is Elaine-to-the-max.  The entire book consists of her talking to herself inside her ditzy head.  Its huge success, especially among women, suggests that that James has hit on a core female fantasy.  We guys should pay attention.<br /><br />What lessons should we take away?  A superficial view would be this: If you want to really turn on your woman, you should, first, be a 27-year-old indescribably handsome billionaire with a bit of little-boy winsomeness and a penchant for domination and bondage.  Second, you should treat her with bemused dismissiveness and gentle but insistent domination.  Really?  Good to know.  But that's not the whole story.<br /><br />I've asked a bunch of women what is so erotic about this book.  Turns out it is not just Christian's youth, wealth, good looks, and little-boy vulnerability.  Those are  big.  But what is really gripping is something as old as all romantic literature: drawn-out sexual tension.  He makes it clear to Ana early that he wants her and is determined to have her.  But consummation does not come until late in the book.  Anticipation.  That's what grabs and holds.  Thanks, ladies.
0385344333|5.0|I enjoyed this Reacher novel far more than the last few efforts. I actually enjoyed the slow build-up with Reacher as hitchhiker and his observations and deductions about his travel companion. Because Child used short chapters, I was able to start and stop frequently over a few days without losing the plot thread, and I felt that the deductions that Reacher made about the smallest details of his situation were fascinating, and well integrated into the story. The pace was deliberate, not slow, but as each new character was introduced we learn more about the complex plot into which Reacher was thrust. Bringing all of this to a satisfactory conclusion is done nicely, and unlike some others Reacher novels that end with an explosive final chapter, this one is very nicely paced and builds to a conclusion that develops over a longer period of time. This was the best done in this series in quite a while. I know some other readers will disagree, but I am more tolerant of slower pacing in service of character than many others.
B003QSMCKO|3.0|It was quick and easy to upload the video, but the quality was lacking. It was fuzzy or grainy through most of it. It looked like it has been taped in movie theatre.

0441013597|5.0|A lot of great sci-fi focuses on the effect the technological environment has on the people within it. Few if any sci-fi works do this better than Dune. The anti-technology Butlerian Jihad highlights that. Like many of the classics, it creates a brilliant setting, but goes above and beyond with that.<br /><br />With the political intrigue that dominates the setting, it's appropriate that Paul's outmanuevering of the Emperor is a key part of the climax, one of my many favorite scenes. Irulan as part of the deal (not to mention Leto keeping Jessica as a legal concubine) highlighted marriage as pragmatic, while the bit about viewing Chani as his real wife also highlighted marriage as romantic.<br /><br />I first noticed Paul's story as a bildungsroman (about a young character mentally growing up), but it also seems to fit the hero's journey archetype.<br /><br />Herbert has a brilliant way of handling religion.

0385360177|5.0|I was surprised at the flow through all 3 books.  I don't agree with the lifestyle but the story line was great and well written.  Everyone I know has read the trilogy so I had to get the CDs.
0451232577|5.0|As with Follett's other series, this first book is a winner.  It runs the gamut--imperialism, world war, political upheaval to socialism.  Makes the point for the need for a labour movement to what happens when change of power, supposedly for the good, becomes absolute and corrupts as completely as what it was replacing.  Actually makes a case for what's occurring in society today.  Can't wait to see the next chapter for these characters.
0545265355|5.0|Saw move first but very happy to read the book. Book had more detail so don't be shy on buying the books after seeing the movie.  Half way through 2nd book & still riveted.  You find yourself immersed in with the characters and feel what they feel.  A great way to spend your spare time.

0062071017|4.0|Just finished \\"The Strategist. Be the Leader Your Business Needs\\" by Cynthia Montgomery. The examples and content come from Prof Montgomery's teaching in the \\"Owner, President, Manager Program (OPM)\\" at Harvard Business School, where she leads the strategy track. The strategy content is based on (true and tested) Porterian view of strategy (industry perspective, five forces) and some older, more descriptive material (\\"Wheel of Strategy\\"). Montgomery also emphasizes purpose = vision/mission as key to successful strategy. My favorite part of the book is some less well-known case studies, e.g., Gucci.
B008602KQI|4.0|I don't know about anyone else, but I buy DVD's for the extras.  I know the movie - I've generally seen it in the theater before I decide to buy the DVD.  Hunger Games did a good job of being true to the story while reducing the potential gore - I really liked that.  I also think the cast did a great job of bringing their characters to life.<br /><br />The extras are educational and give a lot of insight about what the producers and director process was, but where was the fun?  Where was the commentary with the actors, the blooper real, the challenges?  This might seem like I'm focusing on fluff.  But honestly, a story like this needs a little levity for balance.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|the reason as to why i did not rate this game a 5 star is because the game itself is good but the camera controls and how you control the horse is so frustrating. otherwise it is a good game.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonamassa, born on Robert Johnson's birthday on May 8th, 1977 in Utica, New York.<br /><br />As the story goes Cream's Farewell video was a defining moment in Joe's life. Joe said that he wanted to learn guitar and that he planned to play RAH one day like his hero Eric Clapton.<br /><br />Starting at the age of five, while most boys his age were out climbing trees, Joe was spending countless hours practicing guitar. At the age of twelve he opened for blues legend B.B. King.<br /><br />This RAH Concert is the realization of a life long dream for Joe and after 20 years of dedication and hard work he has made it.<br /><br />This two disc set is flawless from the content to the camera work. I felt like I was there, glowing with pride as Joe reached the pinnacle of his career.<br /><br />This is not only a magical moment for Joe, but for all his fans, including myself. On May 4th, 2009 during this historic concert, the circle would be completed when Mr. Eric Clapton passes on the torch to the future blues-rock guitar god of the world  Mr. Joe Bonamassa.<br /><br />You can see it in Eric's eyes and demeanor. The look of pride and respect, the smile pasted across his face. And if you are passing the torch, who better to be on the receiving end than Joe. A person who deserves, has worked for and will respect his new position.<br /><br />I will not go through the highlights of the concert as it is all ONE BIG HIGHLIGHT. From start to finish this is excellence.
0345803485|1.0|I just couldn't take the \\"woman doing anything to please her man\\" thing. It made me sick because she was denying her needs and values to be with a man. It speaks to an entire generation of women in America who don't value themselves but rather rely on the opinions of others to shape their self-esteem - I'm quite disgusted with the author for perpetuating this. While making it all okay in the end, that isn't going to be the case for 99% of women/girls who find themselves in precarious situations --- her writing is irresponsible and offensive.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|This puzzle game is super cute! my 2 1/2 year old loves it and will play it for 30 minutes at a time. the graphics and sounds are really cute. this was a great purchase!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|another forced review for updates. I just Downloaded the game,  but it seems like a typical glue game. play forever, win little money for upgrades.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Having read many of Michael Connelly's books, I was so pleased to learn the life story of Harry Bosch.  I wish I had read it first so I would have understood Harry's personality.  However, I wonder if his romantic life will be any happier than it's been in other books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My Kindle for Droid drives most of my decisions when I buy a new phone. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment in situations in which I was normally a prisoner to boredom: Doctor's waiting rooms [No, I'm not interested in the July 2010 Popular Mechanics], super market checkout lines, Subway lines during rush, the throne room, and such. I got the GS3 for its large screen and reading books, as much as any other reason. One reviewer said he's had trouble synching between user devices on the same book; never had that problem and on the rare occasion I do lose my place, the table of contents will get me awfully close. Just a great app and it pairs well with buying new Kindle books with my GS3's Amazon app. Wow, what a dangerous capability: One-click buying on Amazon!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I heard about it and everyone was saying it was a great trilogy but I never thought it would be this good!  Recommended for adults only.
1423136802|5.0|This is a nice boxed set.  My son bought this and other books with his Amazon gift card.  He is pleased with the books and my 6 year old seems to think he is reading them also!! :)  Happy with the purchase. Good reading for mom also!
B005XT4932|5.0|I am so happy I found this finally - the anthem \\"Tonight is what it means to be young\\" is an amazing finish to a movie that was truly underrated and underappreciated in it's time!  For those of us that are no longer in our teens or 20's (or 30s or 40s for that matter) it is an awesome reminder of the fire we felt at that age - and what it means to be young!  We were invincible and could do anything we set our minds to do - something that seems to have been largely lost today!
030746363X|5.0|Loved the book the workout actually work less is more sometimes I can't wait until tim writes another book you have to make it work for you
B0035XVVDY|5.0|If you like cerebral crime movies... this is the movie for you. Don't try and figure it out just let it develop and you will love it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|For me, as for the non-native English speaker/reader is that book fantastic in very easy, military style of writing. If you´re in military, you love to have things easy, and this book is written very readably. You can easily imagine yourself in there with SEAL guys, because of the dramatic and realistic description of all events.<br />Thank to the author not just for this book, but mainly for his effort to the GWOT.
0553382179|5.0|Who knew cleaning could be so much fun, and feel like such a blessing to my home!  I am so grateful that a dear friend introduced me to the world of Fly Lady.  This book is thorough, inspiring, and life changing.  I recommend this book to every person inhabiting a space on the planet.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This has turned out to be my favorite app.  I downloaded it thinking I &quot;might&quot; use it a little.  Wow!  Was I wrong!  I use it almost every day!  I love it!!!
0452289963|5.0|Start with this book!  Start what, exactly, is up to you.  This is the first book I can truly say has changed my life.  I thank Oprah for steering me towards it years ago and I thank Eckhart for sharing it with humanity.  Forever grateful for the information and I 100% recommend this book to every human.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Star-studded is not a cliche for this movie. Superb acting and a delightful, thought-provoking yet immensely entertaining movie. I can't wait to see it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I aboslutely loved this trilogy!!  This book made me feel sad, nervous, happy, excited, mad and jealous and I loved it!!!!!  Fifty Shades Freed has got to be one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  I LOVED how the author was not afraid to write such explicitly erotic moments between Christian and Anastasia but still make it known that there was love between the two characters. We need more writers like E.L. James, writers that are not afraid to just write down exactly what they're thinking!!  I found myself in their life and wanting to be Anastasia and really wanting my own live Christian!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Hard to know what to do, not what I thought it would be, not fun.....should have been labeled something else.  title is mis leadindg
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The entire series was captivating. One of the best series I have ever read. I convinced my sister to read it too and now we can't stop talking about it.
B006H5120E|5.0|I didn't buy on here but still I wanna say best movie i have seen so far on blu-ray with the exception of Jarassic park dvd blu-ray set. Beautiful color and great sound. Can't believe it took them this long to put on dvd. I'm just in awe on how great it is. You can't go wrong with this movie. Even if you have an old copy I would go get it and be amazed by the picture. This is one movie you can't go wrong with. I give 5 stars for this movie.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Be lured in by the game's simplicity, and play for quite a while as you figure out the means to the end. And be efficient at it too for a bonus! This game could keep one occupied for a while.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is another SEAL book.  Tough, committed, patriotic, ALL HEROES.  Luck of the draw for those chosen to participate on this Mission.<br /><br />To this particular SEAL, THANK YOU and GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR TEAM for taking OBL out.  It should have happened sooner.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Thakyou for an app that is an olde, and put your thinking cap on. I enjoy<br />chess and am not always able to find a partner, the computer has a nice range of challenge ability. Graphics are good on the eye. Good free app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its fun and free and its kind of difficult but then its easy and cool to play with friendds and family
B0087HT36U|2.0|Make it so it is playable on a tablet not a small screen phone.  But good for a free app of the day
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Brand new tools and obstacles, same award-winning  interface. Movable forks, suicide moves, red drops, and gate crashers. New leaderboard and achievements.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book!  The characters were well developed and their motives were pure (even the bad guys).  The world in the Silo was so perfectly described and well thought out I could picture it in great detail.  I also appreciated that the scenes were believable.  Seems like I often find myself rolling my eyes at books where the hero is moving buildings with their bare hands and such, but not with Wool.<br /><br />Looking forward to future books by this author.
B0036EH3U2|4.0|In the beginning (2003), this had two major strikes against it -- it was a show coming from that godawful channel (which is still pretty awful, btw), and it was --to judge by the title-- a re-make. So I ignored it during its run, although rumors and recommendations piled up, but I waited still more, despite the intriguing nerve of some friends to actually compare it to the all-time SF great \\"Blade Runner.\\" Then the entire show was done, and released to DVD and Blu-Ray. I read the glowing detailed review over at thedigitalbits.com, decided to let it wait even more, until I made the switch to Blu-Ray. Besides, the first release had bunches of notorious packaging issues that have since been resolved by the second release. Then I did switch to Blu-Ray in Sept 2011 (for Star Wars, my template). Finally, after trying to haggle with the local Best Buy and Barnes and Noble, I actually got the set this spring.... here.... on Amazon.com. (It's a bit of a tragedy that we are less and less able to get things off-line anymore....)<br /><br />I had watched the original series a few years ago in \\"preparation\\" for this -- the new series jettisons most connections quickly. This is as hardcore and as serious as SF drama can get, and that's no light praise -- I can be Very critical, especially of recent (ie, last 20 years') attempts at SF. While there are inevitable stumbles that effect any TV show, BSG Redux is so busy with great plots and characters that most such mistakes will be quickly glossed over, or turned around, or changed into a much improved scenario. Any characters that I had a hard time appreciating or taking seriously at first usually improved over time, either on his/her own, or through the miracle of Cylon replica(n)tion.<br /><br />Dynamic visuals, set decorations, good props: check<br /><br />Complex interactions and issues, dealt with realistically and with dramatic flair: 90% of the time, and always enough to keep people talking, guessing, speculating; quick n' easy spoon-fed solutions are few and far between here. It's all about the questions, not the answers.<br /><br />Sound design: mostly really good. For some reason, some of the dialogue is strangely a little bit off balance, but hey, that's partly what subtitles are for.<br /><br />Music Score: Well, at first, and a lot of the time, it's just drums...you know....*military*, complete with vaguely Irish-Scotch anthemy-type stuff. Then, starting with the vaguely \\"Bolero\\"-type piece from the first season finale, the score grows.....and grows ever more complex and beautiful and engaging. Even \\"All Along the WatchTower,\\" so strangely and awkwardly forced into Sn 3's finale, grows into an engaging plot point later on.  Season 4 is full of great scoring, and everyone pitches in during the final episodes, pulling no stops, as documented in that season's documentaries about the music. (Compared to the really weird parody of a doc about music for Sn3)<br /><br />Extras: Commentaries, a mass of deleted or alternate scenes for most episodes, silly (but kind o' fun) games, ok vid-blogs, behind/scenes stuff, mostly a fairly standard selection, with a few standouts, including the infamously funny \\"What the Frak\\" recap of Sn.s 1-3.<br /><br />In some cases there are extended versions of a handful of episodes -- always watch the extended versions.<br />Most of the webisode sets are here, except for \\"Face of the Enemy\\" (mid season-4), but I had no problems watching it on Hulu.<br /><br />Also, a quick note about viewing order. I've seen others' recommendations (you can do a search and see those lists, too). Here's my take:<br />1) The 2003 miniseries, and Season 1<br />2) Season 2<br />3) \\"Resistance\\" webisodes (Sn3, Dc2)<br />4) 3x9 \\"Unfinished Business\\" extended episode -- very much a flashbacky story anyway<br />5) \\"Razor flashbacks\\", then \\"Razor\\" (Sn4, Dc 1)<br />6) Season 3<br />7) Season 4, with \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes between episodes 10 & 11<br />As for \\"The Plan,\\" there are many options. A lot of the story takes places before and during the first two seasons of the show -- however, just after Sn2 is still too soon to watch this. The best time to watch this is any time between mid-Sn3 and mid-Sn4. Sure, there's a risk of still spoiling a major Sn3 finale development, but not very muchly. To watch \\"Plan\\" after the series just exposes it for what it really is--- a bit of an anti-climax.e many options.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Beware, this game is very addictive.  Just like pictionary, but you have to have a touchscreen phone for it to work.  I just wish it was available for Windows phones.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Kevin Costner produced, told and acted the most authentic story of Wyatt Earp there is. Tombstone is too Hollywood. Historic and romantic.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|This is an awesome season, but I wouldn't watch it before I had seen the prior seasons. Weird how you are basically rooting for a serial killer, typically the \\"bad\\" guy.  But hey, he only kills bad guys, right?!!  If this series doesn't hook you from season 1, you are probably already dead.
B007MG360G|5.0|We really enjoy this game.  Keep up the good work!!! Cute pictures & the voice is funny too. Whimsical & fun to play
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is da BOMB!  The quality is really good for something you wouldn't think it would be that good for. The controls are simple and easy.  I personally prefer creative but different people have different preferences.  This is totally worth the $7.
0345802934|5.0|This is quite a book. So many themes and things to think about, with enjoyable characters and a plot that rolls along and keeps you turning the pages. The three volume paperback set is the way to go, as it's much easier to handle than the huge hardcover. One of the few books I really think I should read again, just to see what I missed the first time. And it would be a pleasure.
0525953728|5.0|LOVE this book.  Started reading and couldn't put it down.  It's nice to read a first-hand account without any media spin.  It's very interesting and entertaining and sates the hunger to know what really happened that day.  Well-written, great book.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|It's not as complicated as it looks in the promotion pictures. And the so-called 100 levels just means that it contians about 100 difficult corners, transfers or so, but not 100 ways of playing. But it's well act its function to me.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|A very informative and detailed guide on how to build book for kindle. I benefit from the tips shared in the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I could play it 24/7 I have school its awesome totally not a waste of money I love it and I bet you might to it deapends if your awesome like me lol
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My two boys (ages 10 and 12) downloaded this game. I don't play it, but they play it pretty consistently.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The concept of this story was rather interesting.  I wouldn't call it a page turner exactly but I wasn't bored.  The characters seemed well developed and the story moved at a nice pace.  The climax however was a let down and then the book just suddenly ends.  There is no closure.  It seems the writer just got tired and ended the book.  I actually thought I missed a chapter somehow.  Needless to say I was dissapointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm a late comer to this series, maybe a bit put off by all the 'celebrity' that the movie garnered which I have not yet seen. But I was wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong, I am so sucked into this book. Its awesome. And so timely. I'm on number three now, Mockingjay and cannot put it down.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|The book was mostly about preparing for excursions.  To me the book was boring..A guy might enjoy it if they enjoy combat.  A struggle for me to get through it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a book that I just couldn't put down. Well written and eloquent however the ending left something to be desired.
0066620996|5.0|I loved the way the book started - Good is the enemy of great.<br /><br />I have read a few business books, but soon I realized that this book is meant particularly for people who are already in some kind of managerial/entrepreneurial position.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed the Hedgehog concept, the later chapters definitely require deeper understanding and management experience.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|we really like mark walberg and this movie was great also. Hope to see many more with MW as the lead actor.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game. Good for passing time and making you frustrated. Not just a simple children's game.<br /> It's the cartoon world's best agent on the go.<br />Hey. Where's my Perry?
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book. It quickly became an obsession.<br />To each its own. I appreciate a good read. It was definitely NOT a waste of my time.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|That app is really good. I tried the free version first and decided to just spend the 2.99 and get the full version. Love the verity of sounds. Good value.
0385344333|1.0|I feel sorry for the people reading this book before the other great stories by Lee Child. They will be missing his really great books.  They will, however, probably never pick up a Lee Child book after this one.  It was AWFUL! Sad to say.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|I  need some instructions, I guess. I have no idea how to play this game. I have succeeded several times, but it was just luck.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has been a fun, free app for passing time in airports, on the plane and other long waits while traveling as it does not require wifi.
B007C94QRK|5.0|My kids love watching this movie! We watch it as our family movie night with popcorn.  I even downloaded it to my kindle and the kids love watching ti in the car for long rides.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is addictive and fun.  It provides hours of fun and entertainment for all ages.  My kids love this game.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Yup. This is the cutest book I've ever read it my life. And I have a book-crush on St. Clair.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Okay, I love P!nk. I think she has more talent than most singers and she has an attitude that makes you like her. I am also not into songs with language or racy meanings. I bought the clean version so I could listen to her CD and not feel I need to pray afterward. Well, that mostly worked. Several songs are still just raunchy, but at least I don't have to worry about the language. I know we live in a world where that is old school and censorship, but so what? I will censor what I listen to as I please. The songs on this CD are fresh and fun and I like the no-holds-bar view on love. P!nk knows how to deliver. The clean version doesn't take away from the songs but you will notice several spots where a word is cut off or a sentence is broken off. I kind of like how it sounds though. If you are considering the clean version, I recommend it. I like both, but prefer to not hear the language if given a choice.
1401937519|4.0|This book is very insightful.  It is based on fact!  The story made me realize more than ever the power of our mind and what we can accomplish if we trust and set our intentions.
B004R12BP0|2.0|I bought this book for my dad since I heard that it was clean and he is interested in literary stuff. He said it was the weirdest book he ever read and that it had too many characters.
1449314287|4.0|I've worked a lot with MySQL, over the past few years. I'm completely self-taught, however, and obviously, I've had gaps to deal with. While Google is dandy in a pinch, a book like this really fills in the blanks and provides a far more comprehensive understanding. Granted, if you're just starting out with MySQL, this is probably not the best book for you. Just looking at it from a learner's perspective, you'd better have at least a basic grasp under your belt or this book is going to be a tough one to tackle. If you've got a good background in it though, and are looking to be a real expert in the field, I'd definitely recommend this book. Even if you've already read the second edition, this third edition is definitely worth the purchase as the information is updated and the authors really expand previously presented topics. My overall take: It's well written, well organized and easy to reference when needed.
B008N1V11U|1.0|this game is so bad because the screen and stuff its dark and looks like a bootleg movie. I paid seven rollers for this crape don't get it trust me it'll me a wast of monkey shame on this game on gameloft my username is haileyface if u Wabash be friends
B004NDVJA0|5.0|It has all been said by previous reviewers.<br />Lovely, clear, enchanting vocals...... beautifully written.<br /><br />I first heard one of her songs on the sci-fi, \\"Lost Girl\\",  I HAD to know who this artist was and listen to more of her work. So happy to have found Agnus Obel,  a definite enriching experience.  Looking forward to more of her music on my shelf.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I can't see how anyone would give this 5 stars. It's boring and it's NOT free. You have to buy your coins. I'm uninstalling it.
B000FC0ZEO|2.0|*** Spoilers below. Please don't read if you haven't finished the book ***<br /><br />For me, the love of a book comes from the sum of it's parts. Had it not been for the ending in this final chapter of the Farseer world,I would have given Fool's Fate five stars. However, I was sorely disappointed (depressed, actually) with how the story closed between Fitz and Beloved (the Fool).<br /><br />R. Hobb has an extraordinary gift for emotionally engaging readers into this beautiful, complicated world she has envisioned. This, perhaps,is why I find the ending so unforgivable. Had she not made the relationship between Fitz and the Fool so powerful and moving - I might have been less horrified to see him cast aside so frivolously. The final chapters with Molly felt empty and dull in comparison. Her character seemed petty.<br /><br />Ironically, this has still been one of my favorite fantasy adventures....though I sincerely hope she changes her mind about not continuing the story. I would normally cringe at a series that lasts beyond 3-4 books, but this would be the rare exception. Too much was left incomplete.<br /><br />I gave this book three starts a few years ago on goodreads[dot]com, but am removing an additional star for this amazon review after a recent re-read through the series.  I had previously skipped the Liveship Trader books because I was too impatient to continue FitzChivalry's story. However, I finally read them through this last cycle and found myself even more convinced of the Fool's gender being female (or, at the very least, a hermaphrodite).  It made the conclusion of Fool's Fate feel even more hollow than it did before.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun to play.  Some levels are easy, some not so much.  I've completed all of the levels but I have not gotten all golden crowns yet. Still trying.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Using HTC my4gs.  App prevents computer from recognizing the  phone as a drive, until the app process is ended manually. calendar doesn't allow user to set default view eg month view instead of daily, etc.
B006XF5BTG|2.0|I found the book generally ok, however most of the training and dieting advice can be found in the Ecyclopedia of Bodybuilding by Arnold. A better and more thoroughly researched book with great pics and illustrations too. Get it at Amazon for only 9.99 you won't be disappointed.
B006RED4GA|5.0|This film was done with all the mastery of old-school horror flicks, not too much gore, no torture, but just an uneasiness that builds into terror.  It has that wonderful cliche of \\"why is she going in there by herself!\\" It does borrow from The Shining.  The camera work is simple, clean, and beautifully done.  And the best part are the questions at the end...the story is resolved.  But is it really?  Was it all paranormal or were the incidences caused by human agency?  I LOVED IT!!!  *warning*  This flick requires the use of one's imagination, and if you want everything done for you (special effects, etc.) you won't like it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had to keep reading. Well done. Made enough of an impression that I bought the other two shortly thereafter.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I wasn't too sure what to expect of this movie other than the fact that it was based on Snow White.<br />The Grimm version, not the Disney version.<br />And......<br />I liked it, but I didn't love it.<br />Some of the comedic aspects seemed forced.<br />The acting was top notch however.<br />The FX were wonderful.<br />The score and pacing were done well.<br />All in all I recommend a rental.<br />It's a wonderful movie filled with many things to like but it was just shy of being great.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Fantastic movie. Jeremy Renner can hold his own with Tom Cruise, who is amazing himself. This was the best Mission Impossible of the four.
1118109791|5.0|would recommend purchasing the math and verbal workbooks along with this book in order to get more practice for the exam. the workbooks provide practice problems and more detailed review.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I must admit, that my heart and thoughts are with the young special forces people of today, are always for them.........the average person will never know how hard the trainng is to make the grade, to be privilaged, to serve our country in the highest elitest state of our armed forces, now on to my review of No Easy Day.........I read the digital sample of this fine read, of the afore menchioned book, on my Ipad, and decided, I must read the rest, of what this fine young man, had to say about this extreemly dangerous mission. The book reads, as if you were along, with the Seals, reading this book will give you chills, I could not put it down, and I dont think you will either, it reminded  me of days of mine, long ago, in a different war..when I went on missions, simmilar to this one.....if your reading my review, I would suspect , your concidering getting this fine read, if you are, I strongly reccomned it. you will thank me....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I thought it would get boring, but I was wrong! I have a blast every single time I get on. I also thought I would need to buy coins, but you get 1 more every 30 seconds! You can buy coins if you want, but I never have to!
B005OK721G|5.0|The basics are pretty simple: gun-toting babe, out to avenge herself on the druglords who murdered her family. In that regard, it's a quality product of its kind: a few Mission Impossible kinds of attacks, innocent lover blissfully unaware of her red-handed life, down-around-their-ears ending. It's all there, and very nicely done, which is to be expected with Luc Besson directing. It meets the standards he set in [[ASIN:0800195175 The Fifth Element]] and [[ASIN:B00004XMSL La Femme Nikita]] - very high standards.<br /><br />Two things truly stand out in this movie: the two actresses who played the central character, Cataleya. The young girl (Amandla Stenberg) was more than cute. She'll grow up to be a charmer, I'm sure, and did a great job in this role. Zoe Saldana makes this movie, though. She brings Halle Berry to mind, but with more distinctive features and a less conventionally beautiful kind of figure - the kind just made to wear a black catsuit, which she does as if it were invented just for her.<br /><br />Above all, this is popcorn-worthy entertainment. That gorgeous leading lady just makes it even better.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B004QX07G4|1.0|There were a couple of times I chuckled. I do love Ellen's show and her stand-up routine. But I don't think it comes across quite the same in the written word. This book is probably silly to a teenager, but it was a waste of my time and money. Seriously.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|\\"Some things are meant to be.\\" Sure, you've heard that phrase before, but just who was it that meant them to be? And how will that be enforced?<br /><br />This brilliant movie starts by assuming an answer that second question: The Adjustment Bureau makes sure things turn out according to The Plan. David Norris (Matt Damon's outstandingly played character) encounters a dancer (portrayed beautifully by Emily Blunt), and mutual infatuation strikes in a heartbeat. Their affection is not part of The Plan, however. It must be stopped. Then, in an unrelated thread of the story, Norris discovers the Bureau's workings.<br /><br />Soon enough, they're working against him. This keeps a more credible tone than most action movies - no block-buster stunts, no guns, no explosions. Special effects appear in a very few places, neatly done but with a light touch that I appreciate. All that lets the raw characters come through, a Kafka-like sense of vast and unseen powers. Instead of submitting to the faceless forces, however, Damon and Blunt confront them. Although that familiar foreboding echoes many other paranoid fantasy movies, the heroes' determination against those forces keeps the story fresh. I recommend this one highly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1401229921|4.0|I have Batman: Hush in several formats [single issues, two-volume TPB, the Absolute Edition]. Each one is an upgrade from the last, from additional material to the format and size. However, none of them compare to the sheer awesomeness that is Hush: Unwrapped. Being a HUGE Jim Lee fan, any works he does I study and admire. Needless to say, this hardcover was one i simply could NOT pass up. If you already have Hush, then this version will be a visual treat. However, if you don't have Hush, I advise you to invest in one of the other volumes in full color so as to get the scope of the project and not be distracted by the pencil art [which is the main reason to buy this volume in the first place] and lack of additional material [re-printed from other volumes in short supply, could easily find more in other volumes]. My only gripe about the whole thing is that the size could be larger. Given the release on the Absolute Edition, which presents the story on gorgeous over-sized display, I would've liked to get that same treatment for Jim Lee's pencils.<br /><br />All in all, totally worth the investment, especially for up-and-coming artists looking for some inspiration.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|The basic plot has been done: ex-agent seeks revenge. It gets the action going nicely. Despite its common beginning, however, 'Hanna' rises well above its genre. Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.<br /><br />Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill. Hanna is that kind of kitten.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0050XFY4O|5.0|I can't believe this movie was amazing. I can't ignore the fact there was Incest but it was love and that's something you can't judge. Can we all acknowledge those guys were beautiful men Jesus I want one ..... Just not as my brother
B0053EOFFO|3.0|\\"Limitless\\" gets off to a strong start - a dicey character hands out \\"smart pills\\" that really work. Pop one, and you're suddenly brilliant. In the case of this down-and-out writer, that means not just getting started on that novel stalled because of writer's block, but finishing in just a few days. Of course, being that brilliant becomes addictive.<br /><br />The story moves along well. First, his dealer ends up dead. (What would a smrt guy do with that clue?) Then,to finance his venture, he borrows from the local loan shark (not so smart). Next, he flaunts his new-found ability as day trader, building up his financial head of steam - and I have to wonder whether taking such a high profile so fast was really a good idea.<br /><br />Things get out of hand, though. The loan shark gets his hands on the pill, and dicovers that being a smart crook is more fun than just being a crook. And there are side effects - the kind that kill not just you, but maybe other people, too ...<br /><br />This should have been an August movie. Just a few too many things seem just a bit too implausible for anything but a silly season flick. But, if you stifle your own intelligence, it's enjoyable enough.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|If you have nothing to do and want to waste several hours, this is the game for you. it was really fun and better than most games of this sort.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|First, it's a great catastrophe movie. Star-power doesn't guarantee a good flick, Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburn, Jude Law, and a flock others do their best to raise this movie a level, and their efforts pay off. The script gives them a chance to do their best - a believable outbreak, as contagious as SARS and as deadly as Ebola starts in a remote corner of the world. It propagates at the speed of jet travel to every major population center, and then the fatalities start to come in. It doesn't reach \\"Mad Max\\" levels of post-apocalyptic collapse, but does show how social structure sould shudder under the blows. And, in a thoroughly modern touch, the rationality of the CDC is offset by a wingnut internet conspiracy theorist who believes that the government is suppressing life-saving floral extracts.<br /><br />Among all disaster flicks, this stands out for one reason: it gets the science right. Ian Lipkin, M.D. and director of the Northeast Biodefense Center, consulted heavily. The movie virus, although fictional, followed the same path to people via bats and pigs as the real-world Nipah virus did. The movie virus fictionally attacks a genuine human receptor, but the imagined protein actually bonds to a genuine receptor site in biochemical simulations. Lipkin had Winslet pipetting and running gels, and showed Elliot Gould how to handle liquid nitrogen without freezing his hand off (as reported in Science magazine, 2 Sep 2011). Lipkin also suggested the bogus cures spreading across the internet, as actually happened in the SARS outbreak.<br /><br />That said, they didn't do so well on some of the CDC procedures, but hey. They got a big one right, and set the standard for future plague movies. What they did right, they did beautifully right - in addition to making some good entertainment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B006LSZECO|5.0|First book I've ever read that totally threw me off. It's so unpredictable and I loved it! I love books that keep you thinking, and this one goes beyond that.
B005V1WZ10|1.0|this is just pathetic. If they wanted to be experimental then hire a producer that can actually make electronic music like Trent Reznor, Martin Gore, or even a seasoned well respected producer like Flood. Who do they get instead? That talentless hack Skrillex, someone who just mashes together sounds with start and stop beats over and over and over until its beaten to death and cannot truly operate a synthesizer if his nuts were threatened with a bear trap. I remember when Korn made See You on The Other Side and I thought \\"Ok this is cool a bit of electronics mixed in you can tell Davis really looked into his Industrial influences like Ministry, he even got Atticus Ross to help as a producer, obviously they are trying to move on\\". Korn did a good job experimenting then and if they followed through and learned from that lesson they could have re invented themselves as a solid industrial metal outfit. But this is not experimentation this is just a poor attempt to stay relevant after years of declining album sales. every track sounds like its trying to out-do the other and failing miserably at it.<br />  anyone who just wants to fit in, listen to dubstep, and has no taste go ahead and buy this.<br /><br />RIP Korn, you should have quit when Head left and the sales started to sink, take the signs.
B00243FQFA|5.0|When my copy os Season 5 of SG Atlantis showed up the longest it took for me to open it and put in disc one was how long it took me to figure out which of the new mail boxes at our complex was mine.... long story... Anyway, I put in disc one and hit play and everything works perfectly. This copy was in great condition, I have no complaints and would use this seller again
0385344333|1.0|Others have said it all. I've read and thoroughly enjoyed every other Reacher Creature book. Not this one, however. Were this abysmal imitation to have been a book I just picked up, it would have been trashed before page 100. It is difficult to fathom just what Child is doing except dramatically lowering his standards.

B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good game play smooth control. Reminds me of the old game golden axe only up to date. I would say it is a game worth the downloaded
B0081KZ20E|5.0|This is a must read thriller.  You know how it ends, because DeGaulle was never assassinated, but you are always on the edge of your seat.  This book set the gold standard for thrillers, and no book has suppressed it yet,  read it, it is a masterpiece.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper is a very thought provoking book. I had a little difficulty getting into this book, but it is well worth it to read the entire book.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|An insightful view of God and time. This book like his others is a treasure trove of compassion and feeling.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy all the new and fun ideas that I find. The new connections are great. I also like the many new re&ccedil;eipes
B007J4T2G8|4.0|In spite of the horrendous writing, far too much sex and the the overuse of \\"oh my,\\" \\"murmur\\" and \\"mutter\\" (and many more) I found myself quite addicted to this trilogy. The underlying love story along with Mr. Grey's troubled past kept me up too late for a whole week and groggy at work. I am embarrassed to say that I most definitely would read the 4th book in this series if it came along. On my kindle of course, so I could keep my dirty little secret!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Overall the game is good. Very entertaining and imo better than angry birds. I like the fact that I can aim my shot instead of relying on a slingshot. Only thing keeping this from a five is the bugged levels. They seem to be working on the apple version of the game but I have two unbeatable levels at the moment with only 20 levels left in the game. Developer fix these levels and you get a five.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the only thing  i dont like about this game is that i cant save the puzzles that i started and end up moving on to a new one

I seen this book in the kindle line up and though \\"how good could it possibly be\\" and passed on reading it for weeks. One day I finally decided to read it and I can say its absolutely outstanding...you must read it..the author has an incredible way with words..
B008XG1X18|4.0|It is eye candy. Fun way to spend some free time. So much to see and stimulate you creative juices.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Wasn't at all sure if I would like this movie, but I did!  Awesome!  Loved the characters, the actors and got very caught up in the story and action.  Very very wierd characters in the beginning - wasn't sure what to think, but the story line got me past all that!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is just like the real live game.  I love it!!  It keeps you on your toes waiting to see what prize will be next.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I haven't read any of Stephen King's books in a long time and wanted to try one again. I must say that his style remains the same and he is a clever wordsmith, but his plot was just too far fetched for my taste. I rarely give up on a book, but I did not finish reading this one.

B006Y0QBQC|5.0|It really helped me to understand the behaviours of others and mine as well. As gay I could see myself in both roles, the one who waits, or the one who doesn't call. There is not a single day where I do'nt think of the book.<br />thanks
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I was a angry bird fanatic until I purchased this one.  I got through the first 2 section in level one and tried the 3 section and was never able to advance any further.  I think this one is very hard to play and was not very much fun.  I deleted it from my tablet and will not download it again.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love to listen to this when I cant sleep or when I'm doing homework...very soothing. What I really like is that you can save your favorite sound combos.

1402171935|5.0|\\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\\"- Genesis 1:1, \\"Through him(Jesus) all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.\\"- John 1:3 God says only He created the world. If you purchased this book, it's most likely because you have a scientific background. Being scientific should consist of testing something and THEN drawing a conclusion. The majority of \\"atheists\\" or \\"evolutionists\\" I have spoken with, have never actually read the bible, they just find verses off of atheist websites that take scripture out of context. That's not very scientific to draw a conclusion that the bible is wrong, without actually reading it. I want to challenge you to read the bible for yourself starting in the gospel of John and then you can decide.<br /><br />If heaven does exist would you go? Do you consider yourself a good person? Would GOD consider you a good person? Let's take a look- how many lies have you told in your whole life? Hundreds? Thousands? What do you call someone who lies? Have you ever stolen anything? Music from online, something from a sibling, time from work, cheated on a test? What do you call someone who steals? Have you ever looked after a man or woman in lust desiring them? \\"But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\\"- Matthew 5:28 This means that God not only judges our actions but our thoughts? Would you be in trouble when God judges you after you die? Let's see what the bible says \\"But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\\"- Revelation 21:8.<br /><br />If you are honest with yourself, you will see that you deserve hell because you and I have both sinned against a righteous and holy God. But the good news is that God sent his ONLY Son to die on a cross and take the punishment you deserve. He lived a perfect life, died one of the worst deaths and rose again conquering sin and death. \\"For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him, should not perish but have eternal life\\"- John 3:16. If you repent and put your trust in Jesus he will forgive your sins. Cry out to Him and ask for forgiveness and turn from your sins to put your trust only in Jesus of the bible. Know that you can NEVER earn your way into heaven. Nothing you do is good enough as even our good deeds are considered filthy rags in God's sight. We can never join a specific church, do works, do rosary beads, etc... Salvation is found in Jesus ALONE. \\"Jesus answered, \\"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\"- John 14:6

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is super addicting! I can't put it down! It would be five stars if the timing was better. There will be two obstacles and a missile and you can't get around them. Besides that, this game is pretty great'
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very good book with many psychological twists and turns.  The book made you think about how twisted people's lives get when there is sexual or physical abuse in their past.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|The English Patient is a layered and deeply moving motion picture. Based on the Michael Ondaatje novel, director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella does a masterful job of telling the story of Count L&aacute;szl&oacute; Alm&aacute;sy, played by Ralph Fiennes, and his romantic and torrid affiar with Katharine Clifton, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, and the effect it has on them and the people around them. This is told in flashback, were in the present we meet Juliette Binoche's Hana, an army nurse who has seen her fair share of tragedy. The English Patient flows between different times and places, but remains completely coherent and involving. We come to meet and care about a wide range of people throughtout the film. Fiennes and Scott Thomas have a wonderful chemistry together, and radiate heat. Binoche is sympathetic and utterly likeable. The English Patient is one of my favorite films, it's gripping and moving, romantic and unforgettable. I give it my highest recommendation!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book kept me interested by having a nice flow and story line.  I would recommend it to everyone.  I read it on a business trip.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was good but the first two kept me wanting to read them, this wasnt quite as intense.I would still recommend this whole series to my friends
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for enhancing your study of God's word. The added features such as the Daily Devotionals are easy to use and a great gift. I have used this app daily since downloading it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|this film is what life is about, not thinking about just ourselves and our family but also being willing to help others! This was indeed an inspiring film and so wonderful that it is based on a true story!!!!
B0088X7YMS|3.0|At first I thought this was going to be a great addition to my Starship Troopers collection. Should have read the small print.  The animated movie was okay but I wanted to see real folks playing their parts.  I did like the series 1-3, three where John Rico returned to the battle.  I guess the makers did not want to pay the actors for another round, so they voiced over animation.  As an animated movie, it was okay but did not have the corny dialog additions as the series.  I missed the \\"do you want to know more\\" and the one liners with perfect timing was missing.  If you wanted the human involvement you will be disappointed.  If you like animation it will not disappoint, however, I still think the makers could have used actors in the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great way to pass a few minutes.<br />It reminds me of the quarter machines in Atlantic City and on cruise ships. Now they have them in Va. gas stations
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I purchased this set to have something to get through the end of summer doldrums and have only recently started on the journey.  I was worried that it would take a long time to \\"get into it\\" and learn enough to care about the characters.  Not so! From the first page, the author grabs your attention and drags you into this marvelous adventure.  He introduces the vast amount of characters superbly.  Even though there are many of them, you care about each of them from the get-go. It may take a while to get through all four volumes, but at the rate he keeps your attention, maybe not so very long after all.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|stuck on this stupid thing now. at least it doesn't cost me anything like it does at Dave and busters
B002ZG97LK|5.0|This case and movie were in really good condition. I love this movie, I love all the extra parts added to this movie from the original one.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's a very fun and addictive game.  The premise is very simple...collect all the dots with your drop of water.  This graphics are great, and it makes you stop and think about a plan, before you start.  The inclusion of chips that you earn for solving puzzles is great, because you can use them to help you later when you get stuck.  I love it!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this is a pretty cool game to pass the time away...just wish it had mini games to earn more coins
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I didn't think I would like this as much as I do!  great way to pass the time while waiting.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|I am a big fan of Robert Downey and Jude Law, and they both give good performances in this movie. The special effects were cool, but that was about the only thing this movie had going for it.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|If you are expecting a storyline, plot of some kind or intellectual stimulation, this is not the movie. However, if you are wanting to watch a movie with hot guys dancing and taking their clothes off then this is perfect for you. I wish there would've been some chocolate in the mix though. But the bodies & dancing was good. Heck for fun, you should take a drink every time someone takes their shirt off or you see an ass. Hell, you could watch this movie on mute and not miss anything. Hahah! Love it.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I first saw this movie at work, but the last part skipped really bad.  I thought it was so hilarious that I had to buy it for myself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun and addictive game.  my kids and I love this game.  I do strongly recommend this game for adults and kids
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Cool effects do not a cool movie make!  A very thinly threaded plot of cobbled together scenes that might have developed into something engaging if not treated so superficially.  The 'fairy forest and the great white stag'?  How about an inkling of how this helps Snow White understand her destiny and her choices?  Awakened by True Love's first kiss?  There is no emotional connection evident between SW and the Huntsman or SW and William or anyone else that would make you think she'd ever be revived.  Really, really glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Way better than I thought it would be. I didn'tget into at first but once I got the hang of how to use it, it's been great. I love looking g at cute pictures and getting yummy recipes.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"Mark Owen\\" writes a captivating account of what really happened during the training, and mission,to get Usama Bin Laden. This book will keep your heart rate up, and your fingernails short, as you follow the Navy Seal Team on their historic mission. The true heroes of this operation are the men and women who used their intelligence, wits, and determination to finally track down the planner of 911. You'll also discover why President Obama, through our Pentagon, threatened to criminally prosecute the author. \\"Enhanced interrogation\\" did provide the first clues of how to track Bin Laden. There was procrastination concerning the operation to get Bin Laden at Tora Bora,because of interference from some of Obama's \\"unqualified\\" advisors,  and the White House version of how Bin Laden died was totally wrong, as were the news reports. It is an excellent, action packed tribute to our intelligence services, and our special op warriors.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|love it. great product. I love it. the fact that u can calabrate the app for your own device is pretty cool.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book cant wait to read the next to and  see what unfolds with the characters this is the first book i read on my kindle fire loved the book and love the kindle fire
B007R41E8O|1.0|Due to it's large size, I had problems downloading the resource portion of the game. The initial download and installation is no problem, but when it came to downloading the resources, it took hours and then it looped and started the download again.  I gave up finally after two days.  If you read the reviews everyone seems to have that problem.  To me it isn't worth the headache of trying to downloading the game.
B000ID37KO|5.0|The Birds is a Hitchcock masterpiece the way he puts fake birds in with real birds to make you think they are all real is brilliant.<br />I love this movie and I never get tired of it and I still don't like real \\"birds\\" because of it.  The cinematography is remarkable<br />film students and actors should defintely have this in movie in their collection and study it regularly for movie making tips and<br />acting tips.  The drama, suspense, tension is very well done.
B00511PTWM|5.0|Have had this for many, many months now and it's terrific.  It fits snuggly into the outlet, charges/supplies power to two devices, and the swivel allows it to fit in all our cars with no problem.  I also have an older car without an .mp3 player, and when I listen to my iPod and iPhone through my radio (with proper jack) the connection stays true through all driving conditions.  Highly recommended!
B00846REIS|5.0|If you are looking for something to read after the \\"Shades of Gray\\" series, look no farther. Her roommate in this book is a tad unsettling to me, but I will definitely read book II.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like not running out of energy and always adding something. it keeps you busy getting new stuff. my daughter. enjoys playing.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a different romance story.  Highly sexual and into the world of sadism, porno, a lot of sexual content that reflects good taste on a controversiable subject. The Fifty Shades Triology is a must read.  Good reading for psychology students.  Really good issues that you can critique on the two main subjects Mr. Grey and Miss Steele.
B008645YEE|4.0|iam enjoy motion picture soundtracks; this one does no disappoint. Zimmer work re-creae images of this popular summer flick and finale
B0087HT36U|4.0|I find the game fun and challenging. I dislike that I could not play the last level until I rated the game.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|I'm very happy I spent no money to see this Bond movie.  This dour, humorless, James Bond is great at driving cars, boats, and killing people, but he's no hero to me or even interesting.  The actions scenes go on forever, and the technique of overlapping and editing between some grand staged event and something terrible going on behind the scenes is cliche to me already and it's done at least twice in this movie for extended periods of time.  The actions sequences were more tedious than anything else, and I decided after about a half hour that it wasn't worth another quantum of my time.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I saw this movie long ago and thought it was a very good film.  I felt it conveyed a good message about life and that there was a good lesson to learn from their characters.  I thought it was a great pre-teen movie, so I ordered it for my granddaughter, who is 9 years old.  She loves it.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Take note people in the music industry this is how you do a box set of your greatest hits. Not since George Straight and Ronni Milsap box set have I enjoyed a greatest hit package I mean its all here people. All of the hits I mean the man was putting them out every year and finally the record company came through what surely will be a classic to have in any country music fan collection!!!
B0089IGUP4|4.0|New Jersey-based The Gaslight Anthem has released several albums before, and with each release they are gaining more and more critical and commercial acclaim. This is the band's fouth studio album.<br /><br />\\"Handwritten\\" (11 tracks; 41 min.) starts off with the best track on here, the single \\"45\\", an ode to the old vinyl singles of yesteryear, with lyrics like \\"Hey hey, turn the record over/Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side\\", ha! Of course the ode-to-singles has been done before, never better than Belgian band Telex on \\"A/B\\" in the early 80s. And is it just me, but \\"45\\" sounds like it came straight from the early Goo Goo Dolls sound, think their \\"Superstar Car Wash\\" album now 20 years ago. After \\"45\\" comes the title track, and then \\"Here Comes My Man\\", the latter being the type of song that invites comparisons to that other NJ product (some guy named Bruce). The good songs follow one after another and while sometimes a bit too wordy, they flow easily and before you know it, this album has come and gone and you'll want t play it again.<br /><br />I had the good fortune of catching these guys live earlier this summer when they played at the Bunbury music festival here in Cincinnati. However good this album is, live they just kill it! They brought a blazing  60 min. set that was heavy of course on the \\"Handwritten\\" album. If you have a chance to see these guys live, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \\"Handwritten\\" is the band's most accessible and ultimately most enjoyable album to date.
B00846REIS|4.0|Planning to read second book.  Book kept  me interested and wanting to know Cross' big secret and to see how the relationship progress.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|If you have read the book then of course you will find the movie a little bit lacking, but I was lucky and saw the movie first.  This made me watnt to read the book, which I did and it was superior, but I feel they did as well as they could and still keep the movie to an acceptable length.  The reason I gave it four stars is because with a blue ray I expected more and better bonus features.  I liked the ones that were there, but like I said, I expected more.  It is a must see, so if you haven't then see it!  :-)
B008GM1G70|4.0|As a philosopher I have heard most of these concepts. Reality is not as fixed as we would like to think of in our own little box, but we do have to play in this game. The movie goes through the questions, but like most philosophical questions.. their was no resolution in the movie... life it unreal. This pointed out that the belief makes it so.
B0018QBAXG|5.0|Just an all around great movie, especially good for children 8-10 years of age. It is a family favorite in our house

B007RD4KQ8|5.0|Ian Gillan and Tony Iommi have collaborated for the first time since their last collaboration on Black Sabbath's Born Again album back in 1983.  The new project is called WhoCares and features a treasure chest of tunes from the pasts of both of the heavy metal monsters.<br /><br />The collection includes their 2011 singles for charity, Out of Mind  and Holy Water. These two songs included help from Metallica's Jason Newsted, the late Jon Lord from Deep Purple, Iron Maiden's Nicko McBrain and Linde Lindstrom. Together, they formed the super group, WhoCares.<br /><br />Other tracks on this 2-CD, 18 song collection is two previously unreleased Iommi tunes that feature Glenn Hughes and Zero The Hero from the Born Again album.<br /><br />Gillan said of the effort, \\"As I said once in the song, Razzle Dazzle, it's a real fine line between an orgy of destruction and a wonderful time.  The destruction of conformity in this case: some of the pieces never really fitted into their contemporary program and got sidelined or forgotten, and some of the album tracks never had much exposure.  As the track listing for this album came together, I noticed many of the titles had character similarities: a combination of freshness as they finally felt the sun on their backs and rebellion in a `yeah told you so' kind of way.  And that adds up to a wonderful time and more money for the music school we are building in Armenia\\".<br /><br />Gillan added, \\"The ad-hoc benefit WhoCares band was just a band put together by Tony Iommi and myself on a flight home from Yerevan where we'd been deeply humbled by the honor and expectation bestowed upon us.  Well, that's it, really, in a nutshell, so to speak. What more can I say?  It's all there in the music.\\"<br /><br />Whether you're a Deep Purple fan, a Black Sabbath fan or just love heavy metal in general, WhoCares is a must-have collection for your listening library.<br /><br />Boomerocity.com
B000GWE44U|5.0|I had wanted this in Blu-ray to see things better. I was not let down with this purchase. The picture quality is very good and the sound is intense. I bought this with Prime and got it very quickly!
0061438294|5.0|This is one of the most useful books I've ever read. It gives you insights that have always been there but most of us are oblivious to. It's very helpful in my business as an Art Dealer. Helps me know if someone is interested or if they want to be left alone. Highly recommend this book.
B0048LPRD2|2.0|I checked after watching the film, and Noe is not, in fact, an adolescent, having been born in 1963. But it seems like he has a teenie sensibility--the film's plot seems ripped from the pages of some young adult novel:<br /><br />Brother and Sister have a close relationship and promise each other never to separate! (\\"Promise me you'll never leave!\\") But a car crash kills their parents! Now orphans, they become separated after all! But wait: Brother arranges for Sister to meet him in Tokyo! Together again! He, a drug dealer, she a stripper-escort--they're really Living Life On The Edge! Until he's killed in a drug bust--oh no, they're separated! But luckily, he'd been reading the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and knows exactly how the afterlife works! He's reborn to his sister: Together!<br /><br />And here's some of the not very snappy, or even convincing, young-adult style dialog:<br /><br />Sister: \\"I would already have committed suicide if I didn't have this sensation that Oscar is somewhere around me.\\" [As Oscar's soul is floating somewhere around her.] \\"I wish he could come back to life.\\"<br /><br />Pimp: \\"Stop hurting yourself. I know it's hard to admit, but dead is dead.\\"<br /><br />The acting is wholly in line with the dialog, which is to say, um, unpersuasive.<br /><br />My sense is that other reviews have cut the film a lot of slack because it's clear its onus is supposed to be visual. And the neon photography is, in fact, interesting for the first half-hour or so, but it palls, since nothing new happens photographically after that, and there are still more than two hours to go. I helped it along by fastforwarding through those endlessly repetitive scenes of the spirit floating back and forth over the same Tokyo blocks at night (there is no day here), by which expedient I reduced the the film to around an hour in length.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|If you love the classic Anime movies like \\"My Neighbor Torturo\\" or \\"Howles Moving Castle\\", you will like this.  The DVD does come with both subtitled or dubbed options in the menu list.  I prefer the subtitled with Japanese language and it did not disappoint.<br />  It is a bit goofy at times, but that was fun. It is set in pre-WWII Italian social culture. That is the only political commentary so some history of that era may help explain some of the comments made.<br />  I am glad I bought this.
0547391005|5.0|We bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She LOVES Curious George and we thought this would be a perfect present. She loves it! There were a couple of things we were surprised about: George smokes a pipe in the first story and in another they talk about a \\"fat\\" man (which is not something we really want our daughter repeating). However, considering when these books were written we can over look those things and when our daughter is ready we can tell her how we feel about smoking and calling people unkind names. Those small things definitely DO NOT detract from the appeal of this book. The colors are bright - the stories are engaging. My daughter LOVES it - and that is really all that matters (and it makes her want to read more - which we love).

B0071XO8RA|3.0|This is good old fashioned SF yarn, easy to read and with interesting protagonists. The basic mechanics of writing were well followed, providing a generally satisfactory read. Since this is Science Fiction, we expect for all the basic laws of science (except possibly for the underlying presumption of the plot) to be followed. Unfortunately, the basics of diving and of electrical wiring were both abused in the last story, fatally, which ruined it a bit for me.  Other than that, I would recommend the story with 4 stars; but with the understanding that if you understand electrical wiring or diving, you will have to cringe through the bad sections. Others may criticize the lack of technical sophistication of the environment or the psychological depth of the situation, both critical elements of the storyline.<br /><br />This is a light read, a unique situation that is fun to think about but which the author did not invest a great deal of scholarly research to make realistic. If you demand your SF to be rigorously correct in a technical sense, this story isn't for you. You need to read it with an ample suspension of disbelief. I find it fun. I have continued to read the series and have now completed the sixth segment.<br /><br />When I wrote the (now edited) review above, I did not realize that the series had gone viral. Let me expand my comments for those who desire a more comprehensive review. I have read, literally, tens of thousands of SF novels. I am also a published SF writer (barely, don't bother looking for my out of print short stories) and I have engaged in a lot of constructive criticism. I hope that background helps this critique.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT, the critique below discusses elements of the plot. As a good deal of the story is invested in discovering these elements, you may not want to read too far; though I don't know that I reveal much more than many of the other critiques. However, the comments above should be sufficient to allow you to make up your mind.<br /><br /> This series is easy to read and fun to contemplate. It is not a science-dominated concept, but it does follow the basic maxim of SF to make one fundamental premise and follow it to a logical conclusion.<br /><br />This book has a set of protagonists that are about as deep as your typical SF story; in other words, intriguing but with no depth. There is almost no character arc. That is not meant as a criticism, just a description. There is frequently little character arc or depth in SF. It is the situation, not the characters that frequently hold our interest. The characters are well rounded enough to hold the attention of most SF readers. They are not as well developed as say the characters in \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />I hold out hope that as the series continues and the author's writing skill grows, he may develop a character arc in his main character, which would be a bonus that would add to the richness of his writing. There lies the basic tension in this series between those who live in the silos unaware of their world and those who control the truth with a partial objective of keeping the silos viable for a long, long time. To have a character internalize this conflict and struggle towards a solution would be great. However, to be done well would require a depth of character development that the author hasn't shown to date, so it may not be reasonable for him to do so. It is not necessary.<br /><br />The basic premise of people living in a closed environment and not being aware of the true nature of their 'world' has been done before a number of times. The precise premise of this series is more compelling than most, and thus the biggest hook of the story. That premise, along with the writing style of the author, makes this a fairly satisfying read. If you have any affinity for SF, you can't help but respond to the environment presented and imagine what you would do differently, whether as the author or as a character. This forms the crux of the criticism against the author as well as the groundswell of support for his story.<br /><br />The plot is linear. That is, one issue after another is presented and experienced and the story moves on. There is no substantive conflict within a character or within a group. There is confrontation between groups. That is typical of SF stories and what you should expect. What conflict that does exist lies between what you as the reader think about such a situation and what the author writes, which is not all bad as it makes you think.<br /><br />For too long, selection of SF stories by the publishing houses has been limited to highly commercial stories that can be successfully exploited by the vertically integrated entertainment industry. If a story can't be turned into a movie, sell an album of the score, generate action figurines, themed lunch boxes, ad nauseam, then it couldn't be published. This maxim has nearly extinguished a once vibrant genre. Self-publication allows a return to the good old-fashioned yarn with a SF premise. It is this vacuum that the author is filling. I applaud him.<br /><br />Is this story on par with a Heinlein or an Asimov? No, not close. But this author deserves a read. His writing skill will only increase with experience. Hopefully, for me, his attention to fact will increase if he can make a full-time living as an author. Many great authors develop a back story that dwarfs the material presented in their story. This is especially true of great SF authors, where a great deal of the back story is frequently invested in developing the technology behind their premise. This series should demand a depth of knowledge in the design of small enclosed environments and in psychology. This doesn't seem to have been done here, which forms the crux of the criticism against the story. Perhaps this author never will develop a rigorous investigation into his backgrounds. If so, just be aware that there is an element of \\"fairy tale\\" to the way he writes, and read accordingly.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|for what it is, its entertaining. perfect time waster, I can burn a few minutes with it. Don't expect angry birds.

B004ISVH7U|5.0|That voice...that voice!  And the song he was made to sing...that artistically perfect song.  In all the decades that have come and gone and will continue to come and go, it is this listener's opinion that there will never be a song in the popular arena of music as giftedly written and flawlessly interpreted and performed as Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\"  40 years after hearing it for the first time it remains my favorite piece of music.  It has touched me, comforted me and inspired me too many times to number.  So much so, in fact, that I intend to have some of the lyrics inscribed on my gravestone.<br /><br />People have ascribed many meanings to the words, from intraveneous drug use to love between friends and love between more than friends.  For many of us the message even has spiritual significance as it can be interpreted to mirror Christianity's promise of Christ's faithfulness to his followers.  However you slice it, \\"Bridge\\" was the coming together of Paul Simon's exemplary writing talent and Art Garfunkel's transcendent voice--both of them at their very best.<br /><br />I've heard that Mr. Simon regrets not having had more of a vocal presence in the recording of the song, but the relative absence of his voice (except in a few perfectly executed places within the tune) in no way diminishes the gift he gave the world through this truly inspired work.  I simply cannot imagine \\"Bridge\\" in any other form than that in which it was presented to us by this talented duo.  The song has been re-recorded by many other artists, but no version has yet to surpass the arrangement and vocals of the original.  In my (highly biased, I admit) opinion, none ever will.<br /><br />Had Simon & Garfunkel given us only this one song I believe it would still have been as popular and generation-spanning as it has been.  If you are new to Simon & Garfunkel, your money will be well spent for this one song alone; fortunately, however, the duo's talents were much moreextensive than just \\"Bridge.\\"  Thank you, Paul Simon, for \\"Bridge,\\" and thank you, Art Garfunkel, for lovingly interpreting the piece of music and molding it into a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.
B00633W614|5.0|I have not read an Archer book in a long time. I love the way he writes. Great character development, storyline and writing style.I am almost finished with the second book and slowed down because I do not want it to end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a very good app for being a free one I mean it works great for shay its supposed to do very nice 5 stars
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was really great, I learned a lot about the state of foster care in America.  Sad but uplifting at the end.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  I have enjoyed reruns on tv but they are not sequential. The dvd's are much better.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked all three books.  I think I like the first, then third, then second (in that order).  I think it is a love story.  I am not into all of the \\"other\\" stuff, but when you read pass all of that, I think it is a love story that I am sure many women would love to live.
B003DT194G|5.0|Best of breed actors bringing it. Dense meaning in purposeful movement draws powerful scenes uncovered by multiple layers from glances to killing. You can taste the dust, sweat and fear as you're riveted by every nuance. The lifeblood of this western saga is nurtured by both a sweeping cinematography steeped in the west's brutal beauty along with a soundtrack that propels you slowly forward out of control.
B00846REIS|2.0|Bared to You was recommended because I read all three Fifty Shades books.  It was definitely a takeoff of those books but if anyone critized the 50 Shades quality of writing, they should stay away from this copy cat book that was poorly written and lacked an original story line and substance.  Definitely a huge disappointment and I would not recommend wasting your precious time to read.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great album, good mix of slow and upbeat songs.  You can listen the entire album and not want to skip any songs.  These songs tell a story and are not just repeating a catchy chorus.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Why is this book so popular?  The characters are unlikable and one-dimensional; the plot is bizarre and hard to swallow.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|there is only one word you can use to describe this game. EPIC! if you have played temple run its similar but, ITS ON MUTANT STERIODS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Fantastic little GPS receiver - works great on Windows or Linux, fast to acquire a fix, and accurate too.<br /><br />My one criticism would be that it struggles to pick up a WAAS fix unless it has a clear view of the sky - wouldn't pick up WAAS in my back yard (where my hand-held Garmin unit picks up WAAS with no trouble), or when mounted inside the car. No such problems when mounted on the roof of the car though.<br /><br />Magnet is more than strong enough to hold the unit in place at highway speeds, the cable is (just) long enough to connect from the roof to a laptop in the glove compartment.<br /><br />Works as advertized, at a great price. Recommended.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|1. Using WiFi File Explorer Pro is so much easier than using a cord. It took a minute or two to figure out but then it was no problem. 2. Great software. It always works flawlessly. 3. I'm kind of surprised the Kindle Fire doesn't automatically come with something like this though. Everybody should have it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased the book to see what all the hype was about. I thought I would get through the first part hoping for a change. It is porn and I read more than I should have, but did not finish. JUST PLAIN PORN!!!!!!!! Freaky
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I loved this game as a child. I never had enough quarters. so glad there is an online version. a little slow on the collection of coins... but still loads of fun!
B0087HT36U|4.0|pretty fun casual game. the level where u save 2 guys on a car towards spikes is bugged. the car hits the building before you can fire. galaxy s3
B0070Y46UY|5.0|At first it was slow going. But once the ship sinks the pages just flew by. I wasn't sure I was going to like this book but now I can honestly say that I love it. People will miss out if they only go to see the movie in November. YA GOTTA READ THIS BOOK!!!!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book was well written and gave a refreshing point of view.  I agreed with the premise and think the ideas could apply to anyone who wants to change their life.
B0086700CM|5.0|1. This guy can run! On the Kindle Fire the game works well, and I've played it a lot, but after a while you just have to say enough is enough. I need my life back! 2. None of the power-ups really appealed to me. I'm not sure why anyone would spend money in this game. 3. I hope he escapes some day!
1936608898|5.0|I loved reading this book. It really gave me some science-backed information as to why the certain foods work better in our bodies than others. Dallas and Melissa use a tough-love tone to their writing and it really works for getting people motivated! They clearly explain their views and back it with their research to make it easy to understand and possible to make it happen. I am completely enjoying my real food journey and this book has really helped give me solid reasons.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game. it keeps me engaged and always wanting more! I'm on level 30 and I don't know what I'm gonna do when its all over... :(
B001NEK2GE|5.0|A greatkeypad. The elevated wrist section fits my hand perfectly and after a while of using it the keys become easier to use.  At first they were strange and had a loose feeling<br />The graphical approach to assigning the keys makes for quick on the fly gaming changes.<br />For Battlefield 3, I programmed two of the right bottom keys as an enlarged space bar.<br />The macro recorder works great.  The thumb operated joystick takes getting used to and was unable to use it as a joystick, so, I ended up programming the five keys not as directions, but, as extra functions.<br />My grandson uses my computer to play games and the three configuration modes lets him have his own key setups.<br />The display works well for monitoring frames per second or cpu and ram usage.<br /><br />All in all a good buy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was a fantastic conclusion to the Hunger Games, a great series of novels...I hope that the movies do it justice!
B007UXT6T6|1.0|Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. From goofy scenes at an attempt at humor to improbable cliches this thing was a dog all the way. A pure waste of time.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|Pros:<br />-Well protects phones.<br />-Hassle Free warranty (Had to use it when I dropped the phone and the Otterbox had a section snap off.) Had a new case in less than a week.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Pain to put on and take off. But I don't have to take it off often.<br />-The port for the charger isn't big enough for the charger that came with my phone, had to modify it.<br />-Couldn't manage to get the screen protect to fit right, but that could just be on me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I've read both of Flynn's other novels (Sharp Objects and Dark Places) too. I thought this book was excellent, up until the end. I really like how Flynn's books tend to switch between past and present... it helps keep things interesting. I don't want to spoil the ending, but the whole time you're reading the book, you're wondering what happened and then second-guessing yourself as new details are revealed. I personally wasn't impressed with the ending at all. I thought it really fell flat in relation to the rest of the book. The entire book leads up to the conclusion, and when it finally comes, you're like \\"really? That's it?\\" Or at least, that's how it was for me. And this was after I heard the ending was \\"amazing.\\" I guess it just depends on what kinds of stories you're into, but I would have liked it much more with a different ending.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|It's ok, but not a game that I can play for hours. I would like it more if I could jump and duck down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the most addictive app that I use (including facebook) there are millions of ideas for home decor, recipes, arts and crafts.
B00650SSDU|4.0|I loved it, from the time it started. Wondering what was going to happen next. They both had great energy and were very humorous. Great movie for married or single people.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Easy for everyone (regardless of age and/or gender) to enjoy. I loved the story and the characters. From the first one book they got my heart.
8866130915|4.0|The hard back cover is awesome for someone like me who is hard on my books. I take this with me everywhere and it fits nicely in my backpack as well as a purse (does not fit into a smaller purse - anything you'd use for a night out, but I don't want my planner with me when I'm going out for the evening so that is fine.)<br /><br />The weekly lay out is awesome. I'm a freak about organizing and this allows me to do everything I need and want - with one exception. The fact that it doesn't have (somewhere in the front) a nice two day spread of each month in a regular month calendar layout with open boxes for us to use as a \\"quick view\\" for the month - is a bummer. It would be incredibly helpful for people who are busy like me. To work around that, I actually drew in my own monthly calendars in the address book they gave additionally in the back of this moleskin. So while that wasn't as clean and pretty as the printed matter - it's still functional and gave me the \\"monthly overview\\" that I need (I'm a very visual person and having a monthly view is a real bonus).<br /><br />If you can live without a monthly overview - or don't mind adding your own calendar the way I did, then this planner will suit your needs perfectly! I am in love with it and so happy with this purchase! Hopefully, Moleskin will get wise to the fact that many of us out there would love that regular calendar format and replace the current monthly calendar scenario they have in there now.
0345803493|5.0|LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT! GOTTA READ IT!<br /><br />It def wasnt as great as th 1st but still a great read...had a slightly diff twist which made it a slightly intriguing read, u really want 2purchase this one!
B0088X7YMS|5.0|\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is far better than the previous attempts at bringing the original novel to the movie screen.  It has more realistic combat action and a more sensible plot than the first three movies.  The powersuits are more inline with the novel's description and the new Bugs are interesting.  Hopefully, there will be a direct sequel to this movie.  I would also recommend \\"Roughneck Chronicles\\" for it's characterizations and variety of Bugs, vehicles and weapons.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a free app I downloaded from the Amazon app store onto my Kindle Fire. My husband has the same version on his Android phone so I knew about the ads. I have not yet had a video ad, nor is there an ad after every new game deal (knock on wood). Overall, I like this version of the game. It was free, I can customize the game play as well as aesthetic settings, and it's a great time waster. I gave it four out of five stars because of the ads. But really I can't complain too much because it was free and I'm not going to dish out money for a game that comes standard on most media devices. Heck, it came pre-loaded on my iPod!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is very entertaining and distracting. I play this all the time anywhere that I go is easy and fan.
B0053O89JM|2.0|Not as good as the first seven seasons. The episode had gotten to far out of reality. should have stopped at seven.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Finally the wait for Indiana Jones on Blu Ray is over! So far all of the movies are looking terrific, my only complaint is the box that holds the Blu Ray's is quite possibly the worst box EVER conceived, I have to actually grab the disks to pull them out of the sleeve and they are all now full of fingerprints.
0345803507|4.0|this was definitely th weakest of all 3but an interesting read, it def completed the trio! enjoyed this one too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was sooo good!  I would recommend it to everyone!!  I'm glad I read the book before watching the movie though, so I would recommend that first.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I talked my husband into watching this with me as it seemed from previews that it would be pretty funny.  It had some funny parts but in general was pretty ridiculous and it seemed as if the movie lasted five years.  Boring.  Not recommended.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book is awesome.  I enjoyed the movie, then read the book.  It caught my attention.  As soon as I finished the first book I ordered the second.  The continuation to the story was great.  Its suspenseful.  It's a thriller. The development of each character grows and grows.  Katniss needs to get with Gale!! I couldn't put it down.  I'd read it long into the night.  Can't wait to order the third book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I did not want to put it down. This is my second time reading part two. I love it its an amazing trilogy.
0062124293|5.0|As an \\"old\\", long-time Feminist, I appreciated being updated on where kids learn about sex, dress and view themselves, and create meaningful lives.  But this book is so much more.  It is a complete sharing of growing up in the 21st century in a unique home environment, and as a \\"fattie\\" (of which I was also- she nails it!); how and when and why to fall in love, have babies, and live and love your career.  All told with humor and compassion.  Cheers to Caitlin (pronounced Catlin) Moran.

0525478817|5.0|This book had me hooked from the 9th sentence on the first page.  TFIOS is profound.  I know many people are saying \\"but ... but ... it's a cancer book!\\"  But it's not *that* cancer book.  Cancer is personal to me - times two.  It's not a topic people like, it's not a subject that especially when it involves young teenagers in the prime of their lives that people flock too - we run, we hide, we shake our heads vigiliantly saying 'oh no, oh no'.  But this one is a keeper, a literary work that left me in a state that many books have not.  BRAVO, John Green!<br /><br />This is my first John Green book.  I was BLOWN AWAY that it was written by 1. a man and 2. a man who, assuming the picture on the back cover is correct, is NOT 16 or anywhere near it. Seriously?!  How a grown man can wrap himself into the character, the persona, the language and thoughts of a 16 year old girl is sheer brilliance.  That takes skill and raw talent to pull off.<br /><br />The character is Hazel {\\"Hazel Grace!\\") who is a 16-year-old cancer survivor, having her first near-death encounter at 13.  She becomes a reclusive teenager having completed her GED instead of attend school due to her cancer and having to carry an oxygen tank and cannula everywhere she goes. At her weekly cancer support group, many characters are introduced which play an important role in this book, from Isaac who will eventually go blind and his relationship with Monica, to the ever fabulous Augustus Waters, aka Gus, who was left with just one leg after a cancer amputation.  The two are so richly described and the ensuing relationship is one that blossoms from support, love, fear, etc and Hazel's life is transformed immediately and profoundly. She's given a second chance with a new cancer treatment drug that is buying her time.<br /><br />This book teeters on having just enough sass and spunk and humor (Hazel) to get you through without being a total downer.  Gus's character is flourishing.  It makes you stretch your mindto places - especially a parent - you might not think about, ever ... gratefully so.  This book is about life.  About Death. And about the journey.  The description and sheer beauty of Amsterdam felt like I was there with them both.  It was so rich and lush and dare I say, romantic.<br /><br />I think my only critic was that through-out the novel, they are chasing down the answers to An Imperial Affliction and asked repeatedly \\"What happens at the end!!  What about the Tulip Man!  What happens to Anna?!\\"  I disliked strongly the character Peter Van Houten, but then, I think he was the catalyst amongst a cast that we loved :)  So, at the very end, I felt like TFIOS just ended.  Kinda like AIA.  And now I want more.  I want a future for Hazel, for her parents.  And as they chased Van Houten all the way to Amsterdam for answers, I ask \\"What happens to HAZEL!!?!\\"<br /><br />Hands down: *5 stars*.  You'll want to hug your kids.  You'll want to hug EVERYONE after reading this.  Just make sure you keep the Kleenex nearby when you crack the cover.

B006GHA9VQ|4.0|I thought this stage production, filmed in Australia was wonderful. The vocalists, the sets and the colour excels!<br />My only comment that having been filmed live, the camera angles were not always accurate and in the darker scenes the blacks were a little on the grey side. There was also some distractive light wandering into the black bands at the top and bottom of my 16:9 screen. The soundtrack deserves merit.<br />I thoroughly recommend this blu-ray disc.
B003WJQ74E|3.0|\\"Flowers of Algernon\\" by Daniel Keyes is an immersive reading experience that is both sad and uplifting. Based on mental retardation and brain science it is taxing on your soul because you want the best outcome and for a time you get partial satisfaction but it is fleeting. While the writing is brilliant this is not a story for everyone, I know I will not be revisiting it in what remains of my life...
B007T99ENE|5.0|This review was originally posted here: [...]    Is it possible to write convincingly from the point of view of the opposite gender? Is it possible to write a review of an Ian McEwan novel without giving too much away?    The answer is, of course, it depends how good a writer you are. Kirsten McDougall presented Philip Fetch, in The Invisible Rider, so authentically it is hard to see how she could have known all the thoughts and feelings of a middle aged male lawyer. Some people loved Lloyd Jones' Matilda in Mr Pip, whereas others had a problem with him writing as a 13 year old girl. And then there's Ian McEwan. Perhaps the best known instance of McEwan writing as a woman is his masterpiece of trickery, Atonement, which includes McEwan writing convincingly not only as a woman, but as a woman writing as a woman. So there's no doubt he has form in this matter.    The idea of trickery resonates throughout Sweet Tooth, McEwan's latest novel. The book starts with the main character, Serena Frome, telling us how she was recruited into MI5 in the 1970s, where there's plenty of trickery and deception going on. She's a voracious reader who prefers her authors to `make use of the real world' and avoid `tricksy haggling over the limits of their art... .' On no account should writers `infiltrate their own pages as part of the cast.' The clues about what McEwan is doing with Sweet Tooth come thick and fast and don't let up.    But, like the very best novels, the extent of McEwan's ambition and achievement can't be seen until the last sentence has been read and fully absorbed.    McEwan layers on the literary content thickly, with the story echoing his own experiences of being published for the first time in the 1970s. His friends and publishers get name checks, as do various pubs, restaurants and parks. McEwan also indulges us with jokes. The `new fangled Booker prize' gets several mentions, and he plays around with the name of a former director-general of MI5 and makes her a high-flying contemporary of Serena.    Its clear from what we're reading that Frome wouldn't have liked McEwan's writing in the 1970s, and perhaps still wouldn't today. We hear about other writers Frome likes and doesn't like, giving us plenty to think about in respect of McEwan's own likes and dislikes. There's a lot of reading between the lines as the book reaches its middle act, especially when Frome starts to quote chunks of her lover Tom Haley's newly penned fiction to the reader, some of which clearly reflects McEwan's own writing from the 1970s.    McEwan shows great confidence in delving into a world so well chronicled by the likes of John le Carre and Ian Fleming, although he sets it a few years after Smiley's era. Still, the idea that no-one knows anything, that the respective agencies are actively competing with each other - the dissatisfaction `five' has for `six' comes through strongly - and that around every corner, in every cramped, smoke-filled office there might lurk someone working for the other side, are themes that many readers will be familiar with. Why shouldn't McEwan write about spies, the 1970s and people who like books and writing? It seems so obvious now he's done it.    Less familiar is the idea that the secret service might have funded artists and writers, which is central to the book and on which the real story hangs.    I'm not going to give away the main plot twists here. For me, one of the pleasures of Sweet Tooth is McEwan's skilful circling back, his ability to make everything that happens matter one way or another. As connections are revealed and Serena's personal desires - for literature and for love - conflict with her professional duties, the dramatic tension builds.    So, has McEwan written convincingly as a woman in Sweet Tooth? Well, Serena Frome is certainly a strongly drawn character. She has clear views, and even when she has doubts she knows very clearly that she has them. She consistently tells us what she thinks, and how she feels, about her lovers and potential lovers. She is unexpectedly confident about sex, and yet there are other things she doesn't tell us that we would have perhaps expected her to know. She appears to be consistently interested in the social turmoil around her - the cold war ending, the UK economy on its knees, the Troubles at their peak - but is that a true reflection of the interests of a bishop's daughter, educated at Cambridge, even one who works for MI5?    Would Serena really act and react like this? Perhaps she would.    The ending was too quick, too neat and, if I dare say so, too contrived for me. It explained too much about some things and not enough about others. I can't really say anymore without giving McEwan's game away, and I certainly don't want to do that. Perhaps after reading Sweet Tooth you'll come back to this review and notice my own clues about what happens in the book, and decide whether I've said too much, or not enough.    I thoroughly enjoyed Sweet Tooth and while the ending didn't exactly satisfy me, it did have me shaking my head once again in admiration of McEwan's inventiveness in giving fictional words on the page a reason to be there, his ability to entertain, and the sheer audacity and confidence that is necessary to attempt things other writers wouldn't even contemplate.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|The second book of this series George R.R Martin succeeds to introduce more drama and intrigues between the different fractions of the realm.

B008DVJO8C|3.0|Every album by In This Moment has been different. Beautiful Tragedy was powerful and raw and featured aggressive metalcore guitars and vocals. For The Dream, In This Moment mixed things up and focused on soulful melody and a more mainstream sound over power and aggressiveness and ultimately produced a masterpiece. With the third album, A Star-Crossed Wasteland, we got the best of both worlds, a crescendo of melodic metalcore, soulful and harmonic, yet also powerful and aggressive. Needless to say, I was expecting a lot from this album, and unfortunately, it just doesn't quite deliver. Maria Brink again delivers a mix of clean and screamed vocals, as well as some raspy, almost spoken word sort of passages, but the hauntingly soulful melody I've grown accustomed to getting seems more forced than anything. The guitar work also differs substantially from what we've seen before, with a greater emphasis on electronic effects rather than a more traditional metalcore (or pop metal) sound that we'd gotten in the first three albums. In general, the musicianship seemed a little uninspired - perhaps in part due to some turnover in the band members, I'm not sure.<br /><br />With all that said however, there's some good music to be had here. The album starts off slow, in my opinion, with the first song of note being \\"Whore\\", which at first was a bit dark and unappealing for me but has hence grown on me. \\"Burn\\" is fantastic and is an obvious choice for a single (probably should have been the first single instead of the almost dub-steppy \\"Blood\\"), and the second half of the album is a lot stronger than the first, with a better mix of metal and melody and less electronic distortions.<br /><br />Not every In This Moment album will be a masterpiece - this one certainly isn't. But the past two albums were, so perhaps my expectations were simply too high here. Regardless, enjoy the album for what it is: a solid effort by an exceptional band.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am really enjoying this version of Angry Birds.  I love the animation & the sound effects.  I highly recommend it if you like playing Angry Birds.
B0034G4P1W|3.0|From the \\"Wallace & Gromit\\" claymation people comes a very nicely crafted claymation production (the fish in a pirate's hat was great) with excellent detail and creative character making. My only complaint with this side of the production was a plasticity of sameness and lack of depth (soulfulness) in the overall storyline. Storyline was a roller coaster ride of viewer engagement with too much on the ho-hum side of the ride. Not in the same class as Vinton, Burton and the French animation studios. One example, and even the Wallace & Gromit productions have this weakness, is the faces and especially the eyes display a cut-out mode of sameness; almost as if they had a box of mass produced eyes and gave them to all the characters.<br />The dialogue was contemporary and intelligent. The voicing was OK but it would be good if animation studios would spend more time looking for interesting voices rather than just pay for an actor's name to stick in the credits.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a former combat intelligence officer in Viet Nam 1966-1967 I found the account of the Bin Laden raid well-written, technically proficient (though I was NOT a SEAL) and quite interesting.  I do not understand the government account that the author divulged military secrets.  Nothing about the communication, logistics, tactics, strategy or training seemed to violate any military security doctrinaire that I would be aware of.  It's good reading and presents a more positive appraisal of combat intelligence than what I experienced in Viet Nam.
B009CPES4I|5.0|I adored this movie.  All of the characters are unique, the actors are top of the line talent and they deliver well.  It's entertaining, offers hope for beginning a new phase in your golden years and lets you know that life isn't over.<br /><br />It takes lack of funds and guts to make a change like they do and I wonder if I could.  You'll wonder too.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I approached this book from the perspective of one who has over 47 years of combined experience with the military and the Intelligence community, so I am not the average reader.  This book provides a unique insight into those \\"select few\\" who willingly commit themselves to the very toughest missions -- not because it will bring them fame or fortune, but because it must be done, and they each feel that they are the one who is most capable to accomplish the mission.<br /><br />Mark Owen's style of regressing to the childhood experiences, to establish what compelled him to decide to serve this high calling, makes the books somewhat difficult to read.  After all of that is established, it reads somewhat faster.  By the time you get to where the team is selected for the UBL capture mission, you understand why each of them was selected and why the mission succeeded, in spite of the crash of the first helicopter.<br /><br />Owen does an excellent job of capturing the feelings of low-level operators, who never care about power, but just want to do an excellent job.  Each of them knew that President Obama would claim credit for the mission's success, but that did not keep them (even those who did not want him reelected) from putting their lives on the line, knowing full well that their sacrifice would ultimately contribute to getting him reelected.<br /><br />I particularly liked the way that he dealt with \\"Jen\\" -- the intelligence analyst, who had spend ten years on the UBL mission.  He trusted her judgment and he gave tribute to her contributions, because he realized that she was just a \\"trench fighter\\" like him.  The fact that he sought her out and thanked her for her contributions was a fitting tribute to another group of folks who are often overlooked.  When things go wrong, decision makers blame bad intelligence but when things go well they often forget to thank intelligence analysts for their hard work.<br /><br />Overall, the book is well worth the time and effort.It provided a unique insight into a world that only a few will ever see.

B008D28HYS|5.0|I have both the all black and color versions of CrossMe.  I'm only a few levels in, and already preferring the color version much better.  The extra colors add an extra element of challenge but at the same time make it slightly easier to solve the various puzzles.  It seems like there could be much more variety to the solved color puzzles, which is really cool.
0812992784|5.0|I waited for this biography for years and it did not disappoint. I took me only 5 days to finish it (I was on vacation), very well written, heartfelt and shocking - definitely this autumn's must-read.

B0049GYXDQ|5.0|This film is amazing.  I really loved the soundtrack, and the quality of animation is top notch.  I really fell in love with Tiana, because she is on an emotional journey in life, that isn't too different from my own.  If you are a business owner, or struggling through thick and thin to create a successful business, than you will certainly get more out of this film, than perhaps others who aren't.    I also really enjoyed the fact that it took you all over New Orleans.  While understanding that it is reimagined for a particular time period, and then on top of that, created in the film's image, for someone who has never  been there, it was really beautiful to see it all.    As always, and being an artist myself, I totally appreciate the craft that goes into these things.  This film certainly exemplifies the part of Walt's dream of creating art out of animation.  Well done!    As well, the fact that it has a princess who is African American is truly precious, and a rallying cry for the entire race.  Themes form \\"it's a small world\\" come to mind!    There really wasn't any character that annoyed me, or any that I didn't like.  Mama Odie is the perfect grandmother.  Her boat in a tree, in the bayou is spot on.  The gumbo in the bath tub is hilarious.  Prince Naveen's arc is well done, and Tiana's driving of that arc is a fantastic touch.    The end always makes me cry.  To see that she gets her dream, is, well, pure Disney.    If ever you enjoyed any Disney film at all, I say go for it.  The musical numbers are show stopping, and this film certainly doesn't disappoint!    Now..... If Disneyland could ONLY have that Mardi Gras parade?!  And, somewhere in the world, we need a Tiana's Palace!  New Orleans would be perfect!    ________________________    Daniel L Rappaport  CEO  Pazzaria Productions    [...]    LIVE YOUR FANTASY!

B0058YPG1G|5.0|The best season so far, I can't wait until season five comes out. At times you don't know if you're watching a Tarantino film and others you think its a play on Dumb and Dumber.
0345803485|1.0|I would have given it ZERO stars but Amazon forced me to give it a star or it wouldn't publish the comment. I didn't buy the book from Amazon, it was a present. I couldn't read past the first 2 chapters. I recognized it immediately as the grooming and abuse of a young, probably 12 year old girl by a disgusting wealthy, powerful piece of filth. It is very much a matter of concern to me that grown women are finding this acceptable and allowing daughters and grandchildren to read this tripe and therefore it normalizes this kind of abuse by desensitizing what passes for a society in this country to it. We have harvard and yale professors writing \\"friend of the court\\" briefs trying to push for pedophiles to be a protected class not guilty of crimes and federal judges on nambla's mailing list.<br /><br />If grown women want to indulge their rape fantasies with their sexual partners or put on a cheerleader outfit or bring the pole into the room for a dance, I have no objection, whatever trips their trigger. This series, I believe, is not directed at indulging the fantasies of grown women, but normalizing the grooming and abuse of young girls. And I can promise there is nothing harmless whatsoever in those types of situations. Speaking from direct experience, this is just a how-to manual. Abusers teach their victims that it is what 'they want\\" and the abuser is only fulfilling their wishes, so if anyone is doing anything wrong, it is the child, not the abuser. Disgusting.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a retired prosecutor I was anxious to read this book. Landay gives a glimpse into the politics in probably every DA office in the country. The family dynamics add to the realism of this great read. Quite well written, it held my attention and left me hoping the author will give more views into the interesting world of criminal prosecution.
0425263908|3.0|I read the 50 Shades series before reading this book and was pretty irritated right from the beginning.  It seemed like I was reading 50 Shades again, only with a few character/setting changes. The book has pretty much the same storyline...two screwed up individuals that literally \\"falling\\" into each others lives, dominate males, silver/grey tie ...blah, blah, blah. It took several chapters for me to get into the book and even then, I had issues with the extreme simularities. I did enjoy the authors writing style better than the 50 Shades author, but felt she ripped off the story and just tried to fine tune it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to say I heard from several co-workers that this book was fantastic. I was extremely disappointed. I felt that it was copying both the Scott Peterson and Drew Peterson stories and some of the storyline was a little far fetched. If you want a so-so book then read this, but don't expect it to be one of the best books ever.
B00866JL96|3.0|What's there to say about this movie? Nothing really... It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Just kinda blah... The story isn't original, the performances aren't spectacular. I really think that this film was just made in the hopes that all of Zac Efron's fans would flock to the theaters.<br /><br />I think Zac is a likable actor who's got talent but this movie was just okay. I kinda felt like this movie was trying very hard to be the 2012 version of The Notebook but it failed miserably.<br /><br />If you wanna kill an afternoon and you literally have no other options then I'd say watch it. You probably won't ever want to watch it again and you probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend but it wasn't the worst movie I've seen.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|This book is far more an account of the selection process and training for the Seals Special Forces than it is an account of the mission to kill OBL. That mission is perhaps 25% of the book. It is difficult to understand what is going on during the description of this and the other missions mentioned, and there is really almost no content here that hasn't been reported elsewhere (unsurprising, since everything not reported is probably classified).<br /><br />I found this very similar to, but not as well written as, Inside Delta Force.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|A fantastic book! Rick Riordan is at his best again. But he's even better in this series than the Percy Jackson series! Better adventure and better romance. 5 star for The Lost Hero!
1400069289|4.0|I borrowed THE POWER OF HABIT from the library and read it cover to cover -- then bought my own copy.  It is too useful not to keep as a reference. The author's bibliography and notes are extensive and this alone is worth this book.  The book is a surprisingly fast and interesting read considering the extent of the author's background research.<br /><br />Written by a NY Times investigative reporter, The Power of Habit shows scientifically and anecdotally how habits are formed and reformed.  This is not a 'how to' book, but the insights into reforming habits are well explained and relevant.  Real behavioral change is possible for any reader who takes the time to grasp the concepts and put them to the test.

B009329ZF2|3.0|I guess my biggest mistake was to expect too much. I thought it was ok. Probably worth more as a $1 redbox charge than an Amazon fee of $3.99.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a good read and gave me a direct view of what took place,Rather than a media version and spin.I did not see any Top Secrets revealed. What I read about operational tactics is allready known. Just a straight forward Account of what transpired.A double Tap read. Good Job Mark!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great to read a story to completion and the author did a good job with this one. It may be the best of the series!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel was gripping from the start. It was quite the ride from beginning to end, causing an array of emotions from myself on every other page.  However, the ending left almost too much to the imagination.  I really ended up disliking BOTH of the main characters in the end, and I wanted so much for one to end up the victor.  All in all, a great story, with an ending that leaves a little too much in the open.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Are your survival skills as finely honed as the scientists aboard Prometheus? Let's find out...<br /><br />You, a scientist, have landed on a distant planet with a team of fellow scientists in search of alien life. What would you do in the following scenarios?<br /><br />1. Upon first arrival and entrance into what appears to be a manufactured cave structure, you deploy very high tech scanning and mapping probes. Do you:<br />A) Also send out your android crew member to evaluate any possible danger and then wait for the probes to finish scanning and mapping before you begin exploring?<br />B) Brazenly charge forward into the unknown and maybe consult your equipment's discoveries later, shrugging off any blips of alien life as an equipment malfunction?<br /><br />2. While traveling through the cave structure on this alien planet you discover the presence of oxygen in the air. Do you:<br />A) Keep your space helmet secured tightly because there may be any number of unknown elements, pathogens, bacteria, contagions, and other toxic substances in the atmosphere that are undetectable by your equipment?<br />B) Quickly remove your helmet AFTER stating what an idiotic idea it is because a fellow teenage scientist, who has properly tested the air by taking a few shallow breaths, peer-pressures you into it?<br /><br />3. Your android crew member appears to have quickly learned the language of the inscriptions found within the cave. Do you:<br />A) Ask him to translate everything and share his wealth of knowledge from that point forward?<br />B) Treat him like a red-headed step child and ignore him for the rest of the mission?<br /><br />4. As scientists on a mission in search of alien life, you stumble upon a deceased alien life form in the cave structure. Do you:<br />A) Restrain your excitement at the discovery and prepare to study, take samples, and test further?<br />B) Piss your pants in fear and then while attempting to return to the ship you run in random directions until you are lost within the caves, refusing to consult the mapping tools you brought with you even though you happen to be THE expert in their usage?<br /><br />5. After becoming lost within the caves you learn of a storm outside that will prevent you from returning to the ship until morning. Do you:<br />A) Break out your mapping tools to help determine your location and plot your exit strategy; or still refusing that logic, simply ask the crew on the ship to help guide you through the caves with their 3D map which includes your location?<br />B) Decide that exploring deeper into the caves to frighten yourself further with more deceased alien discoveries is probably the most logical thing you can be doing with your spare time?<br /><br />6. After wandering through the entire haunted-house cave structure you decide to enter the initial room that frightened you off in the first place; unfortunately you then come face to face with a living alien that resembles a large snake which begins posturing and hissing at you like a king cobra. Do you:<br />A) Shoot it in the face and run for your miserable life?<br />B) Decide that you are only afraid of dead aliens and not live ones, and then try to pet the aggressive alien snake with your hand?<br /><br />7. Upon the discovery of a 2000 year old decapitated alien head which has been wondrously preserved, you bag the head in your trusty ziplock and return to the ship with your trophy for testing. Do you:<br />A) Take a sample and have a look at its DNA first?<br />B) Recalling your fond memories of Frankenstein, you inject stem cells into its locus coeruleus to re-animate it and increase the amps until the alien head explodes; and then you run your tests?<br /><br />8. You manage to collect a small sample of a strange black goop in the caves, which appears to be alive. Do you:<br />A) Put a drop onto a slide and take a look under a microscope?<br />B) Decide that the scientific method of small children will yield the best andquickest results and so you secretly put a drop into a drink which you then give to a scientist to see what happens?<br /><br />9. You have become incredibly sick with some unknown illness and witness an alien larva worm crawl out of your eye. Do you:<br />A) Quarantine yourself and ask the other crew members to help treat your condition immediately?<br />B) Pretend that nothing is amiss and you feel fine, then romp about as usual with the rest of the crew until you collapse half-dead?<br /><br />10. After a contagion outbreak and another scientist lost to death-by-alien-snake, the missing scientist left for dead in the caves returns to the ship as a zombie spider monkey. Do you:<br />A) Leave the door tightly secured until you can determine the status of the unresponsive crew member with the variety of cameras located on the ship?<br />B) Open the door and go out alone to investigate, then kick the creature while turning your back to it until it smashes your face in with its zombie strength?<br /><br />11. You come face to face with an Engineer, the creator of humans, after waking him from hypersleep. Do you:<br />A) Attempt to speak his language and introduce yourself, your crew, and your mission?<br />B) Barrage him with fat mama jokes until he becomes an enraged Neanderthal and tears your head off with his bare hands?<br /><br />12. A disc shaped spaceship rolls towards you in the final moments of its crash landing. Do you:<br />A) Run ten yards to the right or left, perpendicular to the ship's path, and let it roll on by?<br />B) In the heat of the moment you forget about the steamroller scene from Austin Powers, and so for a full minute you attempt to outrun the crashing town-sized spaceship by following its trajectory as it slowly barrels towards you?<br /><br />How did you do? Total your score and share it in the comments!<br />All  A's = 1 point<br />All  B's = 0 points<br /><br />Hopefully you managed better than the total of ZERO scored by the charactersplucked straight out of a teenage slasher film to masquerade as scientists in the movie Prometheus!<br /><br />\\"On behalf of scientists everywhere, I am ashamed to count you among us.\\" -Milburn<br /><br />[If you enjoyed this review, I highly recommend The Skeptics' Guide To The Universe Podcast #363]
0811870413|5.0|I like the book, greatly photographed. Its not your standard Recipe book. It shows how to care and understand leavened bread and break making. Also, it talks about great recipes for day old breads. Wish its in digital format and has enhanced video with it, so can actually see what the dough's texture should be. But my first attempt of dough making starts today...should let you know how my country bread looks like without use of the dutch oven. I dont own one and its expensive here in Costa Rica
B0081KTI0E|3.0|but d@mn was I hoping for more. It's been so long since there's been a legit scary movie and d@mnit if this one didn't have all the trimmings. It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch, but it fell short of what it could have been. The story centers around a young widowed lawyer who goes to some distant town in Britain to search for a last will and testament of a client of his firm. Problem is that the house in which the papers lie is haunted by a ghost that kills a young child every time it's seen. Let's stop right there: What? Every time the ghost is seen it kills a kid? How does the ghost determine what age is young enough to be a kid? Is a 16-year-old sufficient or does it have to be a pre-teen? I dunno, the whole must kill a kid angle was kinda lame imo. But whatever, the lawyer goes to the house and realizes that the house is an island when the tide comes in as the only road to it is covered in water during those times. Cool premise and it could made for some really scary stuff during the times he was stuck there. As is, the director opted for suspense over scares as almost nothing really happens until the end, and even then nothing really happens. It's not a bad movie, but I was hoping they would go for just a haunted house that someone is trapped in rather than what they did. Still, not a bad flick. Final scene was definitely unnerving, which made up for the horrible ending.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|As others have said, it is an attractive game with beautiful music.  I like that the game is both relaxing and thought provoking.  it is also nice that there are two levels of challenge, to finish the board and to finish in the minimum number of moves.  Recommended.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Ugh. That's the word I would use to describe this book. I've had this book for probably 2 months and I'm only half-way through it. It is painful. I've gotten through a few of the sex scenes and they just aren't as steamy as I'd expected. It could be because I find the plot, characters and dialogue so horrible that the sex scenes just fall flat. The book is just humorous at this point. I can't wait to finish it up and move on to the next book on my to-read list. My daydreams are more erotic.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great read - a really interesting take on a crime thriller. The way the book is written keeps you awake, and wanting to read more. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good thriller read.

B002SR2PKG|3.0|Haven't picked up a King book in a few years but was pleased by this one. I'd put it on the level with his older stuff, flushing out his back catalog is a better way to spend your time than reading some of his newer works. Slow out the gate, but picked up the pace in the middle of the second act. Can't wait to track down a copy of the movie to compare it.
0439813786|5.0|The Inven­tion of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick is a children's novel tak­ing place on the turn of the cen­tury in Paris, France. We took this book out for my daugh­ter (7) to read, but I stayed up half a night read­ing it - and fin­ished the next morning.<br /><br />Twelve year old Hugo shoul­ders a lot of respon­si­bil­ity for his age. His par­ents are dead and his care­taker is his drunk­ard uncle, ten­der to the train station's clocks, which one day sim­ply disappears.<br /><br />Son of a watch­maker, Hugo who loves to tin­ker with mechan­i­cal toys takes it upon him­self to main­tain the clocks while hid­ing in the hid­den world of the train sta­tion. One day he finds an automa­ton, a mechan­i­cal man, which was cher­ished by his late father.  Hugo restores the toy using his father's note­book as a ref­er­ence, he gets his parts by steal­ing them from the old man who owns a toy kiosk in the station.<br /><br />Turns out that old man is actu­ally a cin­e­matic giant who made Hugo's father favorite film - Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s.<br />And that is just the start of the story.<br /><br />The Inven­tion of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick is a very unique book. Not quite a book, not quite a graphic novel, but an amal­ga­ma­tion of the two where a few pages of text are fol­lowed by sev­eral pages of pic­tures which move the story for­ward instead of illus­trat­ing what one just read about.<br /><br />While this book is tar­geted towards the young, any­one young at heart would enjoy it and espe­cially movie buffs as Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s plays a sig­nif­i­cant part in this tale. Part folk tale, part fan­tasy, part his­tory book with mag­nif­i­cent draw­ings and pho­tographs of old films this book defies cat­e­go­riza­tion. Add a boy, a girl, automa­ton, toys, a key, clocks, train sta­tion and a one eyed man and what you get is a fan­tas­tic fable which is sim­ple yet com­plex and some­what bizarre.<br /><br />My most favorite aspect of the book as the homage to silent films, not only using con­text, but the rich illus­tra­tions all black and white which reminds one more of movie stills than graphic novels.<br /><br />While the book is rel­a­tively long (it comes in at a whop­ping 533 pages) it is a short read. The text pages are short and easy to read and most of the book is the won­der­ful pic­tures men­tioned above - I read the whole book in a day. Even though I bor­rowed this book from the library, I am seri­ously think­ing about buy­ing a copy of this fab­u­lous work of art.st favorite aspect of the book as the homage to silent films, not only using con­text, but the rich illus­tra­tions all black and white which reminds one more of movie stills than graphic novels.<br /><br />While the book is rel­a­tively long (it comes in at a whop­ping 533 pages) it is a short read.

0385742886|3.0|The Kill Order is the prequel to the Maze Runner trilogy by James Dashner.<br /><br />Before Thomas entered the maze, and before WICKED was formed, sun flares hit the earth and disease ravaged the planet. The Kill Order tells the story of Mark, Trina, Alec, Lana, and their friends as they survive the sun flares and find a safe settlement, only for that peace to be ripped from them when one day a Berg appears in the sky and its inhabitants start attacking the people in the settlements.<br /><br />I loved the Maze Runner trilogy and was so excited to read the prequel, hoping it would answer many of the questions that were left unanswered in the trilogy. However, after reading it, I was disappointed in the book. First of all, Thomas is basically non-existent in the book except in the prologue and epilogue and those two segments don't even fit in with the rest of the book. The creation of WICKED is never really explained although they do go into detail about some other government agencies that may have become WICKED but it is never stated if they become WICKED eventually. The book is fast-paced but I felt like the entire book consisted of Mark and Alec trying to investigate or rescue one of their friends and then them fighting the Flare infected people. Rinse and repeat. It basically was non-stop action and to be honest, I got bored with some of it after awhile. It took me 2 days to read each of the books in the Maze Runner trilogy; however The Kill Order took me 2 weeks to read since sometimes I just had to put it down for a bit. I feel asleep twice while reading it because it failed to hold my interest. I did like that we learn how and why the Flare virus was released and how it mutated. How Thomas gets his name is also touched upon and the girl that may become Teresa (it is never stated that it is for sure her) is introduced in the book. Also, even though this is a prequel to the trilogy, I recommend reading it AFTER you read the trilogy. It'll spoil the original trilogy for you...it's one of those prequels that is intended to answer how things became how they are in the trilogy instead of introducing you to the situation first-hand.<br /><br />Overall, it was an okay read. I did enjoy it however I felt it could have been better. If you liked the original trilogy I recommend reading it though.logy for you...it's one of those prequels that is intended to answer how things became how they are in the trilogy instead of introducing you to the situation first-hand.<br /><br />Overall, it was an okay read.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was great but it just ended in the middle of everything so it is SCREAMING SEQUEL.  I hope there is one because without a sequel the book would not be very good.  I thought my book was missing pages!

0802473156|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THERE NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET IN THIER RELATIONSHIPS! ITS CHANGED OUR RELATIONSHIP FOR THE BETTER WHEN MY PARTNER REMEMBERS MY LOVE LANGUAGE AND I REMEMBER HIS! ITS  GREAT BOOK TO READ IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND YOUR CHILD OR PARENTS TOO!  A MUST BUY AND THEN AS THE AUTHOR SAYS PASS THE BOOK ON! IF EVERYONE LEARNT THE 5 LOVE LANGUAGES THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I first found Brandon Sanderson because of my love for The Wheel of Time.  From there I read his mistborn books as with those this book kept me entertained enough that when it got slow I could still power through.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As always, I love ANYTHING Mitch Albom writes and it seems that the timing is always perfect for my life. I bought this book without even reading a review which I NEVER do. Buy this book...this man is a genius.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I got this app from Amazon (Free app of the day) on my Droid 2. This past weekend, I upgraded to a Galaxy S3. Google Play says Plants Vs Zombies is incompatible with the S3, so I went to the Amazon app store, downloaded it on the S3, and lo and behold! It works! :)
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Mmmm... interesting story line, keeps you wanting to find out how it really ends so do get the trilogy from the start.  It is an easy read and the grammer is acceptable, although at some stage I did start feeling the author was now becoming a bit immaturish and too plain with the prose. This however did not deter me from enjoying the story and reading about all the 'naughty' stuff most people want to hear about but too abashed to do so in company.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.  However if it's intellectual nutrition one is looking for with the english language - one might be slightly dissapointed.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|One of the best series I've ever read. The hbo series follows it so closely, and it helps put everything in the book in perspective

B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book detailed actual  events during the Binladin hit and was nothing what the TV portrayed...good book and would highly recommend it...
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a very well written book. The author is amazing and has a way of drawing you in. Some may find the beginning a little bit slow, but not for long. The ending is definitely a crazy and fascinating twist, and personally I loved the whole thing. Many people say they didn't like the way things ended but personally, it worked out exactly the way I was hoping it would but didn't expect it to. I ended up working backward and reading this book first, and then going back and reading her second and then first book because I enjoyed her style so much. Coincidentally that happens to be the order in which I prefer them, this being her best book in my opinion. Sharp Objects was very interesting but the ending was a little predictable, and Dark Places was slow at the beginning but ended with an amazing bang. I've definitely recommended this book to my friends, who also love it and are now reading her other novels. She's very gritty and detailed, and has a way of surprising you with little things even when you think you know it all!
B004LR5K0I|4.0|I purchased this CD collection to replace, or more accurately backup, cassette tapes recorded from LPs many years ago. The recording quality is excellent.  There are lots of 'live' performances which I find more interesting than the studio versions.  My only complaint (and the reason it didn't get 5 stars) is that a few of Elvis's best, such as 'In the Ghetto' and 'Don't Cry Daddy' are not included.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I bought Jetpack Joyride and immediately got addicted. Not only are there achievements to complete as you play, but you always have at least 3 challenges active at once. So each time you play through you may be trying to do different things, and it makes each play through different.<br /><br />There are lots of collectibles to buy with coins you pick up, so even if you play through and beat it, and then beat it again, you can keep playing until you've purchased everything. I've put in many hours and plan on putting in many more.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Baldacci continues to write books with fresh plots.  I had just finished reading a fairly good book; but when I read \\"Zero\\" immediately afterward it was evident how good he is at writing prose and developing character. He's written another winner!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hate Block Story and wish that I didn't waste money kn it but I did. When I saw that Minecraft was avalible I bought it and got rid of block story. MINECRAFT IS THE BEST!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book, brings to light many questions that were unanswered.<br />The Navy Seals were a credit to our country and should be treated as heroes.<br />The newspapers and White House should honor all of them as heroes.
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book made some valid points about why so many people are gluten intolerant.<br />It's worth looking at if you have weight issues or allergies. I found I made some alterations in my diet after reading it and saw benefits in appetite control and digestion. I do think the author goes out on a limb a bit in his estimation of how detrimental wheat is for us - it has to vary with the individual.  And it's pretty dry reading after a while. It seems to be a mix of fact and theory, as are so many diet books. Readers can draw their own conclusions.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Excellent, an absolute must for all novitiates to the world of adult sex. BDSM really overstated, it spoiled the whole trilogy as did the number of sexual encounters. At the ripe old age of 72,<br />apart from the BDSM; been there, done that<br />and got lots of ties, or words to that effect! With a bit more editing and rewriting, it (the trilogy) could become required reading for all high school/College students
B000V8A95C|5.0|I saw the musical and just had to get the album. Just love it! My favorite is For Good, but all the songs are great.
B004SBQAN8|2.0|Ok, I waited for this in my Netflix queue for I don't know how long, so I was pretty excited to finally see it. My reaction was....mixed, if not a little dissapointed at the wasted potential this film had. I expected from the trailers, an action/sci-fi movie with hidden messages, deep character development, and more, considering the premise. But, sadly this turned out to be just your run-of-the-mill tween-ish romance about a normal girl and a mysterious boy with alien powers. Seem familiar?<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit I compared this to Twilight more than once while watching. I'd even argue that this has less action (or well put together fight scenes) than the vampire movie. The fight scenes in this are forgettable, and some look like the actors are swinging around on cables. Hard to swallow when you know that these are aliens who have been trained to try and protect themselves in self defense.<br /><br />My next complaint is character development. As soon as I saw the titular Number Four (or \\"John Smith\\" as they unoriginally decide to name him), I didn't see a distinctive personality. I saw a face that would fill seats with teenage girls. And even besides that fact, I couldn't pin down one distinctive thing about him, and he's the main character! Sure he gets new powers, but he's too busy flirting around with Sarah (Dianna Agron) to develop any of them. Moving onto her character, she's your average every day photographer, doesn't really contribute anything to the plot, which is a shame, because I like her work on Glee. John's sidekick in this is a basic goofy nerdy kid, and I'd lie if I didn't say he was the most annoying part of the movie. Maybe it's the actor's hollow performance, maybe it's because his character's a cliche, etc., I just didn't enjoy the character at all. Henri, John's mentor, is our Obi-Wan Kenobi, whose only purpose it seems is to die, so John can have a reason to finally use his powers. The villains in this, right alongside the sidekick were the worst part of the movie. It's never explained why they want to kill the nine aliens (and if it was I must have missed it), and they're just (to put it bluntly) dumb looking, and don't have much to offer, and if there's one thing I look for in a movie, it's a good villain. If I had to pick one good actor, it would probably be the dog (shapeshifting alien) that John adopts.<br /><br />Next, is the book to movie translation, and the gaping plot holes we're left with as a result. What happened to the sidekick's dad? Why is John leaving the town at the end? How did that shapeshifting dog survive the slaughter of the planet all these aliens are from? Why does it follow John and Henri around at the beginning of the film. What's the bad guy's motivation again? Most, if not all of these questions are never answered in favor of poorly written romance and badly choreographed action sequences. If you read the book (I didn't) you'll be able to understand most of these situations (hopefully). But if you didn't read the book (or even know it was a book) you will be very confused by the film's end.<br /><br />The last complaint I have is more of a personal one. The music. Yes, those pointless scenes near the beginning of the film where they play a popular song over what's happening. It wouldn't be so bad, if maybe they were playing on the radio, or had significance to the scene. But nope, \\"We used Adele's \\"Rolling in The Deep\\" for the trailer, gotta put it in with the scene of Number Six blowing up a house.\\" What? That and some of these are played within five minutes of each other. It doesn't flow.<br /><br />So, am I saying this film is bad? Yes. It could have been great. The premise looked interesting enough for me to pick it up and watch it. Sadly, the amount of wasted potential in this film made me want to go back and skip it. All I have to say is, if the book is like this, than I will probably skip reading that one.
B001B51B9M|5.0|This Blu Ray is so wonderful to see.  When I finished watching this disc, I felt like I had seen the Music Man once again in the best possible way since seeing it at the movies when I was in high school.  Robert Preston and Shirley Jones are simply superb in the lead roles.  It is beautifully filmed and a joy to experience.  I am so glad Preston's performance of Harold Hill was preserved on film.  This film is simply a joy to view.

I also used it when I watched my neice over the weekend, put her right to sleep.

B001PBEJL4|5.0|Having seen Camelot on it original roadshow engagement in Atlanta, GA....I have loved this movie ever since.  I have bought it on Beta tape and lastly laserdisc....and finally in Blu Ray.  The Blu Ray is about as close as one can get to the original experience of seeing it on the big screen in 70 mm.  This release seems to be the uncut orignal roadshow version... with scenes restored that had been missing when released to local run theaters.  The colors and sound are crisp and beautiful.  If you love this film you will not be disappointed in this latest release.  I am disappointed that the additional audio CD is limited to only a few songs instead of the whole soundtrack album.  Still...the movie is what I was after....so well worth the purchase.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|Beautifully written by an author with an obvious passion for flowers and writing .  This is a book to share amongst friends just lovely.

It taught me at a young age that parents take care of their children and still love them besides bad and frustrating behavior, and the most important part was that this was a mutual love. Parents took care of children, and children took care of their parents. I can't wait to take care of my mother in her old age as she has taken care of me. The book is touching, yet at the same time light hearted enough and silly at times.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was so much game for the money I spent.  It was a long game but didn't drag on, was interesting and engaging the whole time, and was a really nice balance of adventure/problem solving with found objects and the occasional hidden object scenes.  It wasn't too challenging to be enjoyable, and it wasn't even close to boring. didn't want to put it down! great graphics, great storyline, and great, intuitive interface. I wish they were all this good! I'll happily pay another 2 bucks for the sequel. this one would have been worth paying more.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Character development & plot were a bit thin, overwhelmed by too much special effects. Still adequately entertaining, but nothing beyond that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have not one bad thing to say. It's been great playing Solitaire on my Kindle and have no \\"issues\\" with this app.
B007PVHANM|5.0|If you love Bob Marley and Reggae Music this is a must have.<br />Learn about the Ledgend things you didnt know, great music and so many details i loved it.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|\\"Iron Sky\\" is a brilliant effort but tries to be two different movies that are inconsistent with each other.<br /><br />As a political and social satire, it's hilarious. The Sarah Palin character as U.S. president is a hoot because it's so close to reality. As a rumination on the stupidity and mindless destructiveness of the human race, it's pessimistic and serious. Those parts of the movie are accompanied, appropriately enough, by themes from Wagner's \\"Gotterdamerung.\\" Each part works in isolation, but they don't work well together.<br /><br />The cast is fine. Star Julia Dietze is a honey and a half in addition to being a fine actress. Overall, I enjoyed it a great deal and have ordered the DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice easy to use and very easy to see calculator that is handy to have around on the Kindle.  No more to say than that.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Love this book but sex scenes are a little. Wish the author would spend more time on the villian and back story , then sex between the two main characters. But i still can't put it down. Hope there more series to come. I love the love story that has devoloped. Can't get enough Christian and Anna!

1439102732|4.0|Not my absolute favorite book by Jodi Picoult, but I still enjoyed it very much. None of the subject matter fits my lifestyle (evangelical, infertility or gay), but it was interesting to read and kept my attention til the very end. I do feel that there were some things that weren't addressed - like why Liddy and Reid couldn't just do their own IFV since they are filthy rich, but otherwise everything else fell into place really well. I highly recommend the book, but not the CD of music that came with it. Maybe I didn't give the music a fair shot because the first song was enough to make me turn it off, but I didn't feel that it needed a cd. To sum it up - a good book with 4 stars.
B004H7QICG|4.0|You will never find a \\"perfect\\" case.  I received the V3 revision which has all USB 3.0 connections on the front.  Unlike the older versions reviewed here the connections for all these are terminated for use a now standardized motherboard header.  However, many motherboards, including mine, only have provisions for two internal 3.0 USB connections.  After a bit of searching on Antec's web site I found they will sell you a very inexpensive adapter that will convert the internal 3.0 USB connector to an internal 2.0 USB connector.  In this way you can utilize all three USB connections on the front panel.  However, my bottom connector while \\"USB 3.0 Blue\\" is only 2.0.<br /><br />Other than that very few complaints.  My last build was with a P180 and the upgrade to the new case are nice.  I liked the plain silver color of the P180 better and I'm not keen on the aesthetics of the additional ventilation.  But the old case was a bit air starved so I understand why it was done.<br /><br />It's not a cheap case and there are plenty of good quality cases for much less money.  However, the construction and quiet design are worth the premium to me.  If you don't need the quiet design you can find just as nice for much less.
