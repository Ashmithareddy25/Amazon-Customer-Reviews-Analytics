B00122J30S|3.0|I like the new material but I think it would be balanced better with James Iha's voice rather than all nasal by Billy Corgan, which works, not putting him down, but the Siamese and Mellon Collie stuff had balance in the vocals or maybe a better would be variation, rather than just his vocals trying to carry the whole song.  Give James Iha's \\"To Who Knows Where,\\" and tell me if that isn't the best Smashing Pumpkins song this century.  I love Billy Corgan and James Iha.  Like the Beatles and the Smiths and 10,000 Maniacs and Pink Floyd, the fans of Smashing Pumpkins are just left with scattered elements of what could have been.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I began by wondering if I would be able to follow the story. Once I had read the first two chapters, I was drawn in by the beautiful, haunting words of the author. The Book Thief displays what the German people felt and dealt with during the Nazi reign.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|took to long to upload, program did not load to my tablet well. Could be slowed for kids 3-5 years old.
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|This is a pretty great album- there's a lot of fantastic songs, i just wish it had a few more. But seriously, buy it. in physical form- you never know when you'll need it.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|this movie was so well made! my kids and i both just love it!! id never heard of it till this last year and we watch it everyday (no joke!) super great story line and good for adults too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game. Easy to play. No problem with loading. It's great that it's doesn't force you buy online for something. Fun to use and not so complicated with the app. This help to pass the time. But it would be nice if they had it in level and also has 2 lives to continue on. But if it doesn't work it is still a great game
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|We are giving this to our grandkids for Christmas. We hope they love it and think it as funny as we did.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS IS THE PERFRCT SUBSITUTE OF SUBWAY SURFERS! The story is that one of my friends of my passed school, David,  introduced me to this game on a feild trip, And I fell in love with it! 9 months later, I downloaded the app on my 6 month old Kindle Fire. But I still never loose the moment of c'mon when I die. Yet, If you like A mix of Indiana Jones and Free running, you will love it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought this was a great book. We read it for our book club and I so loved what the principal said in his graduation speech.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It takes my mind off of any problems I may have. It's fun, easy, but also helps stimulate brain activity with planning strategies if you wish to play t that way. I play against friends and relatives so we can at least keep in touch.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|This is a beautiful song, so romantic, and John has an incredible voice, not often do I love a song the first time I hear it, but this was one of them!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best app I ever got. It is amazing I recommend this to ages 11 and up because of slight violence. But overall it is the best.
0930289234|5.0|Fantastic graphic novel! I read it all the time. The movie got me psyched about it, but there are a lot of differences. I'm a big fan! I recommend the character comics, as well!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Great mixer shipping was fast the price for this product the price was the best that i found am very happy with the product.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I am a fan of Queen and especially the incomparable Freddie Mercury. This is a superb collection of every one of Queen's greatest hits.
B000I2IP2K|5.0|Excellent condition. Only downside is that my DVD player can't read it. Just use a laptop and change the region settings but that's a minor hiccup.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|Definitely a keeper. Worth viewing on dreary days. Always a good chuckle. Watch with friends!  Definitely a member of my library.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app worked once only. After that when I did a search for an artist on YouTube it would NOT show all the videos by that artist...instead it placed random videos in the search results. After downloading a video it erased it after I viewed the video....I lost control
B00E0SXNE8|3.0|It was cute, original and entertaining but I'm not sure it was worth a &#34;keeper&#34; and am having a bit of buyers remorse.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Withings Pulse is an excellent Activity & Sleep tracking device which has a very simple interface and very user friendly. You can take it anywhere you go since it's very handy. And with it comes an wristband to use during sleeping time and a belt clip to be used during sports time. In ordinary days you can just slip it into your pocket, and you're tracking your steps along your way! Very clever little thing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS A VERY EXCITING GAME AS ONE MOVES FORWARD TO ACHIEVE the next GOAL.  Helps with strategic thinking and lateral thinking to solve the puzzle.
B00DJ3ITKS|5.0|Very dynamic storyline that  takes you into the time and characters so that you feel part not just an observer. Gives it more of a novel rather than documentary feeling. You take away more of the drive of Jeff Bezos rather than just the impact, and the author gives you a &#34;warts and all&#34; feel for Jeff Bezos and Amazon. I really felt able to touch the core of Amazon in its growing stages, and came away with a humanised understanding of this meteoric company and the individual that created it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This one took me several weeks to complete. I tore through Divergent quickly. I'm not sure I liked the back and forth point of view, and Tobias was so mopey for such a long time. Overall I would say I only finished it to see how the whole thing ended.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This is not a typical book in my collection of reading. It has stretched me. For that I recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves this game! It keeps him occupied when he is having trouble listening, and keeps him out of trouble..
B002N5N4M6|5.0|One of the best comedies on TV!!!! SO funny and it keeps you wanting more!!! I will by later seasons as well!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I love the Stephen King Books and this on was another I could not stop reading.  I think I read this one in two days.  I also read Under the Dome which was very good.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|My wife and I don't watch much broadcast TV, but when my brother-in-law the hillbilly philospher recommends something, we pay attention. BIg Bang is one of his faves and we gave it a try. These nerdy physicists and the gorgeous girl who's the only normal person, are all just a riot. Got a great deal on this set through Amazon UK, way cheaper than anything in the US.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|One of my all time favorites!! You cannot be a guy and not love this movie!! It is a must see!!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Is this the greatest sitcom ever? I wouldn't argue the point. I never tire of seeing Basil and the wife and their retainers do battle with enemies real and imagined. I remember the first time I saw Basil up on that ladder, I laughed so hard I pulled a muscle in my stomach. Seriously. If, by some quirk of fate, you haven't seen FT, do so now. You will never forget it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|excellent app!! too bad there isn't a clean master home version; I would clean all the time. A A A A ++++
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin's dark and bloody fantasy world continues to deliver - i couldn't put it down! I am so hoping there is another book in the works...
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|They're awesome!! Worth every penny a group that'll go a long way. Their vocals are unsurpassed and for the day of music again.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I love Stephen King's prose. And I often love his characters. That's why I rated Doctor Sleep 3 stars-in my book, he always starts out at a 3! But Doctor Sleep didn't move beyond that. I felt the characters were never fleshed out and the ending was anticlimactic. I so wanted to know what happened to Danny and Wendy; Wendy was hardly mentioned.<br /><br />I now do look rather suspiciously at all those RVs roaming the interstates, though.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely adore this game! I thought it was very creepy-good! Although I got bored with playing it the second time, it made up for it by having a very intriguing story line
B00FHATBGW|3.0|I was looking forward to a new Big Fish game to play.  This was a disappointment.  Another reviewer said they got bored and used the hint a lot.  Well, so did I.  A lot!  Not much of a story&hellip;<br />I also had some tap response issues (although not with the hammer and nails); some of the placements for inventory items were waaay off. You'll need to be persistent, and keep trying AROUND the spot where it SHOULD go.<br />The game was playable on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and I would recommend, but it's not the best Big Fish has to offer.  But  hey, even a bad Big Fish game is  better than most.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I am still reading this book but am finding it fascinating. I am absorbed in the history and story line.I am repulsed by the actions of the Nazi characters who I find disturbing and repulsive.
B000MLS716|4.0|I purchased this release for the nested box poster that was included in the 1994 CD, I already own the music. This was the UK release and it did not include the poster, which is the only reason this is not a five star review. If anyone knows where I can pick up the poster, not the $1,000 autographed printing, please post below.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I purchased this memory for an older HP printer. It was shipped promptly and arrived within the estimated time. The item was packed securely and was not damaged. I have installed the memory and it has been working as it should.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I have been a die hard Korn fan since their first album, and I am so pleased with this album!  They have defiitely done whatever they could to please their fans with this album.  There is not one song on it that I don't like!
0061726834|5.0|Lena Haloway appears to be an innocent girl who has a deep, underlying, rebellious side to her, which desires to break free.  She was forced to accept a lifestyle that was inflicted into her daily habits; which made her think that this mold made by her society was right for her.  However, fate inevitably takes control.  Lena found that her destiny was far from her expectations, and that she could break free from the restraints that her society imposes.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver does an amazing job allowing the reader to feel in the moment and experience the thoughts and emotions of the main character, Lena Haloway.  She portrays the exact thoughts and feelings through Lena's outlook, enabling the reader to connect with Lena and relate to her.  When Lena went to a party in the hills she was terrified and unsure of what to think.  This was her first (somewhat) rebellious act towards the government, so naturally she was so afraid of being caught.  The number of people at the party and the mix of girls and guys was overwhelming for her.  Lena didn't know what to think and left shortly after arriving because she couldn't sort out her feelings.  Lena wanted to explore her rebellious side however she was afraid of what she would find.  She arrived at the party and all she saw were throngs of people, all meshed together moving to the beat of music she had never heard before.  Everyone was about her age, and acting like it was completely normal for uncured teens of opposite gender to be together.  But this was too much for Lena to handle in one night-especially when she spotted Alex.<br /><br /> The author shocks the readers by changing the plot drastically.  This makes the reader second-guess all of Lena's morals and everything the reader has come to know about her throughout the beginning of the novel.  Lena's character changes drastically in one moment, which leaves the reader confused and concerned for Lena's future.  The plot changed was when Lena realized that she lovedAlex.  She knew it was going against everything she had learned, or had been forced to learn, but her heart was sending her in the opposite direction.... the direction of love.  Lena kept saying to herself, I can't do this, I can't become an image of my mother, a love freak who ended up killing herself because of the disease, I have to prove myself different, to become the perfect daughter like my sister, not be another freak of the family, uncontrollable and in love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush Saga is now on Kindle! Works great! Would highly recommend this app but beware.....highly addictive!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a wonderful book!!!  I'll read it again.  The whole history is so well thought. Recommended 100% and remember to use your red scarf!!! ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy the game, however, hate the fact it's not totally free. I'll play but won't pay. Otherwise it's a good way to kill a little time.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|What a great movie!! Definitely one to add to your collection. Heartwarming and Sandra B is simply amazing. I highly recommend this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If this thing would have cost a penny more I would have returned it.  They did a great job setting a low price since it really doesn't do very much.  I was under the impression I would be able to easily stream most things from my tablet via Chrome, but that only seems to work from my laptop. I think it has a ton of potential and it's awesome if you travel frequently and stay at hotels with HDTV as you can bring this and stream Netflix from your phone or tablet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|More levels please. I love this game. At first it was difficult but now it is a challenge that is addicting and fun.
006202406X|5.0|After months of anticipating the release of Allegiant, I was very disappointed that the initial reviews posted on Amazon.com were so negative.  I was especially watching the reviews because a few other series I've read recently had negative reviews of the last installment but I trudged through the books anyway to be disappointed (as predicted).  Fortunately I didn't feel that way about this book.  To be honest, I'd probably only give it four stars, but I'm trying to off set the negatives a bit.<br /><br />The comparison between this series and the Hunger Games is always out there and honestly I enjoyed this series more.  There are a lot of personality concepts (nature vs nurture) that are interesting to consider when reading these.  I also felt this third book was more realistic and had better writing/closure than the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you enjoyed the first two books, read this one and make your own judgement.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|I loved this redo. The series is a classic. I like what they are doing with these theatrical releases. Great quality animation. Can't wait for the next one.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Being able to stream my desktop for classes is great I never have to bring in more paper than I don't need, also great for gaming on lunchbreak. Easily my most accessed app on my device by a long shot. It's like have my 8core in my hands
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I love this redo, redo. again? Can't get enough. Nice animation. Cool action. Giant robots. I enjoyed it as much as the original.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Progressively more challenging as each level introduces new concepts which you must then use and combine to solve successive puzzles. This delightful game will provide hours of entertainment in manageable chunks no matter how much time you have.
B002UJIY70|5.0|Again, Timothy. Plus this is a very good movie. You will think you have it all figured out but you will be surprised by the ending.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|There are tons of reviews giving this book 5 star reviews because they feel bad for all the low ratings they don't believe that she should be receiving.  There is no possible way where anyone should give this book 5 stars.  Veronica took the story in a very uninteresting way and the book got continuously worse when they left the city.  I really enjoyed Divergent and I quite enjoyed Insurgent...and Allegiant was terrible.  Not only was it a bad book, it was a terrible story to.end the trilogy.  I am not upset about the ending like many people...that was obvious from the beginning.  But just the book as a whole is a huge let down.  If you really liked Divergent and Insurgent then do yourself a favor and DO NOT read this book.  LOOKING OVER MY REVIEW SEVERAL MONTHS LATER:  wow wow wow I rated this book one star because of how God awful it really is, and they changed it to a 2 star review.  they must be hurting for ratings.
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|This is a nicely designed basic calculator.  It looks great on my Fire HDX7 and on my HDX8.9.  It does follow the order of operations.  You can see your history, although weirdly, it is in two parts.  You can either see the history of the calculations without answers, or the history of the answers.<br /><br />You can go back and edit prior calculations and recalculate by tapping on the calculation and using the backspace and cursor movement keys.<br /><br />You can specify a tax rate to be used when the add tax or subtract tax buttons are tapped.<br /><br />A nice basic calculator.  I'd give it a solid four stars. 4 of 7 reviews are four stars and above.
B009RH973I|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle, because she tends to drop stuff.  It fits perfectly and offers a lot of protection, and she loves the pink color.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|One of the most underrated films out there. If your a fan of fantasy movies (Lord of The Rings), you will LOVE this movie. Don't let the cheesy box fool ya, this movie is GREAT! You won't even notice the subtitles after the first 5 minutes and it gives the movie a more authentic feel. Watch it, you won't regret it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this when Im travelling and it work very well for me. I also use it at home so I don't change my work alarm clock.
B00004CXIE|1.0|I was very disappointed because this was a European DVD and was not advertised that way...as such it wouldn't play
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|Ancillary Justice presents an interesting take on machine intelligence and machine/human interaction.  The fairly complicated plot hangs together well and the action moves along smartly.  A very good read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Totally taken by surprise by the Red Wedding. Expect the unexpected as you go on  --- lesson learned. I am going straight to the next book.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|You expect a prime product from Gov't Mule and here they do not disappoint.  Warren's guitar and his unique voice are in top form and with the excellent band behind him they produce a set of instant classics.  The bonus disc with guest lead singers taking Warren's place is top notch and very interesting.  It also helps to highlight how good Warren really is.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is very engaging.  I am a beginner to games of this sort but it is not hard to play.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book! It is so good and I absolutely loved Kendall's and Payton's love story! Can't wait to read more from Kristen Zimmer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! The graphics and the vibrant colors really make it enjoyable and the idea of not having to tilt the screen like temple run makes it even more appealing.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Does a great job it  never crashes and its well worth the downliad i have it installed on all my devices
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A wonderful series.  Watched it on TV but couldn't get enough of it.  Great scenery and costumes.  Storyline is like nothing else on regular TV.  When buying the DVD, make sure you get the UK version, as the regular version is cut and you'll miss valuable story lines.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Action and humor, and it's family friendly what's not to Love about that?! Great movie to watch and own. A must
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|exciting movie with good actors.  I  enjoy fast paced, exciding movies.  This is one that I missed when it came out.
B007DA2FHG|4.0|Beautiful photography sucks you in.  Story is so so, but worth staying with. Need to watch with a great sound system and excellent HD.
0375869026|5.0|Where to begin?  Wonder won the hearts of everyone in our family.  A beautifully written book about a young boy working to overcome his challenge in life.  Not only is the book well written but it instills a lesson of empathy and understanding for others without being preachy. An absolute must buy book, that will bring both tears and smiles, while rooting for the main character Auggie.  We enjoyed this book so much that we were sad when it came to an end!
B005F3GMAO|4.0|Branson is a perfect example of a person making the most of the hand he has been dealt. His views on business, relationships and life in general are thought-provoking.<br /><br />This books was excellent until the last 3 chapters. The last chapters seemed to be unorganized by covering a wide range of topics ranging from business ventures to Iraqi crisis and family matters, which made it difficult to comprehend. Because of this, i can't rate the book with a 5.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This blew my mind. The heads are each their own thing and can be placed however you please, then you add water and get a great miniature version of the Governor's trophy case. As for season 3 itself, still the gripping, gritty, survival story we love.
B00DXP0QX0|1.0|This is way too much money to pay for what few songs you get. It has the same songs over and over in different versions and not at all the quality of Rod Stewart's previous releases.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|The Walking Dead is killing the special edition market. This things huge, and the details are amazing. The removable screwdriver is a great touch. And season 2 of the show is everything that made the first great, and then some.
B008602KQI|4.0|Worth watching. Makes me wanna see the newest installment slated to hit theatres in a few days! I also wanna read the books as well now.
0785162348|5.0|These are best art of books and this one is no different. A great edition to my collection, rounding out all of phase one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Except f or the annoying unlock issue having to beg friends for access coupons this game is the first game that managed to hook me since Texas hold em.
1608871827|5.0|Features an in depth look at the gorgeous art that went into Pacific Rim, which had some of the best design work in a film( in my opinion). Great detailed looks at scenery, characters, the machines, and most importantly; the monsters. It's got a lot of great Guy Davis (Hellboy) art in it. Underneath the slip cover is a nice hardcover featuring the Pacific Defense logo.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I purchased this item as a gift for my daughter. She is a huge fan. The packaging was like new and when she saw the casing she was extremely happy. I got my monies worth. Great buy.
1419703692|5.0|It's not as great as the Marvel Studios art of's, but it gives a great look into Nolan's fantastic, gritty, real trilogy.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As always Preston and Child, the greatest team since peanut butter and jelly, have done it again.  This page turner never stops right up to the very end. Their ideas for a story never stop amazing me and the information they provide along the way proves always interesting. A must read for Pendergast fans.
0785168109|5.0|These are the BEST art of books you're ever going to find. And Iron Man 3 does it again with beautiful suit designs and a great look into a more comic-book Mandarin.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I have already finished all the books and I must say that every single one of them is by far AMAZING! My interest was always engaged, and other than a few typos... very well written. Richelle Mead is a brilliant writer, I look forward to more of her work. If you are having second thoughts or were mislead by another, by all means do not listen to them and get these books. Not just this one but ALL of them :-)
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|amazing album!<br />If you like Drake you will love this album!<br />Top 5 favs<br />Furthest Thing<br />Worst Behavior<br />Own It<br />The Language<br />Come thru<br />Too much<br />Well six top fav!
B0049MAXQG|5.0|gives me nightmares still. cant sleep without turning my light on. sad state of affairs, it is. watch at your own risk and dont say you werent warned!
B0091WRCOA|5.0|Awesome movie. I would also recommend this movie in 3D if you have a 3D HDTV. Very good movie on my Samsung Galaxy note2 and my Kindle Fire HDX.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I'm a fan of this genre and this one is pretty good.  I did the free trial which gets you into the middle of the mystery and then I felt compelled to buy it to get to the end.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Works great for a runner to keep track of heart rate and time.  Seems to be of good quality so far.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|You get all your favorite Seether songs on this album, plus a whole 2nd disc full of new songs. I count Seether as one of the top 3 bands of the 2000-2010 era along with Nickelback and Coheed and Cambria. There are at least 8 great songs on this album that I enjoy listening to and I recommend it for all the music you get at a great price.
B008K5T5AI|3.0|The first few culture stories you read nearly blow your mind, but by now it feels more like returning to well liked places. A fine read, though - LOTS of twists and turns. And should it be the first culture novel you read, I fully expect you to feel completely blown away! It is a coherent and fractally detailed universe you'll find yourself in.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|iconic & delightful :-) When Burton, etal. released this film, it was clear there had never been anything like it before - visually, metaphysically - so it was clear that this was a very original piece of cinematic art... and so much fun, too.  Having just now Re-Viewed it, I'm surprised by how much time has gone by since: Alec Baldwin's my age and here he is looking very youthful and limber.  And I recall that first scene when Young Wynona Ryder was introduced to the audience, rolled in on an armchair-throne in Arch-Goth Splendor, I remember thinking, &#34;Don't know who this little girl is, but she's going to be a huge star.&#34; Anyway, still delightful - Shake, shake, shake Senora... :-)
1401917232|5.0|A wonder filled book on many different levels! Gary Renard and his teachers are always informative, enlightening , humorous and stay true to the message of Jesus and The Course in Miracles. This book will join the other two books of the &#34;Disappearance&#34; trilogy on my bedside table for constant reading and study along with the &#34;Course&#34; itself...
B002DJSBMA|5.0|Good movie. Classic . Good add to any library . Shocked my wife had never seen it lol . Good stuff
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|If the music soundtrack to this version was real Jazz then I would say I love it. Otherwise-it is a very luxurious interpretation of Gatsby. Everything is opulent -like a lot of modern movies-it moves quickly. The 1949 version did concentrate more on the story but it deviated from the book, this version is true to the book's story and the cinematography is great and the acting good, but the music could have been better chosen.
B0092MH8WA|4.0|More of the American recordings, with Cash trying out songs that wouldn't normally be associated with him. If you only ever get one of these, get IV (it's the best) but this is another good fit for Cash fans.
B000002TLX|5.0|I love music and enjoy this CD. Very happy it was available for me to purchase at a very low cost.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thank goodness this is finally on kindle!!! I love this game but I wish you could earn the power ups instead of having to purchase. them
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|As always,  Denzel Washington is superb in his acting! Realistic or not, overall this is a great movie, highly recommendable.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I just love the brilliance in the writing. I can picture every person and every place in mentioned in the book. I can feel the atmosphere in the house and I can smell the landscape.
1476727651|3.0|A solid follow-up to The Shining as far as the story goes,  but I was disappointed with the execution.<br /><br />Readers of my blog know that I am a King fan through and through. A Constant Reader, if you will. He writes a book, and I read it no matter what it's about because the man can write. And yes, I did enjoy The Shining quite a bit and for those of you that aren't in the know, Doctor Sleep is the sequel to that much-loved book. So going in, King had a lot up against him since the first book was written so many years ago and written when he was battling alcoholism. I'm sure that writing Doctor Sleep in a sober state presented its own challenges too.<br /><br />But, I was not all that impressed with Doctor Sleep and it pains me a little to say it. The story is a about a young man, Dan Torrance, who finds himself battling the demons of his youth. He sees things and he has special talents that even he has yet to fully understand. He's also an alcoholic because the drink, is just about the only thing that puts his \\"shining\\" to rest. As he moves through life, he encounters a young girl who shares his talent and the two get to know each other quite well when they are forced to fight a band of wandering life suckers called the True Knot.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is ultimately a battle between the good and the not-so-good. Some of the characters are more developed than others. I felt that King took more time with Dan and I expected that since he is one of the original characters from The Shining. But Abra, the young girl he encounters, seemed cartoonish to me. I had a problem with her age. She felt younger to me than she was. I also had a problem with the main villain, Rose. I never really saw her as a viable threat and I think that is what really disappointed me about the book. You need a really evil villain, one that you can really remember, and Rose was weak in my opinion.<br /><br />The ending wrapped-up too quickly, whereas other parts of the story seemed to plod along. Was it entertaining? Yes. I'd say that most of King's books are and there are glimmers of wonderful-ness here and there, but overall, it was a little too safe for me to love it. However, I did feel as if King did Dan justice in the story itself. It was not a bad story line at all. I just wish it had finished a little stronger.along. Was it entertaining? Yes.

B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|I was pretty excited when I saw that one reviewer had mentioned that this is like TI calculators but when I installed the app I instantly noticed that what you see in the pictures is all you get. I was hoping it had some customizations with more keys like my pretty basic TI-30x calculator that includes keys for easily converting fractions into decimals. This calculator is fine and it's nice that the screen shows the whole calculation and there's a history button but there are so many other calculators that at least does the same things as this one or calculators that cost the same or a little less that does much more and has more of a preference and customization menus with more choices of keys. I was just so stoked when I saw someone compare it to the Texas Instruments calculators so I felt real let down when I saw this didn't have much to offer at all (let me point out that the calculator I had expected it to be like is a pretty basic calculator for pre-algebra problems, I didn't expect anything like a powerful graphing calculator or anything that would cost over $15 if you were buying a calculator at target and I don't think I would've been so harsh if it were $1.)
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|A tragic tale of a split second's insanity that consumes multiple lives.  The author does a nice job of getting into each heroine's head, but didn't weave enough surprises to hold my interest.
B00G32TD98|4.0|This was a really scary movie without too much blood, guts and torture which seems to be the theme of current scary movies.  The was an end to the movie, so we will not see &#34;The Conjuring II&#34; !!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read constantly and too many to count in my lifetime.  This book should be read by everyone who enjoys a great tale.  I especially liked the narrative being told by death.  I could feel the emotion in both worlds.  It is a truly unique read.
B00845PRDS|5.0|Awesome song - great way to start my day, find myself jazzed up for work, Army, family, etc.  What more can an American man ask?
B0038NN3B4|5.0|It is an easy read. I am only 2 weeks and 2 days into the diet and I have lost twelve pounds. If you  tried diet after diet to the point where you find it difficult to lose anything this is for you. Do not modify and make for life.
B0013K6WLM|4.0|The album was a gift for my little brother. He loved the album. I picked it for the song I Got Mine which was my favorite Black Keys song.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|The service is great and the movie came in very excellent condition, The movie is great and very funny!!... Michael Keaton is very funny!!...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this a fantastic game for those who love finding hidden objects and who love to solve a mystery! Two games in one!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Well researched, informative, thought-provoking and fun to read. How the underdog is not really the underdog at all, how liabilities can be advantages, how the &#34;best school&#34; can slash your chance of success by 30%, and in general turning our ideas on their heads. I gave this four instead of five stars because of the material about class size--research shows that the difference in student achievement is at the 15-student mark. Finding no statistical difference between 23 students and 30 students misses the real point of the research available.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game was hard at first but then I figured out how to play the game and then it was very fun
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Solid, for 35 bones can't be beat.  Make sure it's within line of sight of your WAP or it'll have some skipping issues.  Even a thru drywall it has issues at times.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good looking and stylish, easy to use, and classy looking.<br />Weak documentation - but it's easy to set up anyway.<br /><br />Now you can stream from Netflix's and never leave the couch ~
B00FX8EY60|5.0|She is truly an artist.  You can tell by each track the work she puts in.  I love every track.  The album is like a short story.  Can't wait to see the videos
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card is a genius. Please read even if you didn't like the movie. The book is so much better!!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|My interest in reading this original work came from my enjoyment of many of the interpretations I have been exposed to. Wicked the musical, the Judy Garland version, and the television show Tin man all draw from this source and have merits of their own. I enjoyed reading the original work and remember reading other stories of Frank L. Baum as a child. I look forward to reading his work to my own children.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is really good it has all the robots that was in the movie and even some added robots to have more fun you should really get this game<br /><br />This game is really fun they have all the robots from the movie and some added one for fun. You should really get this game.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|Love Michael Fassbender!  Well made film... very realistic!  Great to finally see frontal nudity with respect to men, rather than just women.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A super mind blowing game and a great challange. I loved every chapter of it and was dissapointed it only took be about a week to finish. Waiting for the The Room Two  to come out.  Hurry up with that!! :)
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Great book... Wish I read it before the movie. Can't wait to read more books by this amazing author. Great
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook keeps me in touch with family and friends.  Since we live out of state now. bi cam keep up with what is going on and keep them informed. I also can find friends I haven't spoke to in years.
B003INBOEM|5.0|I'm a big Bruce Lee fan and have always been fascinated by his background and story about his 'teacher'. I have also been a big fan of Donnie Yen since I saw 'The Iron Monkey'. So this movie is a great addition to my collection. Wonderful portrayal and great action sequences. Fantastic movie. Loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, I don't have to keep borrowing my 8 year olds Android. BEST GAME EVER. Now I need Pet Rescue Saga to be completely happy.
B007REV4YI|5.0|In my opinion, best Bond film yet!! Great story, fantastic action scenes and, as always, great Bond opening sequence! Loved it from start to the bittersweet ending. Can't wait to see how they will follow this!!
B00BAXFCPO|2.0|Same old, same old....fish, eggs, vegetables, berries, nuts. No sugar, bread, pasta, potatoes.  Low carb diet. Pretty much same as South Beach, Atkins, etc. Don't waste your money if your familiar with the premise of them.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie about Abraham Lincoln's presidency and was really well done.  I was surprised how well he really looked like Lincoln in the movie and the movie follows the true story very well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is great bingo slot game.  Bingo is fun and easy and the slots are a lot of fun to play. Highly recommend this game.
0792163710|4.0|This was a gift for someone.  Apparently they liked it because they requested it and I never heard any complaints.  I believe it was DVD rather than blu ray.  But it was a great price.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's the nerdiest purchase I've ever made, but it does exactly what it says it does. The sounds are pretty right on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written but halfway through the book it started strange, &#34;couldn't happen&#34;  scenes and plots.  However, this novel provided great entertainment for me.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|it was a funny book and a mind candy kind of book . not a serious book I have nothing else to say
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book I got lost in the book really self-explanatory best book ever! I love this book totally
1594136742|5.0|I love a title with more than one meaning. In this case. Wild can refer to the idea of hiking more than a thousand miles of the 2,663 mile Pacific Crest Trail, the wild trail itself, and even to the author, particularly in her former life. Wild by Cheryl Strayed is well named.<br /><br />When Cheryl Strayed contemplated hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) she had no idea of the magnitude of her impulsive decision. She was totally unprepared for this rugged endeavor. She had researched the trail a bit, inquired and shopped for equipment at REI, and bought a trail guide. But she hadn't done any preliminary back-packing to test her equipment, nor to build up her stamina. Indeed, she'd never backpacked at all, only day-hiked.<br /><br />She starts her journey at the south end of the trail, near the Mexican border. She actually packs her backpack for the first time in the motel room the morning she is to begin her journey. She can barely lift it off the floor. She soon learns that her boots don't fit her correctly, a mistake that plagues her during the entire trip. When she encounters snow and ice, she's woefully unprepared and under equipped. Although she has arranged to have relief packages mailed to herself along the way, she underestimated the amount of money she'd need.<br /><br />Still, over the next several weeks she strives on, overcomes fear and struggles through pain and extreme exhaustion. Her daily mileage is at first pathetic, but she eventually achieves an impressive 17 to 19 miles per day. Strayed's appreciation of the beauty around her bolsters her morale. Her intention is to achieve this ambitious feat alone and for the most part, she is alone, though she encounters a few people along the way. She gains a reputation among other hikers and is dubbed \\"Queen of the PCT.\\"<br /><br />Strayed skillfully includes flashbacks of her life, many of which directly relate to the purpose of this seemingly insurmountable quest.<br /><br />Coming from a \\"hippy\\" background, Strayed's sense of values will undoubtably differ from many readers, perhaps even to an irritating degree, but her sense of achievement and dedication to her goal will inspire and resonate with many readers. The author's writing style sparkles with vivid descriptions and humor as this incredible journey unfolds against all odds.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|My younger sister loves this app. It's an amazing mix of strategy, logic, and just fun! I highly reccomend. But warning, there Is another game called toca hair salon 2 and its fraud. It's not this app though lol.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|[From the Digital Bits:] Lots of people are buying the Blu-ray or Blu-ray 3D version of Man of Steel on Amazon expecting to get a premium content experience for their money. But instead they're discovering that if you buy the same title at Wal*Mart, it's got two exclusive featurettes - \\"The Iconic Characters of Man of Steel\\" (20 min) and \\"The Sonic Landscape of Man of Steel\\" (13 min).  If you're a fan of Man of Steel and you've just purchased the highest-priced version of the title hoping to dig into tons of great special edition material, it's frustrating to find out that - unless you buy a second copy at Wal*Mart - you don't even get all of the special feature content you were hoping for. It gets worse: Target has an exclusive Blu-ray version too that includes five more featurettes - under the heading \\"X-Ray Vision\\" (31 min total) - only available there.<br /><br />So now, if you want everything, you're faced with the choice of potentially having to buy TWO versions of the same title, while possibly returning your original Amazon copy, which had none of the exclusive content.<br /><br />Send the studios a message and avoid buying any version of this Blu-ray!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This  was a good book two in this series! I enjoyed the relationship and the struggles between Ethan an  Lena. Defiantly a book intended for high school aged audiences and because of that I felt some parts were a little slow. Overall great, well written book!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I could barely get through this 3rd book in the trilogy. The first two were so compelling that I couldn't put them down. What a disappointment.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love Mahjong gaming and this one peaks interest.  Love the design and clarity of the game.  This app doesn't disappoint.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Great to read books but still needs to improve the way we navigate through the book sometimes I have to go back to the first page
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider solitaire is a good game at best and this one doesn't disappoint.  Love the action involved.  The entire format is good as well as movement sequence of each card.
B0061US58C|5.0|I am a grown man and I am not afraid to admit that this movie cracks me up! Game Changer in my mind! I mean they are cars and they talk! Hilarious! Maybe it is my simple minded humor but how can you not enjoy mader the tow truck! Larry the Cable guy puts on an Oscar worth performance!<br /> I think my wife thinks I am crazy because I laugh so hard at these type of movies but thats ok...
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun to play - spent hours doing so.  Only suggestion; change up the tile design to peak more interest.  Changing tile design would encourage a five star rating for me.
B00DU73T08|2.0|I am the type of person that loves almost every movie I watch and can find something enjoyable about the experience! However when it comes to the Host it is pretty  hard to find something… I mean it was just not that well done. My sister in-law had read the books and was trying to convince me that they are a lot better than the movie… I have decided it is better to not get the kindle version of the Host!
B0014JKJHK|3.0|Nice style of Crocs, and great quality - they seem as though they'd last a long time.  The unisex sizing seems to be a bit off, though.  The women's size 8 equivalent was at least one size too big for me.  Too long, too wide.  Had to return them because of that, but will probably order a smaller size.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The video quality is great! The sound quality is great! The only problem is it is still very limited on the amount of apps that can use it. When it becomes more like mirror cast that will be great! I have seen a lot of people rate this very high because the price is so good…I do not think a low price justifies a higher rating.  It is definitely worth it though if you even if you watch a couple youtube videos a month with it. I love being able to take my Nexus 10 and watch youtube on my TV. It is a great way to watch VICE!<br />They really need to get more apps on board!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I just finished reading and am at a loss.  This was the greatest story I have ever read.  Absolutely amazing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. it's fast, challenging. I like the time comparisons so I can aim higher next game. Its fun!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Really great game. It's very addictive, although I personally think the prizes are rigged. You never seem to win certain items, and the prizes get repetitious. The fact that you can trade items is a plus. I will however continue to play, since I enjoy it.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW. 1/5/14<br /><br />Originally I had given this app 3 stars, I've now changed it to 1. Another company seems to have taken over & now the game is not very fun anymore. It's impossible to win items when you need that item to complete a room. When you are down to one number to possibly bingo the game either freezes or speeds up & ends. You are constantly kicked out of a round & lose coins or money so a game is not completed. It's rigged so that you spend on in game purchases. When I contact game support the only response you will receive is that its your internet connection even after you state in your complaint that the internet is fine. Many friends of mine have stopped playing, too frustrated by the issues concerning this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it so fun !! I'm stuck on l level thirty. I know it's pretty sad but I've only had it for what a month. But it is still amazingggggg!
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|I expected it to be scarier. It was still a good movie. I would recommend it as a movie to see.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the feature of the white noise as it helps me fall asleep, but when i set the sleep timer and use the white noise, there are short breaks in the noise that disrupt it, defeating the purpose.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|If you like Gladwell 's books, you'll really like this one. Gladwell is such a good writer that he makes a discussion of the relative merits of classroom size interesting. Whether you agree with his analysis or not, you'll be swept along by the narrative. And it'll make you think. Get it.
B000ZELISO|2.0|Includes only Blu-Ray, not Blu-Ray/DVD as stated. 2 discs are included, but they are both blu-ray (one of the movie and one of special features).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nice to see Jake back in action. I hope we see him again soon. No author writes courtroom better than Grisham.
B00902S0IS|5.0|I originally saw Forbidden Planet when it was released in the mid 1950's. It was the Star Wars of its era and nothing came close until Stanley Kubrick's 2001 in the late 60's. The science fiction was excellent for the time and the movie's premise still holds today - we all have our secret (and sometimes not so secret) &#34;ID&#34;. In other words, all of us as humans have a Self centered Independent Nature (SIN). As the movie says, &#34;That's why we have rules and religion&#34; (to attempt to keep things in check and under control). This is a thinking person's film while also being entertaining and visually stunning. The special effects still hold their own as does the electronic music - a first in the 50s. Well worth watching. Yes, some of the plot is silly and juvenile but the underlying theme of the effect human nature has on our choices and actions is accurate and insightful. I own the video as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. The story and characters are wonderful. It is an excellent view of life at that time. I have found all three seasons of this show very addicting and can't wait for the next season
B00874T02K|4.0|Looks great so far! :) I think it's a great app.  Anyone who has trouble organizing their workouts should love it
B00992CF6W|4.0|Pretty close to the full version but there don't seem to be any caves which is kind of a bummer.  Hopefully this gets fixed in a future version update.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its very easy to read and navigate,i like the convience of having it on the kindle fire.you can also choose which version you like.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|Grabbed it to use as a fun little anniversary cake topper for a small cake. My wife and our two little people loved it.  Appreciated that the set included a couple different colors of hair for the bride. Kids still love playing with the set and remembering how much fun we all had during the family-focused observance of our mid-week anniversary this year.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Hugh Jackman is great in this movie.  My kids loved it and watched it many times.  It's action packed and entertaining. Great story!
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Graphics are cool.  Game freezes the Kindle Fire forcing a complete reboot of the device.  Otherwise, the game is fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show! Scares the pants off of you but every episode leaves you wanting more.  It is very realistic and packed with action.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Before I got clean sweep the kindle was jamming up and causing feasts almost every 30 minutes or so making for very slow use.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Gave this to my oldest two grandsons for Christmas and they were a big hit.  Still playing with them after almost a year.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Beautiful Movie! My kid and I just discovered how great are Dr. Seuss books and this in particular is a great one!<br />The movie have some parts of the text but not identically.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was wary of this sequel, but it lives up to the original. Read (or reread) The Shining first - it will really make this so much better. If you like Stephen King in his prime, you will not be disappointed with this.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|bad...never install it. The sounds are just really bad!!! I think it will be more relaxing going outside and pay attention to  nature sounds!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Vivid cinematography, epic story line, and great acting.  What's not to like, except they keep killing off my favorite characters?
0316322407|5.0|I've been following her for over a year and it was great to learn more about her as well as the recent history in<br /><br />Pakistan . She's a hero !!
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This is another great album by Gaga, but has an incredible new sound to it.  It feels more like a personal experience.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|keeps my 3 yr old granddaughter entertained and excited about growing veggies.  nice graphics and easy to understand.  i would recommend this product.
1250012570|5.0|I love the dimension of the two main characters. I also love that it features an Asian male teenage protagonist, in a realistic fashion.
B005PK56TA|5.0|American Horror Story: Murder House Season one is Addicting!!!! I cannot wait for season 2 to start on Amazon Prime!
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie is excellent, but I will always prefer the book. A few key details were left out. I'm not sure how I feel about the intense close ups during fight scenes. I'm guessing that was to make the violence less recognizable to be appropriate for a younger audience.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This album is pure genius! Eminem brings a level of maturity and self discovery in his typical screw loose style. The production is absolutely amazing and blends seamlessly. I enjoyed the typical Dr. Dre beats as well as some of the more old school hip hop, country, and rock elements blended in the album. Eminem's lyrics and flow choices show he is a student and master of the art of rap in its truest form.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I found the book very informative, as i know very little of what is going on over there. She is very smart and her story is very moving
0316322407|5.0|Great book. I learned a lot about Pakistan as well as the Swat Valley, and I joined the Malala Fund as soon as I reached the last page. This young woman is truly phenomenal. People don't come any braver.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|White house down was very suspenseful and action packed! The story line kept my attention the entire movie and was on the edge of my seat  more often than not. Will definitely be watching this again!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I used this app and it help me to get a diffident amount of space (3GB) to get more books and apps to keep me entertained
1492795356|5.0|I bought my first copy of this book studying journalism in the early 80s. Later, when I had to train junior writers at work, it was the first book I put on their reading list - but somewhere along the way my copy wasn't returned. I recently bought another copy for a refresher and to remind me why I use punctuation and style elements the way I do. What a brilliant book. This Elements of Style helps give your writing professional polish. Mean what you say, and say what you mean.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Album of the year hands down. The man is a music genious. I'm not the worlds biggest rap fan either, for the most part I'm not fond of it at all. But Eminem's album is one that just about any fan of music would enjoy.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have not had a chance to read this book.  Plan to in the next couple of weeks. When I do  I am sure that I will give it a 5 star rating.  I like all of John Grisham books.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|This 2nd installment of the BBC broadcasts, which were live on the air, are magical.  You can hear how the Beatles loved the BBC radio specials as the dialog and the music flow easily on this collection.  The well-known early tracks are here, such as \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"From Me To You\\", \\"Boys\\", \\"She Loves You\\", \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", but here you get great great versions of Paul's \\"Lucille\\", John's \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", as well as \\"I'm Talking About You\\", \\"Sure To Fall In Love With You\\" and a marvelous cut of \\"Memphis, Tennessee\\".  Then there are four cool separate interviews the BBC does with John and George on Disc 1 and Paul and Ringo on Disc 2.  The blend here is so great that, like all Beatles albums, it becomes a journey through their music and personality.  This is a must have for the holiday season and one can only hope for a Volume 3, but let's not wait another 19 years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush. So happy I can play on my Kindle. So much better than a phone. Can't stop playing. :D
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is a very helpful product for my phone.  I am constantly on the go and need access to view documents.  This works for me.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Oh wow!  I loved this documentary!  I had no idea who this guy was until a friend of mine in South Africa recommended I see it.  What a great talent and what a waste of that same great talent.  But he has made a bit of a resurgence since this movie came out and I am very happy for him!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great Read! WhisperSync is the greatest! I'm on the road a minimum of two hours a day; so being able listen to whisper sync in car instead of the same songs over and over on the radio is life changing.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Have always loved Pearl Jam and am a huge fan.  This is a great album and reminds me of their old-school days!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very silly way of getting people to read. How can I describe having to write a review when I don't want to.
1476715904|5.0|Collen Hoover made me remember I loved reading!  I absolutely love this book!  It is a sweet story of love and heartache.  It is passionate, and heart breaking.  I laughed, cried and laughed again!  I instantly became a fan of Colleen Hoover and have love everything she has written since.  A must read!!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use this thing all the time and it is amazing how well it works, especially for only being $300!
1480507024|1.0|I purchased this item to play in my vehicle but it doesn't play like a CD so I have not been able to listen to it yet. I would need to play it on my computer;however, after spending 9 to 13 hours at work a day the last thing I will do is come home and sit in my office just to listen I this.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't use facebook and any of their products.  This was installed by someone else on my device.  As soon as I get it back I will be removing it and putting parental controls to block it from being installed again.  I don't get how people like facebook at all.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Just an amazing book and so worth the time.  I have recommended this to a number of people and all have loved it.  Really a worth while book
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this all the time. I love the variety of choices that you have like multi draw or one-3 card play.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great books, the kindle version also has extra background information to help you better understand the story as well as the characters and locations.
1250038820|5.0|He has captured the absolute melting pot of NYC, USA. He is showing us what is behind the faces of everyday people we pass on the street. As you read the book, you see what he sees. People, real people with real lives, problems and accomplishments. A must read and see.
B00BNWWUDY|3.0|This DVD was a gift for my sister who is a huge Channing Tatum fan (shocker i know) i didnt actually see the movie, but it made for a great gift for my sister.
B004LROUNG|4.0|He is a consistently good story-teller and fleshes out his characters so that they become real people.  Of course he has an intimate knowledge of the law and how it functions, so all the legal problems and solutions have a ring of authenticity about them.  I always enjoy his writing.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|This is a superb movie from Anthony Minghella.<br /><br />It has a perfect combination of an excellent cast, superb direction, a fascinating story and gorgeous settings.<br /><br />The film is adapted from the Patricia Highsmith novel (she also wrote Strangers on a Train- adapted by Alfred Hitchcock).<br /><br />Matt Damon plays the title character- a sociopath- masterfully, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent.<br /><br />Well worthwhile
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I think that I enjoyed the characters more than the story - - - but after finishing half of the novel, I could see where the story was going and what the point was.  That in itself is not a bad thing because I finished it to see whether I was correct in my assumptions.  A good read.
B0013ANMWY|3.0|This movie was completed, then major changes were made before release. This is evident when you watch this remake of the 1956 classic \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\".<br /><br />I suggest you watch the 1956 original if you want to see a tight and suspenseful treatment of the subject.<br /><br />This movie displays an earnestness of purpose, but that is not enough to make it entertaining.
0071762345|5.0|Love this book. It explains the difference between atrocious sites like Flavorwire and ones that are more honest, like Facebook. Even though FB owns Flavorwire, whoever runs FW is much more sneaky than FB. Also like how the author gave suggestions for dealing with today's \\"transparency\\". Jean Hantman
B001DJLD1M|4.0|Comprehensive collection for the Matrix enthusiast. However the DVDs have very little extra features, just the movies and a few commentaries.
B0086213XW|5.0|Sarah Polley's \\"Take This Waltz\\" is superb. Surprising subdued acting from Seth Rogen. Luke Kirby and Sarah Silverman were also compelling. And Michelle Williams embodies every character she plays. Toronto's Parkdale section is also a star of this film. You must see. Jean Hantman
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|His rhyme structure is unbelievable, his wordplay is next level. This is not the kind of album you can just play as background music while cleaning the house. This is an album for those that want to understand why rapping is an art, a skill, a talent, and incredibly hard to do correctly.  Is it my favorite album ever? No. But it is the most impressive lyrical rap album I have ever heard.
020530902X|5.0|Why not pause from your compositions and look up a considered, well-bespoke answer.  This book is a must for any serious writer of the English language
B005COO1X6|4.0|Well written, good story, Stephen King, when at his best,  has this ability to lure the reader slowly into the story. By the time you realize it, it's too late.
0385333846|5.0|His best.  If you read no other work of Mr. Vonnegut's -- and you certainly should -- read this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead's third season is crazy. If in the first two seasons it was all about the walkers, this season has more of a human touch. We are also being introduced to the f@#$ing Governor...
B00F35B8F8|5.0|The storyline is gripping, the actors are phenomenal, and the new story arc is refreshing. I'm looking forward to more movies in the franchise.
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|a great reminder of the &#34;Die Hard&#34; franchise, and characters that you can actually care about.  Channing Tatum proves himself to be an action hero and Roland Emmerich keeps the action moving.  A great popcorn movie that doesn't take itself seriously.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining...time goes by and have to stop from playing to get things done. Live this game! Highly recommend if you want hours of fun :-)
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is the coolest 20th anniversary figure ever!!!!! I have her posed with her tiara right now in front of my 11 1/2 inch dolls. This is without a doubt a must have for any Moonie fan or collector. You have no idea the excitement I was in waiting for her when I preordered it.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This is awesome, but this is just the demo. Get pocketinveditor pro, and you can:<br />edit signs, edit armor, edit blocks, and spawn mobs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read all three Loved all three This was one of the books you couldn't put down and when done with book 1 It only took<br />less then 5 minutes to get book 2 . Loved that
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|An extremely well written account of the history of nuclear weapons in the US and of their associated safety concerns. Schlosser elegantly switches between personal stories about people involved in the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons and the national and global political game. Highly recommended for anyone interested in nuclear weapons or international security, but also very relevant for safety professionals and others dealing with high risk activities or industries.
B005COO1X6|5.0|this story was different then most books  But I didn't know what was going to happen and so keep reading .Love Stephen King.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|It was worth a watch but I think I preferred the Robert Redford earlier version But it was well acted I have to say-especially by the supporting cast .
B007FH9GT2|4.0|The girl with the dragon Tattoo is a superior film. However, that being said, the original series is even much more superior.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|Better than the film, Ninth Gate. I was not left hanging scratching my head as much as with the movie.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book has many deep connotations and makes you think. It's a cross between a religious and existentialist views on the world around us. Lots and lots of meaningful quotes. Loved every minute of it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and easy to learn. Have fun every time I play. My wife play every night. Anybody can learn to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I AM ADDICTED.... i CANT STOP PLAYING THIS GAME....  I NEED HELP.... SERIOUSLY... CALL THE DOCTOR TAKE THE TABLET FROM ME....
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi put in that work, I have to say she improved by leap years when it came to this release.  Amazing vocal direction on top of better beats than her last release makes every penny worth it.  In comparison; I only took two songs from the last release.  This go around, seven were kept where &#34;Really Don't Care&#34;, &#34;Neon Lights&#34;, &#34;Shouldn't Come Back&#34;, &#34;Something We're Not&#34; & &#34;Fire Starter&#34; are bred for high replay value!  Thanks Demi...
1581806574|4.0|Sent as a gift for Christmas. I hope Grandson likes it .He is a Budding Artist and loves Dragons and Ancient Folklore.
B00G4SS24I|5.0|Sky Ferreira's voice is super splendid; it's like a bowl of Honey Bunches of Oats after a perfect night of slumber.  &#34;Boys&#34;, &#34;24&#34;, &#34;Heavy Metal Heart&#34; & &#34;I Will&#34; are the super jams of this release.  Very high replay value!  If you're into a saucy voiced dame who knows vocal control, get on it asap & keep supporting her.  True musicians are inspiration & Sky isn't anything short of that.  Catch the lyrics & sing with her...
031623480X|5.0|A GREAT READ - a senior medico provides a clear and concise wake up call to the world about the addictive other sugar, WHEAT
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|GREAT!  at least the storyline is tying into some of the old Star Trek movies.  It's gonna be trekkies all over again!
B0091VYG86|3.0|A great premise well done, good ending and good actors--I just didn't like all the sex--it could have been just as good without it.
B008JFUPPI|5.0|Funny - Its a comedy!  I will watch it again, probably a couple times.  Clean comedy with the exception of some of the language.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|My favorite Jane Austin book, I watch the movie every year or two.The actors and settings are believable and seem realistic.
6302787068|5.0|I love this movie. My children love it. Add it to your collection, It is a whole new world of adventure for your family. It  is old so get it dvd/blu ray for best picture quality.
0811874192|5.0|Fascinating construction and a lovely conversation piece.  It's well made and brightly colored and we had a great time poring over the details.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This was easy to set up and even worked while I had Pandora playing In the background all night. I would tell people to use this if they want easy as well as effective.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's just riveting.  Great storytelling!  The twists and turns just keep on coming so you'd better be prepared!  That's all.
1594744769|5.0|I just bought this book recently and I have to say, I am really impressed by it. I love the story and how the photographs go so well together in this book. It wasnt what I was expecting when I heard about this book and when I actually got it. I cant wait to finish it and have the next one in my hands! Must have for anyone that loves a good read and a dark side to it.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|This was not the movie the trailers led me to think it was. It was basically the character study of an alcoholic drug user who happened to be a pilot. 90% of the movie was about him stumbling around and falling off the wagon over and over, screaming at everyone who tried to help him.<br /><br />It was just boring. I was expecting a thriller or an adventure story.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|its inspirational..do you have the dreamer. about the horse racer with kurt russel. that is a very good movie but you don't have it on netflix. or Avatar.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast . . No HBO GO and they killed DLNA .. Get what you Pay for, should have bought a roku2
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was majorly helpful. If you are publishing on Amazon get it and follow the rules precisely to have a professional publishing.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|The whole Bond thing is iconic and legendary. When Bond movies are being filmed, everyone co-operates, producers can secure any location they wish for anywhere. Remember the film sequence with Her Majesty The Queen at the 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony...? Make no mistake Bond is a highly prized British thing, dear to our hearts! There is no spy character in novels or movies quite like old James Bond. So anyone who dares pen tales about anything related to him or his creator Ian Fleming is traveling a risky road! One needs be pretty courageous to tackle it. And it has to be damn good.<br /><br />And I'm happy to say Damien Stevenson is all these things! Operation Parsifal is the first book I've read of his and it was a very entertaining and thrilling read. It didn't feel contrived or forced, after the first couple of pages a smile came to my face and I thought \\"I like this, this is good.\\" Great plotting, characterisation, twists and turns, nasty villians, beautiful women, gruesome deaths and fantastic absorbing details all finely balanced with a well crafted writing style make this book good old fashioned storytelling at its best. I highly recommend it. I shall certainly be checking out other books in the series.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a nice behind minecraft I have it for computer and xbox they are ahead by like 12 updates. The controls are ok sometimes I get stuck there's  some app  to help u on survival witch I bought and saved the game but still 3 stars y'all shouldered the game out if h can afford it don't beg your parents kids not dat great
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I enjoyed the 3D version. I highly recommend it.  It was worth it. The movie had a very good plot.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife.  She loves it!  This is a hint for all the men out there...
B001BPJJ82|5.0|Visually stunning with a narrative to match. This flick flew under the radar, but I think it's solid gold. A must watch for fans of The Princes Bride.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It was a entertaining movie with few slow areas in it .i would recommend it for what it cost to rent I do however still think walking dead on ANC is better
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This is what rock and roll should be.  Not wallowing in self-pity like so much modern rock, but expressing hope in light of difficult life events.  On a technical level, the music is flawless.  There's plenty going on to keep you interested as you listen again and again.  Big sound, strong musicianship, and an overall positive message make this one of my favorite albums.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i just wish you didnt need to ask friends for tickets. I highly recommend if you have lots of facebook friends.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dashes out of the gate, finishes before you realize it, then leaves you wanting more.  If I were to complain about anything I'd say it's not a 2-disc album.  I just can't get enough Dream Theater.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Great classic.  Drama and romance that can be related through all times.  Hard to put down.  Really feel for the main character.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|I feel really feeble asking this but I didn't know what else to do.  I can't find the menu for quit and save .  I have a battle scene and all that but  the back button doesn't take me anywhere and the menu button just burps.  Galaxy Tab 3.  I'm sorry if this is an inappropriate place to ask
6305428042|5.0|THIS MOVIE BRINGS ME BACK TO A KID WHEN I FIRST SEEN IT AS A YOUNG GIRL, ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WHICH MOVIES EVER!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best alarm clock and app ever ever ever ever ever in the whole wide world and universe from here to Uranus and back again!!!
B00G91WB3S|5.0|Ignore, ignore, ignore the first review and others that have labeled this movie negatively. Sheesh, what did they do, rush on here and post negative comments the minute it was available for purchase? Who are these people and what's their motivation?  They must have watched a completely different movie than I did - seriously, that's the only answer.<br /><br />Superman is a fantastic movie - one that brings him fully into the 21st century. I watched this in the theater and just finished viewing it at home this evening - and I'm even more impressed with the story line, direction, and actors.  Truly an awesome film.  If you're a fan of Superman, I can guarantee with 100% certainty that you will not be disappointed!<br /><br />p.s. I can't wait for the sequel!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A lovely game for all ages to play. Not time consuming but easy to lose time whilst playing. Nice and straight forward with good graphics.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I was having a problem getting enough volume out of my iPad to watch a movie on a plane. This is the perfect solution. Actually, it adds plenty of good high quality volume so that I bought this along with a splitter and two sets of Koss headphones so my wife and I can both watch the movie with plenty of sound.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great<br />I love the suspense on it because president snow scars me and was wondering why he was at her house
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love Blake, Love the CD.  Every song is good and Grandpa's gun gives me goose bumps every time I hear it.  Excellent CD!!!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I love zombies and if you do, too, then this is a good one for you!  The zombies are quite &#34;active&#34; and will scare you slightly, but it's an exhilarating ride.  Quite enjoyable, but the roles of the parents left me wanting in a way I can't quite describe.
0440237688|2.0|I thought this book was boring and depressing. We don't even meet the Giver character until page 89 (half way through the book).  Up until then, it's all just a day in the life of this boy.  nothing happens.<br /><br />then we meet the Giver and it gets interesting for about five minutes.  Then it just gets depressing. I guess I want to read stories that are fun and adventurous, not preachy about society and all its shortcomings.<br /><br />I have no desire to read any more from this author for fear of more preaching and no fun at all.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Suspense. Drama. Couple moments of fear. Definitely has the &#34;creepy factor&#34; if you like that. Awkward at times. Overall entertaining.
0385537131|5.0|This is a great read!! His stories are always amazing and thrilling to read. A Time to Kill was a classic, this one can easily make it to<br />the top!!
B000GOWNPU|4.0|Streaming sucked but the movie is really really good. It would work for 5-10 mins then it would pixel and drop. I have 50 meg so I assume it's not on my end.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper Kenman, through her tell it like it is portrayal, has done a great service to incarcerated women; many of them African American and Latino,  who have been brought, unwittingly in some instances, into the vicious underground world of drug profiteering. They are the &#34;little guys&#34; in the bigger picture and pay a huge price because of the archaic rules, presently,  governing sentencing guidelines. This book may prove to be the catalyst that brings attention to this urgent matter.  .
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good read. Although I figured out what and who about mid-way through, it was a great and easy read. Great for waiting rooms, bedtime, and lunchtime reading.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Another awesome cd by Blake Shelton. It shows a mellow tender side to him I haven't heard before. (Maybe it's Miranda lol)<br />Boys 'Round Here was my favorite until they burned it out on Sirius. I love I Still Got a Finger and Mine Would Be You. Even with Boys 'Round Here, Blake sticks to his country roots, not like some of the cross overs. He deserved Male vocalist and Based on a True Story was the album of the year! Go Blake! Best CD yet!
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the scans, especially the resolution and clarity (images are very grainy). As an example, I compared a film scan to a 4x6 photo that had been printed when the film was developed13 years ago. There are 3 very small written lines on a book cover visible on the developed photo. In total they are less than 1/8&#34; high for all 3 lines, yet I can read them very clearly with a strong magnifying glass on the developed photo. When I scan the negative used to reproduce this photo and blow up the image on my computer, it is very grainy and I can't make out any letters or words.  It claims the pictures are 10MP, but the files are only 1.3mb on disk and only about 750k on disk of you choose the 5MP setting. 10MP pictures taken on my iPhone take up about 10mb, so clearly something is amiss here.  I was planning on probably spending 100's of hours scanning in all our old negatives and getting them organized in iPhoto, but with this level of quality it just isn't worth the time spent. I'll probably end up returning the unit. If I keep it, it will just be used as a slightly better alternative to scanning the occasional printed photo that we want digitized for some reason.  I was hoping for a scanner that could be used to digitize pictures well enough so when printed they looked as good as the developed photos. Clearly this unit won't accomplish that. Not even close. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I don't mind spending more money, or maybe there are professional services that will do this and save me the time and hassle.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This toy is very educational. My granddaughter loved it and want to compare more at Amazon. Arrived on the date promised. Is worth.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Wicked is amazing!!! The sound track is wonderful. I was able to see the play in person so it is nice now to have the sound track.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|My Grandson loves to play on my Kindle and this is one of his favorite games. He is eight years old and we always look for games for him on Amazon amd are never dissappointed.
B00E3QJ7FG|2.0|The copy I received did not include the Digital copy inside. Other than not getting what I paid for the movie itself is great
B004JVXTL8|4.0|Love this movie! Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity. If you like to be moderately scared, this is the movie for you.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|I really like this movie, but then, perhaps I just enjoy seeing justice dealt out when there is too much real injustice in the real world.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|One of the better bingo games I have played on the kindle a little stingy on the coin rewards but still lots of fun.play it every night.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! I find myself playing until the wee hours of the morning. Can't seem to put it down
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|My daughter is so excited to start the calendar. The calendar is exactly how it is described. Totally worth the money
B009ETEEAU|5.0|Upon first inspection the camera looked and felt very cheap.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the 720p HD video quality.<br /><br />The camera is really small. and is really easy to use. The zoom in HD is surprisingly clear. The 640x480 resolution is great for home movies, and with an 8gb memory card, you get about an 90 minutes of record time. You get 40 min. on an 8gb card at 720p HD.<br /><br />Doesn't say how deep this case is good for, but for playing in the water it is great.<br /><br />**This camera is no GoPro but for the price less then 20% of the GoPro for kids who lose and break stuff this is much better then the GoPro**<br /><br />great for kids and love the low price from a reputable company polaroid.
B0063GORYU|5.0|can play it on my cheap android and not have to use my big computer. nothing else to say now
B00009P9LW|1.0|Will not play on any DVD here.  It states &#34; Eject not available to play in your region.&#34;  My husband very disappointed as it was his Birthday gift!
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I bought this for my 80GB Ipod Classic and it works well with my Motorola lbs 700 blue tooth headphones but it will not bluetooth to my Bilt helmet.<br />So it apears this will be a hit and mis but it apears to have bee made for the Ipod family.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Support Gaga's new horizon! My favorites: Applause (Of course), DWUW, and Gypsy! Well, Venus actually sounds pretty good after listening it for a while.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book moves at a fast pace once the scene has been set. Enjoyable and intriguing with a believable if unlikely plot. I would recommend this book for most readers.
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle Ferrell needs 10 stars. Not a fair rating system when she has such a wide range. This album is chalked full of her talent.
B000NY12CI|5.0|This a wonderful book thoroughly enjoyed by my book club. It was interesting to watch her develop into her own person as she got older and moved toward independence.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|what I like is that you can actually take notes with your handwriting, but I thought it'd be a blank sheet of paper to write above the lines. its actually paper but you write in a section and it goes to the paper and what I hate is that you cant write in print with out turning off the auto insert, which the auto insertvis helpful to have
B00B2DSK06|4.0|Pretty cool little movie for the kids...and it's parent watchable, at least the first few times of it being on.
B00902AKK4|5.0|The game is very fun to play and easy to learn. There is a video walkthrough button when you get stuck ,which is a nice feature. Overall this is a great game.
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|Kinda scary for my younger 3 year old, who ended up having no interest in seeing it, now it just sits in our streaming amazon prime account, maybe it'll be watched again someday.
1608871827|5.0|Literally consumed every page of the book. Great insight to a really enjoyable movie.<br />You'll watch Pacific Rim in a new light after understanding the passion for the film. :)
B00APUQT7I|3.0|OK Kid movie. I wish i ad this on my  Amazon prime account. not as good as the original ice age, but will help get you through the winter.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|After weeks of reading this in like 10 hours I'm ready for my review! I spend countless hours regarding other people opinions and  I conclude I'm not alone there's a huge chunk of the fan base that agree that Tris sacrifice wasn't build or deliver properly. The entire  book feels empty we have the characters we love but they don't fit in the  story we are being sold in Allegiant, the plot (if we can call it that) is a MESS  and Tris ultimate sacrifice seems like a joke. I'm sorry but I wish I reverse read this series the ending is a joke. Jocelyn spend years building her factionless army just gives it wall up in a heartbeat for a son she barely knows....  how about Nita? UNNECESSARY!
B0049J3QNG|4.0|Fun Kid movie. Great to have on our Amazon prime account. Pixar makes great animation with great stories. One of my kids favorites.
B000007WOP|5.0|This is probably one of the most important album of the 90's. Americans might disagree, as the Britpop wave never did quite reach their shores. But this album defined the sound of the 1990s (the second half, after grunge era of the early 90's).<br /><br />My favourite track : 'Sonnet'
B0057LUI0O|5.0|RIO is a great, fun Kid movie. Great to have on our Amazon prime account. Pixar makes great animation with great stories. One of my kids favorites.
B000G03S94|4.0|3 star rating for the vinyl.<br />5 star rating for the album.<br /><br />Vinyl:<br />Delivery was fast. Item as described. However, there isone little defect, the center hole was a bit too tight, making it hard for me to place the vinyl on my turntable. The vinyl played perfectly fine however, no noise whatsoever. It's just that it's hard for me to place this vinyl on my turntable and then take it out.<br /><br />Album:<br />What can i say.. Perfection. Not the best Muse album (that honor should go to either of the 2 albums that precedes Black Holes), but it is pretty close. It is in my opinion the best album of the 'new sounding' Muse with heavy use of electronic music. Many hated this album of the different direction that the band took. But i like how they mix rock with dance music. It's just so catchy.<br /><br />It is so different from their previous albums that it's like a new band playing all these songs.  It's not a bad thing. Bands need to evolve. Muse did a very good job here.<br /><br />So many killer tracks here. My favs:<br />- Knights of Cydonia<br />- Starlight<br />- Invincible<br />- Supermassive Black Hole<br />- Take a Bow
B004C3DLJ8|4.0|Toy story(s) are great, fun Kid movie. Great to have on our Amazon prime account. Pixar makes great animation with great stories. One of my kids favorites.
B005AKFXZW|3.0|An very interesting and original idea to begin with, but for this reader, it dragged a little as the pages were turned. For much of the book, nothing important or logical seems to happen and, when it finally draws to a close, readers are left pondering the fate of Marco and his true love not to mention the fates of other characters.<br /><br />The language is well-crafted and the dialogues well-constructed, making it believable for the times in which the various chapters are set, so giving the novel life and atmosphere, even when my initial interest waned.<br /><br />Well worth some reading time.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|We love the original Lilo and Stich movie. This movie has been watched many times at our house and on the road.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|It's a great product for the classroom. It does exactly what I need it to do without the high cost. I really like it.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|We loved the sequel to Monsters Inc. My little one prefers this one to the last one and now that she has figured out streaming with amazon prime it's normally on when she gets by a tv.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|Well, the work is about three thousand years old. I just love the Meditations of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.  I read Marcus Aurelius in high school and encountered quotes, but never owned the work until it became available on Kindle. It is such a pleasure to read of the gentle emperor and his spiritual motivations. Though he was pagan, he sounds almost of the Christian faith to come. I think everyone who is of a gentle mind would enjoy The Meditations of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
B007PKOKTK|2.0|Kind of a junk movie. I didn't like it and neither did my kids. many other movies i'd recommend first.
158270208X|5.0|Herein recorded is my Gratitude for everything Life brings me. The more Grateful I am, the better are the things The Law of Attraction offers me. This is a diary of my Gratitude. Gratitude is the secret of the law of attraction. Love is the power of Gratitude.
B005SAP45I|3.0|As an adult i just think the story is ok, my daughter and freinds seem to like it. Not very watchable for me though.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|While I enjoyed this last book, it was a lot different than the first two. It was still great, but a little  predictable.
B0049J0DC8|4.0|Fun Kid movie. Great to have on our Amazon prime account. Pixar makes great animation with great stories. One of my kids favorites.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Movie was want I wanted all these years from reading the Avengers!  This is one movie I will see again and again.

B00503C226|1.0|Audio didn't work on this movie at all when I bought it...I totally wasted my $. Hoping for a refund!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Maddening, captivating, addictive time waster. I'm glad it makes me wait so I remember to do things like sleep, eat and go to work!
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie can sing like nobody else. Great songs on this album.<br />Anyone who is a Carrie Underwood fan will not be disappointed.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Love It I just Wish That It Would<br />Work In All The Games On The Iphone<br />Or Ipad I Wish That In The Furture That Its Going<br />To Be For All Games
030758836X|1.0|It was a completely engrossing and well written book that just turned gross and unrelatable. I've never read a book that started out SO amazing and intriguing that simply ended up leaving you with a bad taste in your mouth. It was as if the author, who had a great plot, felt she needed to TOP her original plot with what happens at the ending. By the end of it I disliked BOTH characters. If that's what the author was going for, then she accomplished it.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|The reason this game is so fun is because everyone loves a good gamble.  Some people don't but most people do.  This is also good when you like physics and kinematics or...U no wut?  Just get it ur self guys and try it out. Best ever!
B00EV2OY6Y|5.0|Huge Def Leppard fan for over 30 years. If you're a fan or ever where, and you have their In your Face in the round concert video, then you need to get this. It blows that show out of the water. Not a fan of Hysteria? No problem, the Ded Flatbird show, (Def Leppard's opening act Alter Ego), plays stuff that many fans have never heard live.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you have an Xbox or Blue Ray and use it to see YouTube, this device is not required. I downgraded my rating to 1* because Chrome mobile is not supported meaning you can not cast from your tablet or smartphone, just my intended use when I bought it. Useless if you don't have a pc.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|best tv show ever, Bryan played his best roll on this tv series. can't wait to see more stuff from him
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This sound track made the movie. I have to say that Daft Punk has done it again, and has always been amazing to me.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Quite a good book.  I love the way this book is written and the way she shows us the intimate, quirky yet familiar thoughts that go through the characters minds.
0385537131|5.0|another great john grishman book  . it is very well written and a good read. I could hardly put the book down once I started.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I loved the shining and wondered what ever became of Danny. This is a good continuation and I enjoyed it.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|There were so many plot holes I thought some of my book was missing!  Until I discussed it with others at my book club.  The misogyny is overwhelming and the suspense seems to fizzle out as soon as Dracula leaves his home country for England.  It's a classic so read it if you want but it might just be a bit like watching Deliverance.  You hear about it your whole life then realize it's only famous because it was considered scandalous during it's time period not because it was actually good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started playing this game and am very pleased with this game would recommend it to other family members .
B00782O7NE|5.0|Wonderful! One of the best movies ever! Loved this movie. Will watch it many more times! Thanks for having it to order.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A very inspiring story. The Navy Seal is a remarkable being. I look forward to reading Marcus Luttrel's's next book. THANK YOU.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This is definitely an above average movie with a future that I certainly would not want to live in. I will not rehash the plot as that is everywhere at this time. The acting was very good by pretty much everyone, particularly Woody Harrelson. The sets, from the &#34;Games&#34; field to the majestic and quite high-tech studio, were very well done with, IMO, well-edited cinematography. I have not read the book but am quite sure that much had to be left out due to time constraints. That said, what I believe to be the major points were made - especially that hope can, indeed, triumph, even in what appears to be the worst of circumstances. I would not really recommend this for kids under 13 or so, due to the content and nature of the &#34;Games.&#34; To me, author Collins was able to successfully remake and retell, in a not-too-distant futuristic setting, the old Greek tale regarding war and tributes being sent annually to a capitol to meet their fate, while keeping the masses in line. However, then as in Hunger Games now, there are ways around even the most oppressive of leaders/governments - with a bit of cunning and intelligence, coupled with honor and determination ... and hope.
098478280X|5.0|Very good for preparing for interviews. Immensely helpful in cracking not just technical skills but also understanding how the interview process works in the top firms.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this available for my Kindle.  I am addicted and love every minute of it.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|First of all, the mystery of the murder was interestingly dealt with. PD James knows her way around this topic. I could tell that she knows the characters from Pride and Prejudice very well. But as I was reading the novel, I could definitely see a difference from how she, and how Jane Austen would have had the characters converse. That wasn't a big deal as the story was definitely a good read, and PD James did tie up some loose ends quite nicely. That being said, I would definitely recommend this book to fans of Jane Austen.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Decent, but I was honestly disappointed after The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. This one, while a solid book, just seemed... rushed, not as deep. Like it was written and published to meet a deadline, not given the time (or quality of time) of the first two. Let me put it this way: I can read my favorite books over and over again. I've read The Kite Runner 4 or 5 times, World War Z twice, Dune three times, Raptor Red more times than I could count, and several Michael Crichton books a half-dozen times apiece. I'll probably read this one again, but it won't be one of the ones I reach for when I'm feeling nostalgic.
B0077QS9C6|3.0|Factual, clear bio of the Formula1 driver. Nothing new, mostly old clips put together in a logical way. Sad ending for a good driver.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Wraps everything up nicely. Somewhat predictable but it's a good predictable.  Gives you enough confidence to put it down knowing everyone in that world that you want to be ok....will.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Play a little each day and you can move through the game without spending any money...impatient and you can get through faster with some cash. Really like the different scenes and the creative hiding places!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 5 year old daughter loves this game. Amazon made it so easy for jet top find and download.  Plus it was free which was great!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Isn't technology amazing. I suppose I could have watched it on my Kindle with free ABC.com, but I bought them and watched on the big 50 or whatever inch screen. Good show so far. I'm about 4 episodes in. A TV reviewer may have been on target when they noted &#34;where do they go from here?&#34; However, it was still rated in the top ten shows.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|There is a lot of great information in this book. I learned a lot and will try to do a better job of eliminating sugar.
B00F1W1SQW|5.0|I will come back later and beef up the content of my review... just know that I'm a HUGE DT fan.  I honestly wept when I saw the performance of Metropolis Part 1 on this DVD.  The band just nails it and they've never been able to come close to nailing that song on previous concert releases (yes even the Score version).  I just can't explain the joy that rushed over me to hear the band perform all of these songs.  Mangini is an absolute monster, and the rest of the band sounds 100 times tighter than ever.  I now understand why Mangini needs to be the drummer for this band.  I'm amazed by everything here: Bridges is a bad ass opener and they kill it.  Lost Not Forgotten is mind bending.. everything is just so good.<br /><br />I will admit that Labrie gets a little too far out with 6:00 but it doesn't even come close to ruining this masterful performance.  His voice sounds amazing through most of the songs here.  I let my kids watch this and they are mesmerized by Jordan R on keys... (they think he's a real wizard, and I'm starting to think so, too!)<br /><br />Watching this concert brings back my faith in music.  AMAZING STUFF.  Dream Theater are now operating on all cylinders and there's no stopping them.  They are untouchable on stage.
B0052REUW0|5.0|A truly masterful, convincing and spectacularly inter-disciplinary proof of The hypothesis that civilization and the enlightenment are responsible for the decline of violence in history. As mind-boggling are the data - both quantitative and qualitative, so comprehensive is the complex argument for the hypothesis. The refreshing insights from evolutionary psychology are most welcome and enjoyable in a world increasingly jaded by political correctness, received opinion and cynicism. Well done and thank you.
B00B9PJ4R0|5.0|Better than I expected!!! Fit & feel great! I am ordering another pair in a different color as well. Well worth the money!
B00000AOTZ|5.0|Great collection of music, man. If you love the movie/videogame, and enjoy the music that you hear when you watch/play it, then this is a CD for you. Love it!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Love it! Great Movie and part of the Star Trek franchise. Will watch it over and over from here on out.
B000006OHL|5.0|Absolutely beautiful, just as in the film. Thank you, Bernard Herrmann, for this fantastic composition. I love the album art, as well. Great stills from the motion picture, well edited and designed together. I'll never stop listening.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I thought this was very well written and loved the way the author expertly weaves historical facts, scientific discoveries and social events of the period  into her story about an unusual woman with a brilliant mind, but who feels unloved for much of her life.  The character ark of her journey to discover her own self worth was very satisfying.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|One of the best books I've read about dogs. I gained so much insight into my relationships with my dogs (and how to make them better) from this book. It was one of several that was recommended to me by my trainer and I see why.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|easy to use, quick.  Does everything I need it to do.  I have some really long detailed to-do lists, and it auto-saves them.  Managed to successfully transfer the lists from one phone that crashed to my new phone.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Bought this cd because i was looking for some new music - LOVE IT. Great lyrics and sound. I'm now a BIG FAN!
B008OOYALE|5.0|A wonderful game the whole family can share.My son was the first one to start playing, then I started playing. Now my husband plays.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|Not overly impress with this cd. Hoping more of the songs will grow on me over time. Only song i like so far is 'Reflektor'
1476727651|3.0|I, too, always wondered what happened to Danny.  The &#34;life&#34; that developed was a snoozer.  Of course, we know that the little girl will figure in future explorations of the shining phenomenon, but her stock character is lack-luster and  so syrupy that I really don't care about her future.  I thought the constant mention of AA was strident and unnecessary.  I flinched when it was brought up again in Joyland.  There were no incidents that made my mouth drop open or that excited an intake of breath.  I am diabetic, and I thought the constant maudlin dialogue and &#34;action&#34; was causing a rise in my blood sugar level.
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|wow I love this game. when it says it is not responding click wait :)<br />but it can have some lag so be ware of that but over all it is my favriot game
1781162646|3.0|What's with the harping on AA's message?  King again shows his knowledge of a subject--carney life,  The story line is smoother than Doctor Sleep and has a much better pace, but goes nowhere fast. King has much to tell us, but can't figure how to say it.  Get off your soapbox and let the story develop.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun for the entire family. I love this game. I can get help from my facebook friends. Very pretty game
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice app Many helpful features. Like the look and music features. What do you guys think of it. I would say buy it... only .99
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|I love this group.  They have a very &#34;different&#34; way of entertaining.  It is as much about<br />the act, as it is about the actors.  They are all so very talented musicians.  I love their rendition of &#34;Somebody that I used to know&#34;.  They have some unknown &#34;appliances&#34; that they use to make very different SOUNDS, such as a wet comb, fingers plucking across<br />the guitar strings,  and some beautiful voices.  I can't wait til they stop touring so I can<br />go see them in person.  Let's keep these folks busy making cds and tours.  :-)
B001CDLAT4|5.0|One of the best movie's I've seen.  No narration, but an amazing visual journey around the world, stopping her and there to peek at humanity in that region.  Really makes you look at yourself in the world.  Wow.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is a movie to watch more than once. We enjoyed it more the second and third time around. I guess you are catching more of the words and thinking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is insanely addicting and best of all its free!  you can play on the computer and your android device.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|It was strange to see Will Smith with always a serious look on his face. Almost didn't recognize him. Loved the evolution of animals.
0307743721|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it and I'm a hero. Great collection from this year's Nobel prize winner for literature.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Talking to an audience has never been my thing, but upon reading this book, it has given me the confidence to do so.  On giving a talk myself, I have found it difficult to get my words or thoughts together facing a crowd.  This book has encouraged me.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My 10 yr old grandson is addicted to Minecraft so he really enjoyed this Lego set.  It was added to his collection
1490313370|1.0|This is sold as a self help book,  but I was very disappointed to start reading all the swear words such as the F word.  I stopped reading this book and it went into the TRASH.
B008200LHW|4.0|Good price, good performance for this GPS receiver. No issue with it and my Windows 7 laptop. Worked seamlessly with Google Earth.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This is my first novel by this author.  At times it was dark and disturbing. The main character, Cmdt. Verhoeven is interesting and I enjoyed the story.  If you enjoyed the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, you will probably enjoy this too.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Bloody amazing album, Not sure what the bad ratings are She shows distinct diversity and versatility throughout the album, someone who doesn't pay attention to pop music, gaga pulled me in and didn't let me go till the end of the album! Mary Jane Holland Has the traditional Netherlands sounding, GUY, donatella, gypsy sexxx dreams, dope, aura are some of the perfect and effortlessly flawless tracks of there. Gaga didn't resort to make generic easy pop music as some other artists to get high sales. She stayed true to herself and delivered a MASTERPIECE.
B00C7607FS|4.0|So happy this movie is on Blu Ray! A great family movie for parents and kids. Get it while you can!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|If you want a fun and entertaining game, candy crush is the game to have!! Me and all my friends have this game and we all play it all the time. And if you and your friends have Facebook, you can help each other out by giving and receiving lives!!! So download this game now!!! You won't be disappointed!!! :)
006202406X|1.0|What an absolutely terrible ending to a series.  Made me regret having read any of them.  Too bad too, I loved Divergent.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|Works Great, Clear sound in chat, Quick charge, Comfortable during long gaming sets. Easy to set up ready to go right out of the box Overall Great Buy
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Took a while to get going and did not see the feds coming like they did.  Looking forward to the next one.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Completely replaces a regular plug in alarm clock.  Alarm will go off even if Kindle is in sleep mode so the battery does not get drained by using this app.  The upgrade is also worth it to wake up to your favorite song without commercials.  Interface is a cool electric blue with 2 other screen choices if you want them.  Worth it even without the upgrade.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is a great soap opera and when fewed over a few weeks is totally engaging.  I don't know if I would have had the patience to wait week to week to see what was happening next.  Particular favorite characters were the two dowagers and Anna the lady's maid, but they are all amazingly compelling characters.
1400069289|5.0|From sports (the Baltimore Colts and Michael Phelps) to spiritual organizations (AA, Saddleback church), the diversity of case studies was intriguing.<br /><br />The book had some great \\"take-aways\\" for habits in personal and business life:<br />1.  The \\"Habit Loop\\" cue->routine->reward.  All habits contain these elements.  For changing bad habits, the trick is exchanging the bad \\"routine\\" to a good one.<br />2.  Keystone Habits are those that have ancillary benefits in other areas of life and business.  His case study of Paul O'Niell at Alcoa was a great example.<br />3.  The importance of \\"belief\\" and a supportive community.  His information about AA's success had many helpful aspects that are applicable to other areas of life.<br /><br />This is a really helpful book for the small businessman or anyone on a journey to better themselves.  I think that the Keystone Habits chapter will be a annual \\"read\\" for me.
B00EF1PKJQ|3.0|Quality playing and singing but I could not find much of a melody in any of the songs. Try again next year.
0525425772|5.0|Loved this series, and gave them to our grandson for his birthday...the whole family wondered why we sent a paper set of books instead of electronic....can't win I guess
B008JFUR10|4.0|I've always been a sci fi fan and I watched all of the old Japanese monster movies so I really enjoyed the concept behind the movie and didn't try to over think it
1607053888|4.0|Borrowed this book from the library and wanted to make one of the bags I had seen in the book.  All the patterns are overprinted on several pages, and it might be a bit tricky getting them sorted, but the directions seem clear. Pretty hard to rate a product that has not been tested!
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Met my expectations from the reviews and trailers.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is good - restraint but still charismatic.  Terrence Howard is excellent.<br /><br />Enjoyable.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|My bias is going to come out here, but I do prefer gothic horror and love the dark fantastique. Mama by Guillermo del Toro is not quite as good as Pan's Labyrinth but more horrific overall. The effects of the children themselves in the movie are some of the most weirdly horrifying I've witnessed on film. What the Grudge did for the possession walk of the Exorcist, Mama takes to a whole new menacing level. I've heard complaints that the actual ghost of Mama could have been more horrifying and less cartoonish, but to me it was powerfully moving. The key, once you see and get to know her, is to begin to identify with her and feel her pain. Annabel, played by Jessica Chastain, is the analogue to Mama in the world of the living with whom we are also to identify. The link between Annabel, Mama and us is deliberately crafted be del Toro and beautifully so in my opinion. True horror is about story, a particular kind of story; a story that reaches inside us and twists something--it never leaves us, but haunts our memories, heart and dreams ever after. If you are like me, Mama may do that for you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Im a newbie but it is a bit addicting. I have to turn the volume down. A bit annoying after awhile.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Perhaps one of the best horror movies of all time. I prefer my horror subtle, yet horrifying and this tale fits the bill. What cinches this movie for me is that it is based on a lesser known case investigated by the famed paranormal investigators the Warrens. The Warrens were famous for their investigation of the Amityville haunting, but their work is much broader and deeper than this case alone. Though as movies do the actual events are overplayed, you still get a sense of the disturbing nature of the haunting at Perron House.  Some might disagree with the approach of the Warrens who could be described as being more traditional demonologists with a strongly Catholic approach the value of their work in the paranormal is profound if somewhat sensationalized. But all of this is background to what turns out to be an excellent haunted house movie.
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|I really enjoyed the way the program led me through the History of the Vikings. I didn't really enjoy the pagen orgy scene much, but realize it was a real part of the barbarian lifestyle. This was an intregal part of understanding the conflct between Christiandom and paganizm. This was a very thought provoking movie the led me through many emotions as well as forcing me to look at the evolution of all mankinid, the effects of growth of human nature. Very good story. I look forward to the second season. I don't watch TV so, I will have to wait to buy the next season.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|It's great to see this album getting the attention it deserves. It has hung around for a good reason, it is fantastic. The quality of this blues based rock that has been the touchstone of rock for throughout it's evolution is right here on this album. The Stones, Humble Pie, Led Zeppelin, The Doors; they all were after this particular grail. Many of these bands achieved great things in their own right and with the accolades that naturally came, while Robin Trower ticked along in the background. This is a stayer and a player. A timeless album that I have been playing for decades and am still introducing to my friends who are astounded by it. More power to Trower.<br />Further, check out \\"Raw Sienna\\" by Savoy Brown and perhaps the most underrated album of all time: \\"Split\\" by The Groundhogs.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are definitely a Dynamic Duo! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who even remotely enjoys comedies!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|By far one of the most dramatic movies I've ever seen. Daniel Day Lewis has one of his most noteworthy performances with There Will Be Blood. Highly recommend!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was on board before the movies. Although some stories similar to this story have been told before, the Hunger Games story is well written and completely full of suspense.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Three different sizes to choose from, while still sleek and stylish. Works wonderfully! My daughter uses it to practice letters on her Kindle Fire!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great chance to read a book about a good heist without knowing that is what you are reading
B005LAII12|5.0|Great movie. My son's love it. This is the type of comedy that is not for young children but is recommended for adults.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Perfect for kids, and great for parents there's no talking! Just sounds and humor for both kids and adults! a must watch
B00005JMEW|5.0|Great movie. I haven't investigated the special features on the DVD, however the wide screen version that I purchased is just fine.
B008J8KBKY|1.0|I downloaded this game as a FAOTD because I thought it would be a 3-dimensional version of a match 3 game. It sort of was. But I didn't want to play against someone else online. I just wanted to complete the puzzle myself. It's a turn-based game -- you take a turn, the computer takes a turn, etc. And I wanted an independent game. So I give it 1 star because it was not what I thought it was. If you like playing a game against other people or the computer, you might like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I couldn't be satisfied having this game just on my phone.  I also started playing on Facebook.  I was stoked when I found it available for Kindle!  I am definitely hooked on this game!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game and it's NOT as easy as you think it will be. I am a cross stitch crafter as well as a puzzle lover so this fit both requirements for me. I downloaded it while it was a FAOTD and have enjoyed it greatly. It really makes you think about graphics in a different way. Great to pass the time while you're waiting for the kids at school or in the doctor's office. I enjoyed it a lot.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|If this is the best DeMille can do for John Corey than he might as well retire him. What his wife was doing in the book I am yet to find out. A suggestion for the Author; make Kate Maysfield the main protagonist in  your next book. Never thought I would nod off on a DeMille book but I did and several times. Only the last 50 pages or so kept me awake. Even getting knowledgeable on Yemen was not a bonus because the Author builds on a stereotype of Islam which is not doing the West much good. The wisecracks are there but there's less of the wise in them. I wonder what happened to the Author of 'By the Rivers of Babylon' and 'Cathedral' or even the 'Lion.'
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent writing, plot line, and acting.  Lots of ambiguity in motivation, showing that there is so little black and white in our personalities.  Absolutely superb.  I'm hooked.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I had great fun watching this movie! First of all it is robots vs. monsters so you can't take it too serious. Just sit back and enjoy the great 3D presentation and action!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Humor does not get any better than this! ...yes, Fawlty Towers is old and dated but still it is very funny!<br />If you have never seen any of these episodes, and you appreciate British humor, then give this a try.<br />If you don't like British humor, then the humor may fall flat for you.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Love the knife its better than i could have hoped for extreme heavy duty.<br />If i could have one wish a better sheath for alternate carry would be great.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Entertaining though far fetched.  Like both actors and they were funny. Worth the price. Hi ahead and rent it. It's worth it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is very addictive. Had to quit playing. It makes the time go by very quickly. I love it!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a young woman just starting out in my career and my marriage, I found her advice invaluable and inspirational. It has given me new insight on how to conduct business.
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Overall the band is in top form here. I only wish the filming was done a little more tastefully however. Too many spinning shots and not enough wide shots of the stage from the audiences perspective. Also Jordan and Myung are a little lost in the mix at times. Still an intense watch but Live At Budokan is still my favorite.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Keeps your interest fun to play even when you don't purchase power ups, colorful graphics not boring even when you go back and replay games already played. Well worth the money &quot;Free&quot;
0545101417|2.0|This recoding of the book is missing random chapters.  They show up on the playlist, but there is no information recorded on the CD.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Got this movie for my wife. She is a huge fan of it. She watched it alot as a preteen and it brings back alot of fond memories for her.
B0002K0ZTY|2.0|First of all the dvd was not well packaged and cushioned so it arrived with a broken case. I was expecting the DVD quality to be much superior since it was region 2 with higher resolution than region 1 (US) but it was not so. The transfer was very average and similar to a VHS tape and in places it had slightly fuzzy picture quality. I am disappointed and I do not know what the alternative should be since I like the movie and acting very much!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This book was very well written and I look forward to reading the upcoming book by Diane Setterfield.  I enjoyed getting into the characters of this book and the ending totally caught me by surprise!
B00007KWHP|5.0|One of the band's best next the Close to the Edge. Bonus tracks add extra incentive to purchase this cd.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The story was very well written - I enjoyed getting to know the characters and couldn't wait to find time each day to read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is a powerful battery saver. The color is vivid. I like the flashing bulb when there is a problem or a message.
B00DOPEGAS|2.0|I thought the price too high.  I had to keep it. because I needed the gift but I found it for much cheaper other places
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I cannot get it to read Adobe files, I have to send them to my smartphone to read them.  It would also be helpful if there was an Adobe Flash Player that worked with the fire HD.
0142418471|2.0|I loved this book until I reached the ~70% mark, at which point it seemed to go flat and trundled off towards a disappointing ending.  Not recommended.    As others have noted, the book follows two Will Graysons, the first being a bright and \\"fairly normal\\" (if the term describes anyone) straight teenage boy, who has a female love interest and an overweight, gregarious gay best friend.  The second Will Grayson is gay, closeted, depressed, and under privileged. The alternating chapters covering each Will are written by different authors.    I am gay, and I was stunned by the second Will Grayson - I felt like I was in his head the entire time; each facet of his world entirely aligned with what I imagine the real-life experiences of someone in his situation would be. Will Grayson #2 is the strongest asset of the book.  Will Grayson #1 was cool too - but I had my favorites.    The weakness of the book is Will Grayson #1 's best-friend Tiny Cooper. I think that it may have been an accident of the book's construction (two authors writing independently and then trying to find a way to blend their stories into one), but in any case Tiny becomes increasingly important to the narrative as the book goes on, eventually eclipsing both Will Graysons.    Tiny Cooper is a s***ty character. He is oblivious, arrogant, selfish, over-privileged, and usually victorious.  These traits remain in force when the book is finished, although the authors make a (poor) effort at moderating some of them.  It is difficult to be sympathetic to the least intelligent, least dynamic person in the story, and yet the reader seems expected to like him.  The more predictable aggrandizing paragraphs I read about Tiny Cooper the more I found myself wishing that the earlier, more-Will-focused portions of the book's narrative had gone on forever. Alas, all good things come to an end.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm a fan.<br />I have all Mike's books except the one specifically for women.<br />This BLS is Mike's best-to-date. (Hoping for more to come!)<br />Since I began working out less than 3 months ago, I cannot speak to other levels of development, but I know that this newbie profits tremendously from Mike's counsel on diet, cardio, weight training, and supplementation, all packed into this book. He and I have joined (I say \\"he\\" because Mike means it when he says \\"ask me anything\\") to get rid of belly flab and put on some muscle. Long way to go (I hope right to the \\"end\\"), but I've got the confidence and dedication needed. With no real gym buddies, Mike and his books are a real go-to for me. He's sensible, has no ax to grind, and doesn't shill for any of big pharma.<br />And check out his The Shredded Diet. It opened my eyes and my mouth to great tasting, balanced, and healthy eating.
0399226907|5.0|SOOO cute...goes perfectly with the Hungry Caterpiller book...probably more for baby rather than toddler but can be used to accompany the story of the Hungry Caterpillar when read and experienced...good present
0345803485|5.0|HOT!!! Can't wait to read the next one and the one after that. I'm looking to purchase a kindle.  Going to do away with the books
0399255370|5.0|There are a lot of words in this book and if you love to read to your kids/grand kids as different characters there is a lot of opportunity to read in different voices...we love to read in character so this book is great...final picture in the book is worth waiting for...
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Love the tv series, but the movies are the bomb!!!Just as good as last or better. You gonna love this one!
B00486070K|5.0|Went to the apple store to try to get this but was told they didn't have it in store.  What they did try to get me to buy was the thunderbolt version.<br /><br />I have a MBAir and the main reason I wanted a USB ethernet adapter was precisely because I only have 1 available thunderbolt port which I typically use with a VGA cable to project.  In the event that I need both at the same time, with only 1 thunderbolt, it wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />Well thank goodness Amazon had it and now I'm armed with a thunderbolt VGA cable and a USB ethernet port and ready for any situation!  Sweet!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a good game but quite short (you can finish less than 1 hour). So it will be cool that the game will be updated.
0553062182|5.0|This book was a wonder.  I couldn't believe it. As I read it page by page, I kept thinking, it's me ... that's me too.  Oh my gosh, practically every page was me.  It was like reading a diary written by me.  There were things I could change in myself and some things that I could simply understand better, about myself,and not feel guilty about.  It was an easy read.  In laymen's terms.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to a story I have been reading for 15 years. I was really happy with it and how Sanderson finished it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Shipped fast, works better than I expected and it synced perfectly with my iPhone. I was a little upset that there was no chromecast app available for the kindle fire and no application for HBOgo or Showtime Anytime. This would definitely be a perfect product with those additions, but you can't beat the price for what you get.
1878424319|5.0|enjoyed it, very good book! would recommend! Great for a gift for family, friends, co-workers, church members, etc., love it
B00FOU1O3S|2.0|This game is a lot of fun...until it starts trying to force you to buy more frames.  When you don't, it freezes up and won't work anymore.  Guess you get what you pay for -- it was free!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great scripts,good performances by the actors\actresses.It ran for many seasons, and I do not know why it was cancelled.<br />It is still better than most current tv shows.<br />Sort of a mixture between Alfred Hitchcock and the Twilight Zone,with variations of a main theme carried through from one episode to the next.<br />It keeps you wondering what will happen next?
B00902S0IS|4.0|Best sci fi movie of the era.  Excellent special effects.  Clearly provided much of the inspiration for Star Trek, especially the pilot.  A bit too cerebral, as was said about ST pilot, lacking intense human emotional drama.  Got a lot of the science right.  Ending a little flat, could have been spiced up, but satisfying.  Well worth watching if you like sci fi, although hard to imagine any sci fi fans that haven't seen it yet.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Absolutely riveting. I have recommended this series to everyone I know. I can't wait to watch more of it tonight.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Good Read - scary look into our future! The main character Mae is the girl you sympathize with in the beginning and end up hating at the end. Fascinating read that I couldn't put down. Technology = end of life as we know it?
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent documentary! It changed the way I eat. I am far more aware of the quality of food products I purchase.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book about prison life is more political than the soap opera show.  The show prompted me to read the book which I found serious and informative.  Women in Danbury are manufacturing goods for the US military for less than .minimum wages.  Lots to learn from this book.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I really don't know how to play the game.  I brought it because it seemed so popular.  It seems like every time I think I'm getting the game, the game closes out saying &#34;level failed&#34; then I have to start over again. Frustrating!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Magical world, very human problems, shocking end, all in a futuristic sci fi setting. Read it! Especially if you're planning to watch the movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the most hauntingly beautiful book I have ever read. We read this book for my book club and it turned out to be a book everyone loved.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read the book in one day... With 3 kids, a dog and a fulltime job that really means something! I really couldn't put it down. Good read! Best book I've read in a looooooong time!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|ver fun and addictive! great brain trainer! make sure to. push EVERYWHERE -you never know where somethings hidden! would recommend
B001C08RHA|5.0|Good movie, arrived fast, great price. I was able to buy this DVD for just a small amount more than renting it online, and can watch whenever I want too.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|A very insightful look at American prison system.  I was a bit disappointed, perhaps because I read this after having watched the TV show.  I was hoping for more character development of the other inmates, but I guess that's not possible when writing such a personal memoir.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use Splashtop to monitor our Minecraft server and the garage computer when charging my lipo batteries from my Android phone. It works great, easy to use, and I have had no problems.
B005BC3MBQ|1.0|It did not play on any of the blue ray players in my house. The audio came through but there was no Video just a black screen
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game. I could not put the kindle down, it is so addicting. The only complaint I have it that it is not long enough. It needs many more levels.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Great product and perfect for recording videos with crystal clear sound. It is easy to set up and comfortable on. Thank you very much!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|ok so glad I have this DVD in my Collection, As I could not imagine my collection without it! Thank you.

B00EOGZ42U|4.0|This is one of them laidback but pay attention games that is great wit a pair of headphones on with this game. The game is about seeding these little alien things and growing them on a sphere with u can send more too other spheres but watch out there other bad ones that try to take over your territory so it becomes a battle for areas . U can send one little guy to scout other territory before sending more peeps what I call them so there's a strategy too take over all areas, a plus is the soundtrack on this app that is very relaxing but immersive. The color is very bright even if u don't have HD it still looks like u do. U can chage how fast your peeps go put sometimes it tens too slow down the screen some that a downside of the game plus I think cause when there may be hundreds of \\"peeps\\" flying around fighting each other takes alot of processing on what ever tab/phone your useing. I have this on my kindle fire HD and I tean too have some slowdown, all and all this is a great app for relaxing but pay attention headphones a must . 4 out of 5 stars one off cause off price it should be lower and cause of the sometimes slow downs. But it's a really good thought out app that may surprise some alot to offer.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review I try to make them on point hope u got some info.<br /><br />Edit review: for people who think this app is boring u just have to get throw the first few maybe five levels and things start getting interesting, u get more little aliens that do different things allso u get defence one's to protect your territory. So just get throw the first ones that show you what's up this the store ,gameplay ect, then after the first five real missions u do it gets real good just have patience there's alot to offer here. Was one of the first to get this before it became a faotd that many didn't know of, just get throw the early missions.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Great storyline.  Some readers complained about some typos in the story.  Come on!<br />Not to take anything away from the story.  It flows well and I personally enjoyed it.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Such clever intelligent writing-how does Eleanor hold it all together. Very creative talented writer. I admire her ability.<br />Proud she is a New Zealander!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I did enjoy the book, it was a good read. I am a big fan of Tina Fey's 30 Rock, and other things that she's produced, made, worked on, all that good stuff. However, this book was a little &#34;all over the place&#34; to me. It seemed like every couple days she would sit down and write around 5-10 paragraphs, slap a title on it and it would a random chapter. The book didn't seem in order at all.<br /><br />Granted, it was a great, fast read. I read it in only around 2 days. But it was just a little bit of a bummer for it to be so.. all over the place.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app very much. It gives me enough info on what the weather will look like, and it is all free.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|Back in 2008 on a Xmas visit to ye olde homeland, my niece asked me if I'd heard the new Elbow single \\"One Day Like This.\\" Now knowing the musical tastes and listening habits of my young niece and her contemporaries, this question was a bit of a surprise, and also somewhat of a vindication. It meant that Elbow had finally hit the big time! Having followed this group since the beginning, and puzzled over why Cast Of Thousands and Leaders Of The Free World weren't automatic #1 albums, I was beginning to despair that they might always be overlooked in favour of the hyped-up Coldplay types.<br /><br />Let's cut to the chase here. Elbow is special; in fact, I would say that they are the most accomplished British band of the new millennium (sorry, Doves). Here is painstaking musical craftsmanship elevated to the exceptional by the colourful, insightful and moving lyrics of rock's poet, Mr. Guy Garvey, wordsmith extraordinaire, forging memorable and inventive turns of phrase secured in the everyday emotions that make the working man tick; the humour, loves, yearnings and regrets in all of us:<br /><br />The heartfelt: \\"I meet your eyes. Then I'm spinning and I'm diving like a cloud of starlings.\\" (Starlings); \\"We took the town to town last night. We kissed like we invented it......You made the moon our mirrorball. The streets an empty stage.\\". (Mirrorball);<br />The offbeat: \\"The fix is in. There's a nag gonna dance home at Epsom. The fix is in. Can't wait to see how it upsets them.\\" (The Fix).<br />The imploring: \\"I think when he's drinking he's drowning some riot. What is my friend trying to hide. 'Cause it's breaking my heart.\\" (Some Riot);<br />The resigned and hopeful: \\"I have an audience with the pope. And I'm saving the world at eight. But if she says she needs me.....\\" (An Audience With The Pope); \\"And I'm five years ago and three thousand miles away\\" (The Bones of You).<br /><br />Normally I'm not that much into lyrics - profundity means nothing if the music doesn't grab me. But with Elbow the two are mutually indispensible, and that's an uncommon thing in this business, at least at the level we see here. There's music in them there words!<br /><br />Cue the music. Not a tune you can't whistle to. Not an arrangement that is dull or uninspired. These ain't some slung together 3 minute ditties:<br /><br />The attention-grabbing tour de force that is the first track on every Elbow album. Here it's Starlings: tapping percussion overlaid by adagio bass and vocal harmonies then (pow!) a brass blast at 1:00 min, just to get you engaged; lilting piano and strings before starting as it began, proclaiming an aspiring love or an infatuation, a theme developed through an unparalleled variety of melody and rhythm on the next 6 tracks, leading to the allegorical resignation that is the epic \\"The Loneliness Of A Tower Crane Driver.\\"<br />The delicate piano, guitar and soaring strings on \\"Mirrorball\\" (a ballad up there with the superb Switching Off from Cast of Thousands).<br />The samba rhythm, grunge bass and guitar resolving through delicate harmony to the Summertime refrain in \\"The Bones Of You.\\"<br />The quiet falsetto introduction and northern brass on Weather To Fly (Weather and whether!).<br />The spine tingling reverbed piano melody and processed cello on \\"Some Riot.\\"<br />As uplifting and catchy a melody as you're ever likely to hear on \\"One Day Like This.\\"<br />The perfect, moving Elbowesque coda of \\"Friend Of Ours\\" - that final piano arpeggio is enough to make you cry!<br /><br />So, if like my niece, \\"One Day Like This\\" was your introduction to Elbow, do yourself a favour and check out their albums NOW for a musical journey that is as rewarding as anything this side of The Beatles.<br /><br />\\"So throw those curtains wide.<br />One day like this a year would see me right.\\" (One Day Like This).
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! It's so hilarious! Just watch it ok? You will love it!
B005URRCUY|4.0|Really great album plus I think it is cool to get the actual album and the MP3 download, which I have on my computer and my phone.  So definitely worth the price.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|What's to say - I love Leonard Cohen and this CD is just wonderful. I highly recommend it. It is great.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Nothing remarkable about this film. It was just  interesting enough to keep me from turning it off. I would not recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I spend a whole lot of time watching YouTube videos and Netflix and this little gizmo lets me use my iPhone to stream videos onto my big screen TV. It's nice and small and unobtrusive. The only issue is that sometimes for reasons I'm not sure about the little light on the back starts flashing, and when you're trying to sleep even that small light blinking is more than enough to keep you awake. So I have to get up and unplug the power. A bit annoying. Otherwise it's a nice little gadget. It really ought to be able to stream more services, but what it does, it does well.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper was my favorite Halloween movie to watch when I was younger.  This brought back a lot of memories !!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the challenge of this game.  There are different versions so when you tire of one, you can switch to another.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham has always known how to weave a story and keep me completely involved in his storyline and connected to his characters. Sycamore Row is no exception. It is played as a continuation of his original hit A Time To Kill. But though many of the characters are brought back from that book, the storyline is all new and a compelling read. Many thanks, John Grisham, for keeping me up very late several nights lately not able to put this story down!
1449433251|5.0|Essential reading for any grown-up wanting for their childhood back...the days of lazy fun and boundless exploration as only childhood can provide.
0385537131|5.0|This came quickly and was ready for the citizen who needed it. Those who love John Grisham will want to read this book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my laptop for almost a year and was so glad to see available on my Kindle.<br />I can now play at home and on the go..I love this game..
B0000026UV|5.0|This is the BEST!  I can't begin to tell you how much I enjoy this CD!  Each song is better than the last!  I listen to it all the time, then play it again!  Chet Atkins absolutely cannot be beat when it comes to playing guitar!  And you can tell that he and Mark Knopfler are very good buddies!  A good friend told me I'd love it, and it's true!  I DO!
B009G41CG2|5.0|I really like this version; it has excellent graphics, soothing to the eyes. I play this game in my quiet time, I really recommend it highly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a constant reader who I  so thankful that the answer of what happened to Danny and his mom!!  I am one who does  believe that the Shining is the scariest movie, but must admit Jack probably had something to do with that! Loved this story, now I will want to know what happens to Abra, the wheel always goes around :)
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Such a great classic.  I reference the goonies quite a bit and my oldest daughter (11) always looks at me like I'm crazy and one day while checking out the amazon prime movie selection I seen that it was one of the available movies so we watched it.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The show hooks you in - but the writing is not as good as that of Boss which also takes place in Chicago.  Characters lack depth.
0525953728|5.0|Husband loved it.  Adult son did too!  Since I did not read the book myself, I can not review the book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app!  It does everything I need and then some.  It's easy to use, it's a calculator:-) I like the display.  I don't need to go and find my glasses to use it, which is really nice.
0553582011|4.0|Despite many negative reviews, the writing is just as great as any of the other books, if not better. The problem with the book is that it does not stand alone as an independent work by any measure.  The beginning and ending are absolutely arbitrary.  There is no beginning, end, or climax.  It's like a single chapter removed from a complete work.  While all series literature must deal with this problem to some extent, SOIAF is by far the worst I've read in this respect. Making matters even worse, it will likely be years before the next book is released.  The root of all this evil is GRRM's absurdly slow progress.  He should be put on house arrest until he finishes . . . with no football.
1451695195|4.0|I would like this even better if it did not have such a strong Christian message to it. What if someone reading this is not Christian ? Will Jesus greet them?
B003M70O5O|5.0|We can't wait till we have time to watch the next one! Some nights we stay up late just to watch the next one.
1442355476|5.0|Flynn's final story of the heroics of Mitch Rapp does not disappoint.  Flynn will be deeply missed.  I understand there will be a film version of Mitch Rapp's adventures.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|A movie all should see at some point. History to remember. Even with the tough subject the film brought the story to the viewer in a way you have a better understanding of the time. it is an emotional movie to watch but in the end seeing the survivors at Schindler's grave does leave one some positive feeling along with the tragic knowledge of how many did not survive. The history and making of the movie to show it is a lasting memory to those who survived along with those that did not. Both worth thinking and remembering for all.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is an awesome show, I can't wait for season 4 to start. The cast is well chosen, and the storyline interesting.
B002N9MK8G|4.0|interesting to hear the between talk and jokes live during the performance. there were some funny lines and the music was great to hear.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty good gameplay and controls. Some of missions require upgrades that take time to earn money for but over all, very nice game.
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's the same controller that comes with the PlayStation.  It works just fine, however, I wish the charging cable was just a little bit longer.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a astonishing story about adaptability.  How sharing one's life can mean survival in the most awful circumstances. Proof there is good in most people regardless of social status ands education.
1419705644|5.0|This is a funny guide to Adventure Time's Land of Ooh and it's inhabitants written from the perspective of Hunson Abedeer ( Marceline's farther).  It's a little over the head of my 9 year old, but as an adult a of the show I found it hilarious.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|The graphics are great and the colors and sounds are cool, I would recommend this to anyone with a taste for air hockey
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|excellent movie great movie and great everything i m realy happy with it all,would do it all over again if i had the chance
B00992CF6W|3.0|yea pocket edition is fun but really it stinks. when it has creative you cant change to survival you cant even light Tnt on creative.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|With a dramatic opening full of mayhem and death, this tale of vampires creates perfectly a gothic feel and setting for this book.<br /><br />The story centres on a woman: Rose, also known as Eternal, who fears for her life, yet is confused by dreams and flashbacks about what is real and what is from the world of her imagination.<br /><br />This story is exceedingly atmospheric and the sense of menace pervades the pages as Rose is incarcerated in an asylum and with the help of flashbacks, the reader learns the story of the lovely Rose and of those who pursue her.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed by the vivid descriptions of vampires, their lust and longings, as well as the excellent build of tension and fear.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Lots of fun re doing photos and very easy to use. This is fun to make your pics look old. I really liked this one worth a try.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I'm glad to hear is son helped work on this movie too. Bought the From Up on the Poppy Hill with no hesitation and after watching it, believe it more than lived up to my expectations. I knew it wasn't going to be fantasy at all, but the beautiful detail to the environment and setting, the charming atmosphere between her home and the school's club room (which turned out a lot more fun in the movie), and the sweet touch of first love. I would agree with another commenter that it carries a bit of the feel of Whispers of Heart, and though I've always enjoyed this movie I believe it definitely exceeds it. Grab a family member or friends and enjoy this movie. :) Another ghibli classic.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The second season proved to be just as exciting and tense as the first.  The final episode caught me completely of guard.  Mr. Lewis is quite the actor.  The complex plot line was brilliant.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the book,however it became difficult at times to remember just who all the different characters were. Slow in parts. By the end it all came together. A little too predictable for meeting
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|The site is worthless for meeting new people. Almost all the women are putting up phony profiles, phony photos, and they live far away from where they say they live. Badoo needs to really monitor each and every profile and what is being posted. Anyone I chat with complains to me about the people contacting them and how rude and vile they are. This is on Badoo for allowing it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much it is really fun to play its realistic and fantastic would recommend this to anyone
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is an excellent DVD presentation of a terrific performance by a band that turned out to be surprisingly timeless.  Except for some supplemental material that is of lower video quality, the images are crisp, unstretched, and the sound is good (on a regular TV at least) with reasonable dynamic range.
B000683VI4|5.0|So happy I found this movie! Awesome price! Used it for my film project! Shipped fast. Buy it and love it!
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|Well done for the first one. Hope to see more from this group soon.<br />Short but fun. Thanks for not using hidden object scenes to make the game seem longer.<br />Could use more puzzles.
6302212529|5.0|Got this for my little sister's birthday! She loved it! Hard to find VHS. Thanks! Hope it lasts a long time.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I can never get it open to play!  :(  I don't know what else to say -- I can't get into game to play.  :(
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Enjoy all his work! A little slow in the beginning but picks up well and is worth the read and time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it is a great book if I could get to it to read it! let me read it now. now
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very revealing book into the insight of a brilliant man. Experiencing the thought process of another is always interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in business, technology, or big thinkers.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|We just started studying Spanish and this app makes a good supplement to our lessons. For the first time, we're fighting over who gets to use the Kindle Fire!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Not just your run of the mill zombie tome...The story line is wonderful and what great characters. The whole tale is a real romp in zville
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|never could get the game to load.  Tried to delete it but it won't go away!  Too bad cause it looked like fun
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This box set has all the movies. Its a no-frills set so if you're super in love with Harry Potter and want a bunch of extras, this isn't the set for you. I'm sure something like that exists elsewhere. For under $40, this set was great and I was happy to get the whole collection in a nice compact dvd case.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I knew virtually nothing about Steve Jobs before I picked up this book, therefore it was a page turner. It was a monumental task to cover both the personal life of this complex man, as well as his mind-boggling career, in a single volume and Walter Isaacson does a commendable job of balancing these two elements. But Steve Jobs does not come alive in these pages. We learn the facts of his life and career but don't get to know him. This is even more true of his family, friends, and associates. Top notch journalism, but mediocre literature.
B0000024YL|3.0|I guess I have grown past the old days. The CD has all of their hits and I like most of them. I suppose I am not as nostalgic as I thought. They were a great duo in their day and their music is still way better that the current pop stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so great I mean first of all addicting second of all its really truly free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love my dad loves it I love it my sis loves it my mom loves even my dog thinks it looks interesting
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|The Rosie Project gives keen insight to a personality disorder that is becoming more common in America, but it manages to humanize it. The book is humorous, surprising, and hard to put down.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|this is a cute movie....even my husband liked it....I got it to give as a gift.......I give it 5 stars!!!!!,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Me Before You<br />Interesting and well written.  It is a page turner.  Both leading characters are  deep and you really get into their heads.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent clarity; auto detects resolution; no delays and good signal strength.<br />I can Q videos from my andoid phone, tablet or even windows PC. Using it everyday extensively.<br />Giving four starts since onlu youtube and netflix are supported now. However, they works best. I love  the product.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tune in radio permits me to listen to stations from all over the world. Not many days go by that I'm not listening to a favorite station or 2 from 1000's of miles away. It is a great app..
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Hard to believe that Iron Man could have gotten any better, but this did NOT disappoint!  Can't wait to see what they do with 4.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Did not like the Governor storyline and the season was very uneventful until the last couple episodes of the seasons.
0440418569|2.0|The thickened conclusion to the story of some little kids trying to kill God... but in a good way. It feels like Pullman was trying to pad out the novel here, and time he should have spent wrapping up storylines was spent with meaningless non-obstacles. Will gets drunk on vodka with no consequences. The dimension-skipping knife breaks, only to be easily repaired with no consequences. Going to the land of the dead and freeing everyone, with no consequences to the main plot. It seems Pullman needed space to put in the subplots. It made the story drag out, and it's long enough without the filler.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the padding, would it still be a good story? I don't know. I guess I didn't really care for this piece, or the trilogy. I felt like I had to read it to find out what happened. I don't know where it went wrong. Maybe it just didn't click with me. Maybe it was too British, maybe it felt too stilted, maybe I couldn't identify with the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I don't do facebook I wish it didn't try to get u to use it. fun and entertaining.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Like many I waited long months for the much anticipated sequel to Insurgent.<br /><br />Like many, I was left disappointed.<br /><br />In Divergent, Veronica Roth created a gritty dystopian world that did a beautiful job of tying the trials of personal morality into a society that epitomizes the argument of Nature vs. Nurture.  These arguments are continued in Insurgent where we discover this dystopian society is nothing but an artifice.<br /><br />In the finale of a Dystopian trilogy, my major expectation is that where a big Sociological question is asked, an answer will be given and supported by arguments presented through the storyline.  MOCKINGJAY's big failure was not even bothering to answer the question.  Allegiant gave an answer, but only TOLD the argument, all attempts to SHOW us the answer were muted and overshadowed by the use of one of the poorest plot devices ever invented - the memory serum. Instead of a valiant fight against their treatment, their NURTURE, the \\"heroes\\" ended up just showing their NATURE by using their resistance to serums to use the memory serum to cheat the system.  It was so full of mixed messages that it imploded on itself.<br /><br />Divergent also included a strong vein of YA Romance, with a hero and heroine that drove the story and whom we all loved.  I won't go as far as to say you should NEVER kill the heroine in a YA Romance, but if you do, it needs to be a transcendent moment, a supreme sacrifice, the emotional crucible of the entire story.  The readers need to feel both saddened and fulfilled by the loss.  Tris's death was none of these things.  Getting shot while using the aforementioned poor plot device (memory serum) was not an emotional moment, unless getting pissed at the author counts (which it doesn't).<br /><br />Like HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT showed so much promise.  Like MOCKINGJAY, ALLEGIANT failed to deliver.  I will at least give Veronica Roth credit in that she didn't give up, she at least gave it a try.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie kept us on the edge of our seats! It was action-packed and romantic at the same time.  It's a must see movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! It has wonderful visuals with lovely views of the abbey and the surrounding grounds. It captures a period of history beautifully and has an intriguing story line. The acting is excellent.
1451666179|5.0|If you enjoy the blog, you will love this collection.<br />This book is like playing pictionary with an incredibly funny individual.  Allie Brosh's simple, yet informative paint masterpieces add to her words like nothing else could.<br />I couldn't handle the funny 10 pages in and had to put the book down for a spell to laugh.
1593275080|5.0|This is an amazing book.  The level of detail in each creation is beautiful.  I am going to find alot of inspiration from this book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I was never a fan of super hero comics or tv shows or movies but this movie changed all of that for me, I love this movie so much that I purchased it along with thor, captain america, and am looking forward to the new sequel releases to all of these movies!!
B00C5R8364|5.0|This was a fictional story with a realistic premise that mirrored the unquestionable need to spend months, weeks, days and hours of  tedious and non glamorous drudgery in order to learn a persons serendipitous lifestyle devoid of routine and absent the use of easily traceable electronic devices that the rest of us routinely use and push our traceability into the deepest recesses of our consciousness without a care.  In reality, this process is tantamount to a high stakes game of three dimentional chess where one participant is in constant motion inside of an asymetrical non-state and lawless world where the penalty for betrayal is death without appeal.  This is not nearly as glamourous as portrayed in movies and the author captures a world that most Americans applaud when there are successes but cannot internalize because it doesn't comport to their every day lives.  Forsyth hit just the right tone when discussing the complexity of the process and the politics and delemas of dealing with allies and their very brave unsung hero assets.
B002361MLA|5.0|Love this book. Its in sync with my philosophy. It explains all my unanswered queries. Definitely recommend to like minded people.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|More than a simple port, the game adds so much more content and actually looks and feels better than. Its PS2 counterpart.<br /><br />If you plan to get a psvita and love jrpgs...grab this game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book is beautifully written, however very sad and leaving little if any hope in the characters lives.<br />It would have been a breath of fresh air to have found someone in this book who had a happier aging experience than did these tragic characters.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|This story is a classic. It details events that occurred during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s when fascism was on the rise in Western Europe.<br />In 1944, in my adolescent romanticism, I had become immutably bonded to the characters and Ingrid Bergman after seeing the movie that had just come out.<br />Now, 70 years later and reading the details of the love affair, I was to discover that I understood practically nothing of the historical significance in which the story takes place. The atmosphere of the guerrilla cave and escapades left a deep impression on me that was never to be forgotten.<br />Should you read this novel, I might suggest that seeing the movie first might place the characters most strongly in their rightful desperate and fateful surroundings as so skillfully described by the author.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Korn better than ever! bigger than ever! and amazing than ever! These guys can never do no wrong! you may not like everything they release, but man, they are such amazing innovators of metal music! Seriously! Korn is that band that never ceases to amazing and excite! This album is madness all the way through! From the opening track to the delux version with the bonus songs, Korn is here to stay!
B0012250IM|5.0|One of the best songs ever, I love josh grovan ,he has the one and only voice of this world. I have been looking for it for long time and thanks to amazon now I get it ....it's just beautiful.
1878424319|5.0|Simplistic but clear. You can apply what you have learned as soon as you put the book down. Worth it.
B0035LMTZA|2.0|Cheeky, kinda boring, bleh. Wouldnt watch again. I guess it was semi-entertaining for a couple of hours, but very predictable.
B00BGV0Y26|4.0|I thought that I might like 2 or 3 tracks on this CD, however the more I listen to it the more I like the entire CD
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works good from Youtube, but the chromecast from a chrome browser has a delay and has lip synch issues.  If the laptop locks the screen, it would pause the video on the TV.  Overall we like it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great book. Such a fun take on the super hero genre. Brandon Sanderson has a way of really immersing you into his stories. Steelheart keeps a great pace while molding a distopian world I hope we never have to actually see.
B00F2362IE|2.0|We purchased this game for our 7yr old and within 2 days the game not only froze but we had to restart the Kindle (after many attempts to do so). I would not recommend this game.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Thought this product was to allow me to surf the net and view it using my TV as my monitor<br />It just seems to be a cheaper version of the ROKU<br />Too many pay sites and apps and no real internet content
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|very action packed and suspenful.  grabbed and held my interest right away.  Childs writes in a way to keep you guessing.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I love this book it made me cry and smile but the only thing I didn't like was the ending, other than that I love this book.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|arrive in excellent condition and before schedule. product as described in specs.. and additional star for color coded Saturday(blue)  and Sunday(red)  (also bilingual option ,eng/span)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had a friend tell me about this game she played (candy crush) that was super fun but addicting...she was right! I love it, only downfall is running out of lives and having to wait unless you want to pay.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I dont think you can beat a castleville game for the kindle. I love it! Not so tedious as the FB version either. I think it moves faster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's better than I thought. It's was a little tough but I was able to escape eventually.<br />And I loved the different ways the floors got harder and harder.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I have always been a big fan of Stephen King.  A few years ago (before his sad accident) all of his books would get 5 stars from me, but since then some of his bitterness seeps into his writing.  His champions of good vs. evil, tongue in cheek optimism, went to cynicism.  Not one of my favorites, but I don't miss any, at his worse, he is 100% better than other proficient authors.  Many others use formula writing and it is hard to distinguish one book from another, not the case ever with King.
B00F9040HU|5.0|I love the game but the free part runs out fast. I was shocked at the price of this game, it's expensive. I'm still getting Atlantis Quest for I love playing this game.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have to say this game is awesomely the best game I have played yet it's as good as minecraft pocket edition try that out to I also highly recommend this app for every kindle fire owner to read this comment
0743270754|3.0|It's too long.  I learned a lot, but it was painfully slow process.  Part of the pain was the way my kindle measures completion.  I was stuck at 1% all the way across the US from MI to NV, including a long Chicago layover.  When I got to the 40th percentile I checked with a print version and saw that I only really had 1 chapter left.  Apparently the % is by word count, so notes, index and bibliography were in fact half the words in the book.  I actually liked both the content, her analysis, and her writing style.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put this down, I loved it.  Couldn't wait to read the next one.  It's more than &#34;Mommy Porn&#34;.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This is epic.<br />And sometimes that can do more harm than good.  Like Thor, I think most audiences have a hard time with the superheroes in capes (except Batman).<br /><br />First, the star power in this show seemed like overkill.  Amy Adams, great beautiful actress, but woefully miscast for this role especially where it was underused and very little backstory. \\"Fish\\"? Another great actor but didn't need Perry White in this movie. Kevin Costner? gives good farmer ruggedness appearance (along with the acting chops) but again, he seemed angry. Why? Diane Lane is just too hot to be believable as a widowed farmer's wife.  Russell Crowe, great actor, he is MAXIMUS! But is largely wasted here.<br /><br />Second, the storyline is massive!  Too many things going on. I mean I could have watched at least 45 minutes worth of life on Krypton.  That was great!  I've always wanted to see more of what Krypton was like (as opposed to looking like a crystalline world.)<br /><br />Kal-El's basket-in-Nile-River-ride to Earth was quick then BAM! he's an adult.  But I did like the flashbacks to his childhood.  Again, I could watch more of this especially where there were poignant moments.  But we still had to get to the destruction, so cut short this part of the film.<br /><br />The idea of an alien invasion was actually captivating but the movie didn't go too much more into this.  By show of hands, who thought this part of the movie was reminiscent of \\"Signs\\"?<br /><br />Then, it turns into the destruction of our beloved IHOP (plus a few other skyscrapers) while Sears stood tall.  Oh the subtle advertisement.  Then all of a sudden, we're back in the middle of the streets of Metropolis at the Daily Planet (like the mass destruction never happened.)<br /><br />I know, I know. Sounds like I should be giving this movie a bad rating then.  Sure there are gaping plot holes and a lot going on.  But this is one of the better versions of the Man of Steel since Superman 2.  It's a reimagining.  It's not Smallville or the one with Richard Pryor in it (RIP) but MAYBE the start of it's own franchise.  Hence, the \\"too much going on\\" is probably warranted.  It's a rollercoaster of ride especially in terms of bang for your buck.  I think Henry Cavill is great (if not a little wooden) but the Man of Steel has to be stoic for truth justice and the American Way.  After all, he grew up in Kansas.<br /><br />Should you buy it?? Sure why not.  At least it's not as bad as the last Superman. But remember, Batman at least uses his cape to glide.It's not Smallville or the one with Richard Pryor in it (RIP) but MAYBE the start of it's own franchise.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have only used it to view Netflix.  So I am not sure what else it has to offer but it works great from my android to my TV for netflix.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Book purists will never like any movie adaptations of their favorite reads.  I'm not a book purist but I do read quite a bit.  That being said, I love this movie for what it is, entertainment BASED upon a literary classic.<br /><br />I like the first edition of this movie, saw it several times in the theatre.  This version is even better.<br /><br />Briefly, ***spoilers***<br />-Backstory is expanded with more background on Thorin's ascension as the dwarves leader.<br />-The time in Hobbiton is expanded and justly so.  While not quite as good as the scenes in FOTR, it does recapture the essence of hobbit-life.  Even a young Bilbo and Gandalf (face not seen.)<br />-The arrival of the 13 is expanded as well.  I love the interaction between them.  As I watched these scenes, I could not help but feel there was some message to it.  As in \\"screw you pompous book purists and elitist middle-classers\\".  Just have fun and don't take everything so seriously.  Very happy to have the 13 in almost \\"book-form\\".<br />-More time in Rivendell.<br />-The Great Goblin song and dance is back!<br /><br />The rest of the movie had bits and pieces of extra footage but not much to decsribe in any length here.<br /><br />To digress again, this movie is about entertainment.  Sure there are issues I have with it but it does not change the fact that this is entertainment at its finest.  Visually stunning, great actors, as well as the excellent story that is it based upon.  I can only look forward to the next movie, book aside.<br /><br />Hang up the negativity, there's too much of it in this world.  Take a breath and enjoy life.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|It doesn't slide all over the place when using it. It protects my phone. Great for the price paid, seeing on the outside they are 10 times the price
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing for what it does.  Picture quality is better than cable.  For the price it cannot be beat.  Works from my older Kindle and Android phone.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This story is timeless and way better than the movie! It reads like an old school fantasy novel ... In a pre- industrial revolution land where magic is real and so are witches ...
B003TNQEF0|4.0|Smart, unforgettable, creature feature reminiscent of The Thing. Great acting and story telling. I would recommend this film to fans of the genre and those with a pedestrian interest alike.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Little guy and I both love this movie! I wish we owned it! Now he talks about turtles and calls out the fish at the library in the tank by name!
0375805613|5.0|Hands down my most favorite book from my childhood.  Bought for my sister as she is expecting her first.  Good quality and the same great story!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Entertaining enough but not an amazing movie. I think it's a little long and drawn out. My husband and I thought it was ok.
076115678X|5.0|Great book for us curly hair girls!  Lots of stories and some DIY hair treatments for curly hair.  Also gives specific instructions for the various types of curly hair.  Finally a book that specifies how to deal with curly hair!
B008HK3QII|5.0|Fits my kindle fire very well.  I feel better knowing my kindle is well protected. The velcro is not flimsy, and is made to last.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have seen a better game in all my life.to those who like horses will like this app. to me its better than mine craft!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a lot of addictive fun.  Try it you will like it.  There are some boards a lot harder than others.  Just keep trying.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Phantasm Rocks!!  This movie rules so much and the Tall Man is such a bad ass, I loved this movie growing up and I still love it now at age 33, Phantasm will forever be a horror classic,  enough said!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It is definitely hard, so much that I feel I am a part of the biggest loser show. It made me sweaty but the 1st week I followed, I lost 3 lbs.  Of course, you have to partner it with a healthy diet. It works, but you have to prepare for the worst! :)
B001NLL8LA|5.0|One of the best book series I've read.. This author is so intense and keeps you wondering what's next.. I have read the complete series and more of his books and look forward to more..
B00CRS88IO|2.0|No wonder the book is so cheap. It's trash and a waste of time for anyone who has any interest in WW11
1608871827|5.0|A great art book of an amazing movie, the art shown is great. If you loved pacific rim you owe it yourself.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Love this game. It's about cutting ropes to get a candy bit to a cute little thing sitting somewhere on the screen. It's challenging and fun! You will get sucked into this for sure.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Bought this to play ssbm, all my controllers were in an awful condition. It came as advertised, a brand new oficial gamecube controller, and it works flawlessly.
B007SVPZMW|3.0|It's pretty much what you think, tic-tac-toe against a computer. What I don't like about it is that there is no challenge. It feels like the computer sort of lets you win 50% of the time. It's not really interesting and would never have opted for it had it not been a free app of the day. Save your money for something more interesting if you want to purchase.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|I love the movie and the packaging. exceptionally designed gipsy danger that I will enjoy looking at for a long time
B00902AKK4|4.0|I like this game. It's cute and simple. You're a bug in a box and you rotate the box by moving the bug around. As the box flips around you enter into a new box. It's cute and challenging. Fun little app to kill time
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|This was the first really nice watch that I bought for myself. I have long been a fan of mechanical watches, but my tastes far exceeded my budget. I had a Seiko 5 (~$80) and i kept fantastic time, but I wanted something with a little more heft and easier to read. There is a HUGE mod community around these Seiko's (the SKX in particular). Just do a search for &#34;dagaz watch ltd&#34; or &#34;yobokies's photo bucket&#34; for some examples.<br /><br />I thought I was going to want to swap out the dial and bezel as soon as I received this watch, but that turned out not to be the case. This watch is really good looking in person. It has a decent heft and good size on the wrist. The lume is super strong and once it was wound up it has kept great time right out of the box.<br /><br />The only thing I have done to this watch is to get a leather NATA strap from Crown and Buckle. It causes the watch to sit a little high, but this case is not really built to go under a cuff anyway, so it doesn't bother me much.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I have read some people that have had trouble with the watch and have sent it back to amazon or somebody to be fixed. IF you have trouble with your watch check for a local watch repair shop first. When I have had trouble with my Seiko 5 (Banged it hard doing yard-work and it started running super fast) I brought it in and the fixed it while I waited. 15 minutes and $20 later I walked out with a better time keeper than when I first got it.<br /><br />Overall this is a fantastic watch and I could not be happier.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is a solid mahjong game. It's pretty much what you would expect. The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is that each level is timed. Do pass a level you have to do it during a certain time frame and if you don't you can't move on. The problem is they don't tell you what the time level limit is for each level to pass it. I'm stuck on this one level where I've pretty much given up and I can't go deeper into the game because of it. If you're a mahjong junkie than this is for you but it would be very frustrating for someone who is not.
160774418X|5.0|Wonderful cookbook , full of delicious recipes with middel east flavor<br /><br />I tried a lot of recipes like<br /><br />Chicken with zater and sumac , chicken with Harissa roast chicken with saffron and eggplant with tahini and<br /><br />best chocolate cake ever<br /><br />I recommend this book
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I'm all about seek-n-finds, so this was right up my alley. It's pretty much what you think, you hunt for items in a scene to move on to various levels. I like that it's easy to utilize within the game. Some games like this can have issues in terms of selecting items, this one does not. The quest board has various options (e.g.:words, pictures, shadow outline, etc.) to search for which keeps it fresh. I would definitely recommend this game to someone who loves seek-n-finds.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|5th times a charm. It never gets old. Looking forward to rereading Fifty Shades Darker. I love this series of books. Awesome.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This game is so cute! You are a vampire trying to get to a chick in the room. On the way there are obstacles, some that will hurt you and some that will kill you. The object is to get to the chick without dying. It's fun and challenging and worth picking up.
034580404X|5.0|For being a fictional story i thought it was quite okay. Not the best book ever but really whos reading in between the sex scenes? Yea its entertaining and i wished some words werent used as much as they are (you know which ones) but i still think its a good book series.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Overall, I was enthralled when I first got this. The idea is that there is a stream of sugar falling from the sky and you draw lines to direct the sugar into various buckets. It gets more complex by having to go various ways to change colors or direction before the sugar runs out. Here's my problem, you get to a point where you just can't figure out what's going on. It defies science and there are no instructions to walk you through harder trials to help guide you a bit. You just sort of figure it out. I've hit a point where I just don't go to this app anymore because it's frustrating. I'd rather play Color Sheep.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|This is yet another great game by Jundroo. I feel in love with the comical scenarios in dummy defense over a year ago. I feel the same about simple rockets; it panders to the 8 year old me who wanted to fly spaceships.
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|Overall, this is a cute concept. You are a granny trying to outrun a thief to pick up coins and apples. Here's my issue, it takes keen timing to have her jump and based on how long you hold her jump, she can either land on her feet, miss her jump or fall on her butt loosing all the loot you just picked up. I've gone into this a couple of times but I just loose interest.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Extremely realistic novel that communicates the real challenges in business & IT while providing real solutions. Great for business & tech folks.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What's better than a zombie killing game? A zombie killing game using plants! I love this game. You earn sunshines from sunflowers that helps you buy plants that offer different killing options for your zombie problem. It's fun and easy to play and very addictive. Perfect for anyone that loves arcade games.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the ability to easily stream music to my TV alone, I love my Chromecast.  It's easy to set up, easy to use, and really convenient.  I also think the interface is rather attractive when things are playing on the TV.  Before our Chromecast getting music to play on our TV was such a pain in the rear, but this makes it painless.  It's also super-portable if you want to take it to use somewhere else, which is a plus.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|This game irritates me. The object is that your a fish in a bowl and you have to move around eating things in the tank without being eaten yourself. It's very awkward and cumbersome to move you guy around. I think I've opened this app twice and just give up. I love video and arcade games, but this is just not worth it to me.
0385537131|4.0|Look, I'm not under any illusion that my review will persuade you to purchase (or not purchase) a John Grisham novel.  If you liked A Time to Kill, then buy this.  It's worth every penny.  I recently re-watched the film and forgot how much I liked it.  It's a little over-slick and over-produced as a film, but the performances are so strong, and the twist, while fully expected, satisfies better than a Snickers.  \\"Sycamore Row\\" is no different, and topping in at over 400+ pages, you'll be chewing on this for a little while.  Enjoy.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Again, pretty solid hidden object. It's exactly what you would expect. My only irritation is that I hate games like this with a story line. I'm not playing God of War or anything so lets move this along.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I love this movie.  It continues to get better each time I watch it.  You begin to question the level of dreams one can have and if manipulation of these dreams is possible.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|This is pretty much what you think. Little tiles pop down and you clear off the board by linking similar tiles together. It's not a bad game but gets old for sure.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book! I was sorry to see it end. A great continuation of Danny Torrence's life as a struggling adult.
B008EL25LE|3.0|This is pretty much like the other version. You have to group things together to clear the board. It just sort of is what it is. Nothing worth buying unless you love those kind of games
B006JXIWWU|5.0|Fantastic Bowie and super sound!  Soundstage is big and wide.  Sonics are up with the best in rock  records  ++++
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love hidden object games and this is definitely a solid choice. You have various scenes and the numbers can be challenging to find. Definitely a solid game.
B00004WNZ3|5.0|This Madonna LP will blow you away. Monster bass  with awesome soundstage. Way better than expected.  No wonder this LP won so many Grammy's
1612191290|1.0|Total misrepresentation. This is not a history, it's a diatribe. If you care to read about one man's opinions on economists, the International Monetary Fund, and a wild collection of topics, read on. If you're looking for an insightful and unbiased view into the history of debt, keep looking.<br /><br />The publishers should find someone to write the book they're advertising, because that I would enjoy reading.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a wonderful book full of rich and smart dialogue. The lead characters were fully developed and truly came to life. The topic is heart-wrenching but the payoff is worth it.<br />This was my first John Green novel, but I will read more of his work.
0634060384|5.0|This &#34;Fake Book&#34; has a gold mine of jazz, popular, funk, and whatever music - with only chords and melody line for the most part. If that's your bag, this is your book! The only thing I would add is the words to songs.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I finished the book only because it was our book club selection and I was the moderator for this selection. It seemed this novel never really took off. I couldn't keep the characters straight because they were so unremarkable and poorly developed. None of them had redeemable traits. I wasn't attached to any of them. Even with a predictable tragedy in the end- or maybe because of it- I do NOT recommend you waste any time on this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really recommend this game to anybody who likes a challenge. This game is really fun to do and it makes u think of what move to do next to get to the next level. :)
B001TKNWWI|4.0|I'm not a wresting fan by any means. I actually bought this because my boyfriend is a huge wrestling fan & he said this was a great movie. We had seen it together & I liked this movie. It showed the dark gritty side of the sport. I would & have recommeded this movie. Thumbs up!
B009MF56GC|5.0|Here I am with a review for The Expendables 2 which I saw in the theater in The Summer of 2012 while I prefer the 1st movie this sequel comes very close & it rocks. I can see why people like this movie over the 1st Expendables but for whatever reason I like the 1st more. There isn't much wrong in fact this movie is awesome if you told me like 15 or 20 years ago that their would be a movie where Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis & Chuck Norris would star in it I'd think you were lying. When I saw the 1st Expendables you had Arnold Schwarzenegger & Bruce Willis in cameos I hoped that Stallone would give them more to do. While Stallone didn't direct this movie he did write the script & hopefully have some control. I will admit I had my concern's when I heard this movie would be<br />PG 13 cause the 1st Expendables was R also I was concerned how certain guys were going to be used. I had read that this movie was shot PG 13 from the get go I believe that cause it looked like CGI gore was added. But getting to the movie it was made on $100 million & made $312 million directed by Simon West he directed Con Air, The General's Daughter, Tomb Raider & The When A Stranger Call remake which blows. The cast all return except for Mickey Rourke. Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench Mauser, Bruce Willis as Mr Church & Jet Li as Yin Yang. You have some newer cast members Jean Claude Van Damme as Jean Vilain, Chuck Norris as Booker, Scott Adkins as Hector, Liam Hemsworth as Billy The Kid & Yu Nan as Maggie. The movie starts off in Nepal where The Expendables have to go rescue a hostage who turns out to be Trench Mauser. You open up to a great action scene with the team just mowing down enemy soldiers. There is also this really cool fight scene with Jet Li in The kitchen using kitchen items on these enemy soldiers.When  they find Trench he says that this is embarrassing. Trench asks for a weapon he takes Hale Caesar's AA 12 Shotgun he says that if he doesn't get it back his a  *  * is terminated. Arnold Schwarzenegger responds \\"In your dreams.\\" Your introduced to Billy The Kid who is a Sniper he kills some of the enemy troops when the team is surrounded. Plus you get a really entertaining chase scene in the water where the team is trying to get aboard the plane. You have the team at the bar having a good time Lee is still together with Lacy & it was nice that they followed that up to show that sub plot mattered. You have Billy tell Barney that he is going to finish up at the end of the month so he can be with his Girlfriend. Ross gets work in Albania. Mr Church wants him & his team to go & get these blueprints & important items from a safe in this crashed plane. Then you're introduced to this girl named Maggie cause she can break locks even if they're electronic. So they go off to Albania & I don't think The Billy The Kid character is bad but Liam Hemsworth is not believable in the role like when he tells the story when he was in The Army just isn't believable with him I think I would've bought it more if they had Marc Dacoscus or Michael Biehn. Anyway they go to the plane crash where Ross & Hale Caesar have to hold open a metal door so Maggie can open the safe you have this group lead by Jean Vilain he wants what they found in the safe he's captured Billy he wants what they found or he will kill Billy. He has Ross's knife & uses it to cut a huge gash on Billy's chest. Maggie gives up the device & Lee Christmas tosses at Jean Vilain & group Hector Jean Vilain's right hand man tells Lee to pick it up or he will kill Billy so he hands it to him. Vilain tells the team to get on the ground Vilain hands Hector the knife Vilain asks Billy if he's afraid of him he says no so Vilain roundhouses the knife right into Billy's chest killing him. Ross wants to know why was the device so important that 1 of their teammates was killed over it. Maggie tells them that it has blueprints to some plutonium under a mine. Stallone has a great line when they bury Billy \\"Why is it that 1 of us who wants to live the most, who deserves to live the most dies, & the 1 that deserves to die keep on living? What's the message in that?\\" Not as great as the line from Mickey Rourke in the 1st movie but it's still well spoken. Then you have this very direct straight forward line that I remember being in the trailer \\"Track them, find them kill them!\\" Mr Church gets in contact with Ross he is mad that they didn't get the device from the safe. Ross tells him that he always pulls the strings but you always have other people do you dirty work. He also tells him that they're done. They get into this town where Ross & Lee get into a fight in this bar. Maggie takes this manicure kit & uses it to torture these guys to find out some info on Vilain. They find this abandoned town that was used in The Cold War. A scene that was funny when they're talking they would eat for their last meal. Gunner said \\"Baby Seal & Whale<br />a  *  * in the summer.\\" He looks at Maggie who is Chinese & says \\"I would really die for some Chinese.\\" Ross says \\"Then you're going to starve to death.\\" I thought that was 1 of them more funnier lines that Dolph Lundgren had they really made Dolph Lundgren goofy in this movie in the 1st movie Gunner had a drug problem he wasn't<br />re  t  ar  e  d. I did laugh when the song It's A Beautiful Morning the next morning. Hale Caesar steps outside for a moment where these group of fighters called The Sangs that work for Vilain. Hale Caesar goes back in & yells for everyone to get down. You have them get in a big shootout with The Sangs Ross gets in contact with Lee who is fixing a truck he asks if they can hold them off Ross responds by saying \\"Yeah maybe with a tank.\\" Low & behold a tank is coming after The Expendables. They're low on ammo the tank is blown up withrocket the team wondered who took out the tank & who helped them take out The Sangs. It turns out to be 1 of Barney Ross's old friends Booker where they used The Good The Bad & The Ugly theme to me it didn't fit I think they should've used The Delta Force theme or The Walker Texas Ranger theme. Booker is more of a loner Ross says he had heard a rumor that he had been bitten by a King Cobra. Booker tells him \\"Yeah I was but after 5 days agonizing pain, The Cobra died.\\" The theater I was in there was a lot of laughs with that line. If you're a fan of Chuck Norris you'll get the line. Booker points in the direction of this village where the people hat Vilain cause he takes people from the town they never return cause Vilain works them to death to find The Plutonium. They're going to take a group of children The Expendables help them out you have a scene where The Sangs are in this Chapel & Lee is disguised as a Preacher he tells The Sangs \\"I know pronounce you Man & Knife.\\" He kills this group with some knives. The team kills off The Sangs then you have Ross, Caesar, Gunner, Toll Road & Maggie gun the last man in the group down I mean they fill that guy full of bullet holes. The Slaves found The Plutonium The Expendables found the mine Ross crashes into the mine. Vilain & Hector escape with The Plutonium he blocks the way so they can't follow. You have a scene where Gunner makes an explosive it doesn't go off where they continue to make this character look stupid Maggie says don't cry Gunner. Anyway Trench shows up in some sort of mining vehicle & says \\"I'm back!\\" Mr Church decides to help The Expendables. Then you go to this awesome finish at an airport. The back & forth between Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger is funny cause Arnold Schwarzenegger needs to reload & says \\"I'll be back.\\" Willis says \\"You've been back enough!\\" Schwarzenegger says \\"Yippe ki yay.\\" You have Mr Church get this compact car & you get that hilarious line that was in the trailer \\" My shoes are bigger than this car\\" Plus you have Chuck Norris gun this guy while he is going through an airport X Ray Machine. Vilain & Hector try to escape Lee gets in a fight Hector a very good fight resulting in Lee hitting Hector with a pair of brass knucks & his head is chopped up on an airplane propeller. There is this really good fight between Stallone & Van Damme it was originally written Jean Vilain was running away from Barney Ross Van Damme asked for it to be rewritten which I am glad he did cause this was nearly what I would call a great fight. Ross kills Vilain & brings his head out to Mr Church Trench says it's a nice touch. Ross & Maggie say their good byes which was a nice scene. Mr Church got a plane for The Expendables it looks like it's from the 30's or 40's  Ross says \\"That thing belongs in a museum.\\" Trench's response is \\"We all do.\\" As they head off Lee tells Ross that he needs to learn how to fight cause he is bruised & cut up from his fight. Anyway this was a strong sequel it did keep a lot of good stuff from the 1st movie with the action straight forward plot humor that was funny for the most part. I didn't care for how they made The Gunner Character look goofy. The AA 12 Shotgun lost a lot of it's guts I could tell that it was shot for a PG 13  from the start. But this was a strong sequel & has a lot of good things going for than bad things. Simon West did a good job although I am sure that Stallone had a lot of input either way it was directed really good. Sylvester Stallone did a great job. Jason Statham was good. Arnold Schwarzenegger was given a little more time & he did a good job as did Bruce Willis who got more time too. Terry Crews gave a nice normal performance. Dolph Lundgren did a pretty good job despite being written as a goofy character. Liam Hemsworth was ok. Jean Claude Van Damme was good. Scott Adkins did a good job. Yu Nan did a very good job I surprised cause I had never heard of her before. Jet Li did fie although he was only in the movie like 5 minutes or less. Definite recommendation stoong sequel. I know their is an Expendables 3 coming out next summer but I am in no hurry in seeing the cast it's going to filled with UFC guys & girls & Boxers they're great athletes but they don't make good actors most of the time. I am not looking forward to Mel Gibson as the villain cause of how low he has became as human being. I know they got Wesley Snipes & he should be the villain or how about Michael Wincott Sean Bean would make a better villain than Mel Gibson. I would rather have Vincent Klyn. Kelsey Grammer nothing about him says action star. Kellan Lutz from The Twilight movies come on Stallone you couldn't get Jeff Speakman, Thomas Jane, Karl Urban, The Rock, Vin Diesel, Kurt Russell or even Michael Biehn. I know the story why Bruce Willis isn't coming back. I agree with Wesley Snipes & Antonio Banderas that's the only casting I like this movie will suffer the part 3 curse it looks like. So it's going against what The Expendables & even Expendables 2 set out to do going back to the old 80's 90's action movies but update it a little bit. Anyway check out Expendables 1 & 2 if you're a fan of old school action movies.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|I really enjoyed Drew and Kate's romantic and sexual romp. I thought that telling the story from the first person guy's perspective was a fresh and rewarding approach. The dialogue is witty and filled with my favorite cuss words which could be a problem for people who don't like the eff word as much as I do. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I measure every romance against Outlander, and nothing can compare to Outlander.  But Emma Chase should be proud of herself. This was an excellent read that I enjoyed very much. Keep writing Emma. You have a gift for repartee. And I enjoyed the character development of the hero. He reminded me a lot of my husband.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love it it is my son's best game he always says bedo bedo lol it is funny and well all laugh wen he dose it
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I am eighty years old and this book brought me back to the time just before I was in utero. And has allowed me in an accurate (albeit distant) way to trace the decades of my life which have slumped into a deterioration of our culture and which seem to be getting increasingly worse.<br /><br />But enough about me! This is about BILL BRYSON! I love his writing and have read most of his books. I would and have recommended him to many people, who have all thanked me. He is a superb non-fiction writer and gives detailed and readable treatment to stories of our time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love playing. use my battery up playing. nice to have so many different vehicles and tracks. always something to keep working.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Such a classic and awesome show. Watch it brings you back to those times in the 20's and 30's and you feel apart of there family and life. SO well written.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I just love it I wish many of days I could have seen him live Micheal Jackson was the best best entertainer I ever knew I will always love him. U rest in peace mj.....
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|Just OK, at best. Oh, what expected: lots of gunfire, explosions, mayhem of one kind or another but although chief bad guy was decently bad enough, the good guy lacked ??? And Jamie Fox as the president was a waste of his talents. Limited humor. If you want to see better action, special effects, watch \\"Olympus Has Fallen\\".
B00F56AZK4|5.0|my special needs daughter loves jigty jigsaw puzzles and this application is great because she can start easy and then increase the challenge all on her own.  We both love it!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Holy cow! I couldn't put this book down! It's a terrific read, exciting and memorizing! Good price and arrived in a timely manner. I highly recommend this book to all.  Enjoy!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|So i bought the game one week before it was free and now I'm mad as hell because not only did i waste 99&cent; i thought at least since i bought it i would have got some special car but i didn't so please give the people who bought it some thing back in return.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm reading it now...halfway through it. How does Stephen King do it? He wraps you up in a cocoon of characters that you feel you know, like peeking through a window...amazing story...I hate putting the book down, but I have to! I must eat!  lol  Enjoy!  I certainly am. I definitely am one of Kings, 'Constant Readers'.  =)
B00133KFGW|5.0|Wonderful movie.  we have watched it 4 or 5 times and it is a keeper.  A real feel good movie without all the filthy language that most movies have today.  The little boy's acting is outstanding.  When we just want to see an entertaining movie we get this out and watch it again.  Have bought copies for other people as gifts.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I've always liked mysteries and detective stories. Sherlock Homes delivered! good writing also. thank you. I would recommend this book. Enjoy!
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|I purchased this album because I have always liked OMD.<br /><br />Some of the songs, or shall I say the little talking parts really make me smile.<br /><br />If you loved the OMD of the past you should also love this OMD present.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Again, I would read most anything from the Master, Stephen King.  A thrilling read...scary. I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book to all.
B008133MDK|5.0|So good I've watched it twice! The writing, the acting, the editing is great, but especially the writing is unbelievably fantastic. Second viewing provides so many more inside jokes. &#34;they sent a queen&#34; hahahaha!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only problem with this game is there isn't enough of it.It gets more challenging as it goes along! Love it! Can't wait for the next set of rooms.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautifully written story of loss, large and small transgressions and the power of family, courage and love.  Hosseini  only gets better.
006202406X|4.0|Loved it. Not every story has to end happily. If a story ends in true sacrifice and love for those around the character does that make it horrible? Maybe for some but not for me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Brilliant combination of great writing, acting and direction. I think it compares with the very best of all time great TV. I am so happy I am just on season 1 and have so more I can look foreword to.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Heavy duty, holds an edge and can handle most all needs of survival.  Grip is large enough to work for chopping as well wood feathering for starting fires.  Nice knife
B001BANK32|5.0|Classic and terrifying. Much better than the movie(s). Read it for the first time over 20 years ago, had forgotten what a great read it was.
B002UZXJA6|4.0|Great Vocal Group. I love MY &#34;Celtic Women&#34; . My family thinks I'm OCD, but their combined voices and instruments are hard to surpass. I hope that they will continue performing as they are extremely talented.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun to play,I enjoy the challenge of each new phase. I also enjoy the Facebook connection. Plus in all ways.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive! My friends and I are hooked! Love the interaction with Facebook where I can request help from friends.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is classic King.  It has a good tale and is written in a nice easy to read and engrossing style.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|In &#34;down to Earth&#34; speak, Miss Grout lays out experiments that help us realize that the power of the Universe is truly in the power of our thoughts.<br /><br />The experiments are easy to follow. And not al all intimidating.<br /><br />The one draw back for me me was its over optimistic assumption that all the experiments would work easy peasy. No real discussion about &#34;over reaching&#34; and what to do when it happens. She does say that a vibrational match does need to happen for some of these experiments to work.<br /><br />Overall a very enjoyable book to read and try.  I will definitely try some of these experiments again.
B000HF0J36|3.0|This movie has a pretty good story; relevant for today.  Acting is not too bad, and the cast is pretty good.  Special effects are not &#34;Disney&#34; quality, but are not laughable.  And, those responsible for the abomination get it in the end-poetic justice!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|The author gives a real and in-depth look at life in Russia and the paranoia that all it's citizens have on a daily basis.  Great plot twist at the end and comes together perfectly.  Loved the contrast from what the main character's thoughts on his wife were compared to what she actually thought and why.
B00BQBNK04|4.0|Great soundtrack but it's a little too expensive. I still think that it was worth the extra money though. Very good quality audio.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book, I never wanted to put it down. It is easy to read science fiction. Also very imaginative yet believable.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|i don't know how long she's been around but her music is fresh and professional. Sometimes she remind me of keri hilson but very original. Would reccomend this cd. See for yourself.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun and addicting game but it takes way too long to regain your lives. Should be an incentive after winning each game. Perhaps automatically regain 5 minutes after each game won. Would've given five stars if it weren't for the long wait to regain lives.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Love this show and this first season was a great kick off. Creepy characters, interesting story lines and plot twists and great acting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad it's finally on kindle fire HD. My phone still won't let me get it and I fathom playing it on the computer.
B0081336FO|5.0|Only one thing wrong with this series - there is not enough! We want more! The suspense is killing me!
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I loved the movie! and the little toy was just the cutest!!! I am glad that I bought it! I would do it again.
0375842209|5.0|Very interesting writing style, and one of those books you hate to see come to an end.  Have lent this to a friend and she cannot put it down either.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is an intelligent, addictive game. Others have already described the game play, so I won't do that here. I rated it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of what seems to be a glitch in the game play. I usually play it in stationary camera mode, which  means that the cube cannot be rotated, making it much harder to win. I can almost always finish the game, but I've found that when you get down to the last pair or few pairs of tiles, if they are right on top of each other it can be impossible to touch the underneath tiles, either with your finger or with a stylus. I'm not sure whether the game is just not precise enough to let you finish, or whether it's supposed to be a penalty for somehow not calculating how to make the end of the game play out differently.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I particularly like that the adapter feels WELL built....not light weight and flimsy.<br />It also does not have the standard green ( or any) LED light to attract by-passers attention, when left plugged-in.<br />Lastly, nice that it has (2) different amperage for charging, as we have both Android and Apple devices.<br />All in all, nice product at a nice price...we will most likely purchase 1 or 2 more.
1594202273|5.0|Just finished this book. It's on a par with David Hoffman's The Dead Hand as one of the best recent books on the miltary nuclear aspects of the Cold War, in my view.<br /><br />The book covers both the specific, i.e. the Titan II accident in Damascus in 1980 with the emphasis on the human stories of the men involved in both manning the silo and those trying to prevent a catastrophic, and the general, namely the context in which this accident occurred. Schlosser's writing is extremely tight and lucid and both aspects are interwoven expertly throughout the narrative. It appears, from the sources and notes, that Schlosser has researched his material thoroughly and the book is well-edited and free of typos and rambling text (a pleasant change, notable in the exception, sadly!)<br /><br />Could hardly put it doen and read it in 3 days. Brilliant: buy it - you won't be sorry.
B00D4LKOVC|5.0|Loved the movie, the stars, the plot, everything.  Tom Hanks and John Candy made the movie, but overall a great family film.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|my daughter's favorite movie. great to watch on tv, iphone, ipad. each chracacter stands out on their own. would recommend
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The story keeps your interest and keeps moving.  The  story incorporates history and drama in an incredible way.  The only bad thing is that the book ended.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Ultimately disappointed. Though the book started strongly, it meandered (slowly) to the point of irritation.<br />Good concept that could have been better developed.
B003GK2216|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of novel writing and Ken Follett is a literary giant. No exaggeration. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. The characters seem to come alive and become more and more credible as the story unfolds. It is a pity that \\"World Without End\\" had to end! Time for an encore 2 centuries later, Mr Follett.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this.  My son has a different version than I do, but this one was free and I decided to try it.  I have tinnitus and am constantly on the lookout for something that will give me a few minutes relief from the constant ringing and screaming in my ears.  This was probably an app just for relaxation and it does relax you.  But it also provides some relief from the ringing in my ears.  It has all kinds of different sounds you can mix and match and I love being able to match the sound to what I need for that particular day to relax.  Thanks to whoever made this app.  It's a winner.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am an old time trek fan so wasn't sure what to think of the re-boot. Well it's as good or better than the original.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is best game because the game has so much features in it and I'm waiting for next update....  &lt;&deg;~&deg;&gt;
1250038820|5.0|Amazing. Influential. Inspiring. Heart-warming. A marvelous creation!<br /><br />It's wonderful to have people in this world such as Brandon Stanton. Everyone sees something that others don't and it's nice to have a gentle reminder that we're all creatures of the world with emotions, dreams and a story. Everyone is flawed in some way but he reminds us that we're all human and that's okay.
B00DB624GS|4.0|Much improved remastering in 12 or 13. You don't realize how bad the sound is on some of the early CDs until they do a good remastering. The instruments pop instead of being buried in a dark and murky background. Same goes for the Tull Benefit Remaster, Moondance & Kiko.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|First loves are intense and magical. This book captured it perfectly and made me look at my first love in a different light. Best quote from the book that made it for me and explained the ending:<br />&#34;The me that's me right now is yours. Always.&#34;
B00F880BWG|5.0|We love this show. Scary and dramatic and human all in one. The characters keep getting better every episode. The zombies get scarier.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It was a good overall movie. Had a few twists & turns that were unexpected.<br />Is it for the die hard sci-fi person, maybe not but was an interesting two hours.
1742204147|5.0|I know people have their problems with the Lonely Planet series, but I think everyone needs to acknowledge the enormity of the task that these writers undertake: They try to make an entire country/culture/language accessible to someone with no background in it. And given that mandate, they do a fantastic job. The guides make sure you're equipped to do everything from take a taxi from the airport (without getting ripped off) to find your local embassy or consulate in an emergency. They really are a travelers Bible.<br /><br />No, they won't give you an authentic local experience (if you want to test that theory, grab the guide for your city of residence and see how many of the restaurants you hit up regularly) but they can give you a comprehensive tourist experience. Part of that is learning to read between the lines and get to know the Lonely Planet euphemisms, \\"quaint\\" means old, \\"cozy\\" means tiny, and \\"off the beaten track\\" means that you'll be the only person in that hotel/restaurant/cafe. There's definitely an element of hyperbole at play but one can look past the writers' excitement.<br /><br />I don't have too much to say about the Japan guide itself given that I haven't been on my trip yet, but I've read it from cover to cover and feel like it's equipped me pretty well in terms of what to expect and what to see. The city guide on Tokyo seems especially comprehensive and provides plenty of budget options that make the potential expense seem less daunting. Looking forward to another maiden trip to a foreign land with Lonely Planet as my guide.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|It's James Bond. I know there was a lot of feedback (negative) about how there were no cool gadgets but it relied on whit and facade like it should.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is turning out to be a great idea for a series. So many options with so many silos out there. Headed to Amazon to buy the next installment.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Liked it even better than Fruit Drops part I.  It's great fun.  More puzzles to work and the ability to move from easy to difficult or back.
0321934318|4.0|very readable, step by step process to learn lightroom.  I&#34;m still in the process of trying to figure out where to go and what to do but Kelby&#34;s instructions are clear, concise and I'm hoping will get me to where I need to be in becoming functional.  I'm not there yet.
B0036OS3I8|4.0|These are super comfy, hello, they are crocs! But the tread on the bottom is not as good as it looks. I did slip a couple times and fall once on ice. They are great for walking at the dog park and in parking lots, but icy sidewalks with a dog pulling on you are a no no.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This is a great tv series that I heard about at work and have gifted the series to family members who now request the latest  edition for birthdays,etc.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great product. Does everything its supposed to do. The IOS app has some problems and lags. You can only cast youtube and netflix from your iphone or ipad. So you cannot use chrome browser in ipad to cast ur screen. Unclear if this is possible in android or samsung tablets. So this limits things that you can cast if you have an ipad or iphone. Would hope that google updates its app so that we can cast pictures and browser on our ipads to the big screen. It works great if you have a laptop where the who browser is casted. However I cant see the cursor on the tv so even if I have a wireless keyboard, I can use it without seeing my laptop.<br /><br />Update: 11/15/13<br />After using the chromecast for 4 days, I realized that there is significant buffering issue and even with it playing youtube and netflix I cant seem to have a smooth streaming. The chromecast is barely a ft away from my router and I dont think its my internet as my laptop is streaming fine. Moreover the time of the day determines the streaming quality (I guess the cloud gets overwhelmed). I dec quality to 420p but still the same issue. Returning mine to amazon. Will wait for the next generation of chromecast. For now, going to buy an appletv.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|We were looking for a light comedy to watch at home and this filled the bill satisfactorily.  My husband is a great lover of birds , though not a &#34;life lister&#34; and this was his suggestion.  He did notice a few inaccuracies in the scientific references made in the film but got over that.  It's an entertaining comedy with a good cast and a story line that basically works. The Big Year references a count of North American bird life with the purpose of having the most species counted by an individual. It was often funny, had some sweetness and managed to go there without getting sappy.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Just start then try to put it down, don't start reading it at bed time. Lots of energy lots of interesting personalities through out this amazing book
0316055433|5.0|Tartt's writing is perfectly exquisite.  I've been a fan[atic] of Tartt since The Secret History and the old adage, quality over quantity is proven true here.  Goldfinch is a wondrous piece of fiction, filled with characters beautifully drawn and walk-off-the-page real.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I love all of ken Follett books, just enjoy the easy reading,plus the history lessons he gives in his books
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The biggest drawback is the device is dependent on another computer/tab/phone. The only app it offers that you cannot get over Roku, Apple TV or other dongles is YouTube. $35 for just YouTube simply sucks. And, they won't let other apps like Dropbox stream to it, so it isn't an open device.
B0018RE7DU|2.0|Boring.  Gere doesn't succeed in making me care about his character.  Thought it would be more exciting based on the music.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Liked the movie okay, good cast, but if you've read the book they have left a lot out.  My suggestion unless you are a big fan of someone in the cast READ THE BOOK
B005LAIHY0|5.0|If you love Predators or Aliens you will love this movie! It was very suspenseful and held our interest the entire movie.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|An incredible story about an amazing young lady who endured a horrific shooting because she pursued education as an important part of her life. It is real life and we need to be informed.  This is an important read because this young lady lived this life and is telling it as she lived it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun game and challenging. fun to challenge friends. great to get help from friends.<br />hate the time outs. keeps your mind thinking.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I don't love the search engine. Seems to give me lots of things that don't match. But other than that, Love PInterest
B002RTMXIY|5.0|6 big tuff guys get scared out if their wits. How could this NOT BE A TRUE STORY. LOVED IT.
B00992CF6W|1.0|What the hell is this.  I can't believe I read reviews about how fun this is. Where are the directions about how to play or what if any goals there might be?
B00F9040HU|5.0|A great game and make you want to get all the peices to make the picture . It keeps your mind in the games. Best game to play .
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|The worst part is being sucked in to purchasing upgrades and almost impossible to achieve by playing unless you are nut case and playing repetitive sparing for years to complete.  Then control of the game for skill is hard to tell it mostly seems rely on upgrading our robot to win.  I give up, you win!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game it's addicting, I can not put the kindle down. I just wish you didn't have to wait for twenty minutes in between lives<br />.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun and addicting, I do like that there is some strategy involved some of the levels are almost too hard to get 3 stars
B00AMYTA7S|5.0|Ms. Alpin has created magic with her first album. The songs are thought provoking and beautifully sung, so much so that's its difficult to pick a favorite. If pressed to chose just one, 'Keep on Walking' is a true gem of an anthem to the notion of addition by subtraction. The album is richly produced, and the sound mixing is first rate. Well played, indeed.
B00FHNBDC4|5.0|Amos Lee is arguably the best vocalist around today. With this new album, he challenges his own musicality and braves new frontiers in songwriting and production. Some songs may sound foreign to long-time Amos fans, but they are welcome excursions into his musical and emotional development. Amos Lee remains, as this album proves, the best of the best in music today.
B00GKS2HN4|5.0|I loved it .It was so challenging and mysterious I loved it. Plus it was in a haunted house so cool.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game especially since I got it free. It remindes me of the classic atari games. I give it 5 stars all day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I haven't received it.  I would like to rate it when it showes up on my Kindle.  It has been about a month, and I'm still waiting.<br />Darlene Ghiorso - darghi@att.net
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I'm surprised they were allowed to make this movie. A real glimpse into the world of MKUltra. Want to know how the Colorado Batman shootings and recent school shootings happened? Watch this one. Nice single take action scenes.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Never received this game either.  You seem to be having problems with sending games to my Kindle.  This is the second one, and neither was received.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great product.  Well worth the money.  I would like it to support more streaming options.  Hopefully that will come with updates.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|A good read. Would read this book again in the future. A good way to spend time while on holiday.
B00199B2Z8|4.0|A witty and insightful comparison of life in England and in America.  I'm English, born, brought up and educated in the UK and am now a naturalized US citizen.  I came here for a job and suddenly -- whoops!  40 years went by, and I still relish the difference in the humor and attitudes.  Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it is no longer quite up to date  (maybe the UK has become more like the US in terms of consumer culture).
0345803485|5.0|Such a great book I read thus book in two days! All girls must read this book! And the sec one is just as good haven't got the third yet but I'm in the process
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Hard not to love this. Pixar Classic. I remember seeing it in the theater probably with my grandma and cousins.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Pretty standard image search game designed to get you frustrated and waste money.<br />Half of main page appears to have been set up with updates in mind but nothing available.<br />Poor links to the amazon game circle as it doesn't update or sync.<br />A number of achievements are impossible. For example you need to open 20 pictures but as the game description states there are only 14. Another is to post comments on twitter or Facebook but the game ignores the fact that you post so you can never complete.  If these things were fixed would have given 4 stars.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Usually I can find a song or two on Eminem's albums (in the case of Relapse several songs) that I don't like. I like them all on The Marshall Mathers LP2. This is his best album yet.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Most enjoyable, will look forward to catching more about Theo in the future. A good read for all ages from 12 - 72!  Thank you, Mr. Grisham for a very nice afternoon with hot chocolate and a good book!
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book, I am going to purchase the other books by this author. Very good book. Well written.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Yes it did cos my nephew loves mind craft and little did I know it was in his wish list. I t was a dream come true. A part from the play aspect of it, it gives kids a creative and imaginative mind on the positive. It is better than being on all those video games eg call of duty etc
1250029465|5.0|What else is there to say that hasn't already been told. This is a story that rarely happens and its one of those moments when you think that it was made to happen by some things that we cannot understand. Its a life changing story that needs to be passed on and cherished, whether you believe its worth in that magnitude or not. Its these kind of stories that makes a difference in life, both spiritually and mentally.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|Bought it to accompany the Cast CD. It helped clarify some of what is going on in the songs. Video quality is good, although grainy at times. Good singing. Good cast. Easy to recommend if you like musicals or have seen the broadway show and enjoyed it.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Good Family Movie. Lots of fun watching it. Getting new releases through Amazon is a lot easier than going to the video store or to a red box container. Peace.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Really buggy product! I can't get it to play sound from my computer. It seems to work ok from an iphone 5S.<br />I bought this as an easy to store Apple TV, it is not close. Real Crap!!!!
B00F91H666|5.0|a zombie movie on a large scale, it pass the bar and set the bar. must have some snacks and etc.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Good product, improves your workflow I use it for lightroom and photoshop for increasing and decreasing brush size, works like a charm
B0053F042G|5.0|awhhh man your in for a fun night, a must see and you must have your lady with you, this movie's hard to swallow by yourself. enjoy.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The only problem is the addictive nature of the game. I've canceled Thanksgiving and XMas plans and my wife has left me
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Did not want to put the book down.<br /><br />Plenty of plot changes, well developed characters, & satisfying ending.<br /><br />Enjoy for yourself.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent. Exciting holds your attention. The clothing and the set is stunning. The actors are top of the line. The Best in class
B008AIGWVA|5.0|my grandkids love it when they visit.<br />Emma can sit and play with the dog for ages<br />Love the dog and his antics
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I love historical fiction.  This describes more of a cultural history of the time than about events.  The characters are richly drawn and the story makes it a page- turner.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|loved this game. love all angry bird games. I am an old star wars fan from way back . and not only that....its free!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love a good story, and learned about a part of our history that I had never heard about.  It's a page-turner.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love anything and everything to do with angry birds. Space is yet another great game and keeps me entertained for hours
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was purchased for my Grandson, birthday gift. He loves building and creating things with his lego's.  This was on his wishlist.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|Good story, well written, but old fashioned writing style seems rather tedious after a while especially in a very long book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a good game for any age. Simple to use and very good graphics. I like that there are different types of options in the game so that you don't get bored.
0316247545|5.0|Excellent product. I thought it was bigger, but Istill love it. Perfect for a little pony's fan. Perfect as a gift.
1932100660|5.0|This is an interesting book that summarizes 70 years of research from many different sources.  I think anyone interested in diet would enjoy reading this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love love love this book. It made me happy,sad,amazed,excited, and in love with all the characters. I think John Greens should make a sequel, but make it Gus's point of view instead.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have played this game tor ever when I found it again on my kindle I was excited thank you
B00G32OER4|5.0|We were glued to the TV the whole time. Very scary. Gave me chills. I watched most of the movie between my fingers...lol
B0087HT36U|5.0|Don't need too much excitement to escape reality.  The bombs take care of many issues at once'.  I am 76 and I like the challenge of doing in the bad guys and saving<br />The villagers.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Who knew that I'd like this so much? Not me. A friend told me to give this a try and I really liked it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have this app on my IPod Touch. I love it! It's a super fun, exciting game! Anyone who doesn't have this app should get this now!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Amazing CD by 3 guys. They still sound great after all these years.I could not be more impressed. Buy it!
0756407125|5.0|The hands down best book I have read in the last 5 years.  Possibly the best trilogy ever written besides LOTR, if the third book holds up.
B00006879E|5.0|Really good CD. Too bad these guys did not stick with this kind of music instead of going way too poppy.
B006O2QNOU|2.0|slow to develop, and It lost my attention at various parts of the movie due to its extended scenes of conversation that bored me
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|I liked this movie. 2nd remake of this film. Kurt Russell in the 1st Remake was also good. John Carpenter film.  James Arness as the creature in the original Bl & Wh film, also really good.  Very rare to find 2 remakes & original, all good.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|great comedy,  only one cuss word, which wasn't necessary, but good suspense, and believable,  great cast that seemed to fit together.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Great musical drama by Swayze & Grey. A feel good movie for the ages. Great dancing & great music along with a good story & good character actors.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Played with this for a few days on Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Enjoyed it - when it worked.  Crashed frequently.  Straw that broke the camel's back was when all the placed pieces on the puzzle I was working on disappeared altogether.  All that was left was the pieces I hadn't placed.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  Deleted!
B004LWZW6K|2.0|This was the lamest of these films. Of course if all you like is Tits & Ass than watch away. Nothing else about this movie is any good at all.
0194579808|5.0|I always recommend this grammar to everyone who is learning English. The examples are clear and there are sections regarding topics that are usually hard for English as a second language students (Present Perfect vs Past Simple, for example). There are also good exercises for each topic, that help the student practice the concepts. If you are an English Teacher you MUST have this material.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|The only things better then this CD/DVD package is seeing Paul and his band live, which I have done three times!<br /><br />This is a must have for any Beatles, Wings, Paul fan. A collectors item!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It just wasn't as good as the first books. I'm not sure what changed, but this one didn't do it for me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|WOW - how can you even begin to describe this series??  I can't even fathom the time and money spent filming this amazing look at our planet.  It was an undertaking of monumental proportions, and they definitely lived up to the task.  I ought to be able to go on and on about it, but it's too fantastic to put into words.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany should have been nominated for an Emmy (or six) for her roles on this exciting, high concept show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy to play, simple, and fun. Can't go wrong with an easy puzzler. Graphics are simple, but so is the game.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Very reminiscent of his Beatles days. Both my husband and I love this CD. Paul McCartney has always been one of my favorites!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Phone and Kindle Fire can't do everything computers can for example the 3 extra plays but is a fun game
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I don't know what all the negative reviews are for this is an a well put together app and beautifully designed I give it 10 stars and 2 thumbs up
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A real fun puzzle. Will spend way too much time trying to figure this out. I hope I can stop soon
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|4 STARS IF USED WITH NETFLIX, ETC ONLY.  I.e. ONLINE STREAMED MEDIA.  0 STARS IF YOU WANTED TO BE ABLE TO STREAM YOUR STORED MOVIE MP4 FILES FROM A HDD CONNECTED TO YOUR WIRELESS MODEM. THAT WOULD BE COOL AND, BELIEVE ME, IT IS COMING.  THE ONE WHO FIRST MAKES THIS ITEM WILL MAKE A FORTUNE. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL TO HAVE DVDs & BLURAYS IN MP4 FILE FORMAT. THOSE STORED ON A HDD AND STREAMED WIRELESSLY FROM YOUR WIRELESS MODEM DIRECTLY TO THIS DEVICE PLUGGED INTO YOUR TV'S EXTRA HDMI PORT.....PRICELESS. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT GOOGLE IS A BRILLIANTLY RUN COMPANY & THAT THIS IDEA IS IN THIS CHROMECAST PRODUCT'S  FUTURE. THE FIRST TO DO THIS WILL RULE.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|love love love pretty much all of philippa gregory's books! this one was no exception. if you like historical fiction this is a must read
B000022TSY|5.0|I only purchased movies &#34;Easy Rider & One False Move&#34;.  They both were clear & easy to watch. Thank you.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This was an amazing book! I loved all the Harry Potter books and this one didn't disappoint. It's not a very uplifting book but was extremely well written and totally draws you in. I liked how there was no main protagonist or antagonist. Everyone had their good/bad qualities which is what made them so real! I've recommended it to all my friends!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Suits is a really fun, witty, lighthearted show.  While I can't speak for the factual accuracy, I think the stories are very well written and the actors give excellent performances.  At the heart of it is a great story about relationships and how it defines us all.  I watched one episode and couldn't stop.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Interesting geographically and botanically, but far from captivating.  It's an OK read, but not one that draws the reader in.
B00DXLO0D6|3.0|I didn't love that the discs are just stacked together in the packaging. It's not like other dvd sets where each disc has its own space. They're just stacked on top of each other, so it's a little bit of a pain to get them in and out. The DVD's work great, but the packaging was a disappointment.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is so frustrating. I tried to load it on my Kindle Fire HD bought in Feb of 2013 and it won't work.  It says it downloaded, but when we try to play it, it runs through its intro and then keeps saying the server is not available. So I uninstalled and retried about 6 times.  Still nothing.  Now I've got one of the Oct 2013 edition Kindle Fire HD's and tried to load it on that and the same thing keeps happening.  I'm at a loss as to how to fix it.  Very disapointing as it looks like almost everyone else is having success with it.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I have been a Tom Keifer fan since the 80s when he played in local bars in the Philly area.  If you are expecting to hear the &#34;old&#34; Cinderella voice, you may be disappointed.  However, I love the CD because to me it sounds more like Tom should now that he had throat issues.  Great backup singers on this CD as well.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Decades after its creation this still feels fresh/non-dated. One of those movies you quote lines from years later. My favorite: &#34;Curiosity killed the cat you know?&#34;
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is the best granny game!!! My grandson and his friend spent a whole afternoon at my house and they never moved off of the couch.  They loved this game, they are 10 and took turns each time a game was finished.  It is a good child pleaser and I love trying it, though I am not as good at it. Really a lot of fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept my interest all the way till the end.  A story I was not quite expecting.  Even once you find out what the secret is, there are still some surprises in store.
B004JK61K0|2.0|Didn't care for it, so I took it off my Kindle. Sorry I guess we cant like them all. I may not have tried it long enough.  Sorry
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is very good. It does exactly what it says, maybe even a little more. I am mostly doing this because it was telling me to, but I would still recommend it. Best free alarm clock ever!!! If you are looking to get one, get this one.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|My grandson plays this game and is so good at it.  I try it, but guess children have a quick hand and Grandma doesn't anymore.  I still have fun trying .  Check out this fun game.
B001MM28JG|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies. Funny, witty, science fiction. What more can you ask for?! Maybe some free popcorn to go with?!
B00881VLCE|4.0|If you like puzzles...this is for you.  I like them that I don't have to have a place to put them on my table or where ever in the house, and they don't take up a lot of room.  So nice...just play and don't have to pick up all the pieces. Try it....its fun.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Excellent book! Strong plot, well-conceived, smooth writing. Granted I love these kinds of techno-thrillers but this was at the top of the genre. Excellent blending of real and virtual worlds.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, also highly recommend Daemon which is also at the top of the genre.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|How I remember the Dead in their hey day and my youth! Great versions of some classic songs. But it's the DVD that blew me away! I went to high school on the lower east side from 1969-1973 and saw them countless times during that period at places like the Academy of Music, the Fillmore, etc. Really brought me back in time!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I didn't expect much from this movie but turned out to be a excellent movie. I loved the special effect and the Mech's seemed real.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The movie is what it is and I am not going to review it. I purchased the HD stream from Instant Video. For the FIRST time ever, I had one minor issue with Amazon's Instant Video service and that was this movie had very low volume. I had to turn my TV up to 100% volume when I usually watch things at around 20% volume.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset 6 months ago. It is very comfortable, has great audio quality both in and out and the range is much further than I expected. The only issue was some drop outs that were caused by my wireless router being right next to the computer which was easily resolved. Anyway, it worked great for about 4 months then suddenly the microphone didnt work. It was horrible having to go back to my old wired headset but that regression was very short lived. Within days of contacting Logitech I had a brand new headset without paying any shipping or processing fees and the new one works great.
B004UID2LC|5.0|A wonderful app that the Tab or I-pad couldn't have.  That makes me carrying the Kindle everywhere without complaining its weight which is a bit more than other devices.  Anyway, more short videos are expect to come.  Thanks a lot for adding more favors on the top of plain book reading.
B009A87X80|5.0|Cassidy is one of the best vocalists of all time.  She is as good as Judy Collins, in Collins' prime.  Wonderful record.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Very nice package and music sounds great. Nice quality. I recommend this box set for anyone and everyone. Love it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love the case because it keeps it safe from dust.  I can always locate my earpiece at any given time.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|The main character, who we live with on every page, I just wanted to smack upside the head and tell him to pull up his socks and stop his sniveling. Even though his life explodes, tragically, I did not care about him, found him exhausting and annoying. Almost stopped reading the book a few times, because he was so un compelling a character.  The characters of Boris and Hobie, help the book greatly, would have stopped reading if not for them. But in the end, while beautifully written at times, this book is a long slog that doesn't deliver anything I found of value.
B0047747A6|1.0|I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM -- I NEED TO KNOW WHEN THIS ITEM WAS ORDER AND WHERE IT WAS SHIPPED --- I WILL GET WITH THE BANK AND HAVE THIS INVESTIGATED
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so much fun. It has everything I love to do cook and play. I recommend that you need to get this game.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|I think you will find this CD to your liking he does a good job on the standards like \\"You Don't Know Me\\", Try a Little Tenderness\\" and Quando Quando. If you like him you should enjoy the CD.
B00C7607FS|4.0|We had fond memories of The Little Mermaid and this new Blu-Ray release brought many of those good memories back.  At the same time, we were struck by how modern computer-generated animation has so leap-frogged the earlier hand-animated graphics that we found ourselves seeing the contrast throughout the movie.  Still, well worth owning and viewing, especially for young kiddos and grandchildren who are not familiar with the story.  Buy it and smile.
B000088E6D|4.0|He always produces a good CD some great some not so great this was good. Worth adding to your collection.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Not sure why others did not like this because it was a good read.  I have yet to be disappointed by a Dan Brown book.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I thought the CD was terrific, I enjoyed the old songs but not the new ones. He does a fantastic job on the old Jackie Wilson song &#34;To Be Loved'. I had that song on repeat for a week. If you are a Michael Buble' fan you have to add this to your collection.
0312323867|5.0|The sequel to Something Borrowed. I love the story! Hope they make a movie out of this. Emily Giffin did a great job with the plot, and the characters are well-thought. Overall, in my top 10 list :)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Great character development coupled with an inability to guess the ending made for a terrific story, The author also has a way with dialogue.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks novels. And I love Josh Duhamel & Julianne Hough in this movie. Such a nice twist in the story. I didnt read the book yet but i was hoping to read it even after seeing the movie. Another kudos to Sparks' creative perspective! The last part gave me goosebumps :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The best trilogy since The Hunger Games....possibly better! My middle school students are completely addicted to these characters. We are sad the series has ended.
B00BX8PG4S|4.0|Outstanding interpretation of ED Harris. Few external scenes, rendering the film a little static. Certain passages of the film a little boring to the spectator.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|What an incredible game. I purchased this game for my son originally, but I CAN'T get enough of this game. It can be quite addictive. Highly recommended.
B000FCK65W|3.0|This read was a selection for my book club for the month of September from High School Reading list.  It was a slow read and I had to force myself to get through it literally and I am a avid reader.  All in all it was a good coming of age story once you were able to get past half the book.  It is definitely for a young high school student and very difficult for an adult.  Yet, once you get through it is heartwarming and bring you to tears.
B005HED08I|4.0|The visuals look great! The updated effects compliment the classic stories.  Watching the interplay between Kirk and Spock makes understand why the series has delighted fans for nearly 50 years.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a wonderful book. The writing was just pure beauty. But the feels, oh the feels. I want to write more, but readers i fear i might just spoil it for you. So i end with this, if you are in search of a beautifully written, relatable, creatively detailed, wonder of book as i was, this is a book for any age. I hope you enjoy this as much as I and many others did.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie could have been so bad,  but was actually pretty good.  When there's only one comic book superhero in a movie it's easier to suspend disbelief and buy into the 'logic' of that character's world.  I.e. Bruce Banner with his mutated DNA, or Thor in Asgard where gravity follows different rules.  So,  to mash 4 disparate worlds together in a way that doesn't make anyone over the age of 12 groan was quite a feat.  The character interactions were 'adult' in the sense that they seemed believable.  I.e. They don't team up right away or with no friction (some big egos there).  They had to have a reason to which is how things usually work in the real life.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Not bad. Regular piece of super-heroes movie. Met expectations for this kind of block buster. Neither disappointed nor over enthusiastic.
B0063M22QO|3.0|The game is challenging enough and it helps you to recognize details.  Keeps you focused.  You can pick up the game at anytime and continue from where you left off.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Ran down battery on my Kindle very quickly. Many times, alarm would not go off due to battery drain. Uninstalled, now battery life is fine.
B003Y3GZZY|5.0|It his is actually my second pair. I bought a pair in 2012 and had to buy another just in case they stopped making it. I've worn the first pair for two summers now and will wear them again next year. These are the most comfortable sandals I've ever worn. And I wore these everyday during the summer and I mean everyday for hours on end. The color is more of a smoke/dark gray than black on the straps but it went well with everything I wore. Pretty much true size. I usually wear a size 8 or 8 1/2 and I bought a size 8. Fit was great. Comfort was great. Feet do not sweat . Thought I point that out because I've been asked that. Also sandals do not get hot in the sun. At least not for me. I've gone swimming and left them out. Put them on and did not burn my feet. That brings me to the next point. There not that many comfortable sandals you can wear that can get wet and not be ruined or uncomfortable because they are wet. These get wet and still feel great. Wear them in the sand just rinse them really quick and let it air dry.
B005PK1G76|2.0|While I do like the fact that you can adapt the organizer to any stroller, it is not only very small, it's very flimsy and you cannot use the drink holders one-handed.  I have to hold the cup holder open and stabilize the whole unit to put the drink in.  And then it swings backwards and if the cup is full, it spills out the top.  I didn't recommend this to my friend who was waiting for me to receive mine before she ordered one for herself.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|An assortment of style. Sweet to raunchy. Great beat! &#34;Adore You&#34; is one of my favorites. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire for a long flight. Picked up the CD for home and the car. My new favorite!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Too hard to play unless you buy more stuff.  I can see why your company makes over 1/2 million $$ per day.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|This is, of course, a WWII movie.  Violent, vicious, horrible - as all wars are.  The primary interest should be in the Navajo Code Talkers, who, throughout the war, kept completely secret the code used, in the Navajo language - a code that was never once broken.<br />Code talkers were to be killed by their Marine 'buddies', rather than allowed to be taken and tortured for information.  The Marines whose duty this was had a horrible responsibility - and they were told outright NOT to make friends with the Navajo men assigned to them, because one day they might have to kill them;  to \\"save\\" their fellow soldiers.  How does one not become close in a war?  Impossible.<br />There is so very much horror in any war,  most of which our own civilians at home know absolutely nothing about.  How could we?<br />The first time I ever saw this movie, I was stunned - never once having even heard about the code-talkers and their invaluable service to a Country which had persecuted them for so many, many generations.  Still, they volunteered.  Still, they went and were barely commended for their bravery and service.<br />After seeing this film just once, I wrote to the Navajo Code Talkers Assn., (NCTA) to thank them.  My father and both uncles saw service, in Army, Navy and Air Force.  My elder brother was a Marine during the Korean war.  Only one Uncle saw active duty. The others did not.  In my email I thanked them, most humbly, for the amazing feats of bravery and loyalty they offered the Marin Corp.  Semper Fi, indeed.  They were such incredible heroes, along with - of course - many of our \\"regular\\" Marines.  Other units made up of \\"men of color\\" were also never acknowledged properly by this Country.  Shameful.  I was told by the NCTA my letter would be read aloud to the next gathering, which humbled me even more ... but it meant something to them.  I was not even born until 1949;  after WWII was over. But still ~<br />In my opinion , this movie has an amazing impact when you look at it from the code talker perception.  Otherwise, I believe Marines go into active-duty service knowing full well they will probably die.  At least that is what I have been led to believe over the years.  The Navajo Code Talkers did not know (despite what this movie conveys) there was little hope for them if they were injured or captured.<br />They deserve any honor they are FINALLY, after over fifty (50!) years, being given.  Finally, they are receiving recognition for their service.
0739341243|4.0|Interesting reading ... Susan encourages the world to take another look at the value of<br />folks who are not extraverts.
B005FPT51K|5.0|Very good system. I used it to monitor my elderly ill mother. The motion feature assured she would not wander.
B003ASLJO0|3.0|It's a movie.  It's Eastwood.  What more can one say?  I had seen it before, but hadn't liked it enough to add to the collection.  I wouldn't have bought it, but I had to watch it for a graduate counseling class and this was the easiest way (not having Netflix or other rent options handy).  Sociologically speaking, this movie is as much a study in the perpetuation of negative social behaviors seen as &#34;bonding&#34; processes (using slurs as terms of affection, etc.) as it is about changing how we view other cultures (aka the old war vet finding out the &#34;fishheads&#34; next door are actually good people).  Not going to get into that further.  I just needed to write more words before Amazon would accept the review.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|Excellent movie. My girls had a sleepover and this movie was chosen; it was a hit. It was nice not to have to worry about inappropriate content.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Absolutely brilliant and fantastic show.  I've heard some people saying they don't understand why people like a show about Walt when he turns into such a bad guy--but that's the point.  It's a show not about glorifying drugs or violence or glorifying a bad guy.  It's a show about making choices, and the effect that those choices have on us and those around us.  The character development on this show is fantastic and it is intriguing to watch each character make the choices that change his or her life for the better or the worse.  Since finishing the final season of the show, I can't stop thinking about it.  It is hands down, one of the best television shows I have ever seen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't review books very often any more, but this one is worth my time. It's been over a year since I read it, but the story stays with me. I've also read the prequels which were okay, but the Wool series was excellent. I really liked the writing style and the story telling was neat in that it didn't seem to follow a traditional path. I remember when I first started it was a little like reading a twilight zone story. You know something odd is going to happen, and it's kind of eerie, but you have no idea what. It seems a little hard to follow at first because it's as though you're starting a book in chapter 3. The writing is what keeps you going though, and thankfully so. I just read someone else's review headline about this series becoming a classic, and I think they're right.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|After wearing out my 3rd Nostromo I decided to try this out, and I've now been using, or trying to use this device for over 2 years.  I have never been able to get used to it.  I basically have 2 problems both boiling down to the complete lack of ergonomics in the design of the G13.  The thumb stick drives me absolutely crazy for 2 reasons, the position relative to the buttons (claw hand) and the awkwardness of using a thumb stick in games designed for button presses.<br /><br />One of the things I liked about the controller when I saw it online was that it had so many buttons, when playing MMOs you seem to never have enough so I figured more is better.  Not so much. Even after 2 years I struggle to hit the right buttons consistently which I attribute to the fact that they didn't put a home key bump on any of the keys.  With so many buttons, and with my eyes on the game, I lose track of where my hand is on the device.  Additionally reaching the far buttons is difficult, and next to impossible to reach while using the thumb stick.  Also having 2 rows of 7 buttons is a very odd choice because it really doesn't map to any UI implementation in the game universe that I can think of.<br /><br />Lastly, the LCD screen is nice eye candy, but it's not really very useful.  At least I can't find much of a use for it.  As I said before, I like to keep my eyes on the game not the controller.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a short novel that sets up a fantasy world with vivid three dimensional characters and a plot that grows stranger as it goes along. The reader finds himself living inside the mind of an unusually sensitive 7 year old boy and  sharing his terror about things he can't understand.  The twist at the end made me wish for a sequel!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis will always be my book boyfriend!!!  I have read and reread this book so many times I can't count!
B0060D11OU|5.0|How can anything be better than the classic Mary Poppins?  Every kid should grown up watching this innocent, classic show instead of the dark shows available today.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Great writing, great acting depicting a slice of humanity rarely portrayed with such honesty, and yet with enough humor to allow us to keep looking.
B00170GXQ2|4.0|My favorite story!  The film is rich wth symbolism and colorful displays of cimetography. Be careful though as there are sexual undertones through the movie if you are viewing with minors.
0812550757|4.0|A great start to a new era of ender.  The more mature and reflectfull book is still a good read
0307394549|5.0|the best cookie recipes Martha has ever put together1 my aunt turned me on to this book and I ordered it immediately. there are treats for all levels of baking skills and I find the recipes are easily adaptable if you so choose. every mom & kitchen baker should have this book!

B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|Amazing! Avril has grown as artist as a songwriter and as a person and as a new style icon! Avril doesn't take chances musically as well as her new style! She doesn't follow trends. She starts them! She's not afraid to just put herself out there and always does with incredible confidence! Anyone can either like her or hate her but her fearless confidence makes her unique and that's what makes her avril! It's who she always been and always will be! Go avril!
B003Y74AZ2|4.0|This silicone case fits nicely on my iPhone 4s. I like the back swirl designs, I think it may provide good traction when on hard surfaces but the silicone material does not stick in my pocket material or my cell phone holsters. The only negative thought that I had was the fitting of this case to my phone, I feel like it could be more snug. Overall this is still a good product and I would recommend this to a friend.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I bought this CD and was pretty excited to play it. Right away I loved it. Each song is totally different from the others and I just really appreciate this CD. She is pretty wild and I love her for it!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Well worth the money its a great value. Played the console version and enjoyed it a lot and I'm enjoying this version just as much. Takes a little time to get used to the controls would recommend doing the tutorial before jumping right into the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yes this game has been fun. , even though frastrating :) I find myself up all hours , I do like this app
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This show keeps getting better. The episodes about the abduction were fantastic. The show is a great mix of comedy and crime drama.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MINECRAFT IS AWESOME!!!!! Ive always wanted minecraft and now that I got it I know it's worth the seven dollars. The visual graphics are awesome. You can be as creative as you want. AND there are new updates all the time. It's very addictive. You'll never want to put your device down. It's great for kids and I highly recommend buying this app.
B00ERIUO02|2.0|I liked Katy's earlier CDs much better than this one. Other than Roar, which is a great track, the rest were pretty average.<br /><br />The idea of adding little bits of rap to songs comes across as if the recording company is trying to cast as wide an audience net as possible but, to me did not add anything to the songs. Probably pretty good album for Blue Light Disco's and kids parties to get them up and dancing.<br /><br />As a person who really likes to understand the message the songwriter puts into the lyrics, this album just didn't cut it for me.
B003GK22PW|4.0|Great Plot. Clever twists. Typical Ken Follett just a tad lighter than usual. Loved the insight into the art side as well. Great light reading

0451169514|5.0|What's not to like about ANY Stephen King novel....This is suspenful and scary and is set in rural Maine; actually it is Bangor Maine but not called as such in the book,
B000FDECGA|5.0|simply doesn't get any better than this...i have not seen a more visually stunning film,  great effects and the dub is not that bothersome
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I am not quite finished reading &#34;Malala&#34;, but it truly interesting and heartbreaking to see what she endured; her words are articulate.  She's a very mature young lady to be so young.  I amlooking forward to finishing the book!
B0040QYROK|5.0|I've been a fan of this movie for a long time and have the previous version from a few years ago that was thought to be the most complete, but it was still missing almost 25 minutes.  I was so happy to see that an almost complete version was located in Argentina.  I am very happy with this version and have watched it twice in just the two weeks I've had it.  Great restoration.  Well worth the purchase.  Now that I've seen the complete version, it makes more sense and is much easier to follow.  The soundtrack is also excellent.  Definitely worth the money.
0316322407|5.0|Why? You'd have to read it yourself to know. There is no other way to understand the level of love that is expressed in this book.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|I Bought This Movie For My Daughter And My Daughter Loves This Movie. She Loves The Music, Singing And Dancing.
159420411X|5.0|Stunning analysis, very intelligent descriptions about challenging events, and best of all done with language and details that are easily understood (with the exception of a couple scatterplot charts that could use better explanation of the X & Y axis).
1742204147|5.0|A must have if you plan on a visit to Japan. It has a very detailed itinerary plan, complete with how much time to allocate to a place. Even has notes on some detours on your way, so you get to enjoy something special that not all people knew about. The suggestions on stay and food given at each destination is just truly brilliant. They have put a lot of thought about the traveler when writing these, whether it be about bicycle rentals or nearest train stations, its quite a complete guide. It's mostly text and maps, not as picturesque as other guides. But no complaints there !
B003M70O5O|5.0|As with most series, characters are developed so even better than first season. Characters have relatable human qualitys even though their livlihood is criminal . Viewers route for them and not authorities.
B005LAII9O|5.0|Just a great movie- really enjoy watching it.  I love the &#34;Metal & Wood&#34;.  It's a movie to get lost in as well as become aware of some pretty scary things that happens. I like the &#34;happy&#34; part of life and agree with living in this concept, but never to hurt…I DO REALIZE this is a &#34;movie&#34;.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Very good Show. Smart, entertaining, and fun. I think it speaks to the &#34;nerd&#34; in all of us. Great Season.
B00866JL96|5.0|I can watch this many times over…Beautiful scenery and actors.  Well written, can't go wrong with Nicolas Sparks.  Love the Louisiana setting - my home.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Best show ever! The Big Bang Theory is funny, entertaining, and smart. The first early season were magic, I think it has drifted a bit and turned some of the characters in to caricatures of themselves.
039916409X|5.0|Because I totally trust the author and I believe it's unique in its kind like my courses. EFT is my tool.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Entertaining. It is a bit addictive and you can loose track of time but it works well and I have never encountered any glitches.
006202406X|2.0|The ending was weak and lackluster.  I found myself skipping whole sections to get to the end, I was so hopeful for a cool end to the saga... but it was pretty bad.  With the new movie coming out for the first one... I can't imagine them making all three movies with this book so lackluster.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Excellent! One of the best books ever written and this adaptation BY FAR got it right. So many later adaptations missed the boat.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|So funny. You would never know that it is an older movie. Great hslloween movie for kids who want a movie tgat us a little scary.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I found Magic Jigsaw Puzzles to be fun,relaxing and entertaining. The music provides a nice touch.The graphics are beautiful. Easy to use.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman creates universes. Every one of his novels is unique, and this one is no exception. Any one who remembers the.bittersweetnesss of childhood, anyone who had ever dreamed of adventure, would enjoy this beautiful tale.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|great story, characters are amazing, edge of seat suspense!<br />Love Jeffrey Archer's stories, kept me going til the end, was not sure what would happen  next!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|There are not enough words to explain what a great series this is. Season two features great settings such as NYC Fashion Week, the Arctic, the mummy exhibit and even lets Castle try to convince Beckett that vampires are real. A really solid season.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game you should definatly get this game really good graphics very adicting good good good good good awesome awesome game
B00BSBR9N6|3.0|It was funny but I didn't love the book.  The premise seemed a bit unrealistic to me.  I did enjoy the characters.
B00AH6ATMG|1.0|I only received 1 song, I have attempted several attempts and one song for $8, this is outrageous!!! Really stupid!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I was not a fan of Em, however, I respected the work. After getting an opportunity to listen to the complete album for free, I became a fan for the rest of my life. The lyrics can be disturbing but I am sure it's nothing that the majority of people haven't thought of already. Marshall has been through a lot and I empathize on many levels with the tribulations he endured and endures now. For people who don't like it, you will be missing out because this is a piece of art by an artist who has continually exposed his self like a raw nerve. I am sure this album will win a grammy or two. It already flushed out Lady Gaga and Katy Perry album's this year. Looks like Eminem and Miley Cyrus made it their year. Literally.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while!  Written in a style that is so interesting!  So easy to relate to all characters!<br />I actually had a problem reading the ending, because I couldn't see through my tears.  Yet I was not depressed upon finishing this book.  Highly recommend!

B006GECE9Y|2.0|I couldn't download it from my Kindle. I had to use a computer to download it then I emailed it to myself,then I downloaded a download manager and managed to get it working from there. It needs a better video player, there are still too many types it doesn't play but it is much better than Silk which is next to useless.
1891252089|4.0|Amazing book. Clarity through brevity. Swenson is detailed but concise and offers welcome options and alternatives to Primary Series postures. My only complaint is that the spiral bounding could have had a large diameter as the pages can get caught on one another as you turn them.
B007N3GZ9C|5.0|Both informative and inspirational. I had a TIA (small stroke) just before I read it, and, though recovered, I know the other shoe can drop at any time.
1250038820|5.0|I loved every page of this book.  I am a great lover of New York and looking at this book brings back some wonderful memories.<br />I will always treasure it and if I ever feel a bit down just look through Humans Of New York and will have a smile on my face in no time.<br />Joan Sutherland

B00DJWV11I|5.0|I could not stop laughing.  I loved every minute and was so upset when it was over.  Fantastic read.  Highly recommend
B004PAHZMC|4.0|Got this for my 4 year old son. He actually picked it out because he loves Lego Star Wars. This is a fun little &#34;box&#34; for storing and playing with Legos. He does unzip it and use it as a mat. It holds a lot of Legos.
0385350864|5.0|Loved it.  *Loved* it.  Bridget is exactly how I pictured her decades later, struggling with the same questions we all do -- work, relationships, coping with life and technology.  I stayed up until 2am to finish it, and bawled for the last 30 pages.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I love Christina Perri's music. This entire CD is full of ballads and quirky songs that showcase the strong voice of Perri. I hadn't heard of many of the songs prior to buying the CD. Now I love almost every one on the CD.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the book but felt it dragged.  A lot of the things written were mundane.  Excellent story line but didn't capture me like normally this authors books do
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Cute little movie. I enjoyed this movie when my kids were very little, and we still enjoy watching it together now that they are in upper elementary school. Great witty lines. Great music. :)
B00170GXQ2|1.0|This movie is total garbage and is insulting to one of the best books I have ever read. Steer clear.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies!! I watch this every year with my kids. It has become a great tradition. This DVD is great quality!
B0060MYK7G|3.0|moves slow, must be the general story.  Enjoyed Henry VIII alot more.  The story seems to drag at times.  sorry
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|ALBUM OF THE YEAR! Possibly my favorite LADY GAGA album. Album cover is beautiful. Music is amazing. Gaga can do no wrong~
B00BD99JMW|2.0|There were so many ways she could have gone with this. The last two books were disappointing. Even the main character was only partly likable in my opinion.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Great intense movie. Was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. Very rarely does a movie grab my full attention. You should buy this movie. You will enjoy it.
B00BBQXUYK|4.0|Now I'm 25 so it's hard to enjoy kids movies as my age increases but I bought this movie for my niece. She loved it so much we watched it 3 time in a row... So thanks Dreamworks and Amazon for wasting half my day. ;-)
B001974DG0|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It is a real page turner and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  This is truly on of the best books I've read, by any author, in a long time.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Its been a long time since I enjoyed a CD as much as this one. Every song, and I mean every song, is good, better than good actually. I've enjoyed Clutch before, Blast Tyrant my favorite, but this is easily their best. I would say a certain song is best, but that would do disservice to the rest. It will be my &#34;go-to&#34; CD for the near future.
B000ZIYJ2C|5.0|My 2 daughters (10&6) and I love this movie! My oldest daughter has been asking to watch it but I wasn't able to find it anywhere else, thank God amazon has it so we ended up purchasing it and I'm glad I did, we watch it over and over again...<br />Very entertaining movie with a great message!
B00G32VYDG|3.0|It did remind me of MIB in a way.  There were some funny things in it.  The alternative identities were very funny. Good cast, story was ok.  Good movie to just relax with.
0525423842|5.0|I am an adult but have loved this series.  I have read nearly all John Grisham's books. Thanks a lot
B00571F26Y|5.0|Eye opening, lifestyle changing book. The change was easier than I would have guessed. The benefits and speed of transformation were amazing for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will want to make you keep reading. You will be on the edge of your seat the whole time
1476727651|5.0|Love King! He is the best novelist there is. I will get his next novel too. Just love his work.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Overall I liked this book.  Was hoping them main character would escape.  Was looking for a better plot.  I may read the second book.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was interested in the first two books, but once I read the third one I wish I hadn't. The story was very repetitive and the ending was disappointing. I wouldn't advise anyone to read this series. A waste of money truthfully.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Simple easy game play, a lot like the original Facebook game. Quite a bit more stream lined, I like it!
B002BTT0OA|5.0|because the blessed trinity series was great reading. the books touch on some real life experience and testimony. You can relate to someone in your life or church family in the books. Keep up  the excellent writing and I will keep buy and reading your books
B00CP4RZCU|3.0|Nothing special.  As a long time BLS fan this was just a lot of what I already had put together on two disks.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|Good concept but not overly challenging or original. Good attempt to combine popular puzzle elements with angry birds. Didn't really hold my attention after a few days.
B00FQPHOPI|4.0|Superman, R.I.P.  This movie is an excelent  peice of movie makeing, but it shows how old and worn out &#34;Superman&#34; realy is.  Of course it's popular--it's one of the best made movies of the year,but it also shows how Superman is something that has lost its meaning over time. I ejoyed the movie, as an action thriller it works, but as I push 60, I see that 'Superman' needs to at least retire, or die, for the last and final time. It's time for 'Son of Superman' or 'daughter of Superman'. If you want to engage modern twens, give them something they can relate to!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|For $4.99 it is well worth having Word, Excel, powerpoint and Access on my Kindle Fire HD.  I use it all the time.
0823023494|5.0|I honestly had low expectations for this book but WOW this was amazing! It was awesome to see the different view points of other artist that were featured in his book. The designs are great and the author made it so that he was talking to YOU, the person who wants to learn, and not just another step by step book other art books have done. I highly recommend this book!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Steve Blank is great mentor and all that him Bob say in the book makes so much sense. It is a must read for all wannabe Successful Startup Owners.

B003PUZ2NW|4.0|&#34;It's over Johnny....it's over!&#34;  What else is there to say? Stallone, guns and some quality acting makes it a classic movie.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|first I thought this game was a total rip off because u write the stuff you create but then I got super fun even when someone finishes the whole game even throne solar extra you can play in a playground you can even start over I finished the game and I love it still so you should totally get it because it is so awesome sauce.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Amazing beats, beautiful songs. The song Dope made me lose my s*** in more than one occasion. A+ music, can't wait to hear live performances.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Amazing true story of how two completely different people for two distinct backgrounds can save each other without even knowing they are doing it.  We have shown this to our friends and family....including out teenage Granddaughters and everyone loves it.<br />It is now my favorite movie.  I can easily watch it once a month.

B0075LTOR2|5.0|I have noticed a trend lately for CD boxsets collecting rock bands and artists' entire outputs.  Usually these are monster boxes costing well over a hundred dollars, seeing as how the more established rock acts have been playing since the time of Thutmose III.  Roxy Music is an exception however seeing as how they only released eight official studio albums and had the good sense to quit while they were ahead and not turn into one of those sad Dinosaur Rock Bands (Please God, don't prove me wrong).  This set collects - as it says right on the box - all of Roxy Music's studio-recorded output (I guess it would have been too much to put \\"Viva!\\" in there, or maybe they are secretly plotting to release a live boxset to milk more of our money mwahahaha).  Even though I'm sure most of you reading have already listened to a good swath of Roxy - this was clearly made with the established fan in mind - let me do a quick rundown of all eight Roxy Music albums anyway for the odd shopper who may have stumbled onto this page either out of interest or confusion and wants to know whether they want to buy music from a band they have never heard.  Let's go album by album:<br /><br />Roxy Music (1972) - This self-titled debut is all over the place.  Propulsive progressive *ROCK* is mixed with crooning love songs and experimental art stuff.  Some of it is kind of weird but danceable and rockin' at the same time.  Oh yeah, and this is the only band where you'll hear rock OBOE.  Yeah!  5/5<br /><br />For Your Pleasure (1973) - This just might be the greatest Roxy Music album ever.  Actually, this is one of the best rock albums ever, period.  It's certainly better than anything that was ever done by more ballyhooed bands like The Beatles.  Did John Lennon ever sing a creepy ode to an inflatable doll?  I didn't think so.  There is some real kick-ass Rock Guitar on here courtesy of Phil Manzenera (a criminally underrated guitarist).  This album gets it right with Experimental *ROCK*.  One ofthe greatest albums ever.  5/5<br /><br />Stranded (1973) - Apparently Roxy Music was like \\"Highlander\\" and there could Be Only One Brian/Bryan in the group, so Brian Eno is gone now and lead singer Bryan Ferry rules the roost.  A good bit of the experimental energy of the last two albums is still here though so we get awesome rockers like \\"Serenade\\" mixed with arty slow burners like \\"A Song For Europe\\" and... a 9 minute Jesus song?  5/5<br /><br />Country Life (1974) - Yeah, it's the one with the two German chicks on the cover that got the prudes all a fluster back in the day (\\"The female body?  Oh NOOOOOS!\\") but people should remember this for being a damn good rock album with some classic songs.  How did \\"All I Want Is You\\" not become a huge hit?  \\"Prairie Rose\\" is the greatest song about Texas I have ever heard.  And - Good Lord, another Jesus song?  What?  5/5<br /><br />Siren (1975) - No Jesus songs.  But you do get a more laid-back, melancholy Roxy album.  This is the perfect Roxy Music album for a rainy day, actually.  There are a couple of upbeat songs on here but \\"Siren\\" is mostly low-key and that's okay.  \\"Love Is The Drug\\" is the big hit from this one but for some reason I have been listening to a lot of \\"Nightingale\\" and \\"Just Another High\\" lately.  5/5<br /><br />Manifesto (1979) - In the long stretch between the last album and this one Disco came to rule the radio and punk came along to try and kill it.  Some call this the \\"Disco Roxy Album\\" but it's not (the dancing mannequins on the front don't help).  There are some disco-flavored tunes on here but they are given the classic experimental Roxy Treatment (the first half of this album almost feels like an early Roxy album). Ferry and the gang thus effectively kill disco by mutating it into something more musically palatable.  So Roxy Music accomplish what all the punks could not.  Oh, and the band gets all Otis on us with \\"Cry Cry Cry\\".  Overall not as good as the previous five efforts but still worth your time.  4/5<br /><br />Flesh + Blood (1980) - No, not the 80s Paul Verhoeven medieval violence-fest movie, although it would be interesting to watch that movie while listening to this ala Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz.  This \\"Flesh + Blood\\" is very subdued and synthy.  It is the weakest spot in Roxy Music's catalogue although it's not really bad it's merely... okay.  Sometimes things get a little dull but the awesomeness of some of the songs - including the title track and \\"No Strange Delight\\" pull it through.  Oh, and this is the only Roxy album with cover songs - \\"In The Midnight Hour\\" is so lounge-lizard bad that it's hilarious and \\"Eight Miles High\\" is... well, I have never been a big Byrds fan so I really don't have much of an opinion on that one.  3/5<br /><br />Avalon (1982) - When I was younger (five or so years ago?) I used to deride this album as \\"nothing more than make-out music for 40 year olds\\".  Well, after some maturing and listening to \\"Avalon\\" again after getting this boxset I have changed my opinion:  it is AWESOME make-out music for 40 year olds.  I really liked the soundscapes produced by this album - beautiful and spacious, like the album cover.  Sure, sometimes things get a little cheesy (like on the title track) and the experimentalism of the early years is gone (although there are enough moments to remind you what band you are dealing with here) but overall `tis a step up from the last album and a good way to end a recording career.  Now where are the older ladies for me to get it on with?  4/5<br /><br />In addition there are two bonus discs with every Roxy Music single and B-Side.  Some (like \\"Virginia Plain\\" and Bryan Ferry's cover of Lennon's \\"Jealous Guy\\") are essential while some (most of the B-Sides) are not.  All are worth listening to at least once.<br /><br />The sound on this boxset is very good, although not a huge step up from the old Warner/Reprise CDs that I already owned.  The sound is a little more clear and it sounds like tape hiss has been eliminated but that's it - these discs are flat transfers just as those Warner discs were so there is no weird EQ stuff going on and no artificial compression/brickwalling stuff to make it painfully loud or what have you.  What you hear is what you get.  Some of the early albums sound rather bright but I suspect that that's just how they were recorded.<br /><br />This boxset is classy and no-frills.  There is no booklet.  There are no lyrics sheets (even though three of the albums originally came with them).  This doesn't bug me though as I can look up band info and lyrics on the internet.  All of the mini gatefold CD sleeves fit snugly (but not overly so) into a black inner box fitting itself into an elegant black outer box.  The individual albums *can* be kind of a pain to get out sometimes though so you may want to just ditch the inner box and put all of the individual albums into the outer box.<br /><br />Overall I love this set.  Could they have put \\"Viva!\\" in there?  Sure, but I'm not gonna cry over it.  If you have any of the previous CDs I recommend getting this:  not only does it have a good, flat CD transfer but for the first time \\"Manifesto\\" is available with the original album versions of \\"Angel Eyes\\" *and* \\"Dance Away\\" (all other CD incarnations had replaced one or both of them with the single versions).  If you have never owned any Roxy Music albums I still recommend it seeing as how the band never put out a bad album and made some virtuoso rock music that influences rock music to this day.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It's the greatest Christmas movie ever, period. It's a shame it was made before the digital era, HD and BluRay.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|easy to use and works greats. i'm not sure about the why it measures the ambient light from the room, but the images look great.
1556347308|5.0|Excellent, easy to follow guide for the GM, with clear examples and great color art. A vast improvement from the 3rd edition. Just about everything you could hope for in a GM's guide, with minimal errata. A must-have companion book to Gurps 4e Basic Set: Characters.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|Sorry folks, more summaries of the story lines have been published here already so this review will focus only upon the quality of the movie's transfer to blu ray.  Only 1 disc in this Blu Ray package.  I do wish Amazon would separate the Standard Def reviews from the Instant Download reviews from the Blu Ray reviews.  It would greatly help those who are trying to find qualitative<br />reviews focusing on what they hope to read.<br /><br />VIDEO....Watching the video on a new Panasonic ZT 65\\" Plasma set was an epiphany of incredible color grading.  Blacks are as deep and dark as you can possibly get to true black without that hint of grey found in so many discs and other monitors.  Colors literally pop off the screen with dynamic force and details, even in the darkest of areas are outstandingly produced.  At no point did I see even the slightest hint of artifacting and even though the CGI moments, of which there are many, are present and clearly discernible, they actually contribute to the graphic novel feel of this film.  On another note, when I first saw this movie on a rental disc I didn't care for it.  Then I bought the Standard Def DVD on a big sale and liked it a whole lot more.  Now on Blu Ray, and still at a $7.99 price at Walmarts, I am very happy to have this film in my Blu Ray collection.  It's funny how opinions can change after a few viewings.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is top of the line.  Not only is the dialogue clear and transparent but the audio editors made full use of the entire 5.1 audio system with a great amount of discreet channeling to the front and rear side speakers.  I watched it on a 7.1 system with the 6 & 7th channel muxed from the rear signals to create a greater audio immersion but even with a 5.1 system, which is what most folk have, you will not be disappointed in the dynamic audio mix.  Your LFE sub channel will be put to use throughout the film as well with deep, guttural bottom end.<br /><br />EXTRAS...<br />  While I have yet to watch these on the blu ray disc, they appear to be the same as was on the Standard Def DVD.<br /><br />I do hope this type of review has been of assistance and help to you in deciding your purchase as all my reviews focus solely upon a Blu Ray's transfer quality.<br />Thanks for reading.TRAS...<br />  While I have yet to watch these on the blu ray disc, they appear to be the same as was on the Standard Def DVD.<br /><br />I do hope this type of review has been of assistance and help to you in deciding your purchase as all my reviews focus solely upon a Blu Ray's transfer quality.<br />Thanks for reading.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|If you have a problem with \\"Artpop\\", then you're ticked off that she has 2 songs collaborating with rap musicians.  Now, I am not a rap fan but of the two songs, \\"Jewels and Drugs\\" and \\"Do What you Want\\", I think the collaboration works best on \\"Do What You Want\\".  Now I have seen some criticisms about this album which seems to say, \\"Gee, she's not doing constant THUMP-A-THUMP-A-THUMP, she's horrible/I'm not going to buy her stuff anymore\\".  Really? Are you that shallow?  A lot of artists who change their style, usually fail, but I think that Gaga has improved with this album. I went in with this purchase without hearing any of the music, solely based on her previous albums.  I'm glad that I took the chance.  I can look forward to Gaga's future work with great expectations.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Would not properly download, so I was never able to play the game making very hard to review. Don't waste your time.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Really moving and sung and performed with emotion. Great story telling. He sings from the heart and conveys the feelings of the song and words. The bands provide good accompaniment to his voice. The pain of life and his age shows in his voice which has lost its strength and youth but makes up for this with passion and raw feeling. Well recommended even if you are not a fan of Johnny Cash.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is very cool and a very inexpensive way to stream to a television. My only issue is that my wife would prefer a remote and not have to rely on a smartphone or tablet, neither of which she possesses.
B000OT6UZQ|5.0|Excellent story. Steamy sex scenes and hot hot actress in Sarah Michell Geller.  The plot twists are also interesting to say the least.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a fun game. now i know what my friends are talking about.<br />i enjoy play this game<br />thanks
B008HJGPVO|5.0|The various size tips are very helpful for the different apps on Kindle.  Also like that there is a tip on both ends so my grandson does not accidentally scratch the screen by using the wrong end.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Movie  is up there on the most watch list. Actually it takes a few times watching to realize all of it was true in but with happening of different times and individuals.<br />They are not professional actors but professional SEALs.<br /><br />Both thumbs up!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am glad I found this for my Kindle when I need a calculator. Very handy with some extra capabilities over simple calculators.
B00AEBBAEK|4.0|This movie was weird but I did not care for the music part of it but liked the story line.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is continuing to surprise me. I'm addicted to it. It's a excellent  way to pass the time. While unwinding. I recommend it to everyone!
B00007GZR5|4.0|This is movie for some reason onlyappeals to men . Most of the women I have talked to hate it.lol
B00DVPN30A|5.0|I don't know if Amos Lee can top this album but I am looking forward to seeing if he can because I want more, more, more from him.  Loved this album and it's right up there neck and neck with Mission Bell.  Soulful lyrics (which I do wish were included) and great musicians backing him up.  Wonderful!  It's my new go-to CD in my car.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|I likes it different from the story I grew up with. I grew up with the main character being a teacher not a detective.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Still learning this one, some form of help might be a little useful, but you can jump right in and play. Nice degree of difficulty, not too hard,which I prefer if I am going to have some mindless fun. Overall very good game.
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|I returned this item because I found it cheaper elsewhere. But it did arrive quickly,  was as pictured and matched the one I found in store exactly. My niece loved it! Four stars because of price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like this game alot on Facebook. Great that you can get it here on Amazon. Only issue I have is some of the graphics are not loading but all in all a great buy :)
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Great film that I watch over and over.  Touching, funny and best of all based on a true story in a the most beautiful city in the world.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Gift for one of my grandchildren.  5 stars: why? 1st, because its LEGOS!  My grandkids love Legos, & I love Legos, too. 2cd: Its Minecraft! Anything Minecraft is a hit with all of my grandkids, it is their favorite game of all time.  There are times when I don't love Minecraft as much as they do, like when they have other responsibilities, but don't want to quit playing this game.  All in all, this is a great gift, they can work with their hands, use their imagination and creativity.  Only one thing better for them, in my opinion, and that is being outdoors, which is not always possible in our climate, so, yes, 5 stars.  (Oh, if you're wondering, we still teach our families about responsiblity...)
0679745203|3.0|I wanted the book with the cover shown. I didn't want the book with the actors from the movie which is the one I received,  Still, got here on time.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Another great lego set, plus its Minecraft - thats all I need to know when I am buying gifts for my grandkids.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|....... the first off a few  the only way  the first time since I think that this  the only people.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best book King has done in a long time.  Hard to put it down ,Best book since The Shining.Keep it up.
B006AN78XS|4.0|Wilson and Huddleston as well as the others were good.  It was a thoughtful story presented with humor and fun.
B0053KWDES|3.0|It's hard to use because the way the out cable connect to the device is so awkward. It keep disconnecting with my computer because I couldn't get the cable to plug in tightly.<br />After so many try and I don't feel like the sound improve that much, I decided to return it. Maybe I'll buy the Fiio music player and skip the Amplifier :(
1936891026|5.0|The author's viewpoint and work ethic along with his common sense and humor were very appealing.  While extolling the virtues of self discipline, he doesn't take himself too seriously.  The book was also in a format of simplicity, making for a pleasant, easy read.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very good read. Couldn't put it down. A good unpredictable ending with lots of intrigue along the way. A must read for Grisham followers.
1401937519|5.0|In reading many similar books, there is a common theme of love remaining when the body fulfills it's purpose.  Anita's experience was freeing for her and I'm sure for others whose lives of trying to live up to impossible demands of culture and religion blinds us to the gifts we have and the appreciation of who we were created to be.  You wonder how close we can come to achieving this state of knowing and being without having to experience death.
080701429X|5.0|Outstanding writing and philosophy.  I learned more about life and being happy than numerous books from the &#34;big name self-help (so called) gurus&#34;.  Highly recommended.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I loved this game. price was good and graphics were awesome. wish to find more great games like this game.
B00BB8LTWI|1.0|this one was out of stock so my money was promptly refunded and  I was surprised how well I was taken care of. Only rated it a one for not having the movie, but they deserve a 10 for customer service!!!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I love this show. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she was in static. Great price for the package with the season finally.
1423170148|5.0|I love this book. This book is for anyone who has a sister or even a family member who they find different but still<br />love them for who they are. Barbara Hicks does such a good job telling such a touching story. The illustrations add<br />to the story to make it more visual. I highly recommend this book. :)
B00006CXGM|5.0|This movie is funny as hell. Especially if you put the subtitle on Pikey. It goes into ???? When Brad Pitt speaks in the fields. Funny movie
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Good adventure, special effects movie. Enjoyable experience! I was fascinated with the plot and plot points. Great for the whole family.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|I love Mariah Carey, so this was a fun CD to get, especially since it's not as well-known as say Music Box or Daydream.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't like running out of lives or moves but other than that I love it. Its challanging and fun and not to mention addicting. Its great
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This movie is a modern horror classic (on par with Halloween). The movie was delivered in great condition and I enjoyed watching it on DVD.
0316204366|5.0|A very well written book. The author's capacity to mix different stories is impressive. The difficulties not always are negative. The challenges make us stronger.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Wish you could play more levels without having to rate the game. Other than that, its a fun and addictive game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player is the media streaming device that represents the best value, because of its high quality and its incredibly low price point. It is very small, unobtrusive, and well-constructed, and it provides access to a wide variety of entertainment content. The Google Chromecast is an outstanding Streaming Media Player, and I give it my highest recommendation.
1455576387|5.0|Great read!  Many twists and turns to keep you turning the page.  King and Maxwell are superstars in the land of private investigators.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app and I have a mansion with tons of diamonds and I also spend my time trolling my friends but its cool another thing I hare waiting soooooooooo long for updates but still great app
B000063S6Z|5.0|This and &#34;Hotel&#34; are my favorite Moby CDs. Has a lot of songs! Highly recommend to anyone who likes a mixture of Moby, female singing, and crazy noises.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it so much I am addicted to it but I personally think that all who have amazon game circle should be able to text and comment each other like Pandora radio station oh yeah friend me my username is funkraseygirl.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|It did a nice job of killing time and keeping me entertained, but it's not a movie I want to see again right away. They went a bit heavy on the gore and violence and despite the female judge talking about wanting to help the many good people trapped in the community, we never really saw any of them. It was an okay movie overall.
B000001EC1|5.0|The case was broken but songs are awesome,espectially Prayer`94 a great acoustic version of living on a prayer. Great album
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Malala's voice should be heard around the world. Not only is she a brave young woman and a fighter for education, but she provides valuable insight into the mind and heart of a group of people who are too often greatly misunderstood.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the most fun game there is .I will play it till I fall asleep it is incredibly fun.
B00004TJKI|5.0|I use it in teaching business & personal law.  It walks you right through the steps of a criminal trial.
B000VSYDRM|5.0|The story sounds horrifying and I am no fan of horror, but I could not turn away. The idea of an obsessed prodigy of smell & the world of purfume making are fascinating. Great actors. Surprisingly, a fun and entertaining flick.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|My daugher really enjoyed the movie and it taught her to perservere regardless of the odds, because Mike Wazowski won the race! Very good movie for the family.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is fun! I find this app a fantastic way to kill time while waiting in line at the grocery store!
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|The game is nice, my son likes it.  It is fairly simple to play, but the box and instructions we received were all in Chinese.  Not sure how to use the cards or keep score.  I'll try and find the instructions on-line.  Not sure if it was just my seller or not, but wish it was in english.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|I haven't had cable since 2007 and only buy dvd's. For shows after 2007, I have to go by the description and this sounded very interesting. The show isn't quite what I expected from the description. I can't say I love it but I don't dislike it either. Sometimes they get a bit too graphic and gross. (Why does the media seem to think they have to go out of their way to show graphic disgusting things? When will they learn less is more?)  Sometimes the stories are a bit weird, but as I said, the show is well done. They certainly got my attention on the last episode of this season, so I had to immediately purchase season 2 (of course they left it with a cliff hanger) so I can see what happens next. There are several extras on this dvd, and English subtitles (for the hearing impaired).
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Donna Nobel as the Doctor's companion is completely priceless. Her transformation from a fairly shallow temp (&#34;I'm just a temp!&#34;) to a compassionate, powerful, assertive woman is really well shown. The story lines are incredibly fabulous. The dynamic between Donna and the Doctor is excellent and never awkward like it was with Martha Jones.<br /><br />The end - SPOILER - is most tragic on so many levels. The first time I saw this season I was destroyed for days. This tells me just how compelling the show and this season were. Excellent acting, writing, directing - all of it top notch.<br /><br />To really get what happens to the Doctor after Season 4, you MUST watch the David Tennant special. It's the very needed segue between Seasons 4 and 5.
0740748475|5.0|If you're a Calvin & Hobbes fan, this hard cover collection is a must have.  When C&H first came in to my consciousness, I ran out and bought all of the individual soft cover collections.  After years of use, storage and moving, they haven't fared too well.  So I decided that I would get something that would last and I could pass on to my kids to (hopefully) love as much as I have.<br /><br />Good:<br />The entire collection in one hardcover case with each book in hardcover<br />Minimal but beautiful design on each book.  That kind of fits in to the heart of Calvin & Hobbes<br />Built to last.  These are sturdy book that will last through years of use and moves<br /><br />Bad:<br />Not much, but know the entire collection is heavy.  Don't drop it on your toe!<br />It can be kind of a pain sliding out one of the books from the hard sleeve.<br />Be aware!  There's a hard sleeve collection that has the softcover books in them.  I made this mistake and had to return it since I wanted the hardback so bad.  This set has 3 hardcovers while the other has the 4 softcovers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should try this game out, it is awesome! You can travel around, exploring and finding things, or building a world of your own. Play on your own or with others (your friends can join your world if they are on the same network as you). I would absolutely recommend this game!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Wonderful book.  Tells a great story.  Explains social disfunction in ways &#34;guys&#34; will understand.  Highly commend to all readers who enjoy a &#34;great story&#34;.

B00CDTSQZW|4.0|Lovers of HBO's Rome will probably appreciate Vikings.  Lovers of Spartacus not too much.  There is historical detail, (of course some liberties are taken), intrigue, some sexuality but it fits the story (not terribly gratuitous), lots of bloody fighting and well-imagined glimpses into Viking life. Beautifully filmed. It doesn't glorify or demonize; glimpses of pagan life are handled with sensitivity (and a few magic mushrooms!).  Well worth it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great sound and picture! Great packaging after worn in a little. Reminded me of when I saw them in theaters!
1400067820|5.0|Note that this book is on the Essential Readings list for the RMA designation [Retirement Management Analyst(sm)].<br /><br />While the RMA Curriculum Book - T[[ASIN:1493585398 The Retirement Management Analyst (RMA) Designation: Curriculum Book for RMA Candidates]]- is the required text to study for the RMA designation, consumers and advisors who want to build an Essential Readings library of their own will benefit from reading this book, especially if they place what they read in the context of the curriculum framework.<br /><br />To see the full Essential Readings list, check the website of the Retirement Income Industry Association (RIIA).<br /><br />The mission of the association includes:<br /><br />- the empirical validation of academic and industry solutions, processes and products,<br /><br />- the publication of solutions that pass the vetting process, and<br /><br />- the education of consumers and advisors about the proper use of these solutions.<br /><br />There are too many good reasons to mention in one small review why this book is on the RMA's Essential Readings list.<br /><br />One of particular interest for \\"Wealth and Consumption Management(sm)\\" practitioners is comparing Taleb's work against RIIA's RMA curriculum because it suggests an extension of the traditional model that illustrates the four risk-management approaches of retention, management, pooling and avoidance:<br /><br />_ Risk Retention when risk frequency is low and severity is low<br /><br />_ Risk Management when risk is frequent and severity is low<br /><br />_ Risk Pooling when risk frequency is low and severity is high<br /><br />_ Risk Avoidance when risk frequency is high and severity is high<br /><br />\\"Antifragile\\" introduces the notion of a fifth risk-management technique, Risk Barbelling, as it applies to risk frequencies that are very low and whose severity is much higher than expected.<br /><br />Taleb recommends heavily weighting low-risk exposures and complementing those with a few high-risk exposures - the two ends of the barbell with little to no average risk exposures in the middle.<br /><br />This development is useful for retirement planning when one contrasts the key risks of investment management vs. the key risks of retirement management.<br /><br />A key difference between these two lists of risks is the presence - on the list of retirement risks - of household-centric, un-systematic, \\"chance\\" risks that cannot be diversified away, or averaged, using the traditional investment allocations.  Thus making the case for Taleb's point of creating new and convex risk exposures - at the household level - in order to become anti-fragile to those random events.<br /><br />This gives us yet another tool/process to match retirement income strategies to the specific circumstances of a household and their unique mapping of risk exposures.<br /><br />As we continue to explore the growing body of knowledge for retirement management and retirement planning, we continue to see that \\"one size does not fit all\\" and that our role is indeed to match the right processes, tools and products to the right client households.<br /><br />\\"First Build a Floor, Then Expose to Upside(sm)\\" feels anti-fragile.<br /><br />\\"Worry-Free Investing\\" as well as \\"Risk Less and Prosper\\" feel anti-fragile.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0130499277 Worry-Free Investing A Safe Approach to Achieving Your Lifetime Financial Goals]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1118014308 Risk Less and Prosper: Your Guide to Safer Investing]]<br /><br />What other books do you think should be on the Essential Readings list?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Pulls you in and keeps you wanting more.<br />Now I need to get the third book right now. Wow. Such a great series!
1451695195|4.0|Those who do not believe in an afterlife has to read this. This is real death experienced by a top neurosurgeon who scientifically describes his own journey into Heaven and back.
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|I bought this book based on Gladwell's reputation as an original thinker but I didn't find anything original at all. The message is that the underdog can win for a variety of reasons. Not exactly new thinking, Sun Tzu said as much a long time ago. In fact I recommend The Art of War as Sun Tzu explains the same premise, underdogs can win, but without boring examples (I'll spoil it for you, half the book is about girl's basketball). Also recommend Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power and The 33 Strategies of War for a fuller understanding of \\"underdogs\\" and strategy.
B00FQPHOPI|2.0|What a horrible collection of poorly executed, disjointed ideas that in one fell swoop turns Superman from superhero into attempted campy teen idol and ruins the previous best Superman movie storyline (Superman II). I can't believe I anticipated this hunk of garbage. If you're thinking about getting this, get/rewatch Superman 1, 2 or even the recent Superman Returns instead. They are all far superior. If you're looking for disappointment, this is your ticket.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Awesome fight scenes that really put into perspective what a punch from Superman would do.<br /><br />Cons (few kind of spoilers):<br />1. Poorly conceived/executed story line - most of the time it feels like Superman is doing things \\"just because\\".<br />2. The complete ruination of the General Zod story line<br />3. The worst plot line twist... maybe ever.... Superman lets his father die - he literally allows it. Watches on as it happens.<br />4. Superman has no need for his Clark Kent ID by the end of the movie.<br />5. Louis Lane can apparently teleport to Superman's precise location whenever she wants (fight in the city... she just shows up in the same building as him afterwards).<br />6. Superman really digs cheesy one liners.<br /><br />Disappointments:<br />No John Williams score

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The chromecast couldn't be easier to set up and start casting from just about any device capable of running it.  The $35 price tag also can't be beat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I choose to stream the majority of my media from Amazon Prime, and would also appreciate the ability to just stream an image of my desktop to the TV.  The chromecast isn't currently capable of doing either of those things. My chromecast ended up being something more of a novelty to me and I just haven't found a consistent use for it in my house.  Even if the capability existed to cast from the Amazon Ap, I'd still be tying up one of my devices to cast to the TV.  A basic Roku box is similarly priced and doesn't need one of my $500+ mobile devices to make it work.<br /><br />Lastly, the Chromecast sticks out pretty far from the HDMI port and the flimsy Micro-USB power cord sticks out even farther... You've got to be careful not to slide your TV around anywhere the back of the chromecast might hit against.  I've accidentally squished the chromecast against a wall with a wall mounted monitor and again against the  TV stand at my parent's house. Now the Micro-USB power cord is bent and is difficult to get situated in the socket on the Chromecast.  I'm afraid if I do it once or twice more it will break off entirely.  Not ideal if you plan on using the Chromecast as a \\"portable\\" solution that you can carry with you to plug into a variety of displays.<br /><br />Bottom line:  A very cool bit of tech at a nice price, but ultimately useless at my house.
B00FOQRNN2|4.0|Interesting company and founder. Book covered the history of them both very well and you also get a sense of Amazon's basic ideas and bezos' vision for it.
B008JFUR10|5.0|very good movie great effects good action good acting very cool monsters would recommend it to anyone who likes sci fi
B008XG1X18|5.0|Oh my goodness, I cannot stay away!  I will never clip another magazine article and I am a long time clipper and filer.  So many creative people out there and they are so generous with their ideas.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful read. It's about a mothers love for her child no matter the child's age. The illustrations are wonderfully drawn to help tell the story.
B008JFUQZ2|2.0|Again, another go nowhere syfy movie, could not really put my finger on it but it lacked something, it did have plenty of action but still.
B003B02O0A|3.0|Read all of Grisham's books except this one. Bought the new Sycamore Road book and thought I should read Time to Kill first. Opening is very hard to take, I skipped the first chapter because of the violence. Just started and it is getting good.
B005LAIIMG|1.0|This movie was very disappointing, just another zombie dead walking movie with no place to go but down, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this in high school and loved it. Revisited it 10 years later and it's even better! Highly recommended!
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|not very user friendly.  the sleep pattern could be better. im still confused about which scale to buy to go with it.  took a while to figure out how to sync
