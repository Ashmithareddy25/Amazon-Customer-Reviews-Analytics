B0007KS7D0|4.0|This works well with the kit 18-55 kit Nikon lens from 35mm to 55mm. Focal range with this lens is about 6\\" to 1.5 feet.  Resolution is quite good in the center, softening at edges, this will depend largely the lens being used. The 35mm diameter lens (actual lens diameter) of the DCR-150 (49mm filter threads) will vignette images on short focal length lenses (wide angle) and also lenses with large front elements (eg 67mm filter size: Tamron 17-50, Nikon 16-85 will always show some corner shading). I would not recommend this macro attachment lens for these lenses. It will work on the Nikon 70-300 but with an extremely limited working focal range of about 1 foot.<br /><br />The pinch type spring mounting (similar to lens caps) works well and is secure. While this not a substitute for a dedicated macro lens, this is a worthwhile lightweight and compact addition for a travel kit when close focus ability may be desired.  It works very well on the Panasonic FZ 150, giving more options for close focus work, but again the camera only focuses within a limited distance range depending on the zoom and will vignette at wide angle.

B0069UV0LS|4.0|Another small, critically acclaimed film that flashed in and out of theaters quickly came to us from the UK, where audiences are more familiar with its first-time director and star. Tyrannosaur follows the story of Joseph, an unemployed alcoholic with crippling anger issues who decides to turn his life around after he accidentally kills his dog. As he develops a relationship with a local charity shop employee, he finds that her husband has violent tendencies of his own, and confrontation appears inevitable. Based on the same kind of environment Considine observed around him growing up in public housing, Tyrannosaur is brutal and unflinching, but I found the performances outstanding and the story of redemption rewarding. those of you looking for a bit of hard-hitting drama should see this.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|Moviegoers of a certain age may always remember Steven Spielberg for the indelible fingerprint he left on the 1980s, both as producer and director, and many say last year's War Horse recalls some of the best elements of that era. Based on the 1982 children's novel of the same name, which also inspired a stage production, War Horse follows the travails of a spirited horse named Joey during World War I as he is raised by a farmboy, sold off to a soldier, and marched into the middle of battle. Joey endures various hardships but endures through it all, inspiring those around him to greater things. Characterized by polished filmmaking, old-fashioned storytelling, and a certain trademark sentimentality, War Horse won many fans when it opened during the holiday season and six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Definitely worth a look for anyone hankering for a dash of Spielbergian magic.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Wuthering Heights was a very good book although there seemed to be some typos that could have been avoided when editing.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Currently in production is an Alien prequel that fans of the original Alien movies will be sure to look forward to.  My friend bought me this Blu ray anthology from Amazon and said the delivery time was very quick  . Never the less, it is a welcome release of this, the first 4 Alien movies on Blu Ray.  I had owned the previous Alien set of Standard Def versions which were all quite good but the Blu Ray anthology really did take a step up, particulaly in the video transfers.  Each of the 6 DVDs are contained within a book like container.  The discs themselves need to be slid out of the 'page' containing the disc but this was not difficult to do and it was easy to avoid placing your fingers on the face of the disc itself.  However, I do wish there were some kind of protect film within the holders that would protect the DVD rather than have it resting on the hard paper of each page.<br /><br />The first Alien movie broke incredible new ground in both the sci-fi and horror genres.  Since the first theatrical release, there have been a great many other films that have copied the infamous 'monster punching out through the chest' effect.  In fact, that has become so very ho hum as it  has been copied just too many times by directors who could not rely upon their own creativity and had to copy others.<br />Both the first Alien and 2nd Aliens films retain their quality with excellent video transfers showing great details in the dark and shadow areas.  The ability to show detail in shadows, often dependent upon the T.V.'s ability to pass what is known as 'Pluge' will make a huge difference in how you view any of these films.  Some viewers might complain that they could not see much detail in the dark scenes but that will not be the fault of the Blu ray transfer, but the fault of their set's inability to pass pluge.  Both of these first two movies have a great deal of extra footage added in that will certainly enhance each film.  The 'deleted' and now added in footage simply expands the scenes they are in and are well worth having.  As much as the first film broke new ground, like the 2nd Terminator movie, it is the 2nd film of the anthology that equally attracted viewers.  For both of these first two films the audio make excellent use of the front side surrounds as well as the sub woofer.  Use of the rear surrounds was appropriate but rather spare and I was a touch disappointed in that.<br /><br />The 3rd film, centered at a maximum security prison, surprisingly, did not have a director's intro and I believe I know why.  It is clearly the consensus of most that this was the weakest of the 4 films. The acting is fine here and Charles Dutton retains a self sacrificing  charisma throughout. However, the story line itself is fairly weak and goes nowhere.  There is quite a bit of extra footage to the film but, in this case, the footage simply drags out the movie and really provides little enhancement.  The audio is equal to the first two, again, with good use of left and right front channels, sub and little use of the rear surrounds.  This is the only reason I gave the anthology on blu ray 4 stars instead of 5.  I appreciate when producers make accurate, albeit more expensive, use of the surrounds and though the audio is DTS HD, I believe they may have scrimped a bit in the sound mixing.<br /><br />The final film, Alien Resurrection, was a clever reboot of the Alien series and provides a fine take on film.  Interesting that in the directors commentary, he clearly states that the original theatrical release IS THE DIRECTOR'S cut but he added unseen footage to it anyway for this Blu ray release.  There is an excellent video transfer and the audio did make better use of the rear surrounds tho, again, somewhat sparingly.<br /><br />Seeing Sigourney Weaver age from the first through the 4th films was an unexpected delight.  In the first film, she really does look like a young starlet.  However, as the 2-4th films were released, her face took on,not just an older appearance, but a tougher one.  She literally grew into her role as the progression of films continued.  In Alien Resurrection she was still beautiful but almost frightening in her countenance.  Great acting there.<br /><br />Each of the first four discs provides a choice between the theatrical release and the extended versions.  I usually always move to watch the extended version but you do have the option should you choose it.  The last two discs, the 5th and 6th DVDs, contained more extras than you can ever hope to get through in week and all of them are worthy of viewing.<br /><br />The Alien Anthology on Blu ray is the way Blu Ray, in fact, all DVDs, should be released.  It is devoid of tiresom commercials and previews of other films.  Those type of previews simply take up space on the DVD that could go to worthy extras, deleted scenes and outtakes, even auditions that would be related to the film you bought.  This anthology wastes nothing and leaves no stone unturned in its successful attempt to bring you everything Alien worthy.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksnot just an older appearance, but a tougher one.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I think this app is fun for any puzzle fan but if you get frustrated easily, this is not the app for you. overall great game, hours of fun.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I was wondering what all the hype was about when I first started this.. and then I put it down for about 3 days before I decided to pick it back up. I have not regretted it.<br /><br />This story is very deep in its own sense and there's so much beneath the surface of people. It's hard to imagine this sort of life happens to people, since I don't see it in the neighborhoods that I've grown up in. It's an eye opener, I guess.<br /><br />Despite everything, it's a beautiful story and helps to reinforce to me what I experience many times in the books I read - love triumphs all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the variety of games. nice soothing background music fun for me and my husband and children. good quality interactive games. no lagging so. far
B0052VUNHC|4.0|After practically devouring the Fifty Shades triology, Amazon suggested Beautiful Disaster, so I decided to give it a try. Going from the Fifty Shades books to this one, was a little bit of a let down - but it's not really fair to compare the two books since they're really nothing alike. Well - maybe in the fact that there's a possessive/protective/dominating male that introduces an innocent girl into his lifestyle. With Beautiful Disaster - that world is a fight club.<br /><br />The storyline is could easily be turned into a soap opera. Sex, fights, alcohol, Vegas, fights, more fights, running away, the mob (?), cheating, fire... The list could on and on. With all that being said - I finished the book in a single weekend. I just couldn't put it down and it was an easy read.<br /><br />With being a very recent college graduate, I had to just laugh during parts of the book that referenced the current \\"college life\\" as it's is not very realistic... At all. The developed characters more than make up for it. Travis and Abby are complicated (at best) and their relationship makes for good entertainment.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|For the price of $5.49, this is a great value for money T2 Movie. The BR quality is awesome and the only complain is the slow loading of Skynet connection to the Web. The first time the screen appear, I cannot find the options until I change the screen size. Initial loading is slow but overall, great quality.

B006VC3LES|5.0|Long overdue for a Blu-ray release, Chinatown sparkles.<br /><br />One of the best films to come out of the Hollywood boom years of the late sixties and seventies, Chinatown is remarkable not only for its gorgeous cinematography by John A. Alonzo but for its memorable script by Robert Towne. This was Polanski's last film in the U.S. before his escape to Europe.<br /><br />According to Walter Isaacson, \\"Chinatown\\" is reputedly one of the films that Steve Jobs took along on his iPad2 while on one of his last vacations (the two others were \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" and \\"Toy Story 3\\"). Sadly, he probably saw the inferior version available on iTunes.<br /><br />The transfer is competent and bests any version I've seen. The 5.1 soundtrack, though not the intended version, adds a satisfactory dimension to the music and ambiance.<br /><br />My one complaint: The type size in the cheap booklet is way too small! I had to pull out a magnifying glass to read it. The studios should spend a little more money on important releases like this one.<br /><br />Chinatown holds the #2 position on the American Film institute's list of Best Mystery Films of all times. It also was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won for Best Screenplay. It won several Golden Globe Awards --- Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Screenplay. In 1991 it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.<br /><br />Two other releases I'd recommend from this Hollywood boom period are \\"The Godfather\\" [[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray]]] and \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" [[ASIN:B0010YVCHK Bonnie and Clyde (Blu-ray Book Packaging)]]
B0072GPQNG|1.0|Beautifully lit and filmed this manipulative film is the worst kind of schlock.  It is the Perils of Pauline as imagined by the Marquis de Sade.  Not once, not twice, but several times does a character in this film (all different people) put a gun to the head of it's hero and star.  Is the star to be killed?  We know is isn't true as the trailer has given away the ending - so again and again and again we see the horse taken to the brink of death, only to be given a few minutes reprieve.  This is only the tip of the iceberg as to the perils the horse endures.  I consider this movie to be abusive.  Abusive to the audience.  It was possible to tell this story without these cheap manipulations.  This will go down as my worst cinema experience ever.  Before you accuse me of being cowardly or a sissy - The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Inglorious Basterds are some of my favorite films.  War Horse is not.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|I got this on Blu-Ray and settled down to watch it with my kids.  We loved it and I thought it did a great job capturing the essence of the characters and the book, while also making the story approachable to newcomers who didn't know Tintin.<br /><br />The movie is a mashup of several books, but the choice of storyline was excellent to serve up a self-contained adventure and introduce us to Tintin and Haddock together.  This movie packs a lot of story in a relatively short time.<br /><br />The characters are well done and they resisted white-washing Haddock's alcoholism, which was certainly a big problem in the earlier books.<br /><br />Last and certainly not least, full use was made of the possibilities of an animated movie.  Take for example the early scene where Snowy chases the car and goes through a herd of cows.  There is no way you could film this scene with a dog and real cows, but this is precisely where cgi animation shines - on a relatively ordinary subject matter that can't be done for real.<br /><br />The chase scene at the end is perhaps a bit over the top, but... hey, it's a comic book adaptation after all.<br /><br />Good job.
140053271X|4.0|I've had my NST since last July, and I've been very happy with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Battery life when wifi is off is as good as advertised.<br /><br />- The page turn rate was already fast, but the update last November made it super speedy.  Seriously, I've played with the current e-ink Kindles, and the difference in refresh rate might SEEM small on paper, but in practice it's a very noticeable difference.<br /><br />- I never had the wifi problems others did after the November firmware update, but I understand that the latest firmware update should solve it.<br /><br />- The NST feels really nice when you're holding it, and I really like that there are physical page turn buttons in addition to the onscreen touch turning - I use both, depending on whether I'm sitting up or lying down when I read, etc.<br /><br />- Navigation is very intuitive.<br /><br />- I bought a $5 4gb micro SD card and have had no problems using it with the NST.<br /><br />- Sideloading non-DRMed, non-B&N content downloaded from places like Project Gutenburg is very easy, and it all goes into the same library as your B&N downloaded content.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The user interface is easy to use, but it's also VERY basic, and there are very few features.  You can organize your books into \\"shelves,\\" but only on the device itself, and it's a cumbersome process.  You can sort books by title, author, and date added, and... that's pretty much it.  The NST isn't a tablet and I don't want it to be, but there are still some pretty simple features that don't seem like it would have been that hard to add, and more flexible organization is one of them.<br /><br />- Once a book's in the library, you can't really see anything about it besides the title and author. Metadata from sideloaded content doesn't show up, and even purchased content requires you to be on wifi to see more information.<br /><br />That's about it. My cons list is really more of a wishlist, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the NST to anyone, especially at the lowered $99 price.  I imagine a new touch reader will probably be released within the next few months, but unless the user interface is majorly updated, it's hard to imagine I'd feel the need to upgrade, since the current version meets almost all of my needs perfectly well.

1595825045|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the series. Not just for the story, character depth or enticing music.. but the art. It's what hooked me the first episode I saw. I mean, c'mon, you can't deny how gorgeous the premiere looked! So yes, I JUMPED at the opportunity to grab a copy of this baby.<br /><br />The cover is quality. Then you open up to the map of the Avatar world followed by an introduction given by M. Night... And then, the revealings of Avatar's beginnings come to light.<br /><br />One of the things I have to stress about this book is the amount of insight about the behind the scenes work. For the fans who want to know how this deep story came to light, they tell you and they don't hold back. Everything from insights on the difference between American Animation studios and Asian Animation studios to momo going from a robotic monkey to a lemur explained.. It's really great and helped me appreciate the show a lot more. This makes up the first of five chapters.<br /><br />After this, it comes on to highlight sketches from each episode in chapters made up of each season. Some explained in depth, such as \\"Jet\\" and \\"The Blue Spirit\\" and others just illustrations with very minimal explanation, such as \\"The Deserter\\". (Season one). They include small extras about the DVD covers and the chibi Avatar animations as well.<br /><br />The artwork is beautifully colored and high quality ensured. It looks absolutely great. My only nitpick about the book is how short it feels. At times, I wanted more artwork and more details, or wanted some of the art featured to be larger so I can gasp at the details. All in all though, this book really shows how much thought, love and care was put in and the vast amount of talent of those who worked on it. Boy do they have talent. The art speaks for itself. Even friends who aren't fans of the show loved looking through the book. A must buy for any fan or anyone interested in this line of work for that matter.<br /><br />Go! Buy it! The Avatar will blow you away! Eh heh...you away! Eh heh...

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the best game I've had on my Kindle so far. It's basically a bunch of different mazes with obstacles and \\"spikes\\" that destroy your avatar.

B006L3RZ26|5.0|Hearing Xuefei Yang's Bach Concertos, you could almost be convinced that Bach had written specifically for the guitar.  The truth is, Bach wrote for the ages and great artists such as Yang are the sands that keep the hourglass endlessly flowing.  She has a rare musical talent that becomes even more so when it comes to reinterpretation; she is adept at providing a fresh angle while not losing the original composition.  With the Elias Ensemble, she's come up with arrangements that sound very natural as guitar concertos; whether it is scalar runs in track 3 and 4 (Harpsichord Concerto No. 1 in D Minor) or the crisp hammer-ons and pull-offs in track 6 (Violin Concerto 1 Allegro), its more than top notch guitar playing, it becomes transcendent due to her openness to both musical and technical possibilities.  There are understated percussive sounds, or little twists on technique unlike anything I've heard in previous readings of these pieces regardless of the instrument.  It all seems innate to the music though and there is an effervescence that is intoxicating.  Yang is involved in a very open give and take with the compositions; she is taking chances, but the negotiation is respectful of the original pieces.  There is an air of discovery that these subtle inventions grant.  For a good example of this listen to Violin Concerto No. 2 in E major Allegro.  It is as full and strident as ever, but the sustained note (impossible on the classical guitar) about 45 seconds into the Adagio becomes a trill, or half step interval that highlights the vernacular of the guitar.  Other guitarists have substituted whole notes plucked once over each measure of sustain, so even among her peers on the guitar, Yang is providing an arresting alternative to either that or even a straight tremelo.  Think of how many violinists have stated their souls in this note alone and it becomes a defining moment.<br /> Her voicing and accentuation in Violin Sonata in G minor BWV1001 Fugue are very much representative of how she brings a piece to life.  Whether subtle or overt, there is always a forward motion and her artistic choices seem to be an expression of divine will at times.  Yang can routinely infuse influences from many different sources and though the Adagio from Violin Sonata in G minor BWV1001 may have subdued tinges of Spanish and Asian colors, this is the most straightforward I've heard her play.  Over all there is a naturalism that brings both solo and ensemble works to the ear unadorned.  This richly informed musicality along with her fluid technique and innovative arrangements translate into timeless beauty.presentative of how she brings a piece to life.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I tend to avoid products with a great deal of hype behind them, but the series description was appealing and I had the opportunity to borrow The Hunger Games for free from the Kindle Lending Library. After finishing the first book, I couldn't bring myself to wait for my borrowing limit to renew (a measly two days!) so I purchased this trilogy edition. As I believe someone else has pointed out, there is a problem with this edition, primarily in the first book, in regards to the text size. Thankfully, I had already read it and once I skipped to Catching Fire the text was fine throughout.<br /><br />The plot was engaging, though at times I had difficulty connecting with Katniss. I grew a little tired of the love triangle, which felt like a stereotypical Young Adult fiction conflict. Is it really that difficult for teenagers these days to commit to someone?<br /><br />There were some minor flaws, but I found the series exceptional nonetheless.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|I was a fan of the Mercury Living Presence series back in the 1960's, when the albums were on vinyl. This set of course has transfers from the original tapes (and in some cases the original 35mm magnetic films). The sound is brilliant, rivaling modern digital recordings. The original masters were made using a 3-microphone system that was elegant in its simplicity, and great attention was paid to the entire recording sound chain. Not a hint of overmodulation anywhere, only the slightest audible tape hiss, and yet the orchestral pieces have amazing dynamic range and preserve the brilliance of the high frequencies.<br /><br />The works are diverse, featuring many modern composers, stellar orchestras, pianists, guitarists, and even marching bands. At only about a couple of dollars per CD, this collection offers great value and is not to be missed.

To them I say: BY ALL MEANS, GET IT<br /><br /> I watch A LOT of TV (including Seasons 1-4 at least 5 times each) and I have to say the last 3 episodes of Season 4 count among the most riveting television I have ever witnessed in my life (okay, well I guess just a little hyperbole is thrown in here).<br /><br />I will spare you all the lauding of the performances down even to Good ol' Saul's secretary.  They're all phenominal.<br /><br />GET SEASON 4 Like YESTERDAY.<br /><br />And AMC PLEASE DON'T END BB after 1 more 16 episode run - people are just really starting to catch on to how great BB.  If the final season ratings are huge do we get to keep it?  Pretty Please With Meth On Top?
B001V7UXG2|5.0|As mentioned above, I bought this as a present for a friend. Much as I admire Messrs Fry and Laurie, I am not fond of Jeeves and Wooster, but my friend is absolutely delighted with it, and has already watched it several times, hence the 5 star review.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the books!  It was very difficult to put down once I got started, so be sure you don't have to go to work the next morning before you start the next book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is amazing and so addictive if you are OCD do NOT get it because  SOME of the words are speller in correct but if you ever got taught to sound things out that's all you gotta do! I LOVE THE GAME !!!!!!!!!!!
B0052U59F4|1.0|I read a sample of this book and thought I would enjoy it; however, after purchasing it and reading further I was totally surprised by crude sexual nature of the story.  I'm a pretty open minded person but honestly didn't enjoy the explicit descriptions of various kinky sexual acts.  I would classify the story as pornographic. This is the first book I started in many years that I didn't finished.
B0043RSJ8G|1.0|No mention of lesbianism in the review of this book.  Due to my beliefs, I prefer not to read about same sex love affairs. Usually like Picoult's books, but not this one.
B007N85POS|2.0|I play this app for free on my iPod. This price just to play on a different device is RIDICULOUS.
030788743X|4.0|I was initially surprised by all the reviews here, both extremely positive and extremely negative ones. The positive ones went too far - it's a great read, but not book of the year. The negative ones too critical - just because it's not (insert famous author) doesn't mean its crap.<br /><br />The funny part is I agree with all the negative points:<br />1. Way, way too much 80s references<br />2. 1-Dimensional characters and no development *<br />3. Obvious ending<br /><br />Having said that, I enjoyed it. A couple people did notice the dichotomy issue - the book was written in a quick-paced, non-serious manner, more found in children's books, but the 80s nostalgia could only appeal to those over 30. The premise then of the negative implication of that dichotomy is that surely no one over 30 would ever want to read a simple book.<br /><br />What? Some people rack their brains all day at work and want easy at the end of the day. And that's how you should approach this book - a fun, easy, nostalgic trip with a main character you root for.
B0042KC4VW|5.0|I'm not into the whole vampire thing but this turned out to be a great show. I'm mad at myself for waiting this long to watch it. Can't wait to watch the other seasons.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You should really try reading this Bible at least ten times a day. it would really make a difference in how you decide your choices and actions. I really approve this app for any age , if you are 5 or 82 this is something you can do. Read the Bible!!!!!!!! (-: All of my friends would recommend this amazing app as long as anyone would.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Snakes and Arrows is the best Rush release since Counterparts--no doubt about it. Alex Lifeson is the star of stars on this one; his flawless playing goes to new heights with a number of acoustic performances. He plays with such emotion on this album, and it works spectacularly. A lot of this album reminds me of stuff from Hemispheres and A Farewell to Kings from 1977-78. The song ARMOR AND SWORD has that Hemispheres and A Farewell to Kings tone and sound to it, for example. The album also features some cool instrumentals, such as THE MAIN MONKEY BUSINESS, which is a heavier jam. A lot of the songs are heavy, and Geddy's bass complements Alex's acoustic work to make the heaviness work well. Neil's lyrics are more heartfelt than ever, and he's his usual philosophical self. I will admit that I was pretty stunned as to how great this album was when I first listened to it in 2007. This release has me excited for their next piece, Clockwork Angels, due out in late May. Overall, you can't miss with this masterpiece of an album; it was professionally done from the first lyric to the final production. 10/10
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I grew up reading Puss in Boots, and i love this movie.  All of the actors have done a great job and hopefully their is a sequel in the works.
0062060562|4.0|I read this book in one three-hour sitting. It was a fast, fun, page-turner! Looking back now, I can think of a few flaws, but it was just a fun read. Great for a plane ride, beach day, etc!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.... I couldn't put it down! It has a very interesting ending, & read in less than a week!!! Amazing love story...
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Epic 4g rooted, cyanogenmod 7.2 RC0.  Superior game, great graphics, music and an open map where enemies come at you in any direction.  Upgradable weapons, HD mode and lots of gameplay options.  Well worth the money!!!

B00471TLZS|5.0|This is one of the best haunted house movies in the field; characters you care about (rare these days), supernatural baddies you don't, and one of the best lines in horror movies.  For fans of horror need to know this film.. it is one of the genre defining films.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great cooler for the spec. sockets and for the person who is on a budget but needs a better cooler than the ones provided with the product. I'm very happy with this purchase. :)
B00005YJMX|4.0|This Werner Herzog remake of the classic 1922 silent, Nosferatu, is a beautiful yet haunting visual salute.  Starring Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani, this story that originally was an unauthorized depiction of the Bram Stoker novel \\"Dracula\\", remains one of the most scary versions that holds true to the original novel....second only to director Francis Ford Copola's version.  It is a must see for the horror fan, the vampire fan, or the Kinski fan.  The latest DVD release has the actors speaking in English AND a second disk where they speak in German...no voice dubbing.
B005IFSSK6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this second book in the 'Wolves of Mercy Falls' series. It was every bit as good as Shiver and I couldn't wait to get stuck into the third and final book, Forever.
0545265355|5.0|I had heard about this book from a friend. Then my daughter and I saw the previews for the movie.  I looked on Amazon and saw I could get the trilogy for a great price.  My daighter and I are reading the first one together. We saw the movie before we finised it.  We absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!  We can't seem to put it down.  Can't wait to start the others!
B0073CNYWY|5.0|One of the most enjoyable series in a long time Could become very addictive, Great story line and will keep your interest from episode to episode, also great picture quality.  Don't miss this series
B001S86J2Q|3.0|Not sure what everyone is so excited about with this blu-ray. It looked good but it wasn't great. I was not blown away like I was expecting to be. The case it comes in is about the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen. It is not a solid case and full of holes. Don't accidentally step on it or you might break the disc. So tired of these companies cutting corners everywhere and merchandising this cheap crap but yet still charging full price. Corporate America just disgusts me. We are letting them ruin this great nation.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Well written, good story, and I would recommend to anyone looking for an interesting thriller.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Just got these for running, traveling to/from work (airline commutes). So far out of the box they are extremely lightweight which in my opinion is great for running.  Don't seem overly durable but for the cost I wasn't expecting much.  I also have a pair of in ear Sennheiser's and some Phillips in-ear's as well.  The Sennheiser's have slightly better sound to them although the bass output of these is close to the Senn's.  These lose a very small amount of acoustics due to the ear pieces not completing a seal in the ear but very minimal loss.  My music still sounds great and with plenty of bass if not a little on the tinny side for the highs.<br /><br />The in-ear headphones which I've paid lots for and used for a while sound great but just don't stay in while running unless you have the right ear size to exactly fit their custom adapters.  I felt like every run I was reaching up to adjust them and that frankly pissed me off. ;)  I use running to de-stress and unwind a little.  These fit nicely in the ears and provide great sound without having to mess with them. (These are my initial comments, after I run today I'll update with any issues if any.)<br /><br />For those that wear hats/glasses while running, these so far fit fine under or over the top of my adidas running hat and work with my Costa Del Mar sunglasses.  I have slim frames (over the ear part) on my glasses so results will vary for others.<br /><br />Cord is plenty long if not a little too long but will accommodate most body types and lengths. That's all I have for now. Again, I will update post run today if any issues pop up that I feel should be recognized.<br /><br />Four stars for build quality (just don't seem to be very sturdy but time will tell) and sound quality is slightly less than higher end models.  For the cost though, they are dang close though!<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using them running I am still impressed.  Sound was great and I really liked the lightweight feeling of both the headset and cord.  The cord was a little long (I'm 6'2\\") but I ran it down my shirt to my Ipod on my shorts and it was light enough that it didn't bother at all.  Also if you wear the hat, it almost helps to keep a little additional pressure on the ear pieces which, for me, improved the sound quality slightly.  All in all good short term assessment.  Will update later if it breaks or any negatives are noticed.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Currently at 28:10 mark and *yawn*.  So far:<br /><br />*Mindless fan service sans the franchise<br />*Poor acting<br />*Bland characters<br />*Incoherent plot<br />*Uninspiring soundtrack, excluding White Rabbit<br />*Mediocre SFX<br /><br />This film lacks vision - all I see are women in costumes walking around in front of a camera.  I think we need to leave the pinkish violence genre to the Japanese, or Tarantino.<br /><br />Addendum:  Ended just as I expected.  How disappointing.  And I'm really not clear on what  Zack Snyder was trying to accomplish by marketing this film to an audience whom he then uses the movie to berate.  Um, what?
B000PMLFRA|3.0|My only complaint is that there is a lot of grain in these blu-rays, particularly in the outdoor scenes. A little grain is fine but this just seemed to be too much. It's very distracting. The newer trilogy blu-rays don't seem to have this same problem. I know these are old movies but surely that could be cleaned up a little. Indoor scenes looked great!
B004ZH66XO|1.0|all you do is swim around and eat little fish, a waste of two dollars. do not buy this app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I personaly love the game. it keeps me occupied for hours. I recommend this game for any one. loved it
B007JM4CWY|4.0|_I love these pic cross puzzles but a lot of them are too easy or don't fit on your screen. this puzzle fits nicely on my kindle fire. it gets challenging. even on the easy levels. the puzzle difficulty is mixed in each catagory.' graphics. are basic. nothing special. I like the redo function so making mistakes doesnt ruin your progress. would be helpful to have a stylus for this game as the game board is very sensitive. using your fingers is tricky but doable.  if you want challenging this is it. I left 4 stars only because of the sensitive game board. otherwise I would give it 5.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|This is a very well put together app, the 3D rotating globe is an awesome feature! For those of you thinking about getting this, DO! You can set alarms, view and add times and time zones, and look at info about an area. Try it, hey it's free
B007R41E8O|5.0|worth the 99 cents; you'll love this game . if you love seek and find adventure games you will love this one. thank goodness they put the ? there that showed you which direction to go or i would have been very lost and confused. each time you tap the ? symbol  it shows u what to do. for hours of fun buy this game<br /><br />t

0307592731|5.0|This could have been patronizing or self-centered or (gag) like Eat, Pray, Love but it was not.  In fact, the more I reflect on it, the more I love it and I'm glad I read it. I was planning on selling my copy of this book at the local used book store or here on Amazon, but I think I'll keep it for a while because I loved it that much.  She's a gifted writer who has inspired me to read, write, and walk(hike) more. I have Adrienne Rich's Dream of a Common Language on hold at the library right now because of what Cheryl wrote about it.  I wish I had been brave enough to do something like what she did when I was in my 20s, but we are who we are.  I did other brave things.  I felt so proud of Cheryl at the end. I was definitely rooting for her.

057809665X|5.0|Outstanding new addition to professional reading lists: security, law enforcement, and intelligence communities., as well as sales and anyone who wants to imporve their ability to relate to others. This book cuts through all the background noise and years of higher-education study to give the reader a step-by-step action plan that anyone can employ in everyday life right now.  Basic principles empower the reader to overcome the current technology-centric environment to improve their communications and relationships, which the author notes is the key finding among the happiest people.  The book is well written, engaging, and immediately useful.  Highly recommend the hardcopy for reference and hip-pocket training.  Principles are equally effective at teaching other professionals; everyone will benefit from employing these techniques in personal and professional situations.  Recommended also for youth to learn early how to relate and communicate for success, and for enriching life's most meaningful experiences.  In over 15 years in counterintelligence, I have never seen a better guide; BUY and HOLD!

0062073478|5.0|This is a classic Agatha Christie murder mystery/suspense novel.  Ten people are invited to Indian Island by an anonymous host.  They all come to the island for various reasons: employment, friendship, entertainment.  When they arrive, they realize they've all been summoned there to account for crimes of murder they've committed but were never sentenced for.  As they begin to die, one by one, they realize the deaths follow the pattern of the nursery rhyme, \\"Ten Little Indians.\\"  Fear turns to suspicion as the guests turn on each other, sure that the killer must be one of them. Who will remain when the last little Indian is alone?<br /><br />I've taught this book to my junior high PreAP students with excellent results. Some of the topics we have used this novel to explore include: synonyms, metaphors, idioms, theme, motif, symbolism, SAT vocabulary, and the mystery genre.  I found an online book trailer to engage my students in the beginning.  Once the murders begin, the action is fast-paced, and students engage in a guessing game trying to see who can figure out the killer's identity.  Fortunately, the ending cannot be predicted, and it comes as a great surprise.  I loved it, my students loved it, and I'm sure any lover of suspense will love it, too.
0691152640|2.0|I tried to like this book, I failed, it is simply too dry and the authors are completely unable to weave a compelling narrative.<br />It reads like a series of technical economic papers, none of which seem to offer any particularly fresh and/or meaningful insights. I found myself after completing each chapter asking \\"Yes, and?\\"<br />I feel like I missed something after reading some of the gushing appraisals of this book, but I have read far more interesting books on economics and actual economic papers than this...
0345803485|5.0|loved this book!!! amazing trilogy, great love story very relatable and every girls fantasy come true. i could have read 5 more books from this story!
0307959856|3.0|I am a devoted reader of both Jane Austen and PD James, and looked forward to reading Death Comes to Pemberly. As it turned out,  I was so astounded by how badly James handled  this little excursion into the Regency world that  I repeatedly found myself wondering if this weren't something James wrote BEFORE becoming a successful author.  Is this, perhaps, some piece of Jamesian juvenalia that was brushed off to make a book (and a quick buck)?  I initially gave the book two stars, but concluded that it is at least a little more literate and intelligent than that.  But the book has none of the wit, warmth, charm, humor or insight into human nature of Austen, nor any semblance of James's usual deft plotting, suspenseful story-telling, or psychological character portraits.  It is, in fact, a mess, and a sad mess at that.  There is virtually no action, and no suspense whatsoever.  A man is killed in a wood early in the book, and pretty much nothing happens after that.  Lots and lots of exposition, endless repetition that should have been edited out, a great deal of hand-wringing, and a few frankly lame discursions into various Austen books (gratuitous references  to the families from \\"Persuasion\\"  and \\"Emma\\"  might have been fun in a wittier book, here they were simply filler that struck a jarring note), but no plot development, no story arch, no character growth, no twists, and no payoff at the end. Along the dreary way, James manages to make every single member of the original cast a great deal less likable than they were when Austen created them.  Jane calls Elizabeth Elizabeth (never Lizzy), they refer to each other's husbands as Mr Darcy and Mr Bingley (despite being brother and sister for eight years now), and both are utterly conventional, boring and insipid;  Darcy apparently has regressed and become insecure to boot; and Colonel FitzWilliam is made unrecognizable, and thoroughly uncongenial, for reasons known only to Ms. James.  I can only say I hope at least she thought those reasons  sufficient, as I can't see the justification for it.  With 20 pages to go I was still foolishly hoping for something to happen, for a plot twist that would demonstrate that it was PD James who had written this book, and make my attention to the seemingly pointless plot thus far worthwhile.  Nothing happened; and the the revelations of those last few pages weren't worth the candle.  The reviews that claim that this book is as good as anything PD James has ever written do James an outrageous injustice; she has written infinitely better things.  If you want a good mystery, read one of those.  If you wish Austen had written more, read Georgette Heyer or Stephanie Barron.  Contrary to the fulsome \\"professional\\" reviews, this book will satisfy neither mystery buffs nor Austenites.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I love this app but it would be almost perfect with resume on playback of recording and a jump forward button.
B006FZW00W|5.0|These guys are pretty solid.  They make all around good music. Vocals are solid and instrumentation is fairly average, but when you put it all together, they sounds very unique.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome! I lovethis game but I wish you could controlthe other members of your family so that you have more than one person doing all the work. it would be<br />great if you could assign each towns person a job or two to help out. overall very fun game.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|...is that places like Camp 14 still exist and are still guarded by sadists. And the worst of that is what places like Camp 14 do to the children born in them, as Shin (the subject of the book) was.<br /><br />I find these thoughts terribly depressing. The barbarism just goes on and on.<br /><br />The author writes that not all of Shin's story can be verified (naturally). But the story jibes with news I've read about North Korea in recent years and so I took it at face value. It's a damned ugly face.<br /><br />The book is a must read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nothing too fancy here. its a familiar genre but nicely executed. one of the better games for the kindle. worth more than a buck
B0052U59F4|5.0|After reading this book, my husband finally \\"got it\\"!!  Our marriage is stronger than ever!!  He is much more attentive to my needs and we are enjoying the greatest level of intimacy we have ever experienced.  We are in our mid 50's and we are acting like teenagers!!  and...who cares what the kids think!!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|The story is presented a little differently than the original but the music and dancing are fantastic!  Juliane Hough and Kenny Womack are the best I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys videos like Flash Dance, Dirty Dancing, or Grease, you won't be disappointed!
1451627289|5.0|I have never been a big Stephen King fan, but nonetheless, I loved this novel! For the most part, the action keeps going at a steady rate. In addition, considering the fact that I personally did not live through the 1950's and the 1960's, King truly brought this time period alive for me. His description of the setting made me feel as if I were truly there. Also, his character development of Jake brought this character to life. King also inspired me to try the soft drink Moxie when I saw it in a specialty store. After drinking it, I understood Jake's feelings toward it :).
B000I2JI80|5.0|A lower contrast film that has a gorgeous grain structure and great color.  This is my go to film for 35mm/120 when I want it to really look like C41 film.  This film is different from portra 400 in that it actually has a small amount of grain (portra is so clean) and that can be a very good thing. In natural light, this film shines.  It has a very dreamy feel to it.  Good stuff.
1904994679|5.0|Ordered for my boyfriend for Christmas like I do every year, we love these books! It arrived in great condition, the content is interesting and wonderful, and we are very satisfied!
B007R41E8O|1.0|not only does this game require 350mb of space, with wifi,but i just wasted a buck for a game that goes to black screen and freezes my tablet! not impressed!
B001JDS7CU|5.0|This is an amzaing documentary with incredible takes, very well done. The dedication, time and hard work shows in what I would call a flawless documentary. You have to see it for yourself, there are no words to describe the beautiful takes and images. Worth every cent buying.
0061784788|1.0|I picked up the audio book for this one.<br /><br />I got past the chapter about Thomas Jefferson that then jumped over to nanotechnology for some unknown reason.<br /><br />I even ignored the statement that this has nothing to do with freemasonry even though there is a Freemason symbol on the cover.<br /><br />But when I hit the chapter with the explosion and heard \\"The dog had her tail between her legs and if the guy had had a tail that's where his would be too.\\" I gave up on trying to like this one.<br /><br />Seriously? You couldn't just go with the man being injured? If the man had had a tail?<br /><br />Eeesh.
B0073Q0IY2|3.0|It was good enough for rental, but I wouldn't have wanted to<br />pay $8 or more in a theater. It was pretty much the same<br />as the other Thing movies, nothing new here. It was interesting to<br />see a prequel, since I saw the Kurt Russel version.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game was better than I expected. It is very fun and addictive. It reminds me of Super Mario. I can't believe this game was free. Modern day version of an old school classic.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|These are nicely packaged and exceeded my expectations. I had read the books and wanted to see the show, but did not have HBO when the series ran.<br />Surprisingly the series was not a dispointment. In my opinion, it is one of the better book to TV adaptations.
1582406723|5.0|This book is worth the purchase and will not disappoint the reader. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead series, you need to have this book.
B004AYCWY4|5.0|The \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\" is a stunning counterattack on advocates of  idea  then God had created men in his present form. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians.
0553807919|5.0|The Whole-Brain Child is about relationships. Foremost, it is about the relationship between our interactions with our children and their neurological development. More specifically, this book is about connections. Throughout the connections we share with our children, we have the opportunity to directly influence their brain's architecture. Likewise, as we consider the ways in which children's brains process our interactions, we have the opportunity to intentionally support an architectural framework that will last a lifetime. Simple ideas with profound implications, such as Name it to Tame it, Engage, don't Enrage, and Connect through Conflict, are but a few of the strategies the authors present in a thoughtful and accessible format, one that respects the role of relationships within families. One of the best aspects of this book is the manner in which Siegel and Bryson present the most current findings in neurological research: the integrity of the research is in place and the language of delivery allows us to actually understand and address the implications.<br />What I most appreciate about this book is the dedication to families' experiences with their children and the realization that while we all pledge to do our best each and every day, we all will have moments, days, stages where our best is exhausted, on hiatus, and for the moment we are only human. In this book, Dr. Siegel and Dr. Bryson remind us that we have an opportunity to work in the direction of children's growth and development and that we have every right to know and understand how children's brains organize and develop based on our interactions, reactions, and relationships with one another.<br />The Whole-Brain Child is the closest I will get to a manual about how to help my child develop internal resources to live and grow in a diverse world, to engage meaningfully in relationships, and to learn with an open-heart and open-mind.
1451673442|5.0|This book is so amazing to read.It is kind of a work-book.Will buy some more for my friends and family.

B004SUWR2C|1.0|you are so right., this app is crap.! don't buy. I bought the app thinking it would work because it said kindle compatible
B000ERU5EK|5.0|With everything downloadable now a days, its rare to buy a cd. Especially since ipods don't use a cd at all...however Tristate was definitely worth it. I love every single song on this cd, what can I day I'm addicted to above and beyond! Maybe one if the only albums I would buy, the rest I would download.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought this trilogy with great anticipation after all the hype in the Australian press. My first responses were positive enough to the point of recommending to friends, but soon the tacky side comments and incredibly poor writing detracted from what could have been. A more sophisticated approach and heavy editorial intervention could have lifted these stories into something really special. Instead I find them mind-numbingly boring and the writing skills an insult to the reader. I won't be looking to read any more of E L James books.
0375703764|4.0|While I am sure this book is not suitable for everybody, it is absolutely a worthwhile read for anyone who is willing to test the waters of the truly modern novel.  Danielewski pushes his medium farther than anyone else I have ever read, and to some very curious effects.  I found myself reading it deep into the night.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|First, I couldn't beat the price with Amazon, which is the primary reason I purchased this set (since I can see it any time on HBO). Wonderfully packaged with nice large photos of the main characters. Lots of extras and commentaries are enjoyable for the die-hard fan!
B0046B4VXQ|4.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />I was interested in seeing it for years, and my interest was rekindled last week when i read that a remake is being planned. The storyline is really good, and doesn't bore you for a minute. There's also a nice nod to the classic film Psycho throughout, and a moment that's truly scary. Trust me, you'll be scared half out of your wits. Sissy Spacek stars, with now ex-Mrs. Spielberg Amy Irving in a minor, but key, role, and John Travolta in a very minor part before he shook up Olivia Newton-John in Grease. It's ironic that a movie with such a beautiful main theme is rated R. SPOILER WARNING!!! Personally, I think the movie needed more plot & character development, especially into why Chris hated Carrie so much. Shame that Mrs. Collins, the only person who genuinely cared about Carrie, dies as a result of Carrie's wrath during the prom. SPOILERS OVER!!! I recommend this movie, with a moderate warning about the nudity at the beginning and a scene strongly implying oral sex in the middle of the film. If it weren't for those scenes, the movie could have been rated PG-13.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Best work in a long time. Whereas the original was a lark, this album is more serious and contemplative. However, it rocks better than any other Ian Anderson solo album. It's dense with homages to other Tull works, not just TAAB, both lyrically and musically. Any Tull fan who knows the canon will find all kinds of hidden gems in this work. Ian's vocals have been rough since his throat ailment in the 80's but his vocals are strong here. The complexity of the concept and the execution is nice, since this type of prog-rock concept album hasn't been around in a long time, and it's fresh. It's not the two long continuous tracks of TAAB, but it still hangs together as one solid piece.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I got the buzz of listening to a new Tull album. What a flashback.<br /><br />I'm impressed that Ian would take this on. New ambitious material is sorely lacking from the old-timers. I figured after the Jethro Tull xmas album of ten years ago, that Tull was out to the \\"touring\\" pasture. I was wrong. For the Tull fan who has followed them throughout all their albums, this new one is a godsend. And better, it tackles some introspective subjects deftly. This isn't just a new album, it's an artfully conceived and executed \\"concept\\" album that updates a 40 year old classic while forging new ground. And a tour that will play all of TAAB and TAAB2 together? Ambition indeed. Impressed.

0307887898|5.0|Absolutely spot on book.  I have lived through just about everything Eric talks about in this book. Especially when he comes to companies that fail.  I wish I had this book fifteen years ago.  However dear reader you can benefit from this book now. Our firm is meeting way to many companies who go lean in development (agile) without adjusting their management style. Ries gives these folks a process and  systems that can be used to dig themselves out of their holes. Most of the points are not new, we have been using them for decades. What is new is how they are strung together to dramatically improve a start ups chance to get traction , break out into huge income territory and prevent \\"the fail\\".  For example:<br /><br />  Startups must be and can be managed<br />  Use learning milestones vs goods produced<br />  A hundred tests is preferred to one big launch<br />  look for positive improvements in core metrics = market what the buyer will buy<br />  stay away from vanity metrics<br />  test your assumptions as you separate them from facts<br />  be thorough and thoughtful<br /><br />In technology a must read for all leaders.  Other leaders will benefit from this as well.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous CD.  One of the best I have ever purchased.  With some CDs you only get one or two great hits, this thing is packed.  Well worth the purchace price and then some.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to catch myself a number of times thinking this is going to get better. It does not. It continues to be a washed down love story. But...it is a cute little love story...and I guess that works for some people. With that said...it really needs to be in the \\"day time drama\\" section. Don't bother reading this if you want a little more than extra extra vanilla ;) Wait...this author was inspired by Twilight? Okay that was my bad for buying this book.<br /><br />Oh great....I just read they are going to make this into a movie trilogy. Okay...IM OUT!
0316174483|5.0|I've used this book to create fingerprint art with my 8th grade students and with my five year old at home. It's a guaranteed hit with kids (and adults).  Super easy to follow directions. Kids only need to be able to draw basic lines and dots to create adorable creatures, people, and other things.  I would recommend this to any parent or teacher.  A must have.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|After reading the product description for this book I thought it sounded great! After reading about half of the book I was really enjoying it. The beginning pulled me in and I started to love the characters.  Unfortunately the second half of the book just got kind of out of control.  Travis turned into a raging lunatic everytime a guy even looked at Abby and would beat them to a pulp and the whole mob situation was something that I just found really odd to put it in there randomly.  Plus Abby's character annoyed me to no avail! She was always saying how she felt strongly for Travis but would leave him, or decide they couldn't be together anymore. It was incredibly obnoxious! By the end of the book I thought it was just ok.. I thought the ending was cute though.  So overall the book was alright but not super great..

B001P9EQH8|3.0|I mainly got this to boost my headphone volume. After recently moving, my new train ride to work was quite loud. It was making it hard to hear some TV shows on my Galaxy S phone.<br /><br />Long story short, this item did boost the volume, but only about 20-25%. I was hoping for a bigger boost, but it will have to do.<br /><br />P.S.- This thing does increase the sound quality noticeably though, especially the base.
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|Love it! Mix of comedy and drama, without Jack Black being stupid or annoying. Steve Martin has transitioned nicely into a grown up actor. Wilson is Wilson - but he only knows how to play himself. I'd watch it again.

B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors' debut rewrote the songbook for how rock bands could behave. Essentially a power trio without a bass player, these four men bent and twisted conventional rock forms and dropped a fully-formed masterpiece on the first try. Jim Morrison exuded sensuality and anti-authoritarianism from the moment he opens his mouth on \\"Break On Through To The Other Side\\" and commands his followers to give up convention and follow him into his lizard kingdom.<br /><br />Drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger added texture more than structure, but the secret weapon was keyboardist Ray Manzarek. His organ and electric piano work often formed the foundations for the rest of the band to improvise on top of. The Doors could then run the gamut of stunning pop melodies (\\"Light My Fire\\") to the mystical (\\"Crystal Ship\\") all the way to the apocalyptic retelling of the oedipal complex, \\"The End.\\" The were also fearless enough to take a Kurt Weill song and utterly reclaim it, or make Willie Dixon's \\"Back Door Man\\" into a psychedelic blues rivaling Janis Joplin.<br /><br />If there was any problem with \\"The Doors,\\" it was that it's too perfect; The Doors had a hard time living up to the aftershock. Still, this was the birth of an American Classic Band, and \\"The Doors\\" maintains its potency 40 years later.
B00632HWOG|2.0|This app is all well and good as an email app should be on a kindle fire.  My problem came when it started displaying some old emails as blank with dates from 1969.  I would then delete those... Lo and behold my old emails I was saving were gone forever.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I downloaded two other calendar apps for free to try, and just kept coming back to CalenGoo.

I don't even remember which other apps I tried.
1451627289|5.0|The first Stephen King novel I read was The Green Mile.  I've enjoyed every King novel I've read, but tend to enjoy the ones that aren't horror, more than the rest.  11/22/63 was a fantastic piece of historical fiction.  The merging of such a powerful moment with the sci-fi element of time travel was superb.  It's always fun to discuss the \\"what ifs\\" about Kennedy's assassination, and King does it masterfully.  30 pages in I realized why I fell in love with Stephen King's writing in the first place.  Well done.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|I see a lot of movies and really-really LIKE mystery and spy flicks. While this does not move at the speed of light it really shouldn't considering the plot etc. It IS full of suspense and has outstanding actors, they did a great job with it. I bought it and highly recommend it. I read the book years ago and think the movie is right on-target! I will watch it again soon and again over the years.....
B0066W1AZK|5.0|cool as Shit . really cures a boring day at work. easy download easy to play. kid's love it too. wife learned how to play it too.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|You know how when you're walking through the park and the day is beautiful and then you look down and realize you've stepped into a big steaming pile of dog doo?<br />That's this movie.<br />I had heard it was terrible, but I thought I might be able to get some laughs from it.  No, not a one.  It was pure agony just to try and sit there while this movie played on my television.<br />It wasn't entertaining and I'm really glad I didn't pay anything to see it.<br />There's absolutely no plot.<br />There's absolutely no characters.  \\"How can this be?\\", you ask, I dare you to just try and watch this movie and you'll understand.<br />In fact, I've seen 30 second commercials that had more meaning to me, and more substance.<br />I've seen adult movies that had better storylines.<br />Here's this movie summed up.<br />A girl gets admitted to a terrible mental ward, that apparently only has female patients, by her evil stepdad to collect the money her recently deceased mother left her.  She's about to have a labotomy so that she can't tell the police anything about how horrible her stepdad has really been.  She goes off (in her mind) to create a fantasy world where the girls are all strippers and on the side fight off dragons, cyborgs, and steam powered Nazi's in barely any clothes (and certainly no protective armor).  Somehow, this is supposed to relate to getting all the girls out of the mental ward and away from abusive employees.  And somehow this movie is supposed to make sense.  She had the surgery at the end and is comatose.  The end!  Wow, what a great plotless, characterless, piece of cinema crap!!!!<br />The only good thing I can say about this movie is some of the CG work is fantastic and is beautiful to look at, but it can't save a movie that's missing a plot.<br />How did this movie ever get green-lit???!!!<br />DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!  The production value is amazing, but there simply is no plot.

B00166BL6Y|4.0|For some reason Jethro Tull kind of fell off my radar after just a few albums.  But still I had a certain affection for them back in the day--coupled with a kind of gratitude, you could say.  In the late '60s/early 70's, when I was growing up in southern Maine, there weren't all that many major label acts that would play in Portland or its environs.  Nowadays it's not at all uncommon, and in fact, less than 10 years after I first saw Tull at the Portland City Hall auditorium (not at all a bad venue, by the way),  the city's Civic Center was built, and it no longer was the case that you pretty much had to travel to Boston to see a major act.<br /><br />My friends and I caught Jethro Tull in the summer of '69, just before the release of their second album (and before OUR last year in high school).  We'd been listening to the first record, THIS WAS JETHRO TULL, for months prior,  so naturally the concert promised to be one of the summer's highlights (if not the whole year's).  But there was always that concern back then, that a \\"big group\\" might slack off for an audience in the hinterlands.  Jimi Hendrix had played a less than 45 minute set the year before.  There was no need to worry about Tull though, they were still a hungry band playing for a hungry audience.  They gave it pretty much their all, as I remember it, and the audience ate it up.<br /><br />Jethro Tull was at that point, Ian Anderson's group,  and I personally was unaware that it had ever been anything but.  Since the band dutifully performed a great deal of the first album's material in their set that night,  I don't think I would have ever given a thought to the fact that the group I was seeing on stage that night was, in many ways, a substantially different group than the one behind THIS WAS.  I'm not even sure I'd have recognized the name Mick Abrahams, come to think of it.  As far as I knew, Jethro Tull was all about the eccentric guy with the flute, the one standing on one leg half the time.<br /><br />And, yeah, Ian Anderson did have his hand in shaping the sound of this album, but its rootsier side most likely had a lot to do with Abrahams' blues vision.  If reports of their not getting along are accurate, it can still be viewed as a real shame (some 40 years on) that their professional association was short lived. Their give and take is evident, and the album, as a whole, worked very well indeed. This is not just standard issue British late 60s blues-rock by any means.  Anderson's artistic restlessness seems to have guaranteed that.  On the other hand, the bluesy touches that Abrahams brought to the table are pretty tasty too.<br /><br />You could say that the mix of American styles (jazz/blues) and British folk roots were what made the band somewhat unique.  I mean, you could say Traffic was covering the same turf, and they WERE.  But both groups were so distinctive that, for a time, it seemed like jazz-blues-rock-with-a-hint-of-folk was likely to be the next big thing.  It WAS a thing, of course, if not THE big thing.<br /><br />The 40th anniversary special edition may be mainly a \\"fans only\\" affair, with its multiple renditions of the same basic songs spread over two disks.  Devotees will no doubt welcome having both the original mono tracks AND the stereo remixes in the same package--to say nothing of some quality BBC live takes and other bonus material.  Very casual listeners will get a deja-deja-vu sensation if they play the records straight through.  The fact that the last track on Disc 2 (\\"Christmas Song\\") is preceded by its stereo mix a mere four tracks prior can be a bit disconcerting. Like so many special editions (and box sets), this is one package that may benefit from being listened to in discrete segments.<br /><br />Personally, I'm only too glad to have  the chance to get re-acquainted with the early Tull and find myself asking why they  didn't actually rate a little higher in my personal hierarchy. Who can say? All I know is that now thatwe're ALLstarting to look a bit more like the band did on the original cover shot, I'm finding it a most welcome re-connection.we're ALLstarting to look a bit more like the band did on the original cover shot, I'm finding it a most welcome re-connection.
0984334904|5.0|Now there we go... I'm learning some basic Kanji for an upcoming trip, and I was looking for some flashcards - these are beautiful cards, laminated with stroke order, useful phrases, and with the Kon and On pronunciations.<br /><br />Note that these cards do not have romanji - that is the romanized version of the pronunciation - thank goodness they don't waist any space with it... I've started learning japanese on my own about three weeks ago, by now I got my kana down, if you're ready to take on Kanji, you should be comfortable reading your kana - by the way, there was a cute laminated card with the Katakana and Hiragana on each side - quite nice actually. but good call on omiting the romanji.<br /><br />I started out with version 1 (beginner) with 300 basic Kanji I have my work cut-out... but when I'm done, I'm definitely buying the intermediate version.<br /><br />to wrap up, beautiful, professional, comprehensive and useful!!!
B007DA2FHG|5.0|This movie tells the store of the TRUE man's BEST friend. It was a very moving story that tells how  much friends will go through to be together again. The horses were very well trained. This is truly a master piece as only Mr. Spielberg can do.

B007FH9GT2|1.0|This is a poor remake of a good film. The american adaptation is a poor quality copy, instead of a unique interpretation. The thing I really enjoyed about the Swedish version aside from the great job of casting, acting and good story is the silence or space in the dialog. Just like some music, the space in between the notes is what makes it great, it's the same here with the dialog. The Swedish director uses the space in the dialog to great impact. The american version has no space between...

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I came across this book while on Twitter & was excited about it from the synopsis & admittedly, the cover. So excited in fact that I downloaded a Kindle app right away on my laptop, just so I could get started sooner! I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />I've been looking for something new & I found it with The Forever Girl. Rebecca Hamilton draws you in right away & I felt the connection with Sophia almost instantly. Sophia is an amazing character who is looking to find herself in the midst of trying to ignore the prejudices of many of those surrounding her. A true heroine that I wanted to stand behind & rally for.<br /><br />This was so well written & had me up into the early morning hours until I could no longer keep my eyes open. Twists & turns that kept my guessing until the very end. Definitely looking forward to the next book in the series!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love it-light weight, which is needed with the kindle fire & when I get tired of holding it I can use it as a stand which is what I wanted it for! Easy to keep clean & I like the color.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Torches sounds like what MGMT should have done to follow up Oracular Spectacular.  If you didn't like MGMT's 2nd album and want more of the 1st, Foster the People will make you happy.<br /><br />I'm also picking up influences of Modest Mouse here and there.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very interesting album.  Poppier that what I usually get, but still alt/indie enough to stay cool.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I picked this book up a while back before it was so prominently displayed.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The characters are well defined.  The story is thought provoking.  I hated to put this book down.  It wasn't what I consider a \\"page-turner\\" but it never lost my interest, I did want to find out what was going to happen.  The book took turns the reader doesn't anticipate.  I keep thinking about this story - that to me is a sign of a great read.
078689136X|4.0|\\"Naked Heat\\"<br />by Richard Castle*<br /><br />[[ASIN:078689136X Naked Heat (Nikki Heat)]]<br /><br />This book is the sequel to \\"Heat Wave\\". Although I haven't read  \\"Heat Wave\\" yet, I didn't feel lost. In fact, if you're a fan of the hit ABC TV show \\"Castle\\", you won't feel lost at all.<br /><br />The book presents itself as being the work of the title character of that show: Richard \\"Rick\\" Castle as portrayed superbly by Nathan Fillion. Nathan Fillion appears on the back cover; and the acknowledgments are written from Castle's point-of-view. Also, the cover and such present other books \\"by Castle\\" too.<br /><br />The TV show features writer Castle tagging along with the NYPD to research his novels, specifically Detective Kate Beckett, portrayed superbly by Stana Katic, upon whom Castle bases his fictional character Detective Nikki Heat.<br /><br />In the book, as in the show, a writer tags along with the police department too.<br /><br />If you love the show, you should love the book. They're basically the same. Except the TV show requires less reading.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book has less commercials.<br /><br />The key to understanding this novel as being a \\"written episode\\" is that Nikki Heat is Kate Beckett; Jameson Rook is Castle; Ochoa is Esposito; Raley is Ryan; Lauren Perry is Dr. Lanie Parish; and the Chief is the Chief and the writer's mother and daughter are the writer's mother and daughter, only with different names. (The characters match the characters from before Season 4. Season 4 has a different Chief.)<br /><br />Like episodes of the show, the book presents a mystery with intrigue, suspense, and smatterings of humor.<br /><br />Notice how both the names Castle and Rook are chess pieces.<br /><br />Also, the book contains an inside joke for Nathan Fillion fans by twice mentioning a pair of police officers named Malcolm and Reynolds. Nathan Fillion superbly portrayed the character Malcolm Reynolds in the TV show \\"Firefly\\" and the movie \\"Serenity\\".<br /><br />The book might contain other inside jokes as well, but that's the only one I got.<br /><br />Not being censored by TV panels and such, the book drops the occasional F-bomb and such, but overall remains true to the spirit and fun of the TV show.<br /><br />I found the book to be fun, engaging, and entertaining.<br /><br />Would you enjoy it if you're not a fan of  \\"Castle\\"? I would think so, but I can't say for sure. Because I am a fan.<br /><br />Blessings & Joy,<br />Dean Burkey<br />Author of \\"Monster Laughs\\"<br /><br />* Richard Castle is a character on the hit ABC TV show  \\"Castle\\", so I don't know who really wrote this book.\\"Serenity\\".<br /><br />The book might contain other inside jokes as well, but that's the only one I got.<br /><br />Not being censored by TV panels and such, the book drops the occasional F-bomb and such, but overall remains true to the spirit and fun of the TV show.<br /><br />I found the book to be fun, engaging, and entertaining.<br /><br />Would you enjoy it if you're not a fan of  \\"Castle\\"?

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Up until today I would have given this app 5 stars.  It is really easy to use which is super important for people like me who are not tech savvy at all.  One of the things that I have loved about it is that when I click on the \\"store\\" button, it takes me to the app version of Amazon.  Tonight when I clicked on \\"store\\", it took me to Amazon's actual Web page which is much more difficult to navigate on my little tablet (Samsung galaxy).  I'm hoping this is just a glitch and not an actual change.<br /><br />I had previously installed both the Kindle app and the Nook app, but after a month or so I realized that I liked the Kindle app much better and deleted the Nook app.  Now I'm hoping I don't have to go back to that one.  Please fix!!<br /><br />Okay. . . so about two days later I figured out that I may possibly have been the one who just didn't know what I was doing.  It's back to working for me now, so I have changed my review to 5 stars.  Love this app!
0439023491|3.0|I won't say \\"Catching Fire\\" was a bad novel. It wasn't. Though it lacked the brilliance of its predecessor, it was still a very compelling story with which I spent some enjoyable hours. Its problem is that it was something of a rehash.<br /><br />The first part of the book, with Katniss and Peeta back at home in District 12 and trying adapt to their new/old lives, navigate their conflicted relationship, and put the Hunger Games behind them while the upcoming Victory Tour looms over them, is excellent. The Victory Tour sequence itself was a great read. But then the author (and here are some brief spoilers) contrives a plot device that puts Katniss and Peeta back in the arena for the 75th Hunger Games.<br /><br />This was a disappointment to me because it wasn't the story I wanted to read. Far more interesting to me would have been to read about Katniss and Peeta dealing firsthand with the horrors of mentoring when the next Reaping took place. Think where the author could have gone with that: Prim could have been selected again, and Katniss wouldn't have been allowed to take her place a second time. Or one of Peeta's siblings, or one of Gale's (Gale being past the age for the reaping himself). Or perhaps Katniss's friend Madge who gave her the mockingjay pin. Things could have been complicated still further by having one of Gale's and one of Peeta's siblings both be tributes (I could see the Capitol engineering that). They could have arrived at the Capitol to learn that one of District 11's tributes was a sibling of Rue's who looked uncannily like her. Another direction the author might have taken would have been to put Haymitch back in the arena with Katniss if she was set on following the Quarter Quell angle. All of these plot alternatives could still have been used to ignite the coming war.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I think Suzanne Collins is an awesome storyteller. I just think that her decision to take \\"Catching Fire\\" in the direction she did made it a good story when it could have been a great story, and that the book was a true sequel and not a continuation of a great story arc.<br /><br />J.W.story when it could have been a great story, and that the book was a true sequel and not a continuation of a great story arc.<br /><br />J.W.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm not good at writing reviews. In fact this is my first review, I believe.<br /><br />Let me be honest, this isn't really the genre that I like to read. However, I was blown away by this book. I loved the characters. Like some other people here the Wiccan rites that Sophia performed were as realistic as I have found outside of the \\"technical\\" books I have sitting in a bookcase in my living room.<br /><br />Great characters, a fast paced (but not too fast paced) story line rounded it all out, and left me wanting more, MORE MORE! I can't wait until the next book is available!<br /><br />Great job Rebecca, great job!

030788743X|4.0|As a big fan of the 80s myself who quite unashamedly loves Transformers, John Hughes movies, ABBA and Journey songs, and so much else from the decade, this book's premise intrigued me from the start.  And while I have yet to read Neuromancer, which some of the jacket blurbs liken this book to, the concept of a game hidden within a vast information network was also one that caught my attention.  So when this book drifted virtually unannounced into our library, I had to check it out.<br /><br />I just have one word for this book -- SEQUEL.<br /><br />Okay, maybe three words -- SEQUEL and MOVIE!  (And yes, I usually loathe movies ripped straight from books, but this one seems like it would translate quite well to film in the hands of a good director.)<br /><br />Wade Watts is one of the millions on a near-future Earth who lives in destitution, and whose escape from the misery of his daily life comes in the form of OASIS, a sort of virtual-reality combination of the Internet and a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game for any who don't know the acronym).  Through OASIS, Wade attends school, hangs out with his best friend Aech, and participates in the great Egg Hunt.  For the creator of OASIS, an eccentric billionaire named Halliday, has hidden clues and puzzles within the vast universe of OASIS, all based on his beloved obsession with 80s pop culture, and whoever can unravel the clues and solve the puzzles will inherit his fortune.  And when Wade accidentally stumbles across the first puzzle, he finds himself an instant celebrity -- and square in the crosshairs of a corrupt corporation that will stop at nothing, not even real-world murder, to claim the prize for itself.<br /><br />This book is not perfect -- the writing style, as another reviewer put it, lacks artistry and isn't really anything to write home about (though it's a style that works and makes this book a relatively easy read).  There isn't a whole lot in the way of character development, and while the characters are generally likable and a joy to get to know (save Sorrento, the appropriately sinister and cocky villain), none of them are really explored in-depth.  SPOILERS FOLLOW!  And personally, I think the final battle with Sorrento came too early, and should have been saved for inside the third and final puzzle.  But that could just be personal preference talking.  END SPOILERS.<br /><br />I am willing to forgive the book's flaws, however, because it was just so dang fun to read.  I prided myself on knowing most of what the book was talking about, while at the same time boggling over the insane amount of detail given to researching the most obscure 80s games and shows.  The world of OASIS sounds so enticing that I find myself wishing someone in the real world would develop OASIS right now so I can get an avatar and explore.  And being one who practically lives on the Internet (yes, insert nerd joke here), I appreciated reading something that showed that friendships made online can be just as close and deep as ones made in real life.<br /><br />Mr. Cline, I will be watching you.  :)  And Hollywood, if there's a film option for this book, someone take it!d while the characters are generally likable and a joy to get to know (save Sorrento, the appropriately sinister and cocky villain), none of them are really explored in-depth.

0374275637|5.0|Kahneman's two systems of thinking provides a remarkably useful model of consciousness. Intuitively it feels dead-on right: while reading it I found myself constantly thinking, \\"Yeah, that's exactly how my mind works.\\" Plenty of details have been provided in other reviews. If you're interested in how the human mind forms conclusions that are sometimes valid and sometimes wildly invalid, read this book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great story of one of our true American heros.  The patriotism, self-sacrifice and the warrior's mentality to \\"go to the fight\\" can be felt throughout the entire story. This is a great read!
1451648537|5.0|This book captures the complexities and internal contradictions of one of the most fascinating and influential figures of the last hundred years. Until reading it I was unaware of the extent and scope of Job's achievements or his deep flaws. Despite the negativities in his life, however, I found the book inspiring for its lessons in how to pursue, and sometimes create, a product that approaches perfection. This book is well written and highly readable.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game. I was getting kind of bored with the old one but now I have a new entertainment source. the game is great took some time to install though. for a buck it is a great app.
B004A8EI9M|4.0|The only reason why I'm giving this series 4 stars and not 5 is because I kind of felt it was too short. There's only 6 shows and it's really quick compared to season 2.<br /><br />Yes, I know this is the same old Hero leads a bunch of people out of this Zombie hell of the world story again, but the formula works. I love it! In this show, the formula kind of changes. You get to know the characters more and more, but they will end up died. The zombies will eventually find and kill a character you grown to like/love, and you don't know who is next to die!<br /><br />You might think that in all zombies shows, you know a bunch of people and they will die eventually, but it's different with this show. You don't usually get to know those people that MUCH! You really get the feeling that anyone could get caught by a zombie and get infected and just turn into one at anytime, anywhere.<br /><br />In the story Rick is pretty much the only 1 person, you know for sure, he will not get turned it a zombie. The only reason for that is because he is the MAIN CHARACTER! No, not just a main character, THE MAIN CHARACTER. A main character can still be likely get turned or die in this series.<br /><br />The story follows Rick and what he is doing most of the time. The show also shows other people like Rick wife, son, and best friend and what they are doing. Rick is trying to find his wife and son, but unkonwn to him is where they are. He believes that they are safe and unharmed, but doesn't know where they are. He gets pieces of info from people he meets to where his family might be.<br /><br />The people in this story continue to find themselves never ever being save. Even if they think they are \\"safe\\", they eventually are not safe and have to keep on moving and finding somewhere safe.<br /><br />I did not wait to watch season 2 after finishing season 1. Season 1 was awesome and I knew I had to keep on watching to the next season 2. Hint: Season 2 is even better than 1!!!
B001NB3L9C|5.0|not a review, a question....... is it just my bad memory or did i really used to own this album, but it was called sell out / a quick one all in one album? call me crazy, rita.
B007M6P01O|5.0|This show is AWESOME!!!<br /><br />I went from season 1 to season 2 in one day. I just had to keep on watching to find out what's next? Who is going to die next? Where they going to go next?<br /><br />I couldn't stop watching for longer than a hour. After finishing season 2 I was sad that I had to wait till October before season 3 starts. But knew I had to wait even longer before the whole season 3 finish before I start watching it. I hate watching week by week, so I won't do that and am very sad that I have to force myself to stay away from this series like this. But, I know it's for the better because it's torture for me to watch weekly.<br /><br />Season 2 picks right up from season 1. Rick is trying to find the group of people to a safe place to stay. They end up at the CDC building and think they are safe there, when the doors are lock shut and no zombies can ever break in. They manage to get in, but later they find out they have to leave again for a different reason than zombies. Yet another character will die at this location but I won't say who.<br /><br />Rick and the group now are back on the road and trying to find another location to stay safe at. They end up at this farm and they will be there until the end of this season. They are fairly safe at this location. But, what they are really doing is trying to locate a missing party member when they get to the farm. That is why they stay at the farm for so long.<br /><br />When the group eventually leaves the farm, few people in the main party will die, but they will pick up new party member in the group going into season 3.<br /><br />I really can't wait for this awesome series to start up and end, so that I can watch it all in one shot later on. :)<br /><br />I highly recommend this series if you love zombies!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|The soundtrack is unique, the plot is exciting, the suspense is palpable, the acting is great. David Fincher really nailed it with this work. I'm surprised it did so poorly at the box office.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|For those who really appreciate the movie \\"Act of Valor\\" for what it is, you should all read about Michael A. Monsoor, a Navy SEAL from SEAL Team 3 (Delta Platoon) who received the Medal of Honor for his Act of Valor. He sacrificed his life to save the lives of his teammates in the same way it was shown in the movie. Therefore, this movie represents reality. I honor you, Michael Monsoor, and all the men and women who defend this country.

B001A5HBJC|3.0|I've only watched about 1 1/2 seasons and I just couldn't get any further than that. It's really an interesting show and lots of mystery and good writing. But to get to the good stuff, you have to sit for 2/3 of the show watching slow and boring dialog. They really draw out the scenes and it gets boring. If they just got straight to the point I would love it, but the in between was just too much and I got too bored. Been a while since I watched it and I really have to be in the mood to watch it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found the story line of the first of the trilogy engaging but the multiple sex romps and orgasms got really boring. I found myself scanning those parts. By the 3rd book, I had to really struggle to finish it. The \\"I love you Mr. Grey and I love you Mrs. Grey\\" got really old. I am all for romance but her struggles with not wanting to be submissive and then wanting to go into the Red Room got really old. I admit I was left hanging after the first book because I wanted to see if she gave into his ways or he gave into her ways but the 2nd and 3rd books were hard to get through.

030746363X|2.0|I downloaded this book to my Kindle and started reading it a couple of weeks ago. At first I was very excited by the promises in this book, such as rapid weight loss, hopeful injections that I was not fated to my genetic disposition, etc. I think he even hinted at cellulite loss.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />I found the first few chapters to be very misleading when I finally arrived at the Slow Carb diet chapters. He gives the illusion that what is popular is often wrong and can be replaced by eating what I want with little exercise and I will still lose weight with only some small changes. Yes, I was very skeptical and by the time I reached the Slow Carb diet chapters my skepticism was confirmed. This diet has many bad/undesirable qualities, but the biggest disappointment was the requirement of beans and the elimination of all white carbs!!! I love potatoes. I hate beans! I hate the taste, I hate the texture, but I didn't give in yet, instead, I went to the forums in hopes of finding an option to replace beans. Unfortunately, there were none, there is little if any flexibility with this diet. It was suggested by some that lentils and edamame might bring peace to the bean haters world. If I had to eat lentils and edamame with every meal for the rest of my life I would become a very unpleasant person. Then there is the no cheese requirement (this diet eliminates almost all dairy). I am a middle-aged woman and calcium is one of the most important dietary needs for woman of my age group. I have also read many articles that calcium (including cheese) actually aids in weight loss. I am not so sure calcium supplements is a viable replacement. I am not so sure Tim took into account the all the needs of woman and picky eaters when he wrote this book. Lastly, Tim doesn't seem to be very helpful in giving options for his more expensive food suggestions such as purchasing only grain fed meats and many other organic foods. Many people can barely afford to eat this way. Again I went to the forums for helpful hints, but found little useful knowledge in regards to reducing the cost of the Slow Carb diet other than not buying organic and grain fed meats!<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />The book is an interesting read. Although I will never do the Slow Carb diet, it did make me aware of what I eat. After finishing those chapters, I brought quite a few items in my pantry to the local food bank. Upon seeing all those foods sitting out on the kitchen counter I realized why I was failing at losing the weight. So I guess, if anything, the book might make you aware even if you don't follow his suggestions fully. I did find helpful suggestions on how to stick to the path I want to take.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best book ever, but you will need to read the rest kf the Hunger Games series. That being said, this book give s you the atachment to the characters so stronglg that you almost wnt to cry when somethibg bad happens to them. Even when I was finished I spent the longest amount of DAYS just thinking about it. easly the best of the Hunger Games serries. A must buy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|There are many other reviews that summarize and provide reasons why you should read this.<br /><br />That's great...More people should read it.<br /><br />But all I want to do its thank the author for the gift of this book.  I am having so much fun reading it for the first time, and I know I'll be reading it again (and again).  Thank you for transporting me to a new time and place, for showing me new people in a complex and fascinating society, for the wonderful fun of exploring a new world that feels so real, like it could have, our might still, be.

B000002U82|5.0|ok, you may say BEATLES, LED ZEPPELIN, ROLLING STONES or THE DOORS are as great as PINK FLOYD...But none of those great great bands have an album like DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...This album is trully a classic...more than this, Dark Side is a LEGEND!!! I think it´s even more popular than Sg. PEPPERS from the Beatles or the LED ZEPPELIN IV....ALL THE WORLD recognizes the importance and impact this gem got on music...All the songs are amazing...Just a perfect trip through progressive rock perfection!
B004XZR63M|4.0|This is not a get-rich-quick book. It is an introduction to the way the average working/middle class American thinks about money and spending, and how it hurts them in the long run! Even if you do not desire to own your own business, or take an accounting course-this book will make you desire to get something in return for your hard-earned money! I highly recommend it because it will be a benefit for this reason alone.
B0052U59F4|1.0|This was without a doubt the worst book I've ever read.  It was written in redundant simpleton language that was boring at best.  Don't know why I got caught up in the media hype and bought this book.  It wasn't interesting or exciting.  It was predictable and slow.  I wish I hadn't bought the sequels.
0525478817|5.0|I actually picked up the book at my school library,(my school buys John Green's books because of me) the book was so good that I bought it. I have never done that before, then I read it for a third time.

1609410416|4.0|I'm a big fan of Ellen DeGeneres and of celebrity memoirs. She's one of my favorite comedians and I enjoy quite a bit of her stand-up. I was excited to check out this book to see what sort of things she would write about. While it's not exactly a memoir, there are certain things that she does touch on in the book. It's most certainly not a \\"life story\\" book, so if you're looking for one of those, you will be disappointed. American Idol is just touched on and her wife Portia only gets a short mention once every few chapters.<br /><br />This book is really just a bunch of anecdotes, but at times it is more than that. Ellen questions a lot of things that are commonplace in our society. Why are we not impressed with the simple things in life? Why are we so do dependent on technology? Why are we never happy? It's a lot more introspective than I would have expected.<br /><br />There's definitely a lot of funny stuff, so don't worry that it's all philosophical. In fact, I think a lot of the thought provoking undertones won't really matter much to people - they just want to laugh. There are times, though, when Ellen seems to ramble. Especially near the end of the book. However, all the chapters are pretty short, so if a \\"bit\\" isn't working, rest assured it will be over soon.<br /><br />If you \\"read\\" this book, I highly suggest reading it in audiobook form. Ellen adds a lot of stuff for the listener and it definitely adds to the experience.
B007DIQB50|4.0|I must say she has transitioned accordingly musically. I don't understand how come people dont see that Nicki is a musician not a Hip Hop Artist ! My only problem, and its not even that serious of a problem is she did definitely tame down her lyrical ability on the rap tracks. When I saw she had a track with Beenie Man I got excited only to hear it not be a true reggae & hip hop track but its actually a very good song, lol. That is how I describe this album as a whole. What is not expected is actually better than originally expected ! She has done her homework and deserves everything good that comes to her musically !!!!!
1594203334|4.0|I had heard about this book from my mother in law, and decided to give it a read. I am so glad I did! We have four young children, ages 5 and under, and this book pertained to all of them!<br />I loved getting a different perspective from a middle woman on how another country raises their children. I thought it was well written, and actually gave some valid, useful advice.<br />I would recommend this for anyone with young children. I wish I would have read it with my first to try a couple different things! Especially the sleep thing. \\"Pause\\" seems like a wonderful thing :)

0756405890|5.0|The writing in this book is so good it's almost poetic. The world is interesting and offers up a large mythology that I found really cool to learn about, and Rothfuss definitely leaves room for even more revelations about this place. Kvothe is a very cool character, and I think his adventures are something that people could really get into. Rothfuss is a tremendous writer, and I can't wait to continue on with Kvothe and his stories.

B0054JELS4|4.0|I have followed NCIS since it's inception (two episodes on JAG) but my wife was not that interested.  Last year, my wife started watching the re-runs and was a little confused (they are almost never in any particular order) so I suggested that we get the set.  Well, she bought me season one and when we finished watching that (in less than one month) she said, \\"What am I going to do now - I can't go back to watching the re-runs\\" (I'm sure she would if she had to).  I ordered the complete set (Seasons 1-8) and she was happy when they arrived.  Now, when it is not nice outside, we can continue watching.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis can tell a story like no other.  In fact, even before I finished reading his \\"The Big Short,\\" I wanted to work the book into every conversation I had. The story was that interesting and compelling.  Anyone who can take the financial crisis of the last few years, find a story in it that centers around subprime mortgages and shorting the market (if you understand what that means and how to do it, you're more than a step ahead of me and about anyone else I've mentioned it to over the last couple weeks), and then make it interesting to the lay reader deserves to be read.<br /><br />In many ways (if not all ways), the stock market is a giant enigma to me, which suggests how Winston Churchill once described Russia: \\"I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.\\" If there is a key to the enigma, with that riddle wrapped in a mystery inside it, that is the stock market, perhaps the key is found in the self-interest of the individuals participating in the market. Not just the stock and bond traders that made up the named characters of \\"The Big Short,\\" but even the home buyers and owners that took out second, third, and fourth mortgages, bought two, three, and four \\"investment\\" properties, the loan originators who sought them out and offered no interest loans, and the banks that sliced up the loans to fill tranches (there's another cryptic word for you) for trading as bonds to and between the financial houses on Wall Street.<br /><br />In other words, as Gordon Gecko might say: greed. Greed of bonds traders, floor traders, home buyers, loan originators, strawberry pickers, and house cleaners. Greed by just about everyone involved, from the top all the way down to the bottom.<br /><br />Lewis, known for his writing in \\"The Blind Side\\" and in \\"Money Ball,\\" with \\"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\\" returns to his original stomping ground covered in \\"Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street.\\" Finding the few who saw the crash coming, he pulls together a narrative about those who anticipated the crash and saw it coming. While so many were getting rich off trading subprime mortgage based bonds, a few individuals realized that the underlying assets to the housing bubble were not stable and predicted that as interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages became due, defaults would sky-rocket and the bonds' values would crash.<br />And then they bet against it, cashing in lucratively when the predicted defaults began.<br /><br />What makes the story fascinating, of course, is the attention to the often colorful and more than slightly eccentric personalities that comprised the handful of individuals in the story. The stock market is difficult to understand for a simple reason-its workings are data driven and few pay the price to understand the numbers and analysis behind the market. In contrast, those who did, and those who got lucky, were often driven by a narrow-minded focus the data. From a neurologist turned hedge fund manager diagnosed with Aspergers in the midst of the story to a couple of young college grads who all but lucked into it, to a loud mouthed malcontent who made a habit of sticking it to the big wigs on Wall Street who lost investors money to the crisis, the \\"The Big Short\\" is replete with Lewis's deft story telling.<br /><br />Whether you are interested in finance or just looking for a great story, \\"The Big Short\\" is worth the time to read. I listened to it in the car, and often found myself sitting in the driveway waiting for the end of a section. More, it introduced me to concepts and interests that I'm exploring further in other books. Read in conjunction with \\"Too Big to Fail,\\" which I read last year, it provides an up close look at what was going on and why our economy is dragging through the longest recession in a generation.<br /><br />One last observation: one aspect that this book noted that continues to shock me no matter how many times I hear it over the last four years is how people with little or no credit history or ability managed to get so much financing. From immigrant strawberry pickers in California with $750,000 mortgages to house cleaners in Brooklyn with four and five town homes, obtuse financial incentives to originators and investors alike distorted the market in ways that were dangerous to all of us. While I look forward to other financial histories for other perspectives, Lewis seems to make clear that it wasn't so much the free market that failed, but the financial incentives that were built into it. In the end, the old adages \\"if it's too good to be true, it probably is\\" and \\"there's no such thing as a free lunch\\" seem even more relevant today than ever. Be careful when the snake oil salesman comes calling. He may not have your best interests at heart, and he may not even know it himself.ect that this book noted that continues to shock me no matter how many times I hear it over the last four years is how people with little or no credit history or ability managed to get so much financing.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really liked this book -- lots of layers, solid character development, nuances and food for thought<br />Well written with an interesting twist at the end -- don't read forward just let it happen!<br />A classic \\"everything is not as it seems\\" book that asks some tough questions especially for those of us who are parents of teens -- what is normal teen behavior and what should raise some flags. The author also has a keen grasp of social media and how it impacts our kids everyday lives that we have no idea of<br />Four stars and worth the time
0061564893|1.0|On a scale of 1 to 10, this book is junk.<br />_______________<br />It's rare that I would waste space blasting a book. Life is short and time is a scarce resource. I'd rather just drop a book unworthy of finishing and move on to a new one. This time, though, I think 1421 merits further explanation because of the sensational success it has experienced worldwide.<br /><br />Simply put, 1421 is junk history posing as \\"real history.\\" Gavin Menzies has spun a fantastical and interesting tale out of the very real events surrounding the massive Chinese treasure fleets of 1421. His thesis-that the Chinese discovered the New World in the 1420s, mapped it, and that it was their maps that European explorers used when sailing for the New World (including, he argues, Columbus).<br /><br />Built by a Ming emperor to gather in tribute from the ends of the Earth, the fleet was one of the last acts of imperial hubris. Shortly after it set sail, the emperor died. His son, in replacing his father's policies, had the fleets destroyed upon their return, along with records gathered during the voyage. Starting with that sparse introduction, Menzies proceeds to gather bits and pieces of evidence stretching from China itself to the Indian subcontinent, from the Congo to Patagonia and beyond, and levies the evidence to tell a tale of the massive Chinese fleet charting the New World the greater part of a century before Columbus set sail in 1492.<br /><br />It is an extremely interesting and, if it were true, a ground breaking discovery and thesis. Perhaps it is true. But likely, it is not.<br />As I started reading it, the first question that came to mind for me was this: in the almost six centuries since these events happened, why has no one else suggested that the Chinese arrived first? Menzies explanation is that historians generally lack the skill set necessary to uncover the truth, a skill set that he has as a former captain in the British Navy. Unlike most historians, Menzies argues, he can read a chart, understand what he's looking at, and glean from these 15th century charts things that no historian would otherwise notice.<br /><br />Yeah. It's a bit of a stretch. I would be surprised to find that no historian has ever had the skill set to learn maritime charts and understand how to read them (heck, Theodore Roosevelt when only an undergraduate student at Harvard, researched and wrote a book of naval strategy -- \\"The Naval War of 1812\\"-that became a classic and a text-book used by both the US and British navies for decades after it was published). That being said, I gave Menzies the benefit of the doubt. I've long been intrigued with China and its history, and I think I wanted to believe that history as we have been taught might not be true. How interesting would it be for America to have been discovered by the Chinese?  Nothing like a bit of sensationalism to sell books.<br /><br />As I read, though, red flags continued to pop up. Out of only sparse details, Menzies would assert \\"conclusive proof\\" that his theories were finding relevance. Finally, over two hundred pages in, I decided to check into what critical review might have said about his methods and evidence. I reasoned that if Menzies is correct, or even has a good theory, then the academic community would support his findings with further research. I went to the internet.<br /><br />Critical acclaim was anything but what I found. In addition to finding entire sites dedicated to debunking Menzies myths, I also found that historical lectures had been given explaining and demonstrating that what Menzies proposed was just that-a proposal. Be it even true, the evidence was not there, not was the reasoning clearly logical.<br /><br />For example:<br />-Menzies claims that Chinese anchors have been found off of the coast of California, but fails to document them.<br />-1421 says that Chinese DNA is found in North America natives, but fails to account for the influx of Chinese immigrants in the 17th century.<br />-Menzies finds what he claims are chickens unique to Asia living in Peru, but fails to note that Peru exported millions of tons of silver to China and brought back silk and porcelain (and presumably other things, like, for example, chickens) throughout the heyday of the Spanish during the 16th through 17th centuries.<br /><br />And that's just to start.<br /><br />Historian Kirstin A. Seaver says, in dissecting claims about the Chinese in Vinland:<br /><br />\\"The study of history is likely to reward anyone willing to undertake it in a quest for better understanding of who they are, how they became what they are, and what they might hope to become. The manufacture of a history that never existed rewards only those who make money by deceiving the public.\\"<br /><br />If 1421 is true, Menzies has not found the evidence to support it. If it is false, it's junk and a waste of time to read. Further, it perpetuates a falsehood that makes the acquisition knowledge about history-real, boring, dry and factual history-that much harder to grasp.e 17th century.<br />-Menzies finds what he claims are chickens unique to Asia living in Peru, but fails to note that Peru exported millions of tons of silver to China and brought back silk and porcelain (and presumably other things, like, for example, chickens) throughout the heyday of the Spanish during the 16th through 17th centuries.<br /><br />And that's just to start.<br /><br />Historian Kirstin A.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|This may not be Speilberg's best movie - indeed it is a long way from it. And the only reason the hokey old story worked on stage was because of the amazing puppet work. but the one thing this film did that was just amazing was to get one of the best acting performances ever committed to film from Sarah Jessica Parker. How she never got an Oscar nomination is a crime.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I generally am not a huge fan of romance novels, but decided to give this book a try after all the hype. It somehow managed to be even worse than my negative expectations.<br /><br />The bizarre thing about this book is that it reads like an SAT Vocabulary novel. It's as though the author used a thesaurus to insert random and often misused adjectives and adverbs. She also used modern British slang throughout the novel, which was bizarre considering the main character is supposed to be a young American girl who has never left the country. Not sure why she would say bloody hell in her inner dialogue. I also was ready to scream if the author used the word murmur, crap, or her inner goddess one more time.<br /><br />The characters were lackluster as well. Anastasia Steele is written in a manner similar to Bella Swan. She is boring, has no personality, and any woman can easily insert herself into the role. I also found it bizarre that the author spent so much time discussing how she almost never ate. Like the weird sexual situation had an added perk of anorexia. I also didn't really find myself hot and bothered over Christian Grey. The descriptions were a bit weak, but that might have also just been my personal preferences.<br /><br />The sex scenes were alright. It seemed like every time he touched her it was mind-blowing. It became somewhat repetitive. There were a few scenes with some bondage etc., but it wasn't the majority. Also the descriptions yet again were somewhat odd and off putting. She needed to come up with a different way to say down there or her sex.<br /><br />All in all, the writing was poor and the diction was distracting. I thought the characters were also dull. So I would recommend reading something else instead.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I only give this book one star because I can't give it no stars.  The entire book is filled with murder, death, torture, manipulation, and in general a total disregard for humanity as a whole.  I just want to make sure that people aren't buying into the hype and handing it over to their children thinking it would be a nice bedtime story.  It wouldn't, trust me.  I am an adult, an avid reader of fiction, horror, science fiction, fantasy and romance.  This book has made me sick to my stomach, and I have a very strong stomach.
0307959856|2.0|Let me put it this way: I am never bored with Jane Austen and I'm never bored with P.D. James.  But I really had to force myself to finish this book.  It's a curiosity.  But it's neither good Jane nor good James.
0071762345|5.0|Seriously. I cannot say enough good things about this book. I'm only halfway through and it is amazing. I fold down the corners of the pages I want to come back to and remember, and it's basically every page!!!

1594202842|5.0|This is a fairly controversial book (or at least the excerpt of the book the WSJ published was) and Amy Chua and her family got a great deal of heat over it. I don't think judging Chua and her family after only reading the WSJ article would be fair. The book tells of the journey Chua takes as a parent and she shares the changes in her perspective and parenting style as her younger daughter rebelled.  I loved and appreciated her honesty. At times during reading I really thought this lady was crazy, but I couldn't help but admire her strength. I'm not saying I want to be like her but I do respect her.  And being an Asian-American, I must add that the book was pretty funny (it's a bit of self parody as well as a memoir), but readers who are not familiar with the Asian culture may not get the humor. I listened to the audio, read by Amy Chua, which I loved because I got to hear it the way the author meant it to be heard.<br /><br />Even though this book was not meant to be a parenting how-to, here are some of the things I learned:<br />1. Don't assume your child is weak. Assume strength. Children live up to the expectations parents set for them (I've seen examples this not only in this book but also in lives of friends and family, both Westerners and Asians).<br />2. Teach your children work ethics. For Chua, she chose piano and violin as ways for her children to learn work ethics, but those are not for everyone. Whatever the outlet is, don't let your child quit because it's hard. Nothing is fun until you are good at it, and you won't be good at it until you practice, and children don't practice on their own.<br />3. Verbal encouragement gives children confidence, but results give them more confidence. They see for themselves what they can do which in turn creates inner motivation.<br /><br />Growing up in two different cultures, my dad frequently said to me, \\"There are goods and bads in both cultures; take only the good.\\" And at the close of this book, Chua was coming to this understanding as well (albeit very hesitantly but Chua even realizes that and makes fun of herself for it). It was the love for her younger daughter and  the fear of losing her that Chua put down her iron will and questioned her Chinese way of parenting.  And like any good parent, whether they are Asians or Westerners, she learned that the most important thing in the world is the relationship she has with her own children.
0316066524|5.0|This book is everything the 90's ever was or wanted to be. The twisting plot takes place in a dystopian near-future where each year has advertising rights sold on it. To keep track of all the characters would drive anyone crazy. To keep track of every plot point would take longer than actually reading the book. This book is smart, funny, angsty, and witty. It reflects the time it was written in and it holds up as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century.

0553382179|5.0|Organizing my house comes naturally.  Organizing my time does not.  I was very skeptical of a book that told me first to clean my sink.  But her system is very clear: Instead of making the same lists over and over, make them once and store them in a notebook.  Yes, there is more to it than that, but just understanding that helped me out so much.  Now I have a nice notebook that is easily understandable by anyone in the family so others can help me keep up with daily, weekly, and monthly routines.  I was even able to put these principles to work in 2011 to make my own Christmas Control Journal which was put to use this past Christmas.  Things flowed much more smoothly than past holidays.  The book cheers you on each step of the way and is written in such a way that you know the author understands what you are going through, which she does since she was in our shoes one time, too.  I usually just recommend books that I like.  This one I have bought and given as a gift.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good app. though it does deal a lot of losing hands even when you choose &quot;deal winning hand&quot; that's my only complaint.

006112429X|3.0|This is a heck of a story, and really stays with you -- but the writing is just awful.  Sophomoric, even.  It's supposed to a set of letters to an absent husband, but nobody writes letters like that.  It's as if Shriver used her thesaurus completely indiscriminately.  I'm a literature professor, so this is not a refusal of complex sentences (I love Henry James).  But this prose style is both awkward and tortured.<br /><br />It's a nasty story, and compelling the way highway pileups are compelling, but it really isn't believable.  There are so many moments where you can hear the soundtrack in your head: oh no!  A rare fragile pet!  Oh no!  A trusting sister!  Eeek!  A teacher who likes Kevin!  Still, the portrait of an evil child has a certain camp appeal.
0345803485|5.0|I was skeptical before downloading the book, based on the reviews that I had seen. But I went with my gut and started reading. Thankfully I did, because under all the shades of grey you will find a modern day love story that's beyond compare. The first book is very heavy, and I can see why some people were writing that they were disgusted with the behavior of the male character. However, once you progress to the second and third books, you start to unfurl the many layers of this book, and the many layers of Christian Grey. You see this man make a total transformation because of love, which was very touching. It became so addicting to me that I finished all 3 books in 4 days and left me wanting to hear more about the 2 characters. These books really bring out your inner emotions. You'll experience laughter, anger and joy.<br />The book is slightly repetitive though, but I can see why the author chose to write this way. You have to remember that the characters are only 22 and 28.<br /><br />I love this series of books, and cannot wait for the author to continue the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this series for anyone looking for a good read.<br /><br />If you start 1 book you MUST finish all 3 to get the clearest picture of the story!!!

I was curious to see what all the hype was about and I'm quite disappointed that many of my fellow sisters think this is a good read. Yes, the erotica started off a little titillating, but then became so repetitive and dull, I skimmed it. The story is poorly written and becomes quite tedious.  Silly plot and cardboard, unlikable characters.<br /><br />I read someone paid $5 million for the movie rights. Well, you know what they say - \\"there's a sucker born every minute!\\"

Every single cent of your money worth.

The following installments developed the tale in a logical, believable and chilling fashion, explaining the society and the technology without sacrificing suspense.  I stayed up far too late reading this.<br /><br />Mr. Howey writes beautifully.  This work is free of the grammatical infelicities that mar so many self-published books.  I'd recommend it for that alone.<br /><br />This is my first five-star review.  I look forward to reading a great deal more of Mr. Howey's work, and hope he has a long and prolific writing career.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|A spin-off from \\"Shrek\\" series, \\"Puss in Boots\\" provides a surprisingly entertaining romp. But Oscar contender? I don't know, though I really enjoyed watching the film. Anyway, directed by Chris Miller (\\"Shrek the Third\\"), the light-hearted adventure movie succeeds by not taking itself too seriously, just like the titular sword-wielding cat sporting a plumed hat.<br /><br />The new DreamWorks animation follows the story of Puss in Boots (voice by Antonio Banderas) before meeting Shrek and his friends. After his plan to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill is sabotaged by a mysterious thief, the outlaw cat encounters his childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (voice by Zach Galifianakis). The storyline, inspired by such famous fables, folklores and fairy tales as \\"The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\\" and \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is predictable but good enough for rollicking adventures including the joyful \\"dance fight\\" sequence.<br /><br />The screenwriter team wisely avoided pop culture references that would be tiresome in this new chapter. A new female character Kitty Softpaws, a master pickpocket (voice by Banderas's \\"Desperado\\" co-star Salma Hayek) appears, but the \\"Puss in Boots\\" is light on romance and heavy on action set-pieces. Those who prefer the quirky touch of \\"Rango\\" will find the characters and storytelling too conventional, but \\"Puss in Boots\\" remains enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />As far as story and visuals go, \\"Puss in Boots\\" breaks no new ground, with familiar storyline and action sequences, but it still manages to be entertaining throughout.

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I find this book intriguing simply because the author did a brilliant job within his own cultural frame (Scandinavia as a setting and investigative journalism as a tool) raising the alarm about social and gender injustices and crimes... It is even more brilliant thanks to the medium he chose - a detective thriller... Another brilliant twist: even though the main character is a man readers actually are more taken by and fascinated with Salander... and perhaps this is what he has always intended? A female protagonist, who is seemingly a secondary character, but in fact not! Maybe this is how it is in life - men are on the forefront, but are they really?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, is an action-packed book, written in first person. It is a great futuristic fiction novel. It is about sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the frowned-upon, poor District Twelve. Each year, a boy and a girl from ages twelve-eighteen, from each of the twelve districts are chosen to fight in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a cruel event to remind the districts that the Capitol has power over everything. It is also a televised happening when twenty-four boys and girls are pitted against each other, to fight to the death. Will Katniss be selected to compete in this cruel episode? If so, will she survive? Read The Hunger Games and find out! I think that this is a great book because there are a lot of cliffhangers, and you always get hooked, and want to find out more.  This book can get gory and graphic occasionally, so I would recommend this to ages thirteen-adult.<br /><br />Are you looking for good book with lots going on? If you are, STOP and read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games is about a city with twelve districts held in tight reigns by the capitol. Each year every district sends one boy and one girl to an arena to fight to the death. When 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen's little sister is chosen by the lottery to compete in the annual Hunger Games, she steps in to take her sister's place. This is my favorite book and I would give it five stars. Although I loved this book, I thought it was a really scary and graphic book, and I would not recommend it to anyone below the age of ten. I hope you have decided to read The Hunger Games and enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good concept. I love the fact that you get &quot; persistance points&quot; if you play the same game 5 times in a row you get bonus points. the set up is easy however. the more games you play the more games you unlock!

B006PTZNSY|5.0|Nicki Minaj is untouchable. No hip-hop artist has ever been able to, or attempted to infuse pop and hip-hop on the same album. I think that's what scares people away. I wish people would stop trying to dissect whats \\"pop\\" and whats \\"hip-hop\\" and listen to the music!  Female hip-hop artists are like slaves and as soon as they step out of line people throw STONES. Truth is, versatility is what makes for longevity and excitement in the rap industry. Lil Wayne can do rock, Drake can do R&B, why can't Nicki do a little pop? I love that Nicki is opening doors and reinventing the \\"female hip-hop artist\\".  I don't think people will realize what Nicki Minaj is doing until years down the line when new female hip-hop artist are following Nicki's blueprint on how to do it. PS. Come on a Cone defecates on everything moving.
B0072PUC7W|5.0|Pay no attention to the man behind the 3-star review.  I mean really!  Are we listening to the same CD?<br /><br />So many great tunes.<br /><br />Disc 1: The new Roger Shah/Sunlounger tune Try to Be Love is one of my favorites.  Always love Roger Shah and Sunlounger and this song continues his great Sunlounger Series.<br /><br />In your arms by Andy Moor features the smooth, creamy vocals of Jessica Sweetman-a hands in the air tune for sure.<br /><br />Don't miss \\"Always Loved, Never Forgotten\\" by Tenishia and Suddenylt Summer by AVB.  Classic Trance.<br /><br />Disc 2:  This WHOLE CD is EPIC.  Starts off with Ashley Wallbridge (Look for his new CD-it's amazing too!) and proceeds to steal your mind for the next 60+ minutes.<br /><br />0rgan Nilsen's Amsterdam, the dance floor favorite \\"Kinetic\\" by Abstract Vision & Elite Electronic and the Trance Anthem \\"Concrete Angel\\"-Gareth Emery remixed by John O'Callaghan will simply steal your consciousness.<br /><br />I too was fortunate enough to attend Beyond Wonderland in March.  What an amazing event.  Music lovers from all over the world experiencing a truly one-of-a-kind and once-in-a-lifetime event.  Thank You AVB, Aly & Fila, John O'Callaghan, Sied van Riel, Arty, ATB, and Gareth Emery.  All of your music has changed my life.  Gotten me out of my \\"comfort zone\\", taught me to let go on the dance floor, and opened my mind to a world I didn't even know existed.<br /><br />Get this CD-Go see these people live, your life will never be the same.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|I read the reviews and decided to give this browser a shot. The thing that this browser can do that impressed me was the ability to set up gesture movements for tasks. For a device with a captive screen like the Fire this may not really be that important but on a device with a resistive screen, my Creative Ziio, this feature is amazingly helpful. Resistive screens, for those who don't know, have a lack of support for multi-touch either at all or not very well when they appear to. Being able to use gestures allow me to zoom in and out quicker than it would be to get the (+) and (-) up.<br /><br />There are so many other great features others have mentioned but to me and for my situation, this feature tops the cake.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|I was taken aback when I first heard of this project. Why? was all I could think of. I still don't know why - it will take more listens to figure that out.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I didn't really understand how cruel and hard life was during the Great Depression until watching this movie. In a previous review of To Kill a Mockingbird I said how it'd be interesting to live in the Great Depression. Yes it may have been interesting, but it's not an adventure I'd want to experience. I don't blame them for moving away from Oklahoma though. Who would want to live there back then or now?

0345803485|5.0|It's a love story between Christian Grey, who is a very sexual and worldly man, and Anastasia Steel, a young college student who has very few life experiences.  He introduces her to his sexual preferences, and Ana is a deer in headlights!  I love Ana's conversations with her conscience and her inner goddess whenever she reacts to what Christian says and does. The dialog between Christian and Ana is straight forward, intelligent, and humorous. I also enjoyed the author introducing the reader to a variation of music, wine and some words I needed a dictionary for the definitions.  It is a book you could read multiple times!  Their relationship is very intense.  And, who wouldn't want Grey as a lover?  Well, a few things I could live without.  \\"Laters baby\\".

098478280X|5.0|The book is very true to the nature of technical interview, not too broad or too focus on any topics. It exposes you to all the important ones that the interviewers would expect you to know. Although the book doesn't provide the implementation code for some data structures, you should be able to do them on your own. Some questions during the interview come straight from it. Others are very similar. Once you study this book, you will be fully prepared to handle any questions on the interview.<br /><br />Some of my friends found this book not as helpful because they only glance over it. My suggestion would be to READ IT PAGE BY PAGE AND DO WHAT SHE SAID! Try to think hard on the problem before flipping to the solutions. Write it out on the paper and compare your approach with the answer. Always think \\"is there a better approach for this question?\\" and you will master the interview.<br /><br />If you have only a week or two to prepare for the interview at a large tech company, you can do it! This book will save your life, just like it saved mine. Thank you so much, Gayle!!<br /><br />I recommended it to all my friend.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Well done film about an emotional subject. Have always thought that no film would ever be able to cover any aspect of 9/11 but I think this one did and would have never thought of the key: use child as main character.<br /><br />Very engrossing.

B0074EIQUG|5.0|Those of us who are true fans of Mac Rebennack know of the prodigious talent he brings to every project. Dr. John has been with us for a long time, and when he embraces the Night Tripper, he brings the listener to a deep place.<br />This is not \\"Gris-Gris\\", his great debut album - which is probably a lot deeper than the general public would want to go. It is not \\"Gumbo\\", as Dr. John used the original mid-Fifties musicians he played with in the Big Easy way back when to present New Orleans R&B to a new generation. You just can't reproduce that sound today.<br />But for a modern audience with modern ears, \\"Locked Down\\" presents the man hisself. Just as with Muddy Waters' project \\"Hard Again\\", we can hear acolytes who could be his grandchildren support the master as he once again shows everyone how it's done.<br />Get your passport to the electric swamp. The good doctor will heal your ills.

B006PGL7OQ|3.0|There are NO SPOILERS here!<br /><br />I knew nothing about this movie when I ordered it on Netflix other than these two things:<br /><br />1) the trailer looked interesting, and<br /><br />2) Michael Shannon intrigues me<br /><br />On that basis, I ordered \\"Take Shelter,\\" and while I can not say I loved it, I can not say I hated it either.  Hence the three stars.<br /><br />Understand this: it's a good, thoughtful movie, but the unhurried, deliberate pace is only for those who like serious films more interested in building characterization than a frenetic plot.<br /><br />I do believe this movie is well made in the sense that it gives us a realistic construction of a man on the edge and does so within the confines of a middle income working class family in a midwestern state not prone toward hysteria or even colorful words and sustained monologues.<br /><br />This is, in fact, the exact opposite of a David Mamet film, wherein words are batted around like a Jai Alai ball.  There are long scenes in which Michael Shannon slumps on a chair looking glum, and others stare at him.  LONG scenes.<br /><br />But understand they are appropriate to the seriousness of the subject.  It has the feel of an indie film on within tight funding, and writer/director Jeff Nichols is able to do a good job within an apparently low budget creating apocalyptic visions that seem to exist solely within the head of character Curtis LaForche, played by Michael Shannon.  (Is the name \\"LaForche\\" important: a misspelling of \\"fork,\\" as in perhaps a character in the fork in the road, deciding where to go?)<br /><br />The fact that he has these vivid dreams not only when he sleeps, but also when his eyes are wide open and he is awake fully awake is complicated by the additional fact that his mother is in a care facility because when she was approximately his age she had a breakdown due to her own paranoid schizophrenia.<br /><br />Given the obvious misgivings he must himself obsess over, Curtis feels the less said, the better, except that his wife--well played by Jessica Chastain--has noticed his odd behavior and is seriously frightened for AND of him.  Trying her best to deal with a deaf daughter who needs an operation, and the fact that the only money they can scrape together through his job, odd work, and yard sales is being funneled away to build a shelter he believes necessary to shield his family from the upcoming disaster he foresees.<br /><br />Nichols is not interested in making a sci-fi film, but in constructing a careful moment-by-moment character study of a man on the edge, as upset as he is by his visions of the end of the world as he is that it all may simply be his descent into madness, just like his mother.  Chastain is also portrayed as a fully realized character who is trying so hard to do the right thing: to stand by her man as he crumbles before her very eyes.<br /><br />I had seen only one other film with Michael Shannon: the EXTREMELY odd \\"Bug,\\" which should indeed creep you out if you ever do see it.  He is quite haunting there, too, as he portrays a man who may or may not be there to rescue Ashley Judd.  It's all a testament to his face: a large misshapen head like Dudley Do-Right's after a catastrophic motorcycle accident.  His jutting jaw and obsessed eyes register misgivings like a seismograph, giving off a look that is equally paranoic and frightening.<br /><br />So see \\"Take Shelter\\" if you are interested in watching a well made movie about people, and only secondarily in watching a movie that may or may not be about a disaster.  It takes forever to get where it wants to go, but rest assured this movie delivers a punch when it does.<br /><br />If, however, you do not like long character studies, steer clear.  This film is not for you.the less said, the better, except that his wife--well played by Jessica Chastain--has noticed his odd behavior and is seriously frightened for AND of him.

0451232577|5.0|After I finished, I wanted to stand up and give my applause.  Never before did I understand all the causal events of western history during the period around WWI, until I read this book.  Imbued with deep, historical research, this novel provided information from multiple character's perspectives, all intertwined and affecting each other.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially for those who know the least about this period of history, and for those who appreciate a great story rather than poring over history books.  I think it should be essential reading for all students of history, whether in high school or early college.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|The game is great and a nice sequel to the original.  Now if you have a Kindle Fire and it won't download it is because this is the android only version.  For all Kindle Fire users all you have to do is get the one that says Cut The Rope Experiments (Kindle Fire Edition) instead.

Some people said Katniss was dull and lifeless, but, guys, she's fighting a war that she influenced. She's gone through two Hunger Games and her friends are dying. She doubts she's going too make it and her life is always in danger.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a realistic book.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|Fifthy Shades Darker is a fantastic read. Its actually better than the first book Fifty Shades Darker. The first book was a little disturbing at first for my since it was my first introduction to the topic of BDSM. However, I quickly got over that issue. In this book, it picks up exactly where the first left off. Its less disturbing since the main character Christian is willing to give up his lifestyle for Ana. This book is majorly appealing since Christian's main goal is loving Ana, caring for her safety and goes above and beyond to do that. Here you learn that Ana is not some occasionally mouthy smart girl, that she has an inner strength, and more than capable of fighting for her self.<br /><br />If you like reading amazing sex scenes and being pulled into a gripping love story this series is it!!

B005LAIH2W|5.0|Having read the books, I went to see this film based on the short trailers I had seen and felt that introduction was enough to see it. I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs (he wrote the Tarzan stories, for anyone who doesn't know who he is, and there are a few out there who don't). The film was tastefully done and I was transported to Mars and enjoyed the ride, a place I have always wondered about after reading the Barsoom stories - Under The Moon Of Mars (written with the psuedonym Norman Bean), A Princess Of Mars, The Gods Of Mars, The Warlord Of Mars, Thuvia Maid Of Mars, The Chessmen Of Mars, The Mastermind Of Mars, A Fighting Man Of Mars, Swords Of Mars, Synthetic Men Of Mars, Llana Of Gathol. If you haven't read the stories, do yourself a favour....<br /><br />To all the 'critics' for the magazines out there who wrote negative reviews - what did you see ??? It certainly wasn't the movie I saw. The casting was excellent, FX superb, alien characters believable and some downright fun, and I think Edgar would have been proud. The opening was a bit slow to start but it didn't detract, I was hooked to the end and I wanted to see more. A lot of people were asking if a sequel would ever eventuate, hopefully it will. Disney said they have lost $200 million on this film, I can see why. This is due to their marketing not the film which has a lot going for it. Promoting it as a Disney film was a mistake for starters, and the marketing manager left before it was released, fancy that, all the advertising was wrong and he wasn't there, so who came up with the marketing. There is so much in this movie - adventure, excitement, escapism......<br /><br />Forget what you read in reviews, go and see it for yourself. So many times a 'critics' influence can make or break a film. This happens so often and the films attain 'cult' status. Make up your own mind.... I have seen the movie 3 times now (saw it again on Monday) and so have a lot of other people I have spoken to. We wereprepared to pay to see it multiple times. I didn't waste my money.....

B00008F22A|5.0|This review is from: The Elephant Man (Amazon Instant Video)<br />That's the phrase spoken by one of the main characters in the play's most tender and heartrending scene. This is the tragic story of Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, (called \\"John\\" Merrick here) by award-winning playwright Bernard Pomerance.<br /><br />A prominent young surgeon comes across the Elephant Man earning a living in the sideshows (which the real Merrick did fairly successfully in real life until he was robbed and abandoned by a callous manager. This is shown in the play as well.) The doctor, Frederick Treves, presents Merrick to his fellow physicians, describing his many deformities.<br /><br />As Treves displays slides of the real Merrick, an extraordinarily handsome young man (Philip Anglim) begins to twist and contort himself in an approximation of Merrick, and remains that way through the rest of the play. The audience is asked to suspend belief and perceive Anglim as the grotesque Merrick, based on the other characters' horrified response to him. It's not always easy to keep that in mind, but Pomerance makes the point that beneath his deformities, Merrick was a human being like the rest of us, with normal feelings, dreams and desires.

I once heard Mary Tyler Moore say that no one gets through life without pain.  True.  Who, if anyone, emerges from childhood without wounds?  Angela's Ashes teaches that even the devastated can heal, live, laugh, and love.

0307352145|5.0|One-third to one-half of the people we interact with on a daily basis have introverted personalitiesquiet, reflective, sensitive, drawing energy from solitude. Yet, as author Susan Cain reveals in her new book QUIET: THE POWER OF INTROVERTS IN A WORLD THAT CAN'T STOP TALKING, it can be quite challenging to live as an introvert in a world that is characterized by what she calls the \\"Extrovert Ideal.\\" Whether in school, business, or religious institutions, people are often expected to be outgoing and life-of-the-party types, and this is viewed highly, while the quiet and reflective types are often viewed as socially flawed. Introverts often grow up in a culture where they are encouraged to become pseudo extroverts to be successful or just to get by.<br /><br />As an introvert, I know how easy it can be to view introversion as a weakness to be overcome. I can recall many times growing up when people would comment on how quiet I was as if it was a bad thing and the struggle to be quick on my feet in conversations with people. For several years I was a youth minister in a church culture where youth ministers were expected to be clear extroverts. Just a quick glance at youth minister job listings reveals the desire of most churches to have someone who is \\"outgoing.\\" While I've learned to do what needs to be done as an introvert, there have been many times when I've viewed my introversion as a crippling weakness. That is, until I think about my three-year-old daughter who is also an introvert. I listen to the same comments said about her that I've heard all my life, yet I know she's exactly as God created her to be, which means that introversion is vital to who she is. And vital to who I am.<br /><br />QUIET is a timely exploration of the advantages of being an introvert in a world that is often dominated by the Extrovert Ideal. It is a call for introverts to embrace who they are and call upon the strength of their personalities to be successful and make a marked impact upon the world. Through compelling research in the fields of psychology and neuroscience, as well as real-life examples of some of the most influential introverts, Susan Cain reveals that introversion is not a weakness, but instead a genuine personality type that has a distinctive set of strengths that are just as needed as those of the often more gregarious extroverted types.<br /><br />What are some of these advantages to being an introvert? Introverts enjoy being alone and drawing energy from solitude. They're often very reflective, careful, and resilient. This combination often means that introverts are some of the most creative people in the world. Introverts have given us Harry Potter, the iPhone, Google, the theory of gravity, and The Cat in the Hat. QUIET opens with the inspiring story of Rosa Parks who relied on her quiet strength to make a change in the racial discrimination of the 1950s.<br /><br />Cain guides introverts on how to rely on their free will to develop extroverted traits that are genuine to who they are and useful in certain contexts. This is called free trait theory. Though we'll never be genuinely naturally outgoing, we can find things that we're passionate about that help us to interact successfully within the Extrovert Ideal.<br /><br />Introverts are often erroneously viewed as anti-social. I love when Susan Cain points out that introverts aren't anti-social, but differently social. Cain reveals how introverts can be socially strong by relying on our inherent \\"soft power\\" and our ability to ask questions and listen attentively.<br /><br />One of the most helpful parts of the book that I appreciated the most was the chapter on raising introverted children. As parents of an introverted child, my wife and I want our daughter to have the best opportunity to develop into a healthy and confident individual who makes a difference in the world. We know this means raising her with her introversion as an intentional focus.<br /><br />QUIET gives mehope for people like me and the many other introverts who struggle within an extroverted culture. The book reminds me that introverts have purpose and inherent strength. The book should be read by introverts and extroverts alike in order to understand each other better. I have no doubt that QUIET will be one of the best books I've read in 2012 and one I'll return to again and again.<br /><br />I received this book for review from Crown Publishinghope for people like me and the many other introverts who struggle within an extroverted culture.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|i loved this movie while i felt it started a bit slow, it ran the paces as it moved along telling a well written story and in the end i was happy i watched it, an amazing tale that know one should miss. its a must see and a must buy for me :)
0439023521|5.0|This book no matter what anyone says is a great one and a great way to start the series because the action in this is fantastic and even though i'm too into the girl being the narrator but it completely works out. The characters all fit in and they work so well and i really do feel like I am apart of the Hunger Games and it's just jaw-dropping, heart wrenching fear, and just complete emotional overload that just throws your emotions all over the place. Enjoy the book and the rest of the series!!!!
B0073XORCY|5.0|I opened up my Deluxe TAAB2 package, put myself in the proper set and setting to listen to it, and listened as I read the lyrics along with the 5.1 DTS version on the dvd. I then listened again, and then this afternoon, before I wrote the following:<br /><br />As I listened to the opening notes, the first thought that occurred to me was that Ian was putting us on, here. After all he never intended TAAB1 to be serious \\"progressive rock\\"; it was a put-on, or at least it started out that way.<br /><br />So those first few bars, so reminiscent of TAAB1, are surely a put on, I thought. I laughed to myself. He's screwing with us, I thought...<br /><br />And then began the meat of TAAB2. And it was good.<br /><br />Wow, I thought to myself, Ian (and his band) have done a helluva job of picking up where they left off 40 years ago. That in itself is pretty impressive; but to do it with creativity, style, surprise, and flair - that's really quite amazing.<br /><br />As I listened to each track I was delighted and surprised that after all these good-at-best, so-so at worst solo albums, Ian Anderson has really created something special here, a fitting follow-up to a 40 year old classic rock album.<br /><br />Who else has done this? I can't think of any off the top of my head, but the nominations are few indeed.<br /><br />This follow-up to TAAB1 is indeed mining that very same vein of gold that made the first one such a classic - the classical influence, jazzy progressive passages, tempo shifts, and virtuosic flute and guitar solos, and throughout, the Tull-style metal guitar and Anderson voice and lyrics. And unlike those first few notes of the album, TAAB2 is also very fresh with a different overall feel.<br /><br />This album is indeed somewhat of a miracle, in my book, in that it gave me all I hoped for and more. This is *great music*. As to whether or not it is \\"as good\\" or \\"better\\" than the original volume, each listener will answer for himself. But I think it is safe to say that Anderson has delivered a very admirable effort here, one worthy of its title. \\"Worthy of it's title\\" is as high a praise as I could give this.<br /><br />That itself is enough, and any more that it might be is simply icing on a 40-year old's cake.<br /><br />Personally I think Ian and band have totally *delivered* with TAAB2!say that Anderson has delivered a very admirable effort here, one worthy of its title. \\"Worthy of it's title\\" is as high a praise as I could give this.<br /><br />That itself is enough, and any more that it might be is simply icing on a 40-year old's cake.<br /><br />Personally I think Ian and band have totally *delivered* with TAAB2!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it doesnt matter if it has adds it barely has any anyway only when you pause the game it doesnt cause any stalling and its a lot of fun
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought the book was interesting, the characters were complex and the pacing of the story was just right to the very end. Nothing was cut and dry about the story.  often i find with courtroom thrillers they become predictable in that you know pretty early on how the case will end up it is just a matter of how they get there.  The way this story was told and the ending especially was very satisfying to me personally.<br /><br />I felt like the characters drama, and progression as the case/trial went on was served beautifully from beginning to end.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I literally cannot say enough good things about this series.  It had me on edge and hanging the entire time!  It reached deep for me and I fell so in love with the characters.  I have to admit I was a little squeamish in the beginning but as I began to understand where he came from, everything became easier to digest.  I'm looking forward to a possible movie or TV series but I already know that they will not do the story justice.

0307591549|4.0|I bought this book after seeing Shawn Achor on TED.  He gave a great speech and made me want to learn more.  The book presents some wonderful methods to bring happiness into your life, and fast!  It's nothing groundbreaking, but Achor presents his information perfectly.  The book would be great for all managers.  We can really learn from Achor's methods, create a happier work environment, and a more profitable business!<br /><br />I want to stress that the book is useful for everybody though, not just those in managerial positions.  Achor presents ways that individuals can bring happiness into their own lives as well.  Definitely worth the read!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was hesitant to read it. Not a huge Harry Potter or Twilight fan, but my daughter-in-law and grandson encouraged me to read it. Couldn't put it down until I was finished.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a very entertaining page-turner with a good amount of food-for-thought thrown in. (Actually, food is a big theme in this book, whoda thunk?)<br /><br />The main character is an awfully naive, self-centered thing...I am very interested to see how she develops in the next books. She has a lot of potential. I do hope the next books dive more into the politics.<br /><br />And, of course, you can't help but fall in love with Peeta. I wonder if there are any guys like him in the real world? As the main character says in the \\"Hunger Games Gone Wild\\" parody, \\"You had me at 'baker.'\\"<br /><br />I've been waiting for the kindle price on Catching Fire to go down...not sure I can hold out much longer.
0439023521|5.0|In a dystopian future world, a plentiful society exists in a place called the Capitol which oversees 12 poverty-stricken Districts to produce specific products to maintain their charmed lives. As a way of re-affirming their dominance over the Districts (as well as provide a sadistic entertainment to the twisted rulers), they demand 2 &#34;tributes&#34; in the form of one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 to travel to the Capitol and be placed in a vast arena to survive and fight to the death. These televised trials are called &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;. This is the story of a 16 year old girl called Katniss Everdeen from District 12 who is one of the chosen.<br /><br />I heard about this book a few years ago in Stephen King's Entertainment Weekly column but I decided not to read it as it was labelled &#34;Young Adult&#34; (YA) (I'm not a teenager) and because it seemed like a knockoff &#34;Battle Royale&#34;, a superb Japanese film I'd seen in 2000 which has a very similar premise. Having read the book, in hindsight both of these reasons were ridiculous. The YA label is arbitrary at best and, reading it, I couldn't understand why this book is considered to be a teen book and not one for adults. Maybe the lack of swearing, sex, and overly descriptive violent scenes?<br /><br />And the &#34;Battle Royale&#34; argument (which seems to bother a number of reviewers), well was that the first book to feature kids on an island killing each other? Has no-one read &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34;? Shirley Jackson wrote maybe the best haunted house novel with &#34;The Haunting of Hill House&#34; - does that mean Richard Matheson's &#34;Hell House&#34; or Stephen King's &#34;The Shining&#34; are invalid because they followed in her wake? Or Yevgeny Zamyatin's &#34;We&#34; preceded both Aldous Huxley's &#34;Brave New World&#34; and George Orwell's &#34;Nineteen Eighty-Four&#34;, so do we discount Huxley and Orwell entirely? Just because a concept has been done before, doesn't mean it can't be done again - and done better at that.<br /><br />&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is an exceptionally thrilling read. Suzanne Collins has crafted a compelling portrait of a world unrecognisable to our own, both futuristic and historic at varying times, but the best part of the book is, as it should be, the Games itself. Once Katniss enters the arena with the 23 other teens, I couldn't stop reading and finished the book on my second sitting, it was that exhilarating to read. Her battle to survive both on the basic level of eating and drinking what she could find, while escaping her would-be murderers, was a unique reading experience that I've never come across before and Collins does a fantastic writing job throughout. The survival part of the book echoed another excellent series of YA books I read when I was a teenager, Gary Paulsen's &#34;Hatchet&#34; books (highly recommended by the way), while the many Roman references made it seem like an extended teen &#34;Gladiator&#34;.<br /><br />I won't give away anything about the story here but suffice it to say that there are betrayals and killings that you don't see coming, and constant suspense throughout (even though you know Katniss makes it). Like I say, I don't know why this isn't considered an adult book but any adults reading this review should give this novel a go, ignore the YA label, it's very well written, very well-conceived, and an amazing action-thriller with elements of sci-fi thrown in. Excellent fun, I bought the other two books immediately after finishing this and can't wait to find out how this series continues.t mean it can't be done again - and done better at that.<br /><br />&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is an exceptionally thrilling read.

0465068367|5.0|My husband and I went to see the movie, \\"Flowers of War\\". This prompted our interest in learning more about Nanking. One of the movie reviewers didn't like the movie because it took great liberties about John Rabe. So a little Internet search guided us to this book. I started reading it, and I could not put it down. I read it in one weekend, and I've told everyone who would listen that they simply must read this book. I'm an educated woman with 2 Master's Degrees, (obviously not in history), and I had little to no knowledge about Nanking. I thought the way the author told the story from various perspectives was fascinating. I have since discussed this book with my Jewish friends as well, and now they're reading it. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I finished the first two books of the trilogy and began this one with enthusiasm and joy. By the time I hit the two-thirds mark, I was shocked and disappointed, and by the time I ended the book,depressed and disgusted.<br /><br />Scores of reviewers have already commented on the sloppy plot, non-existent character development, missing storylines, ad nauseum, so I won't repeat their sentiments here. Neither am I all that fussed about the love triangle. All I can say is that their comments were justified. This book was a massive letdown. I'm disappointed in both author and editor for allowing this to go to press as it stands. I could find better fan fic out there, and I hope I do, so I can wash away the bad taste that was left in my mouth. I don't look to books for happy ever after, but I don't expect lectures either. We get that war is bad; we can read newspapers and watch the news for that. At the very best, she built up a great story and characters and then sucked the life, meaning, significance, and sheer fun out of them in this book. One review said it was like the author giving us two puppies and killing them; to me, it's like taking Buttercup the beloved pet cat and shooting it in front of Prim.<br /><br />When I bought this book, I was mystified by the low ratings compared to the first two, but didn't pay any attention to them. After all, ratings typically drop off in series. Well, now I understand why. I wish I had paid attention to the ratings, and just pretended that the book ended at book 2. I'm giving this book 1 star and wished I could give it a negative rating, so that unsuspecting readers like myself don't get duped into buying or reading this one, and wind up being feeling so disappointed.

With that said, it was a quick semi-enjoyable book.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like most of the readers, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I've read the Twilight books, and was curious as to what the connection between the two was. Suffice to say while the author claimed to be inspired by Stephanie Meyers, inspiration does not breed talent, at least not in this case.<br />The story line is slim at best. It revolves around the two main characters, and even there the believably was weak. What 21 year old doesn't own a cell phone or a computer? Even her speech doesn't fit into mainstream American college newly graduate. It's stilted, too formal. As for Christian Grey, so little was told as to why he is the way he is, I just didn't care to find out anymore.<br />Each chapter was the same. She bit her lip, she rolled her eyes. He threatened her with \\"punishment\\". He grabs her hair, she swoons at how his pants/sweats/pj's hang off his hips. She gasps, he groans. I shouldn't have been able to stop to make dinner/fold laundry/catch up on emails, but I did. I had no problems watching a TV movie, and reading this book at the same time, until the movie became more interesting, and I haven't bothered to finish the second half of the book. I don't care if she signs the contract, continues to date him, or not. It's not worth my time.<br />It was easier to connect with Meyer's vampires and werewolves, sans any erotic images, then with Ana and Christian. There was no depth to either of them, while Meyer's characters gave detail and insight. I won't be buying anymore Shades of Grey books, and I'll pass on the movies.

B0079K4WEE|4.0|\\"I think it's OK to panic now.\\" A very serious disease strain has begun to cause havoc all over the world and it's called severe olfactory syndrome (SOS). It begins by smelling something that reminds you of someone you know who has died, then one by one you begin to lose your senses. During the outbreak chef Michael (McGregor) and scientist Susan (Green) begin to fall in love and their relationship is tested over and over as their senses begin to fail. Even the the plot may sound a little hokey this is actually a very good movie. At once the movie is both disturbing and sweet as well as erotic. The acting is fantastic as you believe that they are really losing their senses and you really begin to feel bad for them. To me this is a little scary because it makes me wonder if this could actually happen (from some chemical) and how I would act. This movie will give you hope and break your heart at the same time. I recommend this but it is a movie that will leave you worn out and not really in the mood to do anything after. Overall, a very good movie that is both disturbing and wonderful. I give it a B+.

0316098329|5.0|For this review I wish I was a more eloquent writer to explain my thoughts about this book.  Suffice it to say this most probably will be my number one read for the year 2012.  With poignancy, great strength and humor, the author conveys a young boy and his mother's unusual lives.<br /><br />In an unidentified town, in an unidentified neighborhood there is a house.  In the backyard, covered pretty much by foliage with a door that opens to another backyard, there is a shed where a five year old boy, Jack lives with his mother Ma and their sometime night visitor Old Nick.  While Jack may appear and sound like other children, he has never known anything but an 11' x 11' foot area which is called the room.  Jack is content with his books, television programs, breakfast, lunch and dinner but it is his Ma that knows differently. At the age of 19, seven years ago, Ma was kidnapped and brought to the room.  With a very small window and the most rudimtary of bathing and toilet facilities she gives birth to a daughter who dies and then Jack.  It is obvious that Ma has not only been kidnapped but also raped by Old Nick as well. Ms. Donoghue paints a portrait of Ma as a most reilient  clever and creative mother. She has taught Jack to read and write and organizes track events around their bed to keep themselves moving.  Jack is one precocious, smart and lovable boy.  And one expects this book to coninue on in this slow but sizzling tone.  And then one night Ma has decided it's time to escape and she sets a plan in motion which has sone very interesting consequences.<br /><br />And by the end Jack and Ma prove to have one of the strongest bonds written about in modern day literature. This is the bond of a mother protecting and nurturing her child underterrible circumstances.  And it is the bod of a son with his mother which help him to grow to be a fine man despite his early circumstances.  As I read this book, I couldn't help but think about Stacy Dugard and Elizabeth Smart who are two cases of young people held by their captors.  One can only wish for them and Jack a long a hppy life.are two cases of young people held by their captors.  One can only wish for them and Jack a long a hppy life.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins is the second book of The Hunger Games trilogy.  While I wasn't enamored with the first book, I found Catching Fire to be an interesting read.  Think Lord of the Flies meets Lost meets 1984.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta have both survived the hunger games and the Capitol portraying the two of them as lovers.  They have now returned to their district but now live in beautiful homes with all of the benefits the hunger game victors are afforded.  Katniss needs to deal not only with Peeta's cool attitude towards her but now Gale, her truwstsed friend is maintaining his distance.  And as if her life wasn't difficult enough Katniss is preparing for a victory tour and is coached by the President on how to behave.  The President is worried about riots in the other districts and feels Katniss may be able to stall their efforts.  But Katniss isn't sure what she wants to do or who to side with at this time.<br /><br />This book is a fast read and the characters seem more alive in this book than the first one.  The author leaves her readers in justy enough suspense to grab the next and last installment, Mockingjay.

0062082353|3.0|Like so many the last ten years, the sound of the guns and the excitement of a military career brought many into the military establishment.  This book although documenting one person's military experience as a US Navy SEAL sniper..the story line is like so many of sacrifice, enduring austerity, combat fatigue and the rush during times when things get really challenging.<br /><br />I would like to make a couple of corrects: (1) The picture of \\"General Pace\\" with the author is actually Air Force General Shwartz (sp).  The Air Force General is on AFN almost daily, so his face is well known to those of us who depend on AFN for our news, weather and sports.  (2) The reference to the \\"60\\" or M-60 machine gun is outdated..the M-60 of Vietnam era was phased out many years ago replaced by the much better 240(B) machine gun.<br /><br />The author has many kills...and no doubt righteous, as each one saved perhaps an American being killed.  Urban combat (MOUT for those you know)..is much different than the valleys and hills of Vietnam.  That said, the icon of historical portions remains Carlos Hathcock of the US Marine Corps who scored 93 confirmed kills..many from hides deep in the jungle.<br /><br />The author who made astounding kills within an urban environment was somewhat more enhanced as the targets were like \\"rabbits\\" running around in scandals without muck or any training. I think he would agree-<br /><br />Iraq has and will have many heroes...many unknown or will never be known..but, we salute them all in remembrance of the sacrifice and enduring dedication to maintain-<br /><br />Overall, I like the book...having served in Iraq during the height of the insurgency..also Afghanistan and a few other places of historical note..I would recommend the book to readers who might wish to feel what it is like being a sniper.<br /><br />RH
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Okay, to buy this \\"trilogy\\" one has to spend $30. I don't think so. I purchased the first season of Game of Thrones for the same money, and I can guarantee I'll enjoy it more. I read this when it was free Twilight fan fic. It didn't particularly impress me then. Having sampled some of the \\"books\\" I can see that not nearly enough editing was done. Juvenile writing at best, a blatant move to jump on the Twihards money train at worst. Find some good BDSM fan fic if you want to save yourself some money. You'll probably be happier with the writing in any case.
0345803485|4.0|Yes, I am a surburban mom.  And yes, this book is all the rage with the housewives and soccer moms that populate my town.  I heard so much about it (moms chatting amongst themselves about it at thier kids' sports practices!), that I just had to read it.  While it didn't force me to drop EVERYTHING and read (\\"be prepared to ignore your family for days\\" one acquaintance said), I did find it an easy, entertaining, and just-erotic-enough-to-not-be-raunchy\\" read.  While this is certainly not the most sophisticatedly written story (some scenes, dialogue and character descriptions may leave you thinking \\"Seriously?\\"), the book is a perfect indulgence for the suburban mom (and others) looking for something a little naughty!

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Lana Del Rey is a refreshing new arrival on the music scene.  With other female musicians gaining fame by proving how trashy they can be, Lana, like Adele, shine through as woman who are not trying to roll around in the mud.  Not that she won't sprinkle a few \\"f\\" words around here and there, to spice things up a little.<br /><br />I have kept this CD in my player and listened to it over and over because Lana's delivery on several songs is unique: on a song like \\"Born to Die\\", sounding almost monotone, her voice is carried along by soaring strings and bouncing hip-hop in the background.  This rich mixture of sound throughout the album makes the album enticing for the ears.  Her voice winds up leaving you haunted and hypnotized by the words, playing in your head long after you've finished listening.  Thus, they are also sticky.<br /><br />Sometimes, the lyrics resound in your head because of repetition.  In \\"Summertime Sadness,\\" the song's title is repeated many times in the song, like a mantra.  This is one of my favorite songs.  The wistfulness of summer coming to an end brings to mind The Doors' \\"Summer's Almost Gone,\\" very much capturing the similar spirit.  This song, along with \\"Born to Die,\\" the richly orchestrated and lush \\"Video Games,\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" are the tunes I would put on a chill out playlist.  Feeling like chilling out, a bit blue, or winding down for the day, these tunes help sync with that mood.<br /><br />Other tunes are more playful and energetic, where Lana uses a fuller range of voice, as in \\"Off to the Races\\" and \\"Diet Mountain Dew,\\" both of which bounce along, but moderately--she's not trying to hit the disco dance floor here!<br /><br />One thing I like is use of very descriptive language, really painting pictures of things, as in \\"Off to the Races\\":  Swimming pool glimmering darling/ White bikini off with my red nail polish/ Watch me in the swimming pool / Bright blue ripples.<br /><br />\\"National Anthem\\" has a clever touch with the lead in of the sound of muted fireworks in the background.<br /><br />The rest of the songs that round out the album are okay, but don't stand out like the previous ones mentioned.  If you're looking for something different, definitely check out Lana Del Rey.

0385344228|4.0|Defending Jacob is ostensibly a legal thriller but it's as much a nuanced family drama as it is courtroom murder mystery.<br /><br />Jacob is a fourteen-year-old accused of murdering one of his classmates in the park on his way to school. Violence of this nature is completely foreign to this affluent Massachusetts community and Jacob's parents are not prepared for their neighbors disdain and the public microscope they're subjected to.  To make the situation even more scandalous, Jacob's father is the #2 man in the DA's office and was initially overseeing the investigation.<br /><br />The murder strains Jacob's parent's marriage and their relationship with their son. How well does any parent really know their child? Should they have known that their son was capable of this kind of violence?  Do they believe their son is innocent or guilty and how does that affect their role as a parent?  If they doubt their child's innocence are they being disloyal?  If their son is a killer, is it their fault?  Where should their allegiance be - with their son no matter what he's done or with a community that needs to be kept safe?  Is it fair for friends and neighbors to blame them for raising a monster?  To add fuel to this fire, family secrets are revealed that further tear the family apart with shame, guilt and blame.<br /><br />Jacob's DA father Andy provides the first-person narrative, the reliability of which is never completely clear.  There is a sense as you read that novel that Andy's narration may be selective, and that as a reader you may not be receiving a complete picture.  Woven through the story, in typed court reporter transcript, is a second narrative where Andy is on the stand as a grand jury witness, a year after the murder.  How this grand jury investigation fits into the story is revealed gradually and proves to be a very effective story-telling device.<br /><br />Jacob is something of an enigma. Most of our impressions of the boy come from conversations about him, not from scenes involving him.  We see him through the eyes of his father, whose inexorable faith in his son may or may not give us a reliable picture. The reader, and perhaps his parents, never have a clear picture of the boy.  Is he a typical teenager or is there something more to his sullen, withdrawn, self-absorbed persona?<br /><br />I had a few minor issues with the novel, behavior that I wasn't convinced rang completely true, but I found Defending Jacob to be a gripping page turner from start to finish.  It was the ending though that sealed the deal for me.  Defending Jacob finishes strong, one of the best endings to a suspense novel in recent memory.<br /><br />Landay does a solid job of developing the character of Andy, a proud man, tormented and struggling to hold his family together and protect them at all costs.  The novel may not appeal to action junkies, but it's a well-paced novel, with a compelling story that is certain to have parents of any teenager questioning how well they know their own child.  Landay is surprisingly good at capturing the rhythms of how teenagers talk (and post on-line), something that few adult authors do credibly.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is much more than just another legal thriller.  It's a powerful family drama and a social commentary that is certain to have readers pondering the issues the novel raises and asking themselves questions that aren't easy to answer.  4 ½ stars.him, not from scenes involving him.

B006ISJQ26|5.0|some may view this as a typical british gangster movie and if that's a turn off don't bother watching it. don't watch it for the supposed romance between kiera knightley and colin farrel. don't watch it because most people seem to hate it. watch it for the difference in language. nothing is a shock in this movie but it's well paced and provides a transport from reality for a little over an hour. isn't that what movies are for?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Overall, the hunger games was an excellent story.  A great mix of human feelings and imagination.  It moved a little slow in a few places, but held my interest throughout the story.  I found it both entertaining and thought provoking.  I have now seen the movie (which was good) and have read book two (also excellent and very fast moving throughout)and am in the process of reading book three.
1401232590|5.0|The re-telling of Harvey Dent's journey to the dark side is tonally perfect and impeccably structured. The creation of Holiday, a murderer who kills with corresponding national holidays, enables the story to form a narrative structure that spans an entire year, keep a great pace and allows the story to take on a grand scale. The chapters allow each character the necessary page time to have a strong impact, nothing seems forced or underdeveloped - this is a complete Batman story. The detective story drives the narrative, keeping the reader hooked until the satisfying climax, and the artwork is second to none. No Batman collection should be without this, it's almost the perfect Bat story.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I'll admit when I first heard the brief snippets of each song that were released in succession on Facebook, I was not really impressed and a little worried.<br /><br />Despite the snippets and my opinion at the time, I gave it the benefit of the doubt and purchased from iTunes.  Heck, I can throw away $12.99 on a stupid meal at a restaurant.<br /><br />The first go around didn't knock me off my feet, but all songs were at minimum listenable to where I wasn't during each song wanting to skip ahead to the next song.  This was true for every song.<br /><br />On the second go around two or three additional songs (I initially caught on to Tattoo, although it's a bit too pop'ish for me) became noticeably catchy/good.  Those songs being \\"She's the Woman\\", \\"Outta Space\\", \\"Bullethead\\" and \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\".<br /><br />By the third go around, those three were definitely addictive and had me wanting to listen again.  I also picked up on \\"As Is\\", and \\"Stay Frosty\\".  As Is, is my new favorite.<br /><br />From that point, on I have been totally hooked on the whole CD (start to finish) and want to listen (crank up) every day.<br /><br />I will say hands down this is a CD where every song is catchy.  I have over 1,000 songs and only a handful of CD's that I desire to listen to start to finish.<br /><br />For a modern effort it definitely catches some of the vintage sound of VH (David Lee Roth - feel good, goofy lyrics, and don't take life too seriously vibe) that I was worried it wouldn't catch. \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"Bullethead\\" are vintage VH sound w/ perhaps a 2012 edge.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" is totally \\"Ice Cream Man\\"; a diddy that starts slow and has the listener like WTH, then hits the switch and starts flat out rocking.<br /><br />No, it's not a VH'agar, power ballad collection, (i.e. Dreams, Poundcake, Right Now, etc.).<br /><br />Truth be told, I will be disappointed if they don't play at least three (hoping 4) songs from this CD when they play Charlotte on April 27, 2012.<br /><br />-Stay Frosty!

0670022411|1.0|My cousin recommended this book saying \\"I just couldn't put it down\\". So I kept trying and trying to like it. Every time I felt like something was going to  get started it just fizzled out.  Finally about the 26th chapter I realized that nothing at all was going to happen. How fun to learn to make tea???  I have to ask what another reviewed ask, where was the editor? Who wants to read how she took the boat out of the shed, or how Mathew said hello to the man at the gate? I think we as readers can get there without having to lay it out each time.<br /><br />Wouldn't it have been nice if Diana had found self discovery and growth? Nope sorry, instead she became a love sick puppy. Mathew, what a boring vampire, perfect in every way. Maybe if Mathew were killed it would make a more interesting story. I don't think I'll be buying the next book, not for $14.00 on Kindle.<br /><br /> If you enjoy supernatural then I recommend Dark Fever by Karen Maria Moning, with the exception of a disappointing last book it's a good series.

0743454537|4.0|\\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" (2005), by New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult, her eleventh novel, was a monster hit upon its publication.  It followed upon the heels of [[ASIN:1416583866 Second Glance: A Novel]], which is sorta kinda where I come in, as my mystery book club read, and I here reviewed  SECOND GLANCE.  However, whatever that book was, it wasn't much of a mystery, and I must admit I come to MY SISTER'S KEEPER only now, years after the rest of the world.  Which is a pity, as it's one powerful book; although they do say better late than never.<br /><br />SISTER'S KEEPER tells the story of the New England-based Fitzgeralds.  Brian, Dad, is a Providence, Rhode Island fire chief.  Mom Sara is a formerly practicing lawyer, now a full-time mother.  Kate, their eldest daughter, has a particularly virulent case of leukemia, cancer of the blood. Jesse, their son, who is always ignored due to Kate's never-ending medical drama, is getting himself into a lot of trouble.  And Anna, their youngest daughter, is a designer test-tube baby, created for the express purpose of supplying spare parts for her constantly medically yo-yoing sister.  The demand for parts has escalated, from stem cells at her birth, to bone marrow transplants( painful!), to, now, at thirteen, the `need' for her to donate one of her kidneys to her sister.  In fact, Anna has been in and out of the hospital almost as much as Kate and she has had enough.  She decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation, and sends shock waves round the world in so doing.  She hires a lawyer, Campbell Alexander to represent her; her Mom Sara represents the family's interests, and Judge De Salvo appoints Julia Romano as guardian ad litem to Anna, charging her with investigating the case and the family, and recommending what she thinks best for the child plaintiff's interests.<br /><br />No doubt this book can be called chick lit, as it is located within the female world of family.  But the book, as, SECOND GLANCE, and, I expect many of Picoult's works, shows her extraordinary ability to humanize and personalize the great relevant ethics issues of the day.  If you have a pulse, I don't see how you can help but be riveted by the medico/ethical/legal problems of the Fitzgerald family; and I will speak only for myself when I say I have no idea of the \\"correct\\" answer to the complex questions the book raises.<br /><br />The book was made into a substantial film of the same name in 2009,[[ASIN:B002ORTD46 My Sister's Keeper (2009)]].  It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara Fitzgerald, Abigail Breslin as Anna, and Alec Baldwin as the lawyer Campbell Alexander.  The movie was written for the screen and directed by Nick Cassavetes.<br /><br />Picoult was born in Nesconset, New York, a village so far out on Long Island, ordinarily considered a suburb of New York City's, that many people reckon it to be more New England-like than New York-like.  The author's family moved to New England when she was thirteen, and she seems to have largely stayed around there ever since: she took a master's degree at Harvard University, in Massachusetts.  This book, like SECOND GLANCE before it, is set in New England: I expect many of her books are.  She was the recipient of the 2003 New England Book Award for her entire body of work.<br /><br />The author, when queried about this novel, said, \\"I came about the idea for this novel through the back door of a previous one, Second Glance. While researching eugenics for that book, I learned that the American Eugenics Society -- the one whose funding dried up in the 1930s when the Nazis began to explore racial hygiene too -- used to be housed in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Guess who occupies the same space, today? The Human Genome Project... which many consider `today's eugenics.' This was just too much of a coincidence for me, and I started to consider the way this massive, cutting edge science we're on the brink of exploding into was similar... and different from... the eugenics programs and sterilization laws in America in the 1930s. Once again, you've got science that is only as ethical as the people who are researching and implementing it -- and once again, in the wake of such intense scientific advancement, what's falling by the wayside are the emotions involved in the case by case scenarios. I heard about a couple in America that successfully conceived a sibling that was a bone marrow match for his older sister, a girl suffering from a rare form of leukemia. His cord blood cells were given to the sister, who is still (several years later) in remission. But I started to wonder... what if she ever, sadly, goes out of remission? Will the boy feel responsible? Will he wonder if the only reason he was born was because his sister was sick?\\"<br /><br />The reader may be interested to know that between 1929 and 1974, an estimated 7,600 people were sterilized by choice, force, or coercion under the North Carolina Eugenics Board. The program was not abolished until 1977; the legislature and governor of the state are even now discussing how much to award the victims of the program who still survive. It's still very much an issue in this state; the subject matter of SECOND GLANCE may well be even more relevant than Picoult realized. Bless her, she does have the ability to personalize the problems of the day.. the eugenics programs and sterilization laws in America in the 1930s.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have to admit to a life-long love affair with most things Stephen King.  I read the original version of The Stand way back when right after it was published and was simply blown away.  I was a precocious young reader and no adult knew enough about this author to protect my innocent young mind.  Thank goodness!  Since then, I could never wait for the paperback version of his latest work.  During my lean college years, when I was frugal in most aspects of my life, I never hesitted even a second spending grocery money on a hardback Stephen King novel.  As I got older, I tired a little of the gore, but there was always the first half of the book which had the classic King suspense build-up that no one in the industry can seem to duplicate.<br /><br />Then came this book.  It's an atypical King novel, but a mind-bogglingly hold-on-to-your-hat page turner.  WARNING:  Do not buy this book if you have any important event coming up in your life.  Trust me, you will miss your deadline, stay up so late you can't function at work, ignore your visiting mother-in-law, or decide that going to your cousin's wedding is vastly overrated.  Maybe I'm a bit OCD with a good book, but other reviewers also talked of not being able to put the book down.  If you buy it and then find out that all outside life has taken second place to the story, don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />About the story -- Yes, we all know the events of 11/22/63, but you'll never look at them the same way again.  Stephen King kept me on the edge of my seat, rooting for my hero all the way to the very end.  As I turned the last page, I sat there stunned, not wanting to return to life outside the book, not wanting for the book to be over.  I loved the characters, painted in full-blown colorized detail with flaws, foibles, and endearing qualities.  I wanted this world he created to be the \\"real\\" world.<br /><br />Fellow Stephen King fans, don't go into this expecting gore and monsters.  Enter with anticipation of an unexpected journey, a long trip into the Twilight Zone with a Stephen King flavor.  In my opinion, King just keeps getting better and this story of bravery, wonder, heartbreak, and love is the kind of adventure you long for, one which fires up the imagination and bleeds over into daily life.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. King.  I loved the book.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm a female college student the same age as the narrator. I've even found myself in a relatively similar \\"wealthy man attracted to you for reasons you don't understand and, oh hey! He's also a kinky Dom in the bedroom\\" situation. Here's what I have to say:<br /><br />Main gripes with this book:<br /><br />1) The characters say each others names too much. This makes the dialogue seem stiff and artificial; it's hard to hear it in your head and take it seriously. I understand if Christian Grey is going to be formal and refer to the narrator as \\"Miss Steele\\" as opposed to \\"Ana/Anastasia\\" but must he say her name every other damn time he says something?! They are often times the only two characters in the scene; there is really no confusion as to who they're speaking to!<br /><br />2) A 21 year old virgin is a little hard to believe but even more so is a 21 year old who can't refer to her self esteem as something other than her \\"Inner Goddess\\" nor can she refer to her vagina/crotch/snatch/what have you as anything other than \\"down there\\"...I mean really. She didn't grow up sheltered and she's a senior in college (as am I)\\"<br />3) It reads as though the writer sat down with a thesaurus in an attempt to make it harder to read so it might be confused as good writing. That plan failed and instead only annoyed me further. I find myself highlighting words in while reading his on my Kindle Fire and saying \\"are you serious!?\\" after realizing how unnecessary her word choice was. I understand wanting word variation, but this is overkill.<br /><br />4) I really expected this to be kinkier and hotter to read based on the description (and price, for that matter). I feel as though the author hoped that a dominant kind of guy having a sex chamber in his house with whips, chains, canes, restraints, and other stereotypical dom/sub things would be good enough. No, definitely not good enough. Some parts got me a little excited, mostly because they reminded me of some type of sexcapade I once had, but most parts read like a textbook or instruction manual  \\"insert tab A into slot B.\\"<br /><br />Things I like about this book:<br /><br />1) It's an easy, mindless read. I just finished reading War and Peace and was looking for something to read in my downtime from school and work that I could zone out to. This is a good example of \\"chick lit,\\" I suppose. I knew it wasn't going to be extraordinary, the author has penned no novels prior to this one, but was kind of hoping it'd surprise me (someone doesn't have to have written a number of novels in order to be a good writer). It's a \\"page turner \\" only because it's easy to get through. I sometimes found myself skipping through dull internal dialogue parts that really don't add to any characters or plot lines.<br /><br />I guess that's really it...it being mindless was enough to keep me going. As I said, that just happened to be what I was looking for. I wouldn't regard this as real literature.

1407130293|4.0|The literary content of the 3 books is excellent. The stories are compelling, action packed and emotional. The primary characters are well developed and so engaging. The vocabulary is certainly geared toward young people but is  clear and very concise and free of any ambiguity<br /><br />From a practical aspect, I could barely get the books out of the box they were so tightly wedged in.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading the stories and found it very difficult to put them down once I started.<br /><br />For fantasy/science fiction fans, these books are an excellent investment of time and money.

0345803485|1.0|I was very excited to read this series as it is getting loads of media hype, so I purchased all three books for my Kindle. I read them all, gave them a chance to wow me like the magazine articles said they would. Instead my reaction was \\"Wow...I paid $30 for this?!?\\" SEX! Page after page of ridiculous sex and bondage scenes! If that's what you're after then these are the books for you but I found the story to be lame and the sex scenes laughable. Is the author really trying to tell us that this kind of relationship is healthy and exciting?! A guy with anger issues (so sexy) who yells a lot (even hotter) and wants to smack your bottom with a whip (sign me up!)...NOT.  The only reason Christian is a \\"catch\\" (notice snotty quotes) is that he is cute and rich, because honestly if ugly Bob down the street asked to tie you up you would call the police, not move into his trailer. After reading these books the only slapping/smacking I wanted to do was Ana...upside the head...to tell her to run, not walk out of that penthouse! (Although considering they have sex 5 times a day she will be lucky if she can waddle out...) So save your money and precious time people and find a different book to read this weekend. (Preferably a book that NEVER uses the words anal and plug...)

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I don't have HBO so when I heard about this show getting such rave reviews, I bought the season 1 blu-ray set. I have to say that this show lives up to all their rave reviews. It is great mixture of drama, thriller, action, comedy, sex and violence. It wasn't quite what I was expecting and that is a good thing. It is also unpredictable and the acting is some of the best you will see on tv and even movies. Too bad I won't be seeing season 2 on hbo now. I will have to wait for the blu-ray set.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was fascinated with the Christian and Ana, and did read all three. Both characters were well developed from her total innocence and his very complex and believable history into being very real people. At first I thought it was just a 'bodice ripper', but wanted to follow their lives through all their learning processes to some sort of resolution.<br />But there is far too much sex! It was very cleverly written and believable, but just going through all their romps from morning to night... and they did it a lot! Pages and pages and pages! I finally began to skim over to get back to the story. One book of the three could have been dropped if all that unnecessary repetition had been left out. Also, don't read the last bit about his version of their meeting. It spoils that warm fuzzy feeling. I wish I hadn't.

B007DIQB50|5.0|Nicki Minaj's new album \\"Pink Friday ... Roman Reloaded\\" is a really great concept!<br /><br />Nicki has garnered millions of Pop fans in the past couple of years, so why not cater to them as well as staying true to your Hip Hop/Rap upbringing? That's exactly what Minaj does on this album.<br /><br />The first part of \\"Roman\\" is Nicki rapping addicting hooks as always. With tracks like \\"Roman Holiday,\\" \\"Champion,\\" and even clever and mildly-addicting tracks like \\"Beez In the Trap\\" and \\"Come On a Cone\\" (who doesn't love the verse 'D*** in yo face / put my d*** in yo face'?).<br /><br />The second part of the set, Minaj shines as a Pop diva! Tracks may sound repetitive to her and David Guetta's hit single \\"Turn Me On,\\" but, other tracks outshine the hit such as \\"Pound the Alarm\\" with it's addicting club house beats, to \\"Va Va Voom\\" which is just as bubblegum pop and addicting as Minaj's 2011 crossover smash \\"Super Bass\\" (it could very well match the same success).<br /><br />Some songs sound stale and sounds a bit repetitive and used, like songs such as \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" (with it's distinctive title), to other tracks like \\"Gun Shot\\" and the lead single which sounds like a Katy Perry \\"Teenage Dream\\" leftover, \\"Starships\\".<br /><br />Overall, I feel Nicki's \\"BARBZ\\" will love this album. Her Hip Hop fans will like it somewhat, and her haters will demolish this album... that being said, if you liked \\"Pink Friday\\", or even \\"Super Bass,\\" or \\"Turn Me On,\\" you should like some part of this album.

B000O1799U|5.0|I love Beyonce. I hate musicals. My hate for musicals is probably even greater than my love for Beyonce, but Dreamgirls isn't a typical musical and because of that it's become one of my favorite films.<br /><br />Since it's fiction loosely based on actual events, think of this film as sort of a Motown version of 8 Mile (Detroit plays a central role coincidentally, too). It was originally a 1980s Broadway musical which won six Tony Awards, as other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />Honestly, I was probably a half hour or more into the movie before I even realized it's a \\"musical.\\" Because musical performances are a central part of this story about a pseudo-Supremes, you just enjoy the music rather than being subjected to somebody walking down the street dancing around light poles and such like you're apt to find in a typical musical.<br /><br />This is the last good dramatic role Eddie Murphy's done (he won a Golden Globe and was nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar) and his performance is stellar. The film's awards speak for themselves: Golden Globe winner for best picture and Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for best supporting actress. Dreamgirls also won the Oscar for best sound mix and was the first live-action movie to receive THREE nominations for best song (eat it, Lion King).<br /><br />The film is also historically significant because at $80 million it's the most expensive movie ever produced with an all-black starring cast.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is terrific as the fake Berry Gordy Jr. As good as or better than his performances in Ali and Ray.<br /><br />Beyonce Knowles was nominated for a Golden Globe as the fake Diana Ross. Since the fake Supremes in the movie are a trio, there are also some subtle parallels with the real-life Destiny's Child breakup which undoubtedly helped Knowles' performance.<br /><br />Danny Glover is outstanding as always. Even in minor roles he still has a major presence.<br /><br />The always delightful Loretta Devine (Dr. Webber's wife on Grey's Anatomy) does one number in a club and John Lithgow even has a minor role in one scene.<br /><br />Jaleel \\"Urkel\\" White also has a cameo as a talent booker near the start of the film which I didn't originally notice and a very Jackson 5-like group also makes a few fun appearances.<br /><br />David Geffen spent 20+ years trying to make this film and originally wanted Whitney Houston (pre-Bodyguard) to star as Deena Jones, but talks fell apart. Lauryn Hill almost got the role at one point, too, but Beyonce Knowles actively fought for it and when she finally won over the producers it really paid off for all involved.<br /><br />Even if you don't enjoy musicals (or hate them with a fiery passion), give this film a try and you might just be surprised.<br /><br />(Worth noting: My review is based on watching the single-disc widescreen DVD version of Dreamgirls. I liked it so much that I'm planning to pick up the two-disc edition for all the extra special features.)bber's wife on Grey's Anatomy) does one number in a club and John Lithgow even has a minor role in one scene.<br /><br />Jaleel \\"Urkel\\" White also has a cameo as a talent booker near the start of the film which I didn't originally notice and a very Jackson 5-like group also makes a few fun appearances.<br /><br />David Geffen spent 20+ years trying to make this film and originally wanted Whitney Houston (pre-Bodyguard) to star as Deena Jones, but talks fell apart.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book draws you in from the very first page. The author makes you feel as if you know the characters and you can feel what they are going through HOWEVER I felt uneasy throughout the whole book. Its disturbing and left a bad feeling in my stomach...I was truly torn between being totally captivated and curious and feeling sick about what I was reading. It is a page Turner until the last quarter of the book...it was incredibly slow paced and boring. I actually skipped over several pages. Torturing children for entertainment is not exactly an easy thing to read about...I don't think I would ever recommend this book to anyone under the age of 16 but that's just my opinion

1608191664|1.0|For example, in 'Thing 1 - There is no such thing as the free market' Chang exposes himself as an unabashed old school statist apologist. The following are examples of the fallacies that are present on every page:<br /><br />1. Free marketeers are politically motivated ?!  Wrong Chang, crony capitalists are politically motivated.<br /><br />2. The lack of child labor laws in the early 20th century is an example of the failure of capitalism ?!  Absurd apples and oranges comparison Chang.  Child labor was essential to survive in the early 20th century and those who could secure it meant the difference between life and death.  In sum, stop misleading with contextually flawed fallacious arguments.<br /><br />3. Pollution is an example of the failure of capitalism ?!  Absurd Chang, pollution is an example of government failure to prosecute external costs on private citizens and property owners. Hence, a truly capitalist society would place restrictions on external costs through enforceable contracts that enacted up front costs on polluters or forced them into legal arbitration.  If anything, government protects polluters (captured regulators) or acts as an agent to hyper-environmentalists (reliable special interest voting bloc) that limits non-polluting, beneficial and voluntary commerce.<br /><br />4. Lack of regulation led to the financial crisis?!  Absurd Chang, the preponderance of regulation within the banking and financial industries led to the financial crisis.  Indeed, Chang debunks himself in the same chapter by acknowledging that government controls interest rates that manifestly undermine self-correcting free market forces.  For example, artificially low interest rates incentivised capital investment in housing (an interest rate dependent industry) that created an unsustainable bubble. Moreover, implied government bailouts led to moral hazard in the financial/banking industry that incentivised reckless speculation.<br /><br />5. Economic conditions cannot tellus what the 'right' wages should be in China?!  Absurd Chang, free market mechanisms of supply and demand can absolutely determine equilibrium wage rates anywhere, including China.  It is when government forces artificial politically motivated influences that wages, economic realities, and in turn prosperity and living standards are destroyed.<br /><br />6. There is no scientific boundary for the free market. Absurd Chang, the free market unencumbered by government interference is the most effective means to reallocate societal wealth.  Indeed from an empirical perspective, the more free market oriented a society -- the more prosperous and the higher the living standards for all people, including those in the lower class.<br /><br />7. The free market only benefits the rich or those that have money ?!  Wrong Chang, in order to get rich you must satisfy CONSUMER preferences in a free, competitive and voluntary market -- voluntary being the key tenet -- in contrast, getting rich in a government centric economy means the rich must satisfy POLITICAL preferences in a quid pro quo scheme of bribes for favorable tax and regulatory policy.  Or in the case of special interests like religious interests, unions, environmentalists, et al it involves reliable special interest voting blocs for preferential tax and regulatory policy.<br /><br />In sum, what Chang glaringly fails to consider is this simple tenet --- capitalism is a free, competitive and voluntary market that is utterly dependent on decentralized power in the hands of individual consumers guaranteed 100% satisfaction with each 'vote'.  In contrast, government centric societies based on Chang's flawed economics is based on a coercive system that is dependent more on a political oligarchy that is seldom swayed or influenced by more than a small cabal of special interests and bribes from elites.<br /><br />And all this nonsense from Chang in just the first 'thing'.<br /><br />Find another book on statist economics --maybe Keynes, at least he is the original.

0307957934|2.0|During my professional career, I managed to build up an investment portfolio that wasn't too shabby. I've made a modest profit in good markets and I haven't lost too much in bad ones. And now that I'm retired, I'm still not buying a Lexus but I'm certainly comfortable. Fortunately, I've never been especially interested in the accumulation of wealth for its own sake. But what if there was a hedge fund out there, open only to a handful of very big investors, that could show an 80+% growth? Every year? That's what Dr. Alex Hoffman, late of CERN and now of Hoffman Investment Technologies in Geneva. His full partner, Hugo Quarry, is the front man, the salesman, the expert in the technical markets, but Alex is the brains, the creator of an innovative algorithm that manipulates every sector of the financial universe, and does it in milliseconds. Hoffman is a bit weird around the edges, but Hugo and the investors takes that as a mark of unfettered genius. He never used to care that much about money, either, but becoming a billionaire in less than a decade has changed him. And he has a new version of the algorithm that will put even the old one in the shade. But now strange things are happening: There are bank accounts that Alex didn't know about, buying things he didn't order. There are emails being sent to the company's officers, giving orders he's never intended, with results he never contemplated or imagined. And even his loving wife, a non-techy artist, is beginning to think he's losing it.<br /><br />If you ever saw the 1970 movie, \\"Colossus: The Forbin Project\\" (or read the Dennis Jones novel of the same name, on which it was based), then you should easily figure out the thrust of the plot before you reach page 75. The financial detail -- especially the revelation of how dramatically things have changed in just since the turn of the century, due to complete digitization of the worldwide markets -- is quite fascinating, I admit. Also a little scary. Although, not being a financier, I have no idea how accurate his take on things really is. But the basics of the plot are old, old, old, and very predictable. Self-aware computers have been a literary clich&eacute; for a long time now, and Harris doesn't even explain how it (or the algorithm, technically) got that way. Moreover, you can see the flaming ending coming a mile away. I've enjoyed all of Harris's novels to date, especially his historicals, but I have to score this one near the bottom of the list. Perhaps he should simply avoid setting his books in the present day.a financier, I have no idea how accurate his take on things really is.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|An excellent read with a gripping writing style. This would make a very good sci-fi film and has plenty of human drama to satisfy those that don't typically subscribe to the genre. Looking forward to more works from this author and highly recommend the series!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Whenever I'm down in the dumps, one of the things I can usually rely on to put me in a better mood is \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\".  I don't know what it is, but there's something about this show that gives me a warm, cheerful, naïvely optimistic outlook on life -- the sort of outlook that Bertie Wooster seems to have, at least in those rare moments when, with a little help from Jeeves, he manages to escape being bullied, blackmailed, or betrothed.<br /><br />In case you're not already familiar with \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\", it is a British TV show that originally ran from 1990-93 on ITV, and also aired in the U.S. as part of the PBS series \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\".  The show is based on the Jeeves stories of author P.G. Wodehouse; and it stars the fabulous comedy duo of Fry and Laurie in the title roles.<br /><br />Set in England (and a few episodes in New York) in the 1920s, the show recounts the misadventures of Bertram Wilberforce \\"Bertie\\" Wooster (Hugh Laurie) and his devoted manservant Reginald Jeeves (Stephen Fry).  Bertie and his friends and relatives seem to have a knack for getting themselves into trouble; and they usually have to rely on Jeeves to get them out of it.  Bertie Wooster is a hapless, yet loveable, upper-class twit, who just wants to enjoy a carefree life.  Unfortunately, his kind heart, dim wit, and total lack of backbone make it impossible for him to avoid getting caught up in other people's drama, which he usually ends up making worse.  Fortunately for him, he has Jeeves.  With his stoical unflappability, his erudite wisdom, and his encyclopedic knowledge of even the most obscure bits of factual information, Jeeves is the man you want by your side in any crisis.  And, since Wooster's life seems to be one crisis after another, he is very lucky to have Jeeves as his \\"gentleman's personal gentleman\\".  The always-proper, always-dignified, always-faithful Jeeves can be counted on to do what's best for his master, even in the most absurd of situations.<br /><br/>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (1881-1975) wrote nearly 100 books -- including full-length novels and collections of short stories -- many of which recounted humorous tales about members of the British aristocracy and gentry during the early 20th century, with many of his characters appearing in multiple stories.  His most famous stories were the ones about a clever valet named Jeeves who was constantly having to find ways to get his master, a wealthy loafer named Bertie Wooster, out of trouble.  But characters from the Jeeves stories also appeared in many of Wodehouse's other books.  He basically created an entire fictional universe of wacky characters, all of whom seemed to be connected to each other in some way, allowing him to write stories that could feature just about any combination of those characters.  But his most popular characters, by far, were Jeeves and Wooster.  This series is a pretty faithful adaptation of several of Wodehouse's Jeeves stories for television.  The stories were dramatized for television by the late Clive Exton (1930-2007), the same brilliant screenwriter who was responsible for dramatizing 31 of Agatha Christie's stories for the wonderful ITV television series \\"Poirot\\".<br /><br />The humor in \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" is a cross between a comedy of manners and a farce.  It caricatures the members of the British upper classes (especially the younger members) as eccentric, not very bright, out of touch with the real world, self-absorbed, spoiled, lazy, petulant, scheming, amoral, uncultured, bumbling, foolish, and almost totally dependant on their servants -- who are invariably portrayed as smarter, wiser, and classier than their masters -- to insure that they maintain the proper standards of decorum for people of their social standing.  But most of the humor comes from the wacky schemes that these upper-class halfwits come up with in order to accomplish their selfish goals, which invariably get them into trouble.  And, try as he mightto avoid it, Bertie Wooster always seems to get caught right in the middle of all this trouble, and has to rely on Jeeves to get him out.  Fortunately, Jeeves is so clever that he can almost always figure out a way to resolve the problem; though the resolution often comes at the expense of Bertie's pride and dignity.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great show; and I highly recommend it.  Fry and Laurie are brilliant in it, as they are in everything they are in, especially when they work together.  There are 23 episodes in all, over four seasons (5 episodes in the first season, 6 episodes in each of the remaining seasons).  The only complaint I have is that most of the secondary characters who appear in more than one season are not played by the same actor throughout all four seasons.  You get used to seeing one actor in a particular role, and then in the next season a different actor might be playing that role.  It can be quite jarring.  But that's my only complaint.  It's a wonderful show, with lots of clever humor and witty dialogue, fun characters, and even some really good music (if you like the music of the Jazz Age as much as I do).  Get it and watch it.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoilers -- it's better for new viewers to discover all the fun things about this show first hand by actually watching for themselves rather than reading about them in a review -- but I do want to pass along one little tidbit of knowledge that might enhance your appreciation of certain aspects of the show.  It has to do with money.  Because many of the characters in this show are quite wealthy, money is mentioned a lot throughout the series.  But, since these stories are set in Britain in the 1920s, American viewers today might not have a clue what sort of sums are being discussed.  For example, when a judge fines Bertie £5, or when someone asks to borrow £10 from Bertie to pay for drinks at a bar, these sound to us like fairly trivial amounts.  But,actually, that was quite a lot of money back then.  Five pounds sterling in 1925 would be roughly equivalent to $300 in today's money; and £10 then would be worth about $600 now.  So, whenever you hear characters talking about sums of money in British pounds (\\"quid\\"), multiply that amount by 60 and you'll get a rough approximation of how much they're talking about in today's American dollars.  For amounts less than £1, which are measured in shillings (\\"bob\\") and pence (where 1 shilling = 12 pence, and 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence) just keep in mind that one shilling in 1925 would be roughly equivalent to $3 today, and one British penny back then would have about the same value as an American quarter does today.  When they are talking about American currency (e.g. in the episodes set in New York), just multiply everything by 13 to get a very rough estimate of what it would be worth in today's dollars (e.g. $1 then = about $13 now).  Understanding this will help you better appreciate the obscene amounts of money that are routinely tossed around by the wealthy characters in these stories, such as when Bertie bets £100 on a race.<br /><br />So, now that you have this little bit of knowledge to aid in your enjoyment, you're ready to begin your fun adventure with \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\".  Trust me, you'll love every minute of it.  And, if you're in a bad mood, it just might cheer you up.
B00701897I|1.0|I'm European, and I also grew up with TinTin comics. Although this movie was graphically fantastic and I love how TinTin looked the storyline was wanting. It just trust us from one action scene to the next and then back again. I felt like I was watching young indiana jones, the scenery was the same, the music was the same and the action scenes were the same. I was actually yelling at the screen (at home) at the end of this insult to my childhood icon.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert------<br />--Oh we lost the ship, but by chance we have the ships telegraph transmission codes, and here comes interpol that knows how to use these codes to track the ship, and I  and oh look again there is an airplane ready for us to catch the ship, that is apparently going back home to where the story started! --<br />You have got to be kidding me! I feel insulted that they try to pass this by us!<br /><br />In my opinion Spielberg is a one trick pony, and his movies are tired and boring. Hollywood needs to give some new talent a chance.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great price for all of the movies. I've seen the collection for around the same price at a few stores and online, but the free shipping was great and the set is brand new.

B005WFWVL4|5.0|With his trademark brutal realism, director Steven Soderbergh steps in with his take on the apocalyptic genre of film so popular these days.  \\"Contagion\\" is a film that separates itself pretty well from the 2012 syndrome so many directors like to take advantage of these days.  A virus is borne not because God wants it, not because there is someone who devised it and sent it other people in the mail, but because a few simple accidents in nature occur.  What ensues is a gruelling and very human battle against this disease, as Soderberg follows the head of the CDC (Lawrence Fishburne), a simple man (Matt Damon) who loses his wife in the opening scene (you get to see Gwyneth Paltrow get sick and die, and unlike in [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]] you get to see the details).<br /><br />The beauty and terror of this masterfully crafted film is the lack of sentimentality.  There are heroes and villains but only *human* heroes and villains. Kate Winslet plays Dr. Ben Mears, a self sacrificing woman who travels the world to research the disease on behalf of the CDC and pays a great price.  Jude Law plays the truly chilling Alan Krumwiede, a wannabe writer/popular blogger who takes advantage of the situation for money and prestige, almost a Hitleresque figure. The performances (especially Winslet and Damon) are fantastic, and anyone who has suffered from a virus long term should see this film.  It's a bit like watching your relatives get it too, and watching how *they* would react.  Recommended.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As enthralled as I was by A Game of Thrones, the first book in this series, I really expected to take a break and read in some other genre after I finished that book. Oh, I tried; but it was not to be. About 100 pages into the history I chose I found myself wanting to know more about the epic struggle in Westeros and how the events in the first book were casting ripples from Westeros, across the Narrow Sea and to the lands beyond.<br /><br />I'm convinced George R.R. Martin is producing literary crack with his stories of the battles and the intrigues of this fictional land. I almost referred to Westeros as a \\"mythical\\" land, but that would have fallen short as a description. Mythic has always seemed to refer to larger-than-life characters. In A Clash of Kings the characters are life-sized and very human. They are also very complicated, neither entirely good nor entirely evil. Even when they may do evil things, their motivations seem truly human and understandable. There are no \\"classic\\" bad guys who chortle with glee when their nefarious plans come to fruition. I even found myself empathizing with Cersei and her son, King Joffery, who are arguably the least likable characters.<br /><br />Not only does Martin produce fascinating characters, but the world of Westeros is masterfully built. Rather than throw tons of exposition at readers all at once, Martin lets the kingdoms blossom slowly and we are constantly making new discoveries. Take, for example, his decriptions of the religions of Westeros. In A Game of Thrones he offers some details of the new gods and the old gods. In A Clash of Kings he adds new details that enhance what has come before. The technique adds layers of depth to the story.<br /><br />Likewise, the world Martin created is a morally neutral one. Evil sometimes triumphs. Good sometimes get corrupted. Even the most noble characters can die (as we learned in the first book). Martin isn't afraid to turn the conventional wisdom of fantasy on its head (or even shake them up, toss them in a literary food processor, and serve up the results to readers). As a result - at least in the first two works - you get a series weaving traditional fantasy threads through a world that feels very natural and organic.<br /><br />I've purposely avoided discussing the plot of A Clash of Kings. That's partly because any synopsis I could write would pale in comparison to Martin's complicated, yet readable, plotting. That he can keeps us reading while his plot runs from battlefields to bedchambers to the froze land beyond The Wall to the Red Waste across the Narrow Sea is nothing short of amazing. Couple that with some of the most fascinating characters I've ever encountered between the covers of a book and you have an absolute winner. Tyrion, Jon Stark, Arya, Caitlyn ... I'd almost swear these were flesh-and-blood people who allowed me to look over their shoulders.<br /><br />It's nearly impossible to heap enough praise on Martin's series, but allow me one more observation: rather than taking a break after completing A Clash of Kings, I've already downloaded the next in the series, A Storm of Swords, and will eagerly dive into it tonight.r even shake them up, toss them in a literary food processor, and serve up the results to readers).

B006PTZNSY|1.0|It's garbage. I don't know if it's possible for her to go back to the person she used to be with all the plastic surgery..... but she's not going to last. She needs to spend less time into trying to be a brand and more time into her music. I could care less about her 50/11 wigs and her ever expanding a$$. If she can't invest 100% into her music she can dip. Sorry.
B004NTDEXY|5.0|American history X is one of those movies that stays with you long after watching it. It should be required viewing is all schools for social studies..It takes an unflinching look at race relations in America and doesn't point fingers. It just puts it out there so you cannot do anything but confront it.<br /><br />History of Violence is another little gem of a movie..A bit of a sleeper as it got very little notice when it came out..<br /><br />They both look great on Blu-ray. PQ, SQ, ect are all BR worthy..Nothing to complain about..
B0052UZIFA|3.0|works like a champ on my HTC incredible. however game crashes on tablet. very disappointing. hope the developers fix this issue
0984999302|1.0|Seems a bit hypocritical that someone who presents himself as an authority on how to build a startup in 2012 with preaches about disruption and listening to one's customers... should choose to publish his book in hardcover only - simply to game the higher paying bracket at the expense of the environment and customer satisfaction, without giving customers even the option to purchase the book in e-format (kindle/audible) up front. Worse - many have complained and the author still has not demonstrated his supposedly sharp listening skills nor capability to pivot to his customers. Shame on you.<br />PS: This is the same as with Eric Ries's company, which has poor customer satisfaction record. So much for profiteering from one's own advice while dodging it simultaneously. Brilliant? Not really. Hope you correct this soon and if you do I'll consider giving you an updated review.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I used to love this app.  I would use it all the time, however the last two updates have made it so I can no longer use the app on my phone.  I am incredibly disappointed.  I select the app and it take 5 mintues to open and when I try to read it takes a very long time to change pages.  It completely shuts down the rest of the phone until the app is closed.  Sometimes I have to take the battery out of my phone because my phone has frozen and I can't do anything with it at all.  Please restore the app so that I can use it or tell my how I can find and download the older version of the app.  MyTouch 3G
B0073XORCY|5.0|I wrote a huge review rating this album at 2/5 ... and I feel bad now because  this is a really good album, musically and lyrically .. but the thing that is really  annoying and that gave me my first impression is the nauseating lectures and  silly stories Ian wove into this album.  Some of it is really great, but it sometimes  seem ham-handed and lecturing.  I just cannot stand the spoken word pieces  that come right in the middle of the music.  That I stand by.    The rest of the album is really good.  One other thing I just get bothered with is  the sort of mocking tone Ian speaks in when he is exploring whether Gerald  Bostock grew up to be gay ... and I just wonder, why does that need to be in  there.  I cannot figure out what it about, pro, con, mocking, accepting.    The other songs and themes are very good for the most part, particularly good  are Shunt and Shuffle, Changing Horses ... Kismet in Suburbia has some real  blistering heat to it worth of anything Jethro Tull.    This always happens when i get a Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson album, it just  takes a long time for it get absorbed and then it makes sense and sounds  fantastic.    Another winner.is an embarrassment, and it is done in the new voices ... ie. accordion especially, which is the greatest innovation Ian/Tull has put forth in the last decade or more.<br /><br />In the 70's Ian Anderson concocted the concept album, not I think he has concocted the geriatric dodderers albums.  I think Ian has finally succeeded in crawling completely up his rear end.<br /><br />There is poetry in Ian's stilted snobbish delivery which I'm sure some will like, but it is the over-emphasis of most of what I do not like about this style of music.  It starts and stops. the music just gets going and as usual grinds to a halt for some trite clumsy passage.  That used to be kind of endearing 40 years ago, but today it is merely Jethro Tull cliche.  The poetry is a little like the delivery on Hot Mango Surprise on DotCom album.<br /><br />I'm probably being overly hard on this on my first listen, but that is what I hear so far.<br /><br />None of the old band members are on this album, which is technically an Ian Anderson album and not a Jethro Tull album.  I am not sure if Martin Barre might have saved it, but apparently he is a long way away from this stinker.<br /><br />It is so out of the blue that Ian would fail so miserably, but this has been a trend, of getting over technical, emotionally removed, intellectually constipated and a total know-it-all snob.  I am really let down, but hey, 1 bad album out of so many is still amazingly good, I was just hoping for so much more after such a long time without hearing from one of my favorite bands of old.<br /><br />There is one saving thing that might make me had to come back here and change my review.  That is when I get a Tull album it is often a week or two before I get a handle on it and soon I am whistling and humming it all around ... so who knows, maybe this will grow on me.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a better result with \\"Passion Play 2\\" that will come out in another 12 years! ;-)

B002VBV1S6|5.0|Scott Lynch is a narrative genius! He uses perfect imagery to create a world in which the reader can come to love a character as flawed as Locke Lamora. His attention to detail when creating the plot and circumstances of the book really make it stand out as more a work of art than a novel. Every character comes to the book fully imagined and fleshed out down to the last quirk and nuance. Locke is just enough parts innocent, mastermind, loyal friend and mystery to keep anyone guessing what his reactions will be. Like all the best books, there is no black and white or right and wrong in Locke's world, only grey, which of course, he uses to his advantage. I was hooked after the first paragraph and didn't stop until the end... and then on again to the end of the second book...!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a fabulous application. It really helps with my productivity. The different notebooks allow me to seperate schoolwork from my book I'm writing from my to-do list, etc. The ability to add photos or pdfs to the notes is extremely useful, and the new speech to text and audio recording functionality makes a busy life easier. The web clipper function on the computer is also quite handy. But the greatest thing about Evernote is the wide variety of ways to access it. As long as you have an Internet connection, you have Evernote, whether that connection is on a phone, a Kindle, or a computer.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A really good read,great pace ,kept my interest up right to the end. Not too long! altough the ending I felt was a little too rushed,all in all great piece of work.

Get a GorillaPod or something.

B005CKPQNE|5.0|This is the greatest series.  I can't wait until Season 5 is aired.  If it came out on Netflix first...I would buy it.
B0073XORCY|1.0|As many others have said, calling this a sequel to TAAB is a ruse to sell more copies. Simply sticking tiddly little bits of music from TAAB into this dreck does not make it a sequel. It has none of what made TAAB the album it was, and TAAB2 has already garnered more 1 star reviews as the original did in 40 years (and I'm sure there will be LOTS more)! I have listened to it 4 times already and while I occasionally find myself interested in what I'm hearing, I also often find myself just not caring. It's an Ian Anderson solo album all the way and Jethro Tull should not be mentioned on the cover (or anywhere else). I have seen Tull live many (20+) times and saw Ian's \\"Rubbing Elbows\\" solo tour. I have listened to Ian's voice go steadily downhill and it's obvious that this album was written in a key that he can almost sing without straining, but the damage has been done. It's time to hang it up. RIP.

Can those lockers be located? The jet lands on a snowy mountain top then calls for rescue. [Would those government agents discuss confidential matters in public?] The villains await the rescue team. They want to find those lockers and recover the money. [A well-planned operation?]<br /><br />[Nobody wears a hat in cold windy weather.] The villains shoot at the rescuers and create an avalanche! Gabriel throws the locker over the cliff, it opens and spills its contents. Gabriel climbs to the station to get warm clothing. The find those $1000 bills and remove them from the locker. One villains uses nigh vision goggles but Gabriel overpowers him. Burning paper provides warmth. The story runs on with the usual dramatic threats and escapes. Can Gabriel and Jessie escape the overhead bomb? Yes. The rescue helicopter is decoyed into landing. Another killing. Gabriel and Jessie escape a booby-trap. One of the villains is sacrificed for power. Another one dies trying to kill Hal. The renegade agent follows a false lead. Travis complains about his choices. Gabriel escapes by jumping off a cliff. Travis walks on ice and meets his doom. Qualen has Jessie in the rescue helicopter and offers a trade.

I'm glad I did because it helped me to understand the tragic ending and the mystery as to why it ended the way it did.  Would highly recommend this book to anyone that likes murder mysteries and fast reads.  Hope the author's other books are as good.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|to put it simply... great music by great musicians. it doesn't get much better than this... the album from start to finish is just beautiful. Regardless of whether you have seen the movie, this album is a collection of some of the most amazing melodies I have ever heard.

0345803485|5.0|I will admit right off that I started this book to see what all the hype was about. I'm not a BDSM romance fan so expected to skim it and not like it. Instead I found myself captivated by the dark, complex character of Christian Grey and the free spirited Anastasia. My previous experiences with BDSM writing was a couple by Laura Leigh and Maya Banks. Didn't care for them. Found them terribly unrealistic in their emotional portrayals. With this book, I loved how Anastasia challenged Christian and his beliefs, rules, and the scenerio he laid out for their relationship. I loved how Christian was willing to listen, digest and change for Anastasia. I also loved the mixture of prose and email exchanges. The book was a mixture of information on the BDSM lifestyle, a romance that had humor and pathos, and a well written piece of literature. Can't wait to read the next two!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Although I read most of the posted reviews prior to purchasing this knife, I was taken aback by the mass and weight of the BK2 Companion. There is nothing wimpy about this knife. It's put together like the proverbial brick outhouse. It's obvious a lot of thought went into the design. If you are equipment-weight conscious, this knife is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you want a solid, reliable piece of steel which feels good in your hand, this is your knife.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is super fun!! You will run out of energy but if you just stop for like an hour you'll have all your energy back!! This game is very addictive and the energy is kinda over priced....$1.99 for only 5 energy things.(I think that's how many you get for $1.99.) So if you like games that are fun and cheap then I would suggest to get this app! I hope you have as much fun as I do playing this game!! :D
B004QOB8SO|4.0|The three almost-movie-length episodes of the second series are, in some ways, more of the same, but when \\"the same\\" is one of the best re-interpretive series in the history of television, well... that's a mouthful. The only disappointing aspect of series 2 is that it doesn't quite live up to series 1. The ongoing plot thread involving Moriarty was resolved in a way that I thought didn't really express the sense that the books give: that he's not only a twisted sort of fan of Sherlock, but also his mental peer.<br /><br />Still love Doctor Watson, and the romantic tension between Sherlock and Watson continues to be a source of humor in the show. Everyone seems to step up their acting game a bit in the 2nd series (if you can believe it), and the music continues to be a joy (I have to go see if it's available as a soundtrack, now).
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|I thought enough of it to pay the 99 cents to register it. Then again, I have a cat and it freaks them out to hear the app meow at them. The free version has ads and some other limits.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|After the free weekend of HBO I just got that played every episode of GAME OF THRONES back to back, I was excited to watch it, being a fan of genre television. I was also a fan of a lot of the people involved, from Sean Bean to Mark Addy to Lena Headey to Peter Dinklage.<br /><br />So, watch it I did, and it was just about everything I hoped it would be: smart, engaging, involving, bawdy, lusty and just the right amount of the fantastical that doesn't take away from the rather gritty realism the show has. In short, the show is addictive, and it almost made me want to subscribe to HBO just to be able to watch it.<br /><br />But after taking the last few days to think about it, I've found some things that I just don't think work as well as they should and maybe it's more revealed in Martin's books but I just have to sound off.<br /><br />I have a great amount of respect for this show. It's done very well. I found myself liking characters I didn't think I'd care about, such as Dani Targaryen and Khal Drogo. I found myself hating characters I thought I'd like, like Littlefinger Baelish (which makes me think, was anyone on THE WIRE American? Not that I care, but I just find it funny with Aidan Gillen, Dominic West and Idris Elba...). But the characters that are a little too one-dimensional are ultimately MOST of The Starks and MOST of the Lannisters. We get to see Catelyn be the loving, doting mother and wife, but once things go all pear-shaped, we get to see her more brutal and vicious side. Ned, Robb, Jon... all the Stark men, really, are men of honor, courage, and virtue. And conversely, other than Tyrion (who is just AWESOME), the Lannisters are unrelenting scumbags with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, with the exception of a few scenes of Cersei's, where we see some of the stone that her heart has become begin to bleed.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I'm all for clear heroes and clear villains in a film. But in a film, you only get a few hours at most to develop characters and sometimes, there's too much story to get in the way of adding layers to the characters. Television is a lot different though. You can get more into the thick of the characters. In many ways, television is more about character than it is about action and story, and this was the only way I felt the show fall short.<br /><br />Now, this is just the first season, and with the Lannisters and Starks largely intact, I'm relatively certain we'll see these characters with more dimension and depth. Until then, I want a Direwolf pup really bad.<br /><br />A Lannister always pays his debts, but Winter is coming. Season Two could get really awesome.characters and sometimes, there's too much story to get in the way of adding layers to the characters. Television is a lot different though.

In many ways, television is more about character than it is about action and story, and this was the only way I felt the show fall short.<br /><br />Now, this is just the first season, and with the Lannisters and Starks largely intact, I'm relatively certain we'll see these characters with more dimension and depth. Until then, I want a Direwolf pup really bad.<br /><br />A Lannister always pays his debts, but Winter is coming. Season Two could get really awesome.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|These are very lightweight. And seem pretty comfortable. I've only wore them for 10 minutes while walking into work but I'm happy with them
B000W93CHC|5.0|At first I was skeptical about a sequel to such a legendary book, as sequels all too often fall well short of the original; however it only took a few pages and I could see that that would not be the case with this book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game... load of fun... something for everyone... all ages... all skill sets ...<br /><br />I will seek out other games from this company.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I'm definitely having fun plying all the different games. I think it could be better if before the start of a new game it gave a descripting of the objective without having to go to the help menu
B006PZBRCY|4.0|I didn't care much for what I saw in the trailers for this film, and let's be honest that it's kind of a weak title. That being said, I really enjoyed the movie. The special effects were impressive without being overdone and in your face, and the story line worked very well. I found myself caring about the characters a lot more than I initially thought I would. Jackman was excellent as always, and Evangeline Lilly...well, she was nice to look at anyway.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I have all of Rick's books. I did not know of him untill i found one of his books at a yard sell. Right when i read the first book I fell in LOVE with his books, and bought all of them. Cant wait for book three of The Heros Of Olympus to come out all ready saving up for it! :)
B00423BDUC|5.0|I have owned this movie in all it's original formats. VHS, Laserdisc, and PAL DVD. I have made my own conversion to NTSC DVD for myself. I would trully love to see this movie get special treatment and come out in Bluray!!! woohoo... This movie is a very feel good movie from begining to end. Funny, sad, and romantic. Needless to say, I love it. Please bring this movie to US Blueray.
B006M4RN3U|2.0|I've been a fun. fan for a very long time, well, a The Format and fun. fan for a very long time. I was very excited to get this album, and when I was finally able to get my hands on it I came to a disappointing and sad realization: fun. has sold out.<br /><br />I hate to be that indie music snob who wants to lead a crusade against labels of any sort, but this is a perfect example of what can happen to a very talented band.<br /><br />Sure, the songs might be a little catchy, but they lack the life, emotion, and power that we've consistently seen before in The Format and fun.'s first album: Aim and Ignite.<br /><br />Remember the song \\"The First Single\\"? Remember the emotion it made you feel, the desire to clap your hands and sing along with no regrets? You won't find anything like that here. Or how about \\"Be Calm\\", when Nate reminds us to be calm, even when we feel like we're breaking down? The emotion, the power in that song? They weren't able to keep to their own advice to be calm, and they broke down when the times got tough and they signed on to a label. The correlation is there, and it might not be the causation, but it certainly is questionable as to why very talented musicians would suddenly water down and ugly-fy their frontman's voice with autotune, or even succumb to a murky pop sound that might be served alongside cheap beer at a community college party.<br /><br />The overwhelmingly positive reviews come from the selling out to a more mainstream style sound,i.e. autotune pop, which in turns appeals to a much larger audience. I'd assume most of these positive reviews seen here and in iTunes come from listeners who have recently become aware of fun.'s existence. Your more negative reviews will come from people like me, who understood the talent and power in fun.'s previous album and who were there alongside Nate in The Format.<br /><br />Well, they're getting the recognition that their previous works were due but never attained. I hope they find the success and money that they desire with this new album's release, but it won't find a home in my collection of music.
0143119680|5.0|Find a complete review of this title at ([...])    I absolutely enjoyed this book and can't wait for the next one. I'm usually late to the party on trilogies, so waiting for the sequel is hardly bearable!
0812550706|4.0|This was the first science fiction book I ever read.  It opened my eyes to a world of the future and sparked my interest is seeing beyond what could be seen right in front of me.  As a 12-yr-old, I thought it was the best book ever.  I tried to read it again as an adult, and though I still liked it very much, it felt a little outdated.  Still will be a book and story I will always remember!
B000JML7YC|5.0|I love J.A. Reading her on the Kindle is a great thing to sooth the soul. I have all the books available for the Kindle from her.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Not bad story from a cowboy. But a little bit uncomfortable while reading shooting people. The American idea isn't as great as the boy believe.
B005ZUR724|5.0|you can uninstall it and redownload it. then it might work its what I did with nova 2 and now it worked fine.<br />if it works then your welcome. that's all post by shotgunmick
B007IXGUG0|5.0|I'm not really into the whole rap game, so I'm not aware which rapper is dissing other rappers. And you won't find me bumping rap songs in my car (I'm an indie rock guy lol), but this album has been in my cd player for months. Drake's flows are legit.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm currently reading the last book in the trilogy and have no idea how I've been able to read this far. The overall storyline has some very interesting elements, but those fall by the wayside in the wake of chronic repetition. If I have to read one more curse word prefaced by \\"holy\\" I'm going to bang my head against the wall. Ditto for \\"shyly,\\" \\"come,\\" \\"inner goddess,\\" \\"Christian smell,\\"\\"twitching palms,\\"biting lip,\\" etc.<br /><br />Another pet peeve is the constant emphasis on age - anyone not in their 20s being thought old by Ana is just plain ignorant. Ana, in general, is immature and lacking and probably needs a psychologist as much as Christian.  The fact that Christian continually wants to \\"punish\\" Ana is also disturbing in the extreme, as well as creepy (the BDSM backdrop could have been handled a bit more tastefully). There is nothing to endear these characters to me at all.<br /><br />Lastly, I have a problem with the author not doing her research on American speech. When you set a novel in a specific country (that is not your own), you don't use your own dialect and phrasing. This trilogy reads like any of the myriad British novels I have read over the years. She should have just set the story in the UK, and not bothered with the US.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that the books got such huge plugs on the Today Show and GMA, which is why I bought them in the first place.I can't say I'd recommend this series to anyone and I don't see myself reading it again. The sheer number of people awarding these books 5 stars is frankly surprising. I guess much of the public does not require quality in their reading materials these days if the majority of reviews for this trilogy is to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Laters...
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|A spectacular show especially in Blu-ray high def on large flat screen TV! Theater is magnificent! Only way this would be any better would be by being there in person. If you liked Phantom live, you will be more than pleased with the Blu-ray.
0756405890|5.0|I'd classify this as a \\"college memories\\" book. It is fantasy, but you will find yourself reminiscent of college days. It is by no means a fast paced action book, nor a hack-n-slash.<br /><br />Still a great enjoyable book, it will set you humming and your spirits high and like the author says, every tale worth telling has to do with a woman. Great book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|this is an awesome book, in fact i'm considering buying the hardcover just for the vintage photographs.  i enjoyed every minute, and i highly recommend this book!
0307956350|2.0|The progression of the book is not at all linear.  it kept going back in forth in time and was therefore hard to keep straight. Are we in Paris or Luxemburg for this chapter? Are they friends or enemies at this point? for an experienced CIA agent, Kate makes a lot of dumb mistakes and doesn't notice things around her. overall, it wasn't a waste of time to read, but it isn't a great book, either.
B005FISC52|5.0|They say, all's well that end's well and after 9 years and 187 episodes the residents of Tree Hill say goodbye. For real, this time. Against all odds, OTH has managed to come back time and again and went from being the \\"show on the bubble\\" to being the \\"little show that could\\". I think it's safe to say that we have all been moved to tears more than once during it's nine year run and it's surely kept me on the edge of my seat more times than I care to count.<br /><br />Now, after a relatively calm season 8 we get to bid our favorite group of North Carolinians farewell with 13 drama packed episodes that will warm and break our hearts all at the same time. With Dan back in the picture, it doesn't seem too much of a coincidence when, at the same time, Nathan goes missing. Is Tree Hill's favorite villain behind his son's disappearance? There's trouble on the horizon for Brooke and Julian as well, as the couple struggle with their new role as parents to their twins and their lives get put in danger when an old acquaintance gets released from prison. And as Clay starts mysteriously wandering off in his sleep, Quinn's worries and suspicions about his nightly whereabout and his well-being begin to mount. And when everything comes to a climax, a shocking secret from a past life is revealed, while some of Tree Hill's residents put their lives at risk in order to save Nathan and bring him home.<br /><br />Never before has a season of One Tree Hill been this coherent and exciting. I couldn't wait to see how it would all pan out week after week, and before I knew it, it was over. In a way, it makes me sad to see a show which had such a deep impact on my adolescence come to an end. But at the same time, I feel that there couldn't have been a better time or way to say goodbye.<br /><br />It was truly beautiful to see it all come full circle in what couldn't have been a more perfect finale! We got to see everybody gather around for the 10th anniversary of Tric. We saw old wishes come true and new ones get made. We saw love and laughter, old friends and new opportunities. And we got to take a quick look at what the future holds in store for Brooke, Haley, Nathan and everybody else - and it is pretty damn perfect!<br /><br />As a long time fan of the show, I have been hoping that an eventual finale would be worthy of its kindness and beauty for years. So instead of being sad, I have decided to be happy to have gotten just that. A worthy ending of a beautiful journey. A journey I am sure as hell gonna relieve on DVD over and over again.<br /><br />Cheers to our little show that did! #GoodnightOneTreeHill
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I was a young kid when I first saw Live In Central Park, both nights. Diana Ross was then and still is my favorite of all time. You'll never be sorry if you have never seen it before. Buy today and enjoy!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app!! i can find everything i need and i love the fact that they have the KJV :)
B000HEWEDK|5.0|The missing footage is not as good as the additional stories about the production,invisible boy and the thin man episode.  It's a product worth the money and I had bought the forbidden planet disc but saw the additional disc and hadn't seen the other movies in a long time.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Sandra Bullock is hilarious. You can really connect with her.  The story line is a little corny, but the characters really keep it flowing.  Betty White...how could you possibly go wrong with her being part of the cast.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Really good to hear new music from the creative force behind Jethro Tull with the double bonus of being a full blown concept album. Its a must listen to from start to finish and worth a few more listens to explore the intricate sound,tempo shifts, subtle humor and story. I actually would liken this to a musical score and think it will make for a very good live performance. I do know Ian is on tour to play both TAAB and TAAB2, I will catch this show for sure. In my opinion tracks 3,5,7,8,9,and 10 are the strongest with the others also being good. It took a bit to get used to the couple of spoken word parts, which were short, but interrupted the flow of the music and I didn't care for it on first listen. Subsequently, I see where it fits into the rest of what is a neat package of music with great musicianship, and a refreshing breath from the rather listless grind of popular musics one hit wonders, meaning it's something to sit back and really listen to. It's only fault will be the listener who compares it to TAAB1,or expects Tull from 1972. It compares more to the Ian Anderson solo albums, a little subtler and quieter than Tull, but this one has enough harder rock to be my favorite among the Anderson solo works, definitely the most interesting too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games was a good read,, exciting and held my interest from cover to cover.  I weould reccomend it to other readers.
B004B32532|5.0|I happened upon Jadorowsky in a boxed dvd set with accolades from John Lennon, among others. Still I wasn't convinced, but the price was right and I picked it up with a couple other movies. How does the mass marketed world of Hollywood claptrap manage to hide a visionary film director and bury what are certainly among the greatest film experiences ever? I guess it's good that one has to do a little searching or arrive at these when the time is right.<br /> They are not for everyone. Don't go out and buy copies for the kiddies (though I hope I would have appreciated these at age 16+); these are liberal arts college film school/art school, NOT MAINSTREAM films.<br /> Now, on to Santa Sangre. I found a VHS tape of this film, so cannot comment on the extras provided on the dvd. Read the other reviews: it is a deeply psychological study unfolding onto film the mind of its protagonist. Within a context of what seems unbelievable, the suspension of my disbelief was complete. all elements are woven ultimately together and for all its phantasmagoria or grand guinal or whatever artsy term you choose, it is great storytelling and great filmmaking. I found it believable within the rich traditions of hispanic myth and yiddish theater. think freda kahlo meets marc chagall on film. i have become more comfortable with the images of real life, as here, moreso than the packaged prettiness of hollywood. i am bored by movies with attractive actors and big stars. this is life on screen and myth from life, brought to life.<br /> i don't want to get too esoteric, but this is filmmaking that draws from, but is itself, original. it's a beautiful film. beautifully written. deeply moving and memorable. i have watched a lot of great films. this is one of the best.

0140544518|5.0|My mother owned a hardcover version of this book when I was young & I loved reading it, so I decided to buy this to share with my daughter who is 6. I read it to her right when I got it & she loves it. She an advanced reader for her age & she's able to read it now too.
0385344228|5.0|Totally compelling and intelligent; I was completely enthralled into this story and found it difficult to put down. You really want to know what happens. I was hooked from the beginning and I love that feeling when reading a novel.<br /><br />This was a great story.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|Ever since Sid Vicious, I've watched as many Gary Oldman movies as I can find. Yet again, Oldman does a superb job in Tinker Tailor! I adored every detail of the movie...watched it twice during rental period because I realized I'd missed specific foreshadowing. Watching TTSS has inspired me to read a few books about Kim Philby; specifically \\"the secret war against the jews\\" by John Loftus.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app. use it daily and perfect for when the storms. are approaching. highly recommended to anyone with mild to major weather interest
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The recent update is causing the app to crash continously.  Uninstalled several times. I miss my books. Wish they would fix this so I can get back to it. Next time I won't install the update, it worked great before. Very unhappy right now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i kmow the ending was ok but if u r team peeta then read the epiloge it made me smile for three days no joke........and it gave me goose pimpils
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|If you loved the Fifty Shades trilogy, then run, don't walk, to snatch this book up. Bared To You offers the same style of complexity and angst that I love in E.L. James' books and I'm thrilled to have found a new series that keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next book. Well done -- can't wait for the next one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i never  stopped reading this book. i am a not a fond reader but all of my friends made me read it and i dont regret it.this book captures a romantic and grafic side of your mind

B004MC8CA2|5.0|excellent app. the ability to listen to the verses is great. highly recommend to others that enjoy reading the bible daily.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book...a bit disturbing in the concept however, but shows the devotion of a mother for her son no matter what he is accused of doing and/or being.
0857685627|5.0|This was a gift and I was happy with the quality of it. It turned out to be a nice gift for someone!
0439023521|4.0|This book owes a lot to [[ASIN:0871292645 The Lottery]] by Jackson. That said, it's absolutely a combination of that, [[ASIN:0399537422 Lord of the Flies Centenary Edition]] and the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Although the first 20 pages start a tiny bit slow, by the time the reaping starts it's actually hard to stay asleep at night for want of waking up to finish it. It's gross, too, but neither unmanageably nor pointlessly (also reminiscent of The Lottery). Diving right into the next...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|When I first downloaded this app I didn't think it would be such a great game. Then when I started playing it I began to realize irlt was a very fun timeconsuming game that sometimes got very fun due to the fact that I didn't know where the game instructions were. I wouldn't recommend this game to people who get frustrated and throw there phone or tablet on the ground but would to everyone else.
0439023491|4.0|More odes to [[ASIN:0871292645 The Lottery]] and [[ASIN:0399537422 Lord of the Flies Centenary Edition]], but now mix in some [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]], too. Also, shades of Jerry Springer a la surprises and twists galore (way to drop a bomb on live tv, Peeta). This is clearly the middle of one big three-part book, which I guess it's good I didn't start until all three were out, as they shouldn't especially stand alone.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I have been building computers now for over 12 years, most if not all AMD based machines. I read the reviews looked at You Tube videos and all of them bashed this chip, how horrible it was who couldn't get their games to work or professed 10 year veterans at computer building who said this was the worst chip AMD ever made. I decided to take the risk anyway and I am glad I did.<br /><br />This chip is fantastic I had absolutely no setup issues at all it boots and runs like a beast on my Asus M5A 970 board and that was before I did a modest overclock at 3.8Ghz, I could easily get it to 4.7 Ghz because this chip overclocks effortlessly but I live in the Caribbean and heat is an issue so 3.8 it great. It idles at 37 degrees Celsius and gets up to 55 under load at this frequency.<br /><br />I use my computer for graphic design and gaming. Coupled with a GTX 460 I can run Skyrim on ultra-high settings with the hi res pack installed to my 32 inch HDTV which I use as a monitor, with excellent frame rates, so to Modern Warfare 3, Starcraft 2, Demigod, Spore, Split Second and the Sims 3 all of them run on the highest settings and the system does not skip a beat. When Graphic designing I have Bryce 7, Poser 2010, 3DSMax and CorelDraw open at the same time without problems.<br /><br />This is a great chip and I am very happy with my upgrade. I have a machine that performs very very well that does everything I ask of it with no hiccups whatsoever and I didn't have to rob a bank to do it.
0385534639|5.0|This book must be read with a willingness to allow imagination to take over and fly. If you can do that with this book, there are vast amounts of creativity and beauty to carry you through the story. I happen to love an opportunity to be spirited away into a realm of wonders, and this affords that in spades. The story is subtle. The imagery is king.<br /><br />Thoughts while I was reading...trying hard not to read it too-quickly-up-all-night. 4 stars at least, and halfway done. Ok, it's done. Can't tell just how in love, but I am at least most of the way to head-over-heels for this. 4 to 5 stars throughout.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|There have been some great reviews of this film and I can only say in HD it looks clean and fresh as when it was released so if your a fan of this film by all means get it in HD one way or the other. I downloaded it to my computer and watched the DVD version then switched over and there's a huge difference. So again if you like the film and want to see it in the highest quality currently available just buy it you will not regret the $10.00
0439023513|4.0|These books (1,2,&3) are all one big book in pieces, really. There is no standing alone for any of them. However, I don't mind that they didn't all come in one binding-- it certainly didn't ruin anything for me, especially as I didn't start the first until after the last was out. That said, this is the final chapter to the story, and it ends in a Hunter-S.-nightmare-fever-dream that left me groggy and dazed. I felt just like I did at the end of [[ASIN:0452284236 Nineteen Eighty-Four]], where I was asking myself, holy s***, did that just happen? Am I imagining that? Other endings that have ripped out a piece of soul and handed it back in a deformed way also come to mind--the movie [[ASIN:0783225903 Brazil]], for example. This story made an impact.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A classic game I have played for heard now conveniently loaded in to my Kindle!  It is free! Get it!
B0073XORCY|4.0|I have been a Jethro Tull fan since I was 4, I used to listen to \\"the dead duck song\\" repeatedly on my little Casio boom box. I really love Thick as a Brick, I love most songs on most albums but there was definitely a downward slide for me around the time Under Wraps came out. The Jethro Tull Christmas album was fantastic and I think it helped break the chain, Ian's solo stuff starting with Secret Language of Birds was great also.<br /> I was really worried that TAAB2 would be mediocre and be missing that exceptionalism some of the 70's Tull stuff had. But, this new concept album has been a really nice surprise, it has depth, and some great progression! I miss Martin, but the new guy holds his own and Ian's voice seems to have a new wind. I also notice a lot of old school Jethro Tull sound randomly on subtle riffs and keyboard surges. The mix of the old and the new is refreshing! My main complaint is that the album cover leaves something to desired, not the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never thought I would like a book series as much as I like Harry Potter and Twilight, but this one is amazing! I have only read the first book, but I could not put it down. I was hooked from beginning to end and truly would suggest this book to anyone. It is written in first person, which is odd at first, but you will quickly adjust. I will say the political implications are amazing! I was left with the feeling of disbelief and shock.
1439181780|1.0|Definitely not a must read. It's basically the same idea reworded for 200 pages. Save yourself the frustration and read something else!

B0006OBPTA|5.0|Growing up I wasn't into the Karate Kid. But my husband was. That is why we have this great four movie case. I finally get to watch each movie from the beginning till the end. And they are not bad. I think I like the fourth movie more though. The only problem is whenever hubby and I watch these movie's and I try to give my hubby some love by hugging him he try's the karate movies on me. Like wax on.... wax off.... LOL. He needs to start copping other movies lol.

B00006FDCD|3.0|The book written by Stephen King was absolutely fenominal, but the movie  can't compare. Not that \\"It\\" is a bad movie, but there were a few too many important details and a few new things that were added in.<br />Now, about the disk itself, everything was okay untill I had to read other review to find out that the 2nd part of the movie is on the other side of the disk.<br />But, all in all, it was worth the price.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I liked how it is easy to move the cards. Worth the download. Gave it four stars because I use a kindle and it is kind of small. Fun to play though.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|\\"Inglorious Basterds\\" was director Tarantino's biggest hit since \\"Pulp Fiction\\" yet, judging from the reviews here, many weren't happy with what they saw. Blame it partly on the marketing, which presented this as a Brad Pitt movie (he's only in it about 25 minutes) and a dark comedy, a la M*A*S*H, which it wasn't (though it does have some humorous bits). I'm sure a lot of American moviegoers aren't used to subtitles, either. Still, for fans of the director - myself included - this was a remarkable, if flawed film. The three extended scenes are film-making of a very high order, and the remainder is never less than fascinating in that offbeat Tarantino way. I enjoyed the history rewrite, with Jews taking revenge on the Nazis in gory but deliciously vivid ways. But I also felt the director was pulling some punches, going for instant gratification instead of really probing the nature of good and evil that might have raised this to the level of a true classic. Still, watching Tarantino move with such ease into such a different genre is exciting. I think his best movies are to come, if he can restrain his impulse to always place style slightly ahead of substance.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I actually prefer viewing my Google Reader feeds through my Kindle Fire more so than on a computer.  I like browsing through the thumbnail photos to decide which feeds I want to read.
0345803485|1.0|I think I am like a lot of other people here when I say that I became interested in this series when I heard about it on TV.  It sounded sexy and exciting and since I already read a bunch of romantica I thought I would love this series...well, I was wrong.  Within the first two chapters I actually found myself getting lost, it seemed like the author would just switch gears without finishing an idea or scene first.  The characters seemed to be flat, the sentences and descriptions were almost stilted in a way.  I'm not sure how to explain it really. When I read a good book it's almost like the pages disappear and I'm seeing a movie in my head, I could not do it with this book or any other in the series.  I think the author was maybe forcing an idea, trying to be edgy and cool but wasn't completely comfortable with everything.  I'm not sure.  I know that I really do not understand the hype behind this as it isn't the first or even thousandth of it's kind. There are so many more better written BDSM books out there.  Lora Leigh and her Bound Hearts series is great, just to name one author.<br /><br />So, bottom line (in my opinion anyway)the story is badly written and repetitive, characters are flat and I would not recommend this book to anyone.

B0058RCVYS|5.0|Great story line. The pacing of the plot was well thought out (sometimes rather predictable) but the actors really brought a sense of honesty.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|the game is annoying. i have all the other angry bird games and this is not worth the money.  it does not compare to the others.
0345803485|3.0|As others have pointed out, this book has many similarities to the characters in Twilight.  Ana, like Bella, is shy, awkward, bookish (she likes British classics), insecure, and naïve to the point of annoyance.  Christian, like Edward, is rich, good-looking, controlling, and a bit lecherous.  Christian and Edward both play the piano.  They were both adopted into close-nit families, while Ana has a wayward mother who collects husbands.  Both books are set in the Pacific Northwest.  At one point, I thought, \\"If Christian plays DeBussy, I'm throwing this *%$@ book in the trash!\\" I could go on and on, but character development isn't really the point of either book.<br /><br />The writing is exceptionally bad. There are numerous typos in the book, and James uses the same words and phrases ad nauseam.  Her editor (assuming one existed) must've been too hot and bothered to notice how many times she writes that Ana \\"explodes all around him,\\" or Christian \\"finds his release.\\"  Oh my! These people have sex relentlessly...I mean, 3-4 times a day?  Every day?  Really???  Physical limitations notwithstanding, I don't know anyone who has that kind of free time.  (Perhaps Christian owns a condom company among his many business holdings? Either that, or he buys condoms by the trainload. But, yay for safe sex!)  Honestly, I just skimmed the paragraphs about their sexual encounters because they all sounded the same.  I don't normally read \\"bodice busters,\\" so I have no idea how this book compares to others in the genre.<br /><br />The plot itself is the book's only saving grace.  The dialog is crisp and fast-paced, and there is plenty of amusing email banter between Ana and Christian.  I am not sure why, but I went ahead and read all three books in the series (my inner goddess is kicking me!).  Books two and three develop the story more fully (i.e., more plot, less sex).  Despite the numerous issues with this series, E. L. James is laughing all the way to the bank.
B007DIQB50|4.0|Nicki Minaj has gone the way many other artists do in order to avoid the sophomore slump, in which this case, go bubblegum pop. With that said, some of those songs are very high energy and in some cases \\"addictive\\" (I hate that word which is why I used quotations). The first 9 songs of the 22 song album (you get your moneys worth thats for sure) are like the old Nicki Minaj mixtape type music such as Roman Reloaded and my favorite HOV Lane. Heavy beats and Nicki's skilled rapping style dominate this section and reminds you why you like her.<br /><br />Song #10 (Starships) and beyond makes us ask the same question the first time that we heard \\"Turn Me On,\\" is that really Nicki? Autotuned as it may (beyond Britney Spears level), the sounds are good to dance to and there are some chants that people will be singing aloud. Each song has it's own individuality and popular producers such as RedOne and Dr. Luke. While these songs are catchy, I would probably never go see her on tour now because as you can see in her performances of Starships that she can not reach those notes that she can apparently reach on the album. At times you even question whether or not Rihanna is featured in the song because of how much it doesn't sound like her and more like the voice of autotuned Rihanna (even in some cases Lady Gaga when she talk sings, take \\"Automatic\\" for example). However, just like many of us like Rihanna, there's no reason to not like Nicki Minaj. These songs are great to listen to, but seem to become forgetful in a short amount of time. I have to admit that my favorite song is in fact Va Va Voom (at this time) but as fast as I liked it, I may start to like something else.<br /><br />This album may be different from Pink Friday and her original mixtapes, but Nicki is heading in the smart direction to keep her original fans and then get new ones who thought that she was only a rapper that with some production she can be something to start listening to. While I recommend to buy this album for the enjoyment, I highly advise for you not to go see her while shes on tour. Also, if you think about, 9 songs of the original Nicki is still alot of songs, it just seems small because there are 22 songs on the album. If it was a 13 song album, she wouldn't seem to be as much of a pop artist. Like I have said in other reviews, autotune does not always break an album. In this case, autotune definitely helps give Nicki that pop sound that she needs to gain that audience.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is great! It makes you think and strategize. I've played the first Quell and loved it and Quell Reflect continues. Its really fun!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|The Fifty books are being devoured by women because of the hot sex. While I agree the sex is hot (and there is a lot of it), I believe the books are really a story about unconditional love. Christian and Ana are very different people. Their relationships grows as both learn about themselves and the value of respect and compromise.
0439023521|1.0|The author would struggle to pass a high school creative writing class.  In fact, the books read as if the books were written by a \\"tween\\" girl.  They're full of run-on sentences and sentence fragments. The character development is poor, and the storyline is cliche. And there's no sense of plot structure, no suspense, no climax.  The story just drifts along from point to point.  I suspect she wrote the books in a spiral notebook and dotted her i's with little hearts. In addition to the bad writing, the heroine of the books, Katniss Everdeen, is entirely unlikeable.  She's a sullen, sulky, unpleasant, narcissistic teenage girl.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't know how this ever got made into a movie. Maybe someone owed someone a favor.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it's not perfect, but it was entertaining to read. I keep going through it again to re-read my favorite parts.

0765350386|3.0|Mistborn is a decent story, though definitely not the best that I have read.<br /><br />One of the big selling points for this novel is its magic system.  To summarize, there are two primary \\"forms of magic\\":  Allomancy and Feruchemy.  Allomancy allows a person to consume metallic alloys that grant abilities.  Steel, for example, allows a person to \\"push\\" other metals away.  Zinc, on the other hand, allows its consumer to enhance certain emotions in another person.  Overall, there are 8 basic metals, each with its own function.  Most individuals can only 'burn' one type of metal, but there are occasionally those who can burn all of the metals (these people are called Mistborn).  Feruchemy, is a bit different.  Instead of drawing energy from metals as an Allomancer does, a Feruchemist can store certain attributes (such as sight, strength, knowledge, etc.) into a metal and draw upon them later.  I was thoroughly impressed with how well Sanderson explores each of these forms of magic.  I also appreciated how original they were.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to say that setting isn't all that interesting.  Maybe I am the only one who feels this way, but I can't help but to feel an overwhelming sense of..smallness to the world.  I know that this was probably intentional on Sanderson's part as he was trying to create a world that barely escaped an all out apocalypse, but even still, I personally prefer stories with larger scale worlds.  This particular point may not be an issue with some readers, but it made me a little claustrophobic.<br /><br />The character development wasn't the greatest either.  The main character, Vin, is pretty well done.  But other than that, most of the characters are fairly..boring and predictable.  Anytime something reckless happens, you immediately know that it was Kelsier.  Anytime someone comes up with a plan, you can expect a generic, sarcastic comment from Breeze.  I dunno..I was just a bit bored with all of the characters because whatyou see is what you get.  This may also contribute to the sense of smallness that I described earlier.  I'm currently on book 3, and so far, Sanderson hasn't done much to change this..<br /><br />I also hate that there aren't any unexpected twists and turns.  I understand that many authors like to direct their stories so that the intended outcome inevitably happens..but that is so boring!  Before reading any of Sanderson's work, I read the first two novels in A Song of Ice and Fire.  Talk about a series with a bunch of twists and turns!  You never know what to expect in those and you never feel 'safe'.  Sanderson, however, doesn't add very many..unexpected twists.  He basically spells out everything that is going to happen in the next few chapters through dialogue...and if there is the possibility of something unexpected happening, he uses his lovely little characters to explain why everything will go as planned (and, in the end, it always does).  And if there are complications, they are usually fairly easy to predict.<br /><br />It has taken me a very long time to get through this series (I started it in January D: ).  I really enjoy books that require a lot of thinking, and unfortunately, I don't feel like Sanderson delivers much in this area.  While his magic system is unique, his world building could use some work, his characters are a tad cliche, and the storyline is predictable.<br /><br />Sorry to offend any fans :P
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Unbelievable that this game is not free on the Kindle Fire. My son was so excited to get this game only to have his feelings crushed that its not free! Unfair for it to be free on some products but not all. Very Disappointed!!!!

B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the best fantasy books I've read. Disappointing to have to wait years upon years for the series to finish, but it seems like it will be worth it.<br /><br />To all the people who picked one star for this... how? Do you dislike Brandon Sanderson that much? I simply can't see how this book justifies a one star review unless the guy at the book store ripped out half the pages in the book.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|It was a good book. it was cool it was awesome it was sad.. you should buy this book. i really reomend it. this book is better than all the other alex rider books. i am writing this with my kindle so dont mind the punctuation. also i am in new zealand right know in my hotel :)  :D
B004QIUH1Y|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan since 1994. It's been amazing following them for almost 18 years. This vinyl is AMAZING. The records are a pretty bright pink color with a slight marble design in them. The audio is top notch, and a decent song selection of older material with the new stuff. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. If your a Green Day fan you owe it to yourself to get this beautiful set.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|I'm a huge JA fan from way back. AND I love this album. Lots have pointed to it having missed their mark in delivering different vibes each tune, or comparing it to older stuff, bla bla bla. Yes, opinions are subjective, but it's hard to not call some of these reviews BS. This isn't some P4P or JA grab for cash. This is as lush, vibrant and artistic as anything they've done, bringing great edgy tunes together with great lyrics, great arrangements, and killer, raging drive - when it's called for. Yes it's a bit more balanced and yes it shows the maturity of knowing what works for hooks and tempo. You get the sense from some of these reviews if anger and aggression are punching you in the face every measure of every tune, the band sold out. I think that is unfair and leaves a lot of cool music off the table. I hope they produce 10 more of these freak albums. Go Jane. Fn rock on.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing tour I might add. No old guys on stage at all you punk wanna-be kids. ;)
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love the throat ripping during one of the fight seance it was amazing and how we see backensail is back and better
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Blown away. Didn't know what to expect with this one. Old fan of the good Dr., and a big fan of The Black Key's cool, jacked, raw, stripped down, and groovy fuzz. A friend said I had to listen, and that it \\"would shock me, and not disappoint\\". We've all heard that one before, but wow, if they weren't spot on. Vocals, key's, and a killer guitar, not to mention terrific production. This freakin' rocks. I could not have imagined a comeback like this sounding as fresh and hot. From the first song, Dr. John delivers his best in many years, and for those wondering if it will sound dated, not a chance. Wait 'til the radio starts riding it. In some ways, I ALMOST wish this was his first album, just to see what a response he'd get unaffected by preconceived notions of genre or style.<br /><br />This one will put him back on the map. Watch for Grammy's, big reviews and a healthy dose of new fans finding out who the good Dr. is.<br /><br />Amazing. What a surprise. What an album.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|There are simply too many wretched performances on this album.  Especially that Ke$ha version of Don't Think Twice.  Good gawd...  How did anybody think that was worthy of release?<br /><br />If you want to listen to Dylan songs, listen to Dylan singing them.  Nobody does them better.
0812550706|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down when I started reading it.  I can hardly wait to start reading more in the series.
B005F9CP7M|5.0|That just goes to show you what our culture values. Though the Spice Girls were about their image and fame (and boy did we eat that up) Melanie has been about the music. Pop music is still all about image nowadays and since she wasn't the Spice to primp herself up to the extreme and marry a celebrity, she has fallen to the wayside. Or maybe if she got involved in a huge scandal or shaved her head or did lots of drugs with public displays of trashyness we would be all over her. Instead she battled depression secretly, and fought off an eating disorder in private. Oh, that must be boring huh? Venting aside...<br /><br />I did hold out hope that the greatness that is this album would bring her back. Every track, from \\"Think About It\\" to \\"Stupid Game\\" to \\"Enemy\\" is perfection. There is so much variety, and she nails each song. I remember listening to this album, loudly, in pitch black from start to finish the night after I finally got this album (I read a review/tip somewhere to do this). I felt so many emotions. This is definitely one of my favorite albums, alongside Beautiful Intentions.<br /><br />People complained that there was a lack of dance songs, but even her biggest hit \\"I Turn to You\\" was a regular album track before it was remixed INTO a dance track. If this album took off I could have seen \\"Drown\\" or \\"Burn\\" remixed as such, but it looks like that will never be. Though it did not get the attention or acclaim it deserves, it holds a place in my heart and I hope that the commercial failure does not stop Melanie from creating another album.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its pretty awesome and addictive I love this game kind of similar to simtown an old game I used to play
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All of these books were terrible.  I can't cant't believe this writer has the balls to sell these stupid books.  She needs to think about her life and do something different.

B0060MYNHI|5.0|I love the Merlin series and am looking forward to adding it to my collection.  I thought season 4 may be a little weaker at the end of the season than the first 3, I still loved it. I can see the characters maturing. I hope in time to come that the writer's show Arthur learning of Merlin's magic in a way that doesn't make him feel like all he's accomplished is a lie.  They will have to tread very carefully.
B0041KKYH4|5.0|Funny movie if you don't take it seriously!!! When I first saw the movie, i didn't care for it at all... Sometimes it takes more then once until you like something! The movie has officially grown on me the more Ive watched it.... Not to mention I work for a school so that makes it even better =) 5 *stars*
B000FC1HBY|4.0|The book itself is very interesting, although it was a little distracting to have to keep checking my \\"cheat sheets\\" to see who a character was or how he or she fit into the story.  With that being said, keeping track of the characters just added a little challenge to the reading of the book.  All in all it was well worth the time and effort spent on it.  I enjoyed the story immensely and am glad I read it.  I am going to buy the next installment in the series (a storm of swords) but have almost decided to wait until after I've seen the second season on HBO.  It might be more interesting that way.
B004SC8XHI|5.0|There are three things that must be said about this recording:<br /><br />First, this is not a gimmick!  This is not \\"Living Strings Play Beatles.\\"  It's more akin to hearing \\"Round Midnight\\" by Miles Davis, rather than Thelonious Monk, or perhaps hearing \\"Appalachian Spring\\" conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, rather than Aaron Copland.  It's just as valid as the original, paying the original due respect but with a slightly different artistic twist.<br /><br />Second, this recording shows the true virtuosity of the four guys who made up the group.  The musical vision is that of Booker T. Jones; in the liner notes he states how he was knocked out by the musicality of Abbey Road, and wanted to record the music with the group.  His keyboards are creative and concise, bringing out a visceral response to this music.  But the other three players are allowed the space to do their thing, too, and they are incredible.  This recording shows why all four of them, Booker T., Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and certainly not least Al Jackson, Jr., are now considered icons of soul music.  The funny thing is, this music is closer to jazz than soul/funk; call it jazz with a soul heart.<br /><br />Third, the 24-bit remastering by Joe Tarantino is amazing.  This is the best I have ever heard BTMG sound.  Although the recording was made in 1970, the sound is up to more modern standards (although the bonus tracks, covers of Beatles songs issued on earlier BTMG albums, are a noticeably \\"older\\" sound).  I hope Concord and Tarantino remaster more of the old Stax output.<br /><br />This album has immediately jumped up onto my top-10 albums to take to a desert island.  It's that good.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the blueray set of the first book of the ice and fire series.  I think the HBO series would have been interesting anyway, but I'm glad I read the book before watching it.  I think if I hadn't had the background of the book I wouldn't have gotten nearly as much out of the story.  The extras that come in the set (production, Dothraki language, etc) are very interesting also.  I used this as a \\"catch-up\\" to get me ready for the second season on HBO.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Is this finally what the map of Vietnam looks like? Three old men play a song I heard before I went to Vietnam. What a question?<br /><br />You can't watch your wife<br />and your outside woman too<br />because when you're out with your woman<br />your wife is being at home<br />cooking your food<br />doing your dirt<br />Buddy, what are you trying to do?<br /><br />As an intellectual exercise, it was like basic training in Fort Knox, Kentucky, when the truck from the butcher shop pulled up behind the mess hall and the trainees on KP were told:<br /><br />Grab your meat and beat it.<br /><br />I was not married when I was introduced to the idea of an outside woman, but a wife seemed to be the hole in the middle of the donut that people who are concerned about morality dunk like Hosea talking about his wife in the Bible when somebody thinks they are going to have some fun tonight. Sometimes Vietnam was my excuse for liking music that seemed harsh to the church people who think the ten commandments are supposed to protect them from loud noises like Cream. This DVD is like a graven image capturing the rock and roll of some interesting times.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Took me about four hours to read the whole book and it changed the way I work out, eat and look at gains. The best part of the book is the first few chapters when he defines all the terms of bodybuilding. You would be surprised how little you actually know.<br /><br />I am in week two now of his program and it is brutal but fun. Everyone I talk to thinks I am insane (ONLY three exercises most days?! Only four sets of six reps?) but the science of overloading is proven and it has definitely helped me mentally and physically with soreness/gain ratio. Also, are you keeping a good log of what you are doing and eating? I thought I was eating a lot of calories and protein but after logging for two weeks, I found that I was coming up short in both areas. Only 3200 calories on average and just barely at my protein intake. Low GI carbs had to be increased and a lot of foods I thought were Low GI carbs were actually high GI carbs. This might sound like a lot but I have a high metabolic rate and was burning through the calories and had to add another 500 to keep fatigue away.<br /><br />Make sure you stick to your log and log everything you eat. Use calorieking.com to figure out the values of all your foods. Do not forget to include dressings/cheese/bread when computing. I think you will be amazed at how different the actual amounts are than what you thought!
B005K15SPG|5.0|Loved these guys for a while and thought I'd review them...the sound is very folk based, very Irish, but also has some pop or commercial elements.  They are excellent musicians as well.  I love the lead singers voice....and that's my very rudimentary review!  I am not good at intellectualizing, especially something like music...
0385344228|5.0|I just put this book down. What a page turner! I disagree with many of the three star or less reviews. I thought this was a very powerful book. And yes, at times you do get insight as to how things will turn out. But you are powerless to stop them...that's where this book hits. And it hits hard! It reads like a true crime novel. And you start to think about your own family and how you would react if this was happening to you. Would highly recommend this book!
B0073XORCY|4.0|Thick As A Brick 2 is neither an album by Jethro Tull or a solo album by Ian Anderson ,it's attributed to Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson - whatever that means .<br />As far as the music goes it bears little resemblance to the original Thick . You'll notice a few clusters of musical passages spread throughout the album taken from Thick , but it amounts to nothing .<br />As far as the band goes , there's no one you will recognize .Florian Opahle a German guitarist, takes over for Martin Barre and does a really nice job .He's on the Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull cd , He's a very good guitar player , there's just not enough of him on this album imo .Scott Hammond is on drums , whether he's any relation to Jeffrey Hammond Hammond - I'm not sure .<br /><br />Back to the music .The resemblance it does bear to Thick is that it is a continual ebb and flow from quiet passages to rock ( with some spoken word thrown in ).Musically it has the feel of  Dot Com . The songs Hot Mango Flush and the title track kept coming to mind while I listened to this . Yea , it does rock harder at points , but it has that Dot Com feel .<br />If you're a Tull fan buy this . You won't be disappointed .It's not in the same league as the original but it's good - and interesting  in it's own right .<br />..oh , did I mention Ian Anderson's lyrics are as good as ever .
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I had Eric Church's newer two CDs, but not this one - his first. It's great to have all three now and to listen to the progress he's made from the first to last one. Sinners Like Me has some great story telling songs. One that never made it to radio was Lightening, which is about a man waiting to die in the electric chair. It is particularly powerful, though I enjoyed all of the songs.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Bilal, Lupe, Erykha' Lalah,Neschell, Music Soulchild.....the list goes on a great collaboration from beginning to the end a great listen everytime!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|gotta get it its very fun entertaining and its also a learning experience for me my wife and my kids.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Yes, I was deeply concerned when this came out.NO MARTIN! Let's face it, Martin Barre is a beloved part of the Jethro Tull story. One listen, I liked it. Weeks later, this is a masterpiece. We simply need to accept this as an Ian solo, hope Martin  is back soon. Meanwhile, the musicians are superb, the writing magnificent. It is a crime if this music is not heard. Anyone who has loved JT must hear this.THIS IS THE FINEST MUSIC FROM IAN ANDERSON/JETHRO TULL IN 25 YEARS,NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was completely absorbed into the story of Downton Abbey from the first season 1 episode through the last season 2 episode. The acting was so incredibly smooth and the storyline so seamlessly knit together, I  was transported back to the period and felt connected to the English aristocracy and society of those days. This program was a welcome break from long work days and extensive travel exertions. Thank you so much Masterpiece for producing such impeccable performing art for television and now streaming. I do look forward to season 3. I hope other similar classic multi-episode stories become available. I am your loyal fan.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Like so many others in posts about this movie, I was astonished at how good it was.  It's clear that the trailer and marketting of this movie did it a great disservice.  If--and this is a big IF--you can accept the fantasy genre rules for what they are, you'll love it.  Accept that the environment on Mars was at one time wet.  Accept that an earthman can be mystically transported to Mars.  Accept that inhabitants include four-armed humanoids.  Accept that warriors prefer swords even though the technology exists to creat guns. Accept that an earth man can jump and practicaly fly through the air, which is of course breathable, because of Mars lower gravity!  In other words, accept the vision of Edgar Rice Buroughs, the writer of the book created for Mars.  If you can, you will have a rip-roaring time.  The CGI is perfect.  Nothing on the screen looks phony. You'll love the wonderful tribal culture of the Tharks.  You'll love the male and female leads, who take their roles seriously, with no chesiness or tounge-in-cheek attitude.  The producers, director and actors all took the story seriously.  And given the nature of this sort of fantasy, doing it straight and doing it well require amazing talent. They succeed in maintaining the perfect adventure tone throughout, with no \\"modernizing\\" of the concept. There's not a doubt in my mind that Mr. Buroughts, if he could have seen it, would say, \\"Yes, that's precisely how I imangined it when I wrote the book.\\"  You'll love the sheer adventure of it all.  Everyone in the theater--all five of us--were laughing, applauding, crying in a scene or two, and left the theater pleasantly astonished at how good this film was.  What a shame, since the poor financial performance of JOHN CARTER practicly assures that none of the planned sequels will ever be produced.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I started having misgivings about the Fifty Shades series when I was nearly finished with book two...the storyline became rather predictable.<br />I waffled about buying the third book. In a moment of weakness, I decided to purchase Fifty Shades Freed. And my instincts were confirmed...author James took a page from the Twilight series and brought her previous \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction lines into the story and melded those lines into the last book.<br /><br />Ana tells her ongoing struggle for independence, her unplanned pregnancy, her desperate risk to save a family member, and her harrowing brush with death, all for the love of control-freak and billionaire Christian Grey.<br /><br />In this third volume, James propagates the fallacy that if a woman really loves her man, she can make a fundamental change in his persona in her role of lover or wife. The whole \\"Wife/Husband\\" dialogue (\\"oh yes, Husband!) seems rather dated and quickly becomes tiresome.<br />At the end of the third book, James writes about the first meetings from Christian's view...again it goes back to the Twilight series and Meyer's proposed writings beyond the Twilight series....and it's about Edward's viewpoint.
034552554X|5.0|There are so many things I loved about this book. The language, the characters, the language of flowers, the plot - I never wanted it to end. If you read and enjoyed \\"White Oleander\\" then you will love this....
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is the best Seal action movie I have ever seen. You know why?  Because the action scenes were not 'performed' by phony Hollywood actors but REAL Seals and that makes all the difference in the world when you're watching it.  Just so well done!

014312093X|5.0|The problem with Le Carre for some readers is two-fold; for one thing, he is quintessentially British, and his writing uses many British idioms and words that are nearly meaningless to mnay American readers, unfamiliar with the intimate details of UK society and social history. For example, if you don't know what the New Year's Lists (aka Honours Lists) are, you won't follow why that list resulted in some of the people working for the Circus (nickname for the intelligence agency) being awarded medals. Likewise, if you don't know about the British system of public schools and how the social classes traverse the educational system, you will not realize why that has a bearing on who runs the intelligence department.<br /><br />And the second issue is that Le Carre's style is more literary--the action is often portrayed by a character relating a story to others, not actually happening in real time. You really have to immerse yourself as if you were sitting next to the characters, listening to them talk and trying not only to follow the conversation, but to get inside their heads, their attitudes, pain, conflict, and their forming suspicions. He stops to give us a glimpse of the weather (which always has an emotional meaning) and also takes us into the internal dialog going on in the head of one or two of the protagonists.<br /><br />This is what makes John Le Carre's writing so rewarding for me--I get sucked into the very mind of George Smiley. And this novel, the first in the Smiley series, is a terrific tale of betrayal and double-crossing that hits in the worst possible place; a traitor at the very highest levels of a nation's intelligence agency. Smiley, who has been sacked in a reorganization of the agency, tries to become a retired \\"has been\\" but is drafted by colleagues who suspect the \\"Circus\\" has been co-opted by a Soviet mole and need his vast memory, his logic and his knowledge of agency activities at the end of WWII and the Cold War to flush out the traitor. And it's a dangerous game; people have already been killed, and not \\"cleanly\\" nor quickly, either.<br /><br />The story eases you in by introducing Jim through the eyes of a \\"new boy\\", a hapless young kid with few skills who has been deemed possibly deficient in intellect, but who has a tremendous ability to observe tiny details (is this a mirror of a young George Smiley?) We watch Jim through Bill's eyes and simply get a description of someone who has a mysterious past, a bad back injury and who has some unique skills despite his downtrodden air. From this idyllic beginning, we then move on to Smiley's world and are taken down into the labyrinth of the Cold War trenches.  As the story unfolds, we follow Smiley as he is able to finally investigate his earlier suspicions about traitors at highest levels, the very suspicions that probably got him sacked in the first place.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down. If you read it, just don't expect fast moving action or punchy writing. This is slow, deliberate, sometimes elliptical and vague, but always fascinating. For me, Le Carre remains the master of this genre and perhaps, one who is unique in his style.And it's a dangerous game; people have already been killed, and not \\"cleanly\\" nor quickly, either.<br /><br />The story eases you in by introducing Jim through the eyes of a \\"new boy\\", a hapless young kid with few skills who has been deemed possibly deficient in intellect, but who has a tremendous ability to observe tiny details (is this a mirror of a young George Smiley?)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought it was to big because there are so many games! I thought they should lower the point price levels to make it easier to unlock everything.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The robustness of this app is just phenomenal.  And the pseudo-shakespearean sounding reader is a pleasure to listen to after a long and tiring day.  Use this daily for five years and you will only scratch the surface of what this powerful app has to offer!

B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app is awesome I love it. it keeps my downloads and lets me play them without wifi.  the app has no problems what so ever
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1 Games is very entertaining. It is good family fun<br /> You and you family can try to beat individual games or each others score. A good way to pass the time during commercials. Games are short and fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that 101games is super worth it and its free for that many games I think it is way fun
B00009L1UP|5.0|Empire is their last truly amazing album. Promised Land and Hear in the Now Frontier are decent albums but from Warning-Empire were their best days by far. Empire is a close follow-up to Mindcrime, not quite as good but almost equal. It's a bit more commercial and less heavy. It's not really a metal album, it's more hard rock. The songs are slower and more melodic, lyrics are great too. It includes their ballad Silent Lucidity which you're probably familiar with. Some of my personal favorites include The Thin Line, Della Brown and Empire.
B0073XORCY|4.0|I'm enjoying the hell out of TAAB2. It's definitely not the original, but in an odd way, it's on par with some of Tull's 60's and early 70's work. That's not to say TAAB2 is the return of Tull's glory days (it's no Aqualung or Minstrel in the Gallery), but it beats the hell out of Rock Island, Catfish Rising, and such.<br /><br />TAAB2 sounds far more like Jethro Tull than an Ian Anderson solo work. I love his mellow, friendly albums like Rupi's Dance, but TAAB2 is far closer to, say, Warchild and/or Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll than it is Rupi or Secret Language of Birds.<br /><br />Diehard Tull fans might miss the contribution of Martin Barre on TAAB2, but it works without him. The album, while not quite as flowing as the original TAAB (that is to say, it feels more like a concept album of separate songs woven together, rather than one huge, long track), contains plenty of callbacks to its forerunner coupled with music that sounds inspired by the original.<br /><br />Reeking of effort, which the later Jethro Tull albums lacked (at least, from the end of the 1970's until J-Tull Dot Com), TAAB2 isn't a must-have, but it's enjoyable and well worth the cost.<br /><br />Final note: If you're unsure whether you'll like it, or lack a good Dolby Digital 5.1 system, just download it or get the single CD. The special edition's 5.1 mix doesn't add a whole lot to the experience; I've heard better 5.1 mixes.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Interesting premise.  Seemed pretty believable up until the part where the \\"thing\\" jumps out of the block of ice.  That seemed pretty unrealistic for something that has been frozen solid for 100,000 years.  But then again its a sci-fi horror movie!  Overall, nicely done.
B007NCSJYW|1.0|I think this should have been two discs. The first 9 songs are rap and the rest is bubblegum pop.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am sure you've probably heard Little Talks...but this whole album is really well written.  I think that one of it's strengths is in the lyrics.  I'd have to say that I am liking this cd more and more with every listen.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this is so awesome. I love this game. its challenging and keeps u on ur toes. watch out for bombs!!!! :)
B0073XORLU|3.0|It was about what I expected.  Some really good material and some boring late-period style fluff.  Good news is its really strong consistantly about halfway into it.  Last half kind of loses me. It ends with the same orgininal TAAB ending when I feel there could have been a reprise of the \\"Thick, as a brick\\" lyrical part from earlier or something to make it stand on it's own as a similar but totally separate piece.  The best news is that we get to hear the entire TAAB1 in concert for the first time in almost 40 years. I wasn't even alive when the original TAAB was made, but now I get to hear it live with Ian and some crack studio musicians.  I'm not hardcore Tull so I don't mind that it's not officially JT.  This album's not perfect, but definitely worth a listen.  Fans should be getting excited for the tour! TAAB is legendary and I can't wait to hear it live! This will be a nice afterthought, if nothing more. Kind of bummed other Tull material won't be featured.
0439023491|5.0|Despite the fact that both Katniss and Peeta have survived the Hunger Games and returned home, the feel of the book is similar to how it felt when they were still entrenched in the drama of the Hunger Games, like they still have to be aware that everything they do and say is being watched and judged by the Capital. There is no feeling of gratitude or relief, only a pervading sense of waiting for the other shoe to drop. The suspense alone kept me from putting the book down much at all until I had finished it.<br />I really feel for Gale in this book, more so than the first book, both because he has made his feelings known and because \\"the odds\\" are never in his favor. He has absolutely no control in his relationship with Katniss simply because the Capitol keeps taking her away from him.<br />Before I read this book, I was careful not to read too many spoilers, and I wondered if there would be another Hunger Games event in the second book. With the 75th anniversary, this is taken to a whole new level, and of course abused by the Capitol for its own nefarious means. Still, I was curious as to how Suzanne Collins would make it more macabre than the previous one, and she did not disappoint.<br />I do have to wonder how Katniss completely missed so many clues about the organization of the rebellion against the Capitol. Even though she had moments of suspicion, she was so focused on the survival of Peeta and herself, she could not take the time to ask a few questions, which was frustrating.<br />There were also a few moments of humor interspersed throughout the book, which helped to give me a bit of relief from the suspense and tragedy. Many of the new characters introduced in this book were quite interesting in their own way, and I especially liked the oldest ones because of their surprising ability to survive in ways other than brute strength.<br />Overall, this book is as engrossing as the first, and I look forward to completing the series with Mockingjay.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great on my iPad. I just downloaded the Kindle app and went with it. Great book, great format.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a very useful app. I appreciate that it's always updating and showing a non-intrusive notice at the top of my kindle.
1609611543|4.0|The main problem with this book is that there's not enough clinical evidence to support his claims. Obviously, most doctors aren't interested in helping find the root problem in their patients, so do your own diet research on your own body. There's no incentive from corporations or pharmaceutical companies to sponsor clinical trials of a lifestyle change that will render their drugs useless.  I've been gluten free for a week and feel amazingly better than I ever have in my adult life. That nagging \\"eat, eat, EAT\\" thought that kills every diet is gone.  I used to HAVE to eat at least every 4 hours or I felt shaky, weak and cranky.  I was a smoker through my twenties and I swear that nicotine nagging is the exact same feeling as what I now know is wheat nagging on your mind. Yes, there are some claims in this book you can take or leave and this book is fleshed out with filler like so many self-help. Do not try a gluten free diet as a magical weight-loss solution, but DO try it for several months to see if you can feel better all around. The criticism of his diet suggestions at the end of the book is misguided as well. If you do an internet search for \\"gluten free food\\" you'll find a million recipes and products that replicate a gluten diet. The author of this book is simply advocating a shift in what you consider food or a meal and not simply searching for the perfect replacement of your favorite bakery item.
B007R12LNO|5.0|I just finished this episode, and I am loving season 7 so far.  The season started out kinda stale, but I believe that was because of the hormones.  The chemistry in this episode is outstanding!  I never guessed the killer, and the crime it self was unique.  Also, I love how Brennan makes fun of Seely's belief, then she has the baby in that manner.  LOVE IT!  Best episode of Season 7 so far!
B004UC4HCG|3.0|Bang for the buck with limitations.<br />This little PC has some surprising features that you wouldn't expect.<br /><br />PLUS +<br />It will hold two (2) hard drives!<br />It has an on-board socket for a laptop type Bluetooth/WiFi card which works very well.<br />It supports a wide range of socket 1155 processors, Pentium, i3, i5, and i7.<br />It supports up to 32 gigabytes of DDR3 ram.<br />It has a 300 watt power supply which is upgradeable to a 500 watt version available from Shuttle.<br /><br />MINUS -<br />The Intel video through the CPU and on-board is not great and does not do well when playing back DVDs and BDs as it does not give good color rendering.<br />It has a limited list of video cards it will support most of which are either under powered or cost as much or more then the PC itself! You need to take this list seriously when thinking about buying a video card for this PC. I have purchased and tried to used 4 different video cards all of which cause the system to freeze and crash then I discovered the list of approved cards when I went to Shuttles website.<br />The USB 3 ports look like USB 2 ports but don't respond the same in the boot stage so if you us a wireless keyboard and mouse you will have to plug the doggle in a USB 2 port in the back for best result on booting.<br />The user guide is incomplete and does not cover on-board WiFi socket or video card limitations.<br />Support response from Shuttle is not quick so be prepared to wait up to several days for a response.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I don't play many games on my tablet but this one get to you after a while and is fun to play. Good for the whole family and the ads aren't really in the way. As with the other 1000 reviews well worth the try.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Just needed it to work on my 2.3 android tablet. It does just that. As expected and a worthwile download.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game except I don't like to post everything to facebook and you have to in order to get investment points. If not then you have to spend your own money for investment points to expand or upgrade your city. Other than that I love the game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|As expected they're good at what they do. A nice weather app for the tablet and has all the featured you'd expect from the weather channel. Worth giving it a try.
0370332288|5.0|This book is written for the Young Adult market but is certainly highly readable for adults as well. It is a story of hardships, played out by some hugely likeable characters. Happy in places and sad in others. I laughed, I cried and didn't want the book to end.<br /><br />Auggie was born with extensive facial deformities caused by genetic aberrations. He is fortunate in being born into a loving stable family with an older sister, Via, who loves him dearly. His younger years were spent in and out of hospital with operations to make him more 'normal'. He was home schooled. When we meet him he is 10 years old, the operations are far less frequent and his parents are struggling with the idea that school would be good for him. Unfortunately his appearance is still shocking and his adjustment into school is traumatic but we are cheering him on every step of the way.<br /><br />There is a strong moral content to this book but it is not preachy. The narrative is written from several points of view, but mainly Auggie and his sister. I couldn't put it down - this is certainly an author that I hope to read again in the future.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|I wanted a different browser than what came with the tablet. I read the other reviews and tried this one out. Does everything I would expect with no hidden bugs. Worth your time to give it a try.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|It has taken me a long time to cozzen up to Speilberg. His early movies were schlock. Sound and fury signifying nothing. Close Encounters was a goofy con job with trashy leitmotives, gauze and blurry lighting. ET was more of the same with lots of cute kids. Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, in spite of theatric high marks for execution, were mindless homages to serialized kiddie junk from the 30s to the 50s.<br /><br />Schindlers List turned that all around. It had substance. It put some of that cinemagraphic education to work in a frightenly grim look into the face of real horror. There have been other acheivments ( and flops ) since then.<br /><br />I don't know the childs book basis. Usually literary transpositions wind up a drawback anyway. I do know literature, films, Ralph Vaughn-Williams and Delius. This movie pulls from period wells very effectively to create ambience.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in the structure of the movie. At the heart of all the stories there is that mystic love of the horse. Few movies have captured that as well as Black Stallion. Warhorse has done that for me. The animals in this movie are amazingly engaged in the tale.<br /><br />The pace is gentile, nostalgic and manages to try to see hope and love in tragic circumstances of a horrible war.  Perhaps that is melodramatic. Perhaps it is too optimistic to see things come out right in the end; with so many characters chosing to make honorable and loving decisions.<br /><br />The story here avoids the overwhelming brutality of Schindler's or Private Ryan. The vignettes dealt with violence in a corner of the eye manner. The cavalry charge sequence of the first battle ends in a blaze of machine guns that manages to wreck bloodless slaughter guaranteed to not upset the customers. Two German child soldiers make an impulsive attempt to desert the war on the captured stallions and are caught. Their sad execution is handled discretely. There are the French Grandfather and granddaughter struggling to survive too close to the war, who recover the stallions only to see the arrival of revenous foraging enemies taking all away from them.<br /><br />The tale comes to a climax when survivors meet in the last half hour of the film. Keep a hankie (s) at the ready as you will repeatedly need them.<br /><br />It's a beautifully crafted film. Hat's off to everyone involved in the project. As with too many Speilberg projects you wind up having to suspend some judgement. How this horse manages to survive nearly four years of war when everyting around him dies is utter nonsense. It's still Indiana Jones and Star Wars schtick.<br /><br />But there is a lifetime of craft conjoined to this formula. My skepticism has been conquered.<br /><br />Five stars from me. I loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Well don't really need a kindle as this app works nicely on my android tablet. A very much needed app on the tablet.

B004GYY714|5.0|This is the best app I've come across. If you were ever looking into the logitech internet radios that cost in the 100s this app functions and does everything that the logitech product does. A very nice app with access to any radio station I can think of in any city, state country. Was listening to music in Daka bangladesh, (I think thats the capital). The New York link has hundreds of stations and the buffering works quite fast.<br /><br />An excellent app.
B004DMIIO6|4.0|This film is like an epic dream caught on camera. I seriously recommend watching this in original japanese language with subtitles. The dub disgraces the picture. Some have called this a japanese take on the legend of robin hood, but it is in its own league i think.<br /><br />I give Goemon a 4 star rating because of the entire experience it offers. A good story. Fantastic visuals. Amazing action and pretty good acting, with interesting characters.<br /><br />If you love japanese culture, be it historic or modern, i recommend this movie. Its one of the best ninja movies ive seen, filled with humor, great battles, some romance, intrigue/ betrayal and honor.<br /><br />HOWEVER, make no mistake, this is NOT anything near the brilliance of an Akira Kurosawa film. So dont expect masterpiece. But its sheer scope and vision would of inspired Kurosawa, and if he were still on this earth today, he would probably do amazing work with all of today's cutting edge CGI and effects.<br /><br />This movie, to me though, is a classic in my favorite movie collection. Perhaps not on pair or in the same league as some of the real great pictures, but its great in its own unique way.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Been excited all day for this game, major disappoint Its been trying to download for the pass 3 hours on my kindle fire. Starting to think I got jacked on the $2.99 price already hmmm...

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found this book to be an amazing mix of mystery, romance, intrigue, magical, not particularly fantasy... but kept me wanting to read until I could no longer keep my eyes open... found myself needing to go back... chapters back, in order to bring strings together... to put pieces together and was amazed at all the different angles of a story that touched me... I don't usually read this kind of book, but the description sounded intriguing... and I am so glad I went with it.  Being a slow reader... I read this book in 2.5 days.... and that is not reading all during the day!!.  The switch-back of the overlapping time periods... just a real work of genius... to me!... Its so worth the read!...  Bravo to the author, brilliant !... (can you tell I loved it).
B007NQ06S0|1.0|\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.<br /><br />This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of 300, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.<br /><br />A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...<br /><br />... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.<br /><br />Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.<br /><br />Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (\\"It is death who should be afraid of us!\\") and dozeworthy action scenes.<br /><br />Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of \\"We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!\\"... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.<br /><br />And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" would be better titled \\"Flush of the Titans\\" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.g their own theological philosophy on us (\\"God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him\\") NON-STOP.

B007HJB6OG|3.0|Excellent acting.  Excellent plot/s also.  Why so much nudity?  The story can still be well-told without the people with their clothes off!  Surprises, always good, and great scenery.  It's a shame that Sean Bean left so quickly.  His acting was superb.  The whole seven kingdom scenario works very well and makes for lots of competition/honor upheld/intermarriage.  There could be more decent TV shows, well-written and well-acted, on regular channels, sans the nudity.  Most of regular TV is garbage.  Thanks to HBO for producing this series and doing it so beautifully.<br />Laura Watson
1451683405|5.0|A very short read, but very dense with information. Whether you agree or disagree with Dr. Harris's thesis or his arguments, this book will make you think. Dr. Harris has a very easy-to-understand writing style, and so you won't feel like you need a PhD while reading it. A good book for philosophers, theologians, scientists, politicians, jurists, or anyone at all with intellectual curiosity.  I recommend this book.

1451627289|5.0|I've lived in Maine all my life.  Many years ago I worked as an optometric assistant and fit Stephen King to contact lenses.  A very interesting and memorable event that I could write a lot about, but this is about a great book!  I haven't even finished it, but know at the mid-point how great it is.  If you are a baby-boomer you will find it even more addictive!  King, once again, shows his extensive knowledge of music and blends it into the story of a time before technology took us over. The premise of changing history engaged me from the beginning.  I love this book and am proud of our great Maine author.
B001P5M7QE|1.0|I had been told several times that this was a really good classic movie and finally found a copy of it. About midway thru I had the first urge ever during a movie to shut it off. It was literally that bad! But, I decided to push to the end. Big mistake! The movie just ends abruptly. Literally! The screen rips in the middle of a scene.<br /><br />This movie is an absolutely travesty and wholly unfunny. I have not the slightest clue what people find funny about this. Maybe its the opiate of the masses. Maybe its one of those cult movies like the Ed Wood stuff that is so bad its funny, but this doesnt really put itself out that way and its fans seem to really be deluded into thinking its funny. It just plain isnt! At all.<br /><br />I hope I can save two hours from someones life by warning them to find another movie that is actually funny or entertaining.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was in my \\"suggested\\" reads section for my Kindle. I'd just finished another murder mystery and thought why not. Christian Grey - OMG! I wish this man was real because he reads beautifully. Anastasia - a bit clueless. How has she made it 21 years with no sex and she went to WSU? Ridiculous, but still enjoyed reading it. The sex scenes I was not prepared for, but I read them and feel like I've learned about a side of the sex scene I've never known. Read it! I've read all 3 in the trilogy. LOVE THEM!
0439023521|2.0|I give this book (and the other three in the trilogy) two stars - I wanted to give it three, one for each of them, but that didn't seem quite right.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" was entertaining enough that I read it and got swept up in the hype surrounding it enough to finish the other two as well.  I'm glad it only took a week to read all three so a large chunk of my life wasn't wasted.<br /><br />These are the first books that I've read about this premise, so I gave it two stars for the storyline.  However, after reading quite a few reviews, I see that maybe it wasn't so novel afterall.  Either way, it was entertaining.  And that's about all I can say that's good about this trilogy.<br /><br />It was predictable.  (So very predictable.)  It was clearly written for a seventh grader or close to, so I tried to ignore the writing style and use of cliches.  I tried my best to call upon my inner 13-year-old and love these books.  But I couldn't do it.  And the main reason I couldn't love these books is because of the \\"heroine.\\"  She is shallow, selfish, egotistical, and manipulative - but not very smart.  I wouldn't have minded if she was manipulative in other ways the author could have made her be - against the Capitol, against the Gamesmakers.  But, without giving any spoilers, I'll just say that she wasn't.  I kept reading hoping to see the character growth over the three books and that all of these traits would be gone by the end and we'd have a heroine to actually admire...  But no.  Her character really left a lot to be desired, and by the end of the third book, I felt like there had been no growth at all, no development, no maturity - she was just Katniss.  The story as a whole was likable enough to keep reading, but Katniss was not likable enough to actually care what happened to her.<br /><br />Friends argued that Katniss was selfless, volunteering for her sister.  While that may have been her only redeeming action, in my opinion, she did it for egotistical reasons.  \\"Look at me, I'm doing what no one from District 12 has ever done before.  Look at me, saving my sister, because my sister's too weak to ever survive herself.\\"  The author didn't make me believe her motives.<br /><br />I don't understand the hype surrounding these books.  They weren't deep enough to make me really think about society or the character flaws of humans in any way, like some books can.  They weren't well written enough to take a journey with a character through her evolution.  They were just some books, that were entertaining enough, but forgettable.  I don't usually leave reviews, but I am just at a loss of the hysteria surrounding these books, and am glad to see that I'm not totally alone.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Decided to relent and get the original. Ad-free is well worth 99¢ because ads still cost your information! Have fun!
B0019FEFH4|5.0|This book impressed me as a tremendous insight in to a brilliant mind.  As with most any piece of work, it is critical that a reviewer be analytical in their approach.  To enter a review with prejudice and or bias simply categorizes the opining party as a proponent or opponent rather than as an observer/reporter of the text.  If I wish to have somebody tell me what they think - I'll seek their opinion.  Otherwise, I am quite capable and appreciative of the opportunity to formulate my own opinions.  When studying great figures in history, it is fairly common to have some understanding of what the respective figure is known for.  With that considered, I feel that works such as this are what are of the most significance; as they offer true insight in to the thought process' that compelled their subjects to their chosen courses of action.  To speak dismissively of someone that you have differing opinions with is a very weak (unfortunately common) tactic.  Also, only listening to one side of a story will further inhibit one's ability to compile the information necessary to form an accurate history/opinion of a given historical event/figure/period.<br /><br />Actually, since I could write a book on this material - I better conclude for now.  I will mention just few quick thoughts:<br /><br />-Stalin was responsible for far more deaths than Hitler (mostly of his own people!), ironic that that FDR sold him to the American public as \\"Uncle Joe\\"!<br /><br />-Communism and its progenitors is the political/religious doctrine responsible for more human suffering than any other in history.<br /><br />-A further irony is that the case for liable against the German's wartime actions was greatly substantiated by the very machines/techniques that the Germans (or people of Germanic descent) were responsible for inventing/developing, i.e. cameras, film and thorough documentation practices.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|I love shooters and was looking forward to trying R-Type out for Android on my Sensation 4G... unfortunately the control options are to either use an on-screen d-pad or tap-drag your finger around. The fault with the d-pad is the space between the directions is a horrible dead zone not allowing for nible movement that shooters such as this REQUIRE and dragging my finger around the screen blocks my view of the ship, enemies and flying projectiles/bullets.<br /><br />Galaga Special Edition offers better controls but not the exact same style.

B00571F26Y|2.0|I have been reading lots of nutrition books lately, and the author's information is a new spin on being healthy through whole food minus ALL wheat products, but 5% into the book, I was mad that he had repeated what he'd said at least 6 times. I usually read all the way through even the ones that are more scientific, but I had to quit 44% into it because of boredom. Although he is really boring, but the information is interesting, if you can accept rereading it 17x throughout the entire book!!
B0072A3OGS|5.0|I saw this band live a month and a half ago while touring with Children of Bodom (who I originally went to the show to see) and WOW! I was really impressed by this band. The other metal heads I know who frequent concerts all said they were most looking forward to this band. During March is Metal month, I purchased this CD. It's great! I can put this album in and listen through the entire thing over and over again. I'm really enjoying the folky bagpipe/hurdy gurdy/flute/violin/metal mashup. Will definitely buy more from this artist!

My plasma TV only has optical audio out and my Apple TV also has only optical audio out.  With two of these DACs, I can now run everything through my Bose system and it sounds perfect.  It is a lot less expensive than buying a new surround sound system!
B006CBSE86|4.0|I've been a Nightwish fan for a long time. I enjoyed Dark Passion Play and to be honest, the first time I listened through Imaginaerum I wasn't too impressed. There seem to be more lighter tracks on this album than previous releases. I like the hard hitting metal tracks most from Nightwish. But the more I listen to this album, the more it grows on me. By far my favorite track is I Want My Tears Back. Storytime and Ghost River are also some favorites from this album. I would recommend this album to any Nightwish fan.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Ok, so the sound on the movies seems slightly muted from the DVD's, but I can mostly get over that. They don't sound as loud or as full as on DVD. I can deal with it. Hence the 4 star review. I LOVE the 3 bonus discs and added commentary on each movie.  I can handle the minute tweaking of each movie for blu ray. The Obi/Anakin fight in Sith looks right now as opposed to when it was released. For all the haters out there, if you think George is doing this for the $$$$, DON'T BUY THE SET AND SHUT YOUR FACES OFF!!!! The main reason I spent the money on this was for discs 7,8, and 9. I own Eps 1-3 on DVD; bought them when they were released. Bought the DVDs for the original \\"special editions\\" when they were released. Bought the re-release of the original trilogy with the theatrical versions when that came out. And yes, bought this. I am soooo over it. These are awesome movies and an awesome series. It's an awesome movie when you view it as it was supposed to be, as 1 movie spread over 6 parts. For me, my favorite \\"bonus\\" was the documentary on the 501st Legion. Second would be the archive stuff for the original trilogy (I am actually watching that as I type this). There was never a doubt I would pick this up.  Don't hate on George for releasing this. Hate on the technology that forced him to have to release it in this version. And yes, I will buy it again if it gets realeased in a different disc type format for whatever comes after blu ray.  This is cinematic gold.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is a hard film to categorize.  Directed by Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m, with a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy adapted from the novel of the same name by Paul Torday, you could nominally call it a romantic comedy, but it's actually far more than that.  A character-driven human comedy about faith, passion and fishing comes closer.  Add in an absolutely scene-stealing performance by Kristin Scott Thomas as the Prime Minister's take-no-prisoners get-it-done-yesterday! press secretary and you've got Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.<br /><br />The film begins with Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor), the British government's leading expert on fisheries, receiving an inquiry about the feasibility of introducing salmon fishing to the Yemen. Jones quickly dismisses the possibility, responding that it is simply impossible for salmon - a fish that thrives in cold fresh-water streams found in northern latitudes - to survive in a hot and arid environment like the Yemen.  The inquiry, it turns out, came from Harriet Chetwood-Talbot (Emily Blunt), a consultant for a company that manages properties for a very wealthy client, Sheikh Muhammad (Amr Waked) from the Yemen. The Sheikh has a vision of salmon fishing, which he became familiar with due to his having an estate in Scotland, as not only a way to create much needed jobs for his people, but also as a way of bringing people together. Undeterred by Jones' initial rejection and buoyed by the persuasive Sheikh's belief in his vision, Harriet persists in pushing for a feasibility study, which Jones continues to dismiss.  Until, that is, the project comes to the attention of the Prime Minister's press secretary, the highly formidable and relentless Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas).<br /><br />A series of recent news items about bombings and other setbacks in the war in Afghanistan, already highly unpopular, has left the government desperately in need of \\"Anglo-Arabian news that isn't about something exploding.\\"  After tasking her staff with \\"We need a good news story from the Middle East, a big one, and we need it now. You've got an hour. Get on with it!\\" Maxwell seizes on the salmon fishing project as ideal for the government's needs and pushes it forward, riding rough-shod over any and all objections as to the project's chances of actually working.  Which in turn sets everything in motion and brings all of the main characters face to face.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor's Fred Jones is a man who muses \\"I was wondering if I was genetically programed to dull pedestrian life.\\"  He's comfortable in his government job where his biggest challenge is picking out pictures of fish to spice up his annual report; he's married but it's a passionless marriage, as becomes poignantly clear when his wife (Rachel Stirling) takes a several-months assignment in Switzerland, only bothering to tell him as she's packing for the trip.  Emily Blunt's Harriet Chetwood-Talbot, on the other hand, is Fred's exact opposite, passionate in her job and in her private life where she's had a whirlwind romance with a hunk of an army officer (Tom Mison) who's just been deployed to Afghanistan.  And Amr Waked's Sheikh rounds out the trio, a philosophical, quietly charismatic man who has a vision that he pursues all the more passionately because it is so impossible.  A chemistry develops among the three as Fred finds himself - much to his surprise - responding to Harriet's optimistic vivacity and to the Sheikh's belief that the more impossible a thing is, the more it is worth pursuing, even when - or rather especially when - all you have to go on is faith.  In addition to becoming not only engaged by but increasingly  optimistic about the salmon project, Fred also finds himself coming to believe that other things are also possible as his working relationship with Harriet blossoms into something else.  Between the two, Fred ends up making his own leaps of faith, with regard to the Sheikh's fantastical project and to the prospect of finding real love with Harriet.<br /><br />But it is Kristin Scott  Thomas' over-the-top press secretary Patricia Maxwell with her take-no-prisoners  approach to everything who supplies the comedy.  A powerhouse on high heels, Maxwell dominates everyone else around her, up to and including the Prime Minister himself, and she has far and away the best lines in the film which she delivers with acerbic glee -  \\"Is that the best you cocked-up, Oxford-educated, moronic buffoons can come up with?\\"  She also has the best scenes, like ones showing her at home where she's kicking her kids' butts at computer games or ordering them off to school, and you realize that she treats the government ministers above and around her exactly the same way as she handles her kids.  And the scenes showing the IM exchanges between her icon and that of the rather hapless Prime Minister are absolutely priceless.<br /><br />In addition to an engaging script and fine performances by the actors, the cinematography is also quite well done, taking you from highly diverse settings of urban London, rural Scotland and the desert wadis of the Yemen (actually shot in Morocco), all beautifully shot.  The scene where the Sheikh discusses his dream project with Jones while the two are fly-fishing is imbued with a grace and tranquility gives added feeling to the Sheikh's vision and you begin to see exactly what he is talking about.<br /><br />My only quibbles about the film are fairly minor.  The way in which Harriet's boyfriend's ill-timed reappearance is handled is dealt with a bit too neatly and ends up feeling out of place.  And the reactions on the part of the Sheikh and Jones when some disgruntled Yemenis attempt to sabotage the project seems more \\"message\\" oriented than how real people would actually react.  But those aside, the rest of the film flows quite smoothly, leaving you both entertained and with more than a bit of its quietly infectious optimism.<br /><br />Recommended as a quirky but highly enjoyable film and for Kristin Scott Thomas' riotously over-the-top performance.ect of finding real love with Harriet.<br /><br />But it is Kristin Scott  Thomas' over-the-top press secretary Patricia Maxwell with her take-no-prisoners  approach to everything who supplies the comedy.

Superior acting, storyline, costumes, sets, character development, all the period details. It's rare that we start caring about what happens to fictional characters, but Downton Abbey has made that happen. Thank you, thank you, thank you! It's so refreshing to see that historical dramas can be done in an absolutely excellent way.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|Based on the graphic novels of a similar title this story focuses upon a Civil War veteran with special powers and chief among them is speaking with the dead. Megan Fox plays the \\"I love you, Jonah, but don't make me say it\\" whore with a not so heart of gold who ends up being pretty good with guns herself as demonstrated at the end of this story. John Malkovich plays Jonah's long lived enemy and by the way Josh Brolin plays the indefatigable Jonah Hex. Other notable appearances are by Aidan Quinn, Will Arnett, Michael Shannon, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Lance Reddick. It's fun in certain parts with its steampunkish western setting yet if you look closely you'll see that there are some plot holes. It's a fun movie and the only way to enjoy it is to not take it too seriously in that regard. It promises to make lots of things explode while six shooters go off left and right and some strange pieces of magic and steampunk blend in to the overall somewhat good tale. Fans of the graphic novels have rightly complained the movie was too short  and didn't spend enough time developing the characters. The budget for this film was $47M but it came woefully under at a bit less than $11M worldwide. STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; ACTION SCENES: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
0307959856|2.0|Glaring errors of logic and storyline mar this book so badly that I'm wondering if P.D. James had an editor. I had been looking forward to this read, perhaps too much so, and was greatly disappointed by both the writing style and frequent tedium. Whole chapters were dedicated to minor characters that ultimately play no real role in the drama. Inconsequential details were boldly highlighted and then forgotten about. Even major characters that I expected to hear more from or even just about were sent off to other locations and never heard from again. And it never ever made sense to me that Lydia had no reaction whatsoever to what was argued about by Wickham and Denny during that fateful carriage ride. Had she suddenly become deaf??? Apparently, she was never even questioned by anyone about it nor did she volunteer anything, let alone change her attitude to her husband. And why did Wickham think the carriage driver would go along with his plans? All in all, this was not the best work by P.D. James.

B00140PK6O|5.0|This production of CRANFORD caps off the BBC's initiative to dramatise the works of Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell, which began in 1999 with [[ASIN:B000GIXLUC Wives and Daughters]] and continued with [[ASIN:B000AYEL6U North & South]].  Arguably the most popular and beloved of all Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell's works, CRANFORD was partially based on Gaskell's memories of a real Cheshire village in which she had lived for a time, called Knutsford.  This quiet, uncomplicated novel is really a series of vignettes - some comical, some romantic and others deeply moving - when woven together create the rich tapestry of life in a tight-knit village which is teetering on the edge of change.  For this 5-part miniseries of CRANFORD, screenwriter Heidi  Thomas has combined the original \\"Cranford\\" with two additional Gaskell manuscripts - \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions\\".<br /><br />We arrive in Cranford with Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), who has graciously been accepted to stay with the Jenkyns sisters.  With a tiresome, matchmaking stepmother (Finty Williams) and an ever-increasing brood of stepsiblings back in Manchester, Mary is hoping for rest and respite... what she gets however is anything but!<br /><br />To her amusement, Mary discovers Cranford to be a community governed by it's unusually high percentage of older female residents.  One particular small circle holds more influence than the others - Cranford's \\"Amazons\\" are the formidable Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton), Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her sister, Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench).  Together, these ladies are Cranford's very lifeblood, the bastion of decency and a support system of mutual friendship.<br /><br />Mary's arrival in Cranford coincides with the posting of a new, young doctor, Frank Harrison (Simon Woods), who quickly becomes caught up in a scheme of matchmaking with several residents.  Also newly-arrived in town is the impoverished Captain Brown (Jim Gordon) and his daughter Jessie (Julia Sawalha).  At the nearby estate of Hanbury Court, the ageing Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) keeps things running smoothly for the county, clinging to the safety of past traditions, but finds herself in a losing battle with the looming prospect of a railway line cutting into her land, bringing with it that dreaded thing called \\"progress\\".  Progress is already much closer than she thinks, in the small body of Harry Gregson (Alex Etel), a gypsy boy whose hunger for knowledge is recognised by Lady Ludlow's overseer Edmund Carter (Philip Glenister), and Miss Galindo (Emma Fielding), Lady Ludlow's milliner.<br /><br />CRANFORD is an ensemble piece, but the bulk of the action emanates from the house of the Jenkyns sisters.  Most of what happens unfolds through the eyes of Mary Smith (the book's narrator) and if there's a \\"lead\\" character it's most definitely Miss Matty, who is one of the most delightful figures in all literature.  Screenwriter Heidi Thomas (\\"Madame Bovary\\", \\"Lillies\\", \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\") is one of my favourites and somehow always manages to distill all the best dialogue from the original source but make it fresh again for the screen.<br /><br />The performances are sublime.  The BBC always furnishes their costume dramas with first-rate talents, but the cast in CRANFORD is simply extraordinary.  With Dames Atkins and Dench leading the way as the Jenkyns sisters, all is well with the world.  In particular I adore Judi Dench's Miss Matty; she brings out a lovely child-like quality to the character.  There's also a few \\"Gaskell veterans\\" reunited here in CRANFORD (Francesca Annis, Michael Gambon, Barbara Flynn and Deborah Findlay all appeared in the BBC's earlier adaptation of Gaskell's \\"Wives and Daughters\\").<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough.rrived in town is the impoverished Captain Brown (Jim Gordon) and his daughter Jessie (Julia Sawalha).

I usually don't miss a thing but with the blu-ray version I realized I had missed lots of details. I even caught a subtle hint at the Mother's funeral which I had never seen before.. I cannot believe I missed it after all these years. I believe Fellini would be absolutely ecstatic.  Anyone who likes Fellini will love Amarcord blu-ray,<br />it is worth every cent.
0670023329|5.0|I bought this book on my Kindle this morning and couldn't put it down until I had devoured the whole thing. This book is a fast read and very thought provoking. It's about a young man named, Shin Dong-hyuk. Shin was born and raised in a North Korean prison camp completely unaware of life in North Korea outside of camp let alone the world. It is his story of survival, escape, and his struggle to adjust to his new life. When I first began reading this book I couldn't help thinking about the uncanny similarities between Camp 14 and the world Suzanne Collins had created in her book, The Hunger Games. Big difference though, this story is not fiction, it's not some YA dystopian novel. What's going on in North Korea right now is nothing short of hell on earth.<br />If you choose to read this book, be warned, this book contains graphic images of men, women and children being tortured and killed. It opens a window into North Korea that most people in the free world can hardly comprehend. You may never be able to get these images out of your mind. You might find yourself thinking about Shin's story at random times of the day and in strange places. In fact, it may change you and the way you look at your own problems, society, and government. This book is very disturbing but in a good way. Hopefully it'll awaken people around the world and brings about change in North Korea.
0671027344|3.0|I honestly expected a little more from this book. I thought that there would be some sort of deep insight revealed by the end of the book, but it didn't really seem like there was. In general, I thought that the book had a nice flow, and that I was interested throughout by what Charlie had to say. Some passages of it were good but in the end, there was no big \\"revelation\\" that made the book.<br /><br />Also, the other characters seemed undeveloped. Nobody really changes except for Charlie. I guess I could relate to a few parts of the book, (as a high school senior), but the events seemed to be cliched and slightly unrealistic.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its like the world went back in time to the old west and then with all the natural disasters its just amazing
0439023521|5.0|I wanted this book so bad and it was the cheapest on amazon. It got to my house fast and i have enjoyed it so much. I just love the series. I will be using amazon in the future.

1612130283|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever seen.  Sexual content aside, the book reads like it was written by a sixth grader.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have always preferred this app over any other and especially over the stock calendar apps on my galaxy nexus. It has little features that make a big difference. The integration with the phone is great and the widgets are perfect for my needs.
B000LB7G00|1.0|Yes it would have been great if it worked. The concept is sound and what not but reality bites.<br /><br />The manufacturer page listed a bunch of compatible software including Photoshop. What it doesn't mention is that the support is **PARTIAL** ie. a lot of the features that're supposed to work don't. In Photoshop, you can zoom in and out with the latest driver, but you can NOT ROTATE. Or you can download the \\"Experimental\\" driver, and it'll allow you to rotate canvas but NOT ZOOM IN or OUT --- seriously WTH!?<br /><br />Also what the software did was emulate keystrokes, problem is emulating keystroke works terribly. The rotation is CHOPPY! It's not smooth and precise like this kind of device is supposed to do. The mouse itself seems to be capable of recording how much force is applied, but it does no good if the apps don't support it.<br /><br />It also doesn't work with Zbrush, Daz, or iClone... I honestly don't know what it works with, may be Maya and 3d Max, but even so there're complains that the support isn't fully fleshed out. I don't want to find out, I wasted enough time and money already.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an awesome game..love all the features..speed and ease of operationm I can play it for hours!!!! Warning....it's addicting!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best series shows I've watched in a long time -- can't wait for season three to begin!
B005VT42BS|5.0|this utility is awesome. there are plenty of features and network tools. I'm surprised that it is free. This is an app that I would have gladly bought after trying it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this as an upgrade to my DVDs once the price was right. It was worth the price paid for the better picture and sound. Special features are good if you go for that type of thing. I'm sure there is nothing I can add about the quality of these legendary movies. I will just say that if you have never seen them then there has never been a better time to purchase them because they have never looked better.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these on my Samsung galaxy s2 4g. And the sound  quality is perfect and loud. Recieved before estimated date. I am buying an extra pair of these for backup. Love them.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|This one is a little bittersweet as it marks the end of a franchise that many fans grew up with. We can be thankful that this is well done and realtivly true to the book. I imagine most people know what they are getting with this release so I will only add that it looks great. Most people are only buying this as a placeholder until the ultimate mega collection comes out in a few months / years. Buy it and know it is a good representation of what the film looked like in theaters.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|love nicki,  love this cd, grrrrrrrrreat. get on a starship, and fly, luv it, buy it, get it, hear it, greatness is is what its worth, reload...BANG,BANG, its on.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I have been a fan of this series since they started rolling out in theaters and bought this set to replace my DVDs. The trillogy looks great and it was well worth the money for the upgrade.
B000TEMRXA|4.0|Getting music in this fashion is so simple that a novice on computer technology can do it. The music is terrific. It's always wonderful to hear the oldies but goodies.
B001EN71HC|4.0|These movies started coming out when I was in high school. I was the perfect age to appreciate Mike Myers brand of humor. The movies haven't really aged that well and the quality certainly dropped off as the series progressed but at Amazon's price they are hard to pass up. Picture quality is good, as would be expected on BD. There are almost no special features to speak of but I don't know what else you would really want. If you enjoyed these movies the first time around they are worth picking up. Otherwise there is nothing here to get excited about.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I really like the app. Great sound for some stations, depends on the stations own feed.<br />I don't understand why it was updated on the Google Play Market, but not on the Amazon market?
0451169514|4.0|Just finished all 1100 pages or so and am happy I saw it through. If you have a Kindle, I would definitely recommend getting that version as I found the paperback somewhat tedious to hold open, it was so thick/dense. Anyway onto the review.<br /><br />If you like Stephen King in particular/horror fiction in general, reading It is a no brainer. I've read a few of King's stories now and believe this is his best in terms of character development and establishing setting/mood. Even if your childhood was nothing like that of the protagonists, it is easy to feel nostalgic reading about them. The amount of detail he provides is striking but that is really a two-edged sword. It's great if you're really into the book because it means you can enjoy it longer. Objectively, though, It could probably be half as long (literally) and do a fine job telling the story. The premise itself is definitely spooky but I felt it could have done without the distinct cosmic undertone towards the end. The clown everyone associates with this book is scarier than what \\"It\\" really is, in my opinion.<br /><br />If, however, you're a casual reader and want to give Stephen King a shot, I'd advise against It. It's just too long for the story you get. Read Pet Sematary instead.<br /><br />Also, I am in total agreement with the other reviewers slamming King for what he has Beverly/the others do in the tunnel towards the end. Seriously uncomfortable reading and should have been left out entirely. I don't know what he was thinking there.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love YouVersion because it has so many different versions of the Bible and I share with others while I'm reading. Awesome!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|We bought this set to replace our flimsy set from before marriage.  The handles are very sturdy and don't bend even when my husband puts pressure on them to cook.  I love the feature that allows me to set it on the counter without needing a spoon rest underneath it.  As long as you tap off the utensil no drips on the counter and it doesn't touch.  We love the product, its fantastic!!
B00355L2TU|4.0|I was looking for a workout to bust me out of my plateau and Jillian didn't fail me.  These workouts get results....my muscles in my arms, legs, and back are more toned and defined and I'm starting to see real definition in my abs. I lost a total of 8 inches in 30 days.  I don't think I would recommend this to someone who hasn't been working out at all. The transition from one move to the next is pretty quick and bad form on most of these moves will surely cause injury. I highly recommend this DVD.
0307386171|3.0|I chose \\"On Chesil Beach\\" because it had become such a popular book, and I had enjoyed \\"Atonement\\" so I though I would give it a try.  I also love anything set in England.  I found the writing to be well done, but the strange turn this book took left me with a sour taste in my mouth.  A disappointment.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I've never read a story by an author who had such a keen understanding of the ancient mindset. While this is a fantasy, it most obviously is creating an amalgam of every age from Medieval to Greco-Roman to Bronze Age. Pretty much the way humans were up until modernity. It was a cruel and wicked land. But in this Darwinian world emerges amazingly intelligent and skilled people, often underdogs. This book shows all that and more
1439153663|4.0|I just finished The Kitchen House and enjoyed this historical fiction so much.  It was well written and kept my attention, because I never did know how all of the characters were going to end up.<br /><br />Lots of secrets and connections between characters definitely kept me on my toes.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Runs well on my Kindle - no issues.  Best app I have found for Weather.<br />Much easier to navigate through and appears accurate in my locale.
B004J4WV28|1.0|I bought a pair of brooks from a running store in my area and loved them. I thought this was such a good deal until i compared them with the ones i bought last year. These are very stiff and less comfortable. Something doesn't seem right about them. I'm not convinced they're authentic. I would recommend to buy something as important as your running shoes in a store where you can try them on first, even if you're buying the same model you used last year. You've been warned.
B007G5GYHA|3.0|The movie was great.  My kids loved it.  We had to completely stop it 2-3 times to get it to play again.  It acted like it was buffering, but would start back up as soon as we stopped and restarted it.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|When you first get this gun, take off the barrel. It will do you no good. With the barrel off, it gives you a light and comfortable feel. Furthermore, when shooting, it has a very nice pump action lever that is impossible to miss. While an 18 mag would be better, the 6 bullets that come with the gun will not fail.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best app ever. Very helpful. I love it. Be nice if they have a highliter. I use it for all my notes.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Lightning Thief is the first bok in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. It's great! Percy is a 12 year old boy. He pretty much gets kicked out of every school he goes to. He is a demigod, but he doesn't know that until he gets to Camp Half Blood, a place for demigods like Percy. No monsters can get inside Camp Half Blood, and that'ts why they stay there. Percy is a son of Poisden ( Sorry if I spelled that wrong, I always forget) . Shortly after he arrives at CHB, he is on a quest to find  Zeus's lightning bolt, whicch has been stolen.  I think this book is great. Percy is obviously great at fighting, I mean he fought the Minotaur right when he got to CHB. Other characters like Annabeth Chase are great too, ( Annabeth is a daughter of Athena, and very smart) or Grover Underwood, Percy's best friend, and protector ( Yes, he is a satyr). The only thing that's bad is THE MOVIE. That was really bad. Annabeth didn't even lool like Annabeth. They left out the best parts, and the story is all wrong. They do 't even have some characters! I say the book is way better.
B005HSL626|5.0|It's really great! You get a lot for NO MONEY...you might want to BE CAREFUL with feint though.....there are things on there that kids 12 &amp; younger SHOULD NOT see...<br />Love it!!! A MUST GET!!

B003EYVXV4|5.0|I recently went to see this movie and it was incredible.  It's haunting, dark and deeply disturbing; but so compelling, I had to read the book.  I waited until after reading the book to write this review.<br /><br />WARNING-CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS....<br /><br />The Hunger Games takes place in post-war Panem, formally known as North America.  Panem is made up of 12 districts.  Two children, a boy and a girl, between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district in a lottery to compete to the death in The Hunger Games for the Capitol and President Snow's entertainment.  This movie is violent and frankly, difficult to watch.  I was emotionally exhausted by the time it was over.<br /><br />I thought the casting in this movie was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible Oscar-worthy performance as Katniss Everdeen.  I am so impressed with this actress' level of talent.  She became Katniss and I don't think anyone else could have played this part any better.  I also loved Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark.  He really impressed me as well.  I got emotionally invested in these two characters and their fight to keep themselves and each other alive.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts regarding the movie/book comparison:<br /><br />All I can say is Wow. It's really good. I loved the movie, but the book is even better.  Keep in mind that they had to condense the novel into a 2-hour movie so there is going to be some changes made to make it work on screen.<br /><br />Katniss' complicated relationship with Peeta is more connected in the books than the movie and I have to say that I absolutely love him. There is nothing sexier than a man who will do anything, including risking his life, for the woman he loves.  I'm Team Peeta all the way. I think I got a better sense of who Gale is to Katniss in the book as well. In the movie, he was just some kid back home that she hunted with, but in the book, you get to see what she is feeling and what his friendship really means to her. I was really affected by this movie and the book. It's funny that my feelings for certain characters were so different in the movie than the book.  For example:  I had absolutely no sympathy for Cato whatsoever in the movie, but really felt sorry for him for what he had to endure in the book at the end of the games.<br /><br />It was a very disturbing movie for sure, but amazing nonetheless. Oh and those beasts are way more terrifying and disturbing in the book than in the movie. Holy Crap, they were off the charts creepy.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was an excellent adaptation of the book.  Even if you have never read the book, you will not regret seeing this movie.  The acting is incredible and the characters are memorable.. I was really affected by this movie and the book.

B004AQOTVQ|1.0|my product has stains all over it, and this was not mentioned in the item description. if i would have known about the extra yellow spots i deff would not have wasted my time, thanks for nothing
0439023483|5.0|I saw The Hunger Games movie and immediately had to read the book.  All I can say is Wow.  This was an amazing, dark, compelling, incredible read.  I loved it.<br /><br />It is disturbing and sad to think of a future where the government of Panem, formally known as North America, takes one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts (24 tributes ages 12-18) and forces them to fight to the death for the entertainment of the Capital, but that is what The Hunger Games are.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the two tributes from District 12 who are the current year's contestants in The Hunger Games.  This is their story of love and survival and what they were willing to go through to keep themselves and each other alive.  I really loved Peeta.  There is nothing sexier than a man who will do anything, including risking his life, for the woman he loves.  I was moved to tears several times while reading this, trying to imagine the horror, misery and utter brutality these kids were put through. This is an amazing read by a brilliant author.  My only regret was that I waited so long to read it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this incredibly dark, brutal and compelling novel filled with amazing unforgettable characters.  It was a very disturbing read for sure, but amazing nonetheless.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I was thinking about how a lot of people complain about why does it take so long for this boat to sink. And a lot of people say the movie is too long. Well, I think James Cameron wanted to set the scene which he did in a beautiful way, look he won 11 Oscars!  I was thinking about it since it's re-released now on 3D.<br />  This movie has a beautiful love story. Rose is being treated like dirt by an angry, controlling husband and almost jumps into the scary ocean & runs into adventurous Jack who saved her life. They fall in love and share passionate times together.  Along with some great special effects.  What's not to love about this movie, even though it is sad.  All I can say is I love this movie & if you don't, then you wouldn't know love.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|even though alot of people may dismiss an american version of the dragon tattoo movie, i have to say this movie is just as good as the swedish version with noomie rapace. rooney mara really kicked ass as lisbeth. this version also seems to have a little more detail that the swedish version left out. also theres things in this version that wasnt in the book that was altered. this movie really brings out lisbeth salander in a more deeper level, even adding a scene wheres shes looking for company in a club just to show that she sometimes need a release from stress. and daniel craig is as awsome as ever. alot of dark scenery despite the white snow, gritty soundtrack and great acting really makes this american version shine in all directions. im hopeing for the next 2 movies to be made. happy to here rooney mara is on board. warning: this movie is really not recommended for the faint of heart (disturbing rape scene, and frontal nudity)
0071762345|5.0|I purchased a few different social media books at Amazon, and found this one to be the best.  Not only was it an entertaining read, it provided quick and easy immediate actions which I put in to place right away.  I was also equally impressed that Dave responded to my personal question very quickly via his Facebook account, as promised in the book.  On all counts, both the book and Dave delivered excellent value.
0375842209|4.0|What an awfully engaging, beautifully written book by Markus Zusak, called The Book Thief. The creepy, but soft narrator, Death tell the book. Such incrediable writing Zusak uses. The language he uses will make you love the characters and getnto know them. In The Book Theif you get to know the characters heart and apperances. Liesel starts out as a young scared little girl who faces a deathly tragedy that starts everything and will haunt her in the future. She has two foster parents, her foster mother is bitterly sweet, but she can show her love in a strange way. The first time Death lays eyes on Liesel he is changed because there is something about her that catches Death, and keeps him. Death has feelings for Liesel; he clearly states that from the beginning. From then on as Liesel grows you grow with her, with all her emotions, fun time with her bestfriend Rudy and struggles with Max. The Book Thief has an ending that you will either love or dislike, it's a turning point that will change Liesels life forever. All in all, a great well written book by Markus Zusak will soften your heart.
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|...if I actually could have watched this series! Unfortunately it was impossible as the completely idiotic programming of the disks prevented any attempts to get them to work! The first disk briefly came to life after waiting for some 10 minutes, since then even that disk doesn't load anymore. I have a multi-region player with up-to-date firmware which so far was able to cope with all other disks I have!<br />Even my new laptop gave up, so back the DVD's go!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|This was one of the most inspirational stories I've ever read.  Christopher McDougell lays out one of the greatest adventures ever experienced.  I found myself almost unable to think about anything else other then the stories and characters of this book.  It's well researched and well written.  After finishing it I couldn't believe how short the book was, because it seemed like I was filled with so much useful information presented in a very interesting way.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in running but lacks the motivation to get started.  Even if you don't buy off on the barefoot running debate, this story is a must read!  I'm probably going to read it one or two more times, it was that enjoyable.

B004JN1D2I|3.0|I don't have anything to say about George R. R. Martin's work that hasn't already been said (it's excellent), but I would like to comment on the preparation and packaging of this document for Kindle.<br /><br />Bundling - When one purchases a \\"bundle\\" of books, they receive individual books. There's a specific term for a collection of individual stories in one book - it's called an anthology. For Kindle, this product is explicitly sold as a \\"4-Book Bundle\\". Instead of receiving four separate files on my Kindle, I received one massive file with all for books strung end to end. That's not a bundle, that's an anthology.<br /><br />Page Counts - One of the alleged benefits of the Kindle is the ability to reference real page numbers to discuss things with users with the dead-tree (that's paper) versions and location numbers for those reading on Kindles of different sizes. The page numbers in this release are broken beyond the first book - everything after page 695 reads as page 695, even the other books in the anthology. In addition, with all four books merged into one monolithic file, the location numbers are irrelevant for comparison after the first novel.<br /><br />Metadata - Kindle books have metadata that is presented on screen so you can see what book you're looking at. This metadata has fields for author, title, publisher, etc. In this case, the title field is populated with \\"George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Bundle: A Song of Ice and Fire Series: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (Song of Ice & Fire)\\". There's a whole slew of errors here:<br />1.) The author's name should not be part of the title field; there's a separate field for that.<br />2.) The book series is not \\"A Game of Thrones\\", even if the HBO series is. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is just one book in the series properly called \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".<br />3.) The name is so long that it cannot be read on the screen of all devices. On the Kindle Touch, you end up seeing the author's name twice and not much else.<br /><br />Of course, this all comes back to packaging. If the Bundling step had been done correctly (which is to say, not at all) then the Page Counts (definitely) and Metadata (hopefully) would have been correct. Amazon, if you did the packaging, shame on you. If the publisher did the packaging, shame on Amazon as well. I shouldn't get a book that is readable but with all the benefits of the Kindle format broken.

B00701QVVY|5.0|Every time a new CD from one of my favorite bands comes out I get this sense of joy and happiness.  I have been a fan of OverKill since the beginning.  The Electric Age is Thrash Metal at it's best. Who ever said this CD is CRAP really needs to get your head checked.  Overkill do not disappoint, from the opening track \\"Come and Get It\\" to the head banging \\"Electric Rattlesnake\\" every track is strong. Great continuation from \\"IronBound\\" I wish I could give this more then 5 Stars. My early favorite for Metal Album of the year.

B004XZDT60|4.0|I happened to see Ed Sheeran performing on TV at the Brits Awards (where he won several awards, if I recall) in February, and really liked what I saw. I finally picked up the album the other day when I saw him live here in Cincinnati (more on that later). Sheeran had released a number of singles with great acclaim in the UK before this album came out last Fall in the UK.<br /><br />\\"+\\" (13 tracks; 50 min.) brings Ed Sheeran's best output from those multiple pre-album singles, and a number of new tracks. When the opening track \\"The A Team\\" comes on, the immediate reaction is that this reminds me of \\"Damien Rice meets James Blake\\", and indeed a number of tracks on here are in that very same vein. But on a number of other tracks, Sheeran expands into further territory, even rapping (\\"Grade B\\" and \\"Lego House\\" among others). Other highlights include the UK singles \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\" (with more rapping) and the last official track on here, the epic \\"Give Me Love\\" (it is followed by an uncredited track to close things oue). But I must say I was appalled by the slimsy presentation of this CD, with no credits or liner notes whatsoever (nevermind the lyrics to the songs), Sheeran's name doesn't even appear anywhere. That said, this is a promising and enjoyable debut album for sure.<br /><br />At the Cincinnati show, Sheeran put on a blazing 35 min. solo-act (opening for Snow Patrol), where he worked with loops and creating a one-man band wall of sound, just incredible. He started with an amazing 10 min. version of \\"Give Me Love\\", inciting a crowd sing-along (mind you, this is the FIRST song of his set!), and doing it again on \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\", just wow. If you have a chance to catch Sheeran on tour, do not miss it! Meanwhile \\"+\\" is a great and promising debut album.
B004NSULHM|5.0|'The Bends' is a great album. I couldn't believe the popularity of 'OK Computer'. I stuck with Radiohead through 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' when many didn't, though skeptical myself at times. I welcomed the rock guitar of 'Hail to the Thief' and recognized 'In Rainbows' as the purely great work that it is. It took me 5 months and seeing them play it live to realize The 'King of Limbs' is the best Radiohead album.<br /><br />Any true fan knows you can't fully appreciate a Radiohead album immediately, or even like it. I had to force myself to dive into TKOL when I didn't really want to. I have emerged realizing this is not an album of repetition and computer loops, as many will call it. It is alchemy at it's finest. If you have the patience to listen to it enough, you will at one point notice \\"hmmm, that's not bad\\". Come back to it a few days later and you'll pick up another layer, complementing another layer you never noticed before. This goes on for seemingly endless iterations.<br /><br />No need for song-by-song analysis here, it's all brilliant. Make sure you listen to \\"Little By Little\\" and \\"Separator\\" with good headphones.  With little fanfare, Radiohead have made one of the best albums of all time. The masses will never know that, but that's just fine with me. All naysayers are entitled to their opinion, but I respectfully dismiss them as part of the 'instant gratification' generation. In this era of generally shite music, I'm just glad we have Radiohead.

1582701709|4.0|\\"The Secret\\" has been popular since its endorsement by Oprah Winfrey a few years back.  It is a well-designed book with principles and fundamentals to lead you to success.<br /><br />One of the foundational laws this book talks about is the law of attraction.  This law of attraction has been discussed and analyzed by Napoleon Hill- the author of the classic book, \\"Think and Grow Rich\\".  Positive believing is essential but it is only half of what you need to success.  You need positive action and direction.  Action is critical to get anything done.  Yes, it is important to saturate yourself with positive and uplifting goals and direction to attract success.  You will also need to \\"unpark your car\\" and drive towards your goal.<br /><br />This is a good book to initially saturate yourself with positive believing.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
1400069289|1.0|This book is unjustly getting attention.  It is a remarkably fatuous exercise.  One lengthy section on Febreze is nothing short of a commercial for that product.  The author describes grotesque experimentation on animals without a shred of compassion or reservation.  The experiments themselves offer nothing in the way of scientific insight, although that doesn't stop the author from credulously, uncritically prattling on about them.  Another lengthy section on memory impaired individuals goes on endlessly; one has to scour it for any real hint of how habit is important.  All of the information the author has received is evaluated without a hint of analysis or criticism.  Any scientist or PR person who would speak to the author is treated as an instant authority with almost godlike powers.<br /><br />More than anything else, the book is about advertising and capitalism -- at least as far as I got.  I picked this up because the New York Times credential of the author suggested a quality work.  I find it remarkable that an author or publisher would market a book in this fashion and include no practical information, no depth.<br /><br />This book raises a larger question of why Kindle books cannot be returned.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I just finished a second reading of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  I enjoyed the second reading as much if not more than the first, possibly because it's so long and so captivating I found myself reading more than 24 hrs straight several times on the first go round.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Definitely for adults just as the book is. Terrific series, goes along most lines of the book, some deviations but mostly on key. If you like the books then you're gonna like the series.
1585429155|5.0|There are two books I read years ago that transformed my life for the better. One was Shakti Gawain's Creative Visualization and the second was Joseph Murphy's The Power of Your Subconscious Mind. My best friend had recommended both books to me during a difficult period, when I was recuperating from surgery. To this day, I practice the teachings in both books, and the affirmations that I've composed for myself, based on my needs and goals, have never failed to lift my spirits, or put me in a better frame of mind, as well as lighten my physical & emotional load. I truly subscribe to the belief that as you think, so you are...and Murphy's teachings have helped me to channel my negative, defeatist, pessimistic thoughts into positive and empowering thoughts & actions. To fully reap the benefits of this book, one does need to have an open mind. I hope many more people benefit from this book as I have. I had the old paperback edition which is showing signs of much wear and tear so I decided to treat myself to this deluxe edition. It is in hardcover (black with gold lettering) and comes with a red satin ribbon marker, perfect for marking pages that I can re-read from time to time.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|There are many detractors for this very long (146 minutes) film, complaining that it is too emotional, too melodramatic, too 'Lassie Come Home', to over the top as a tearjerker, too Steven Speilberg and John Williams, et cetera. Well, it has all those elements but depending on the emotional vulnerability of the viewer the film can easily become a catharsis during this period of time when very little makes sense and the need for positive input into matters of the heart has rarely been more keen. Not having seen the stage play based on the book of the same name by acclaimed children's writer Michael Morpurgo, adapted for stage by Nick Stafford, this viewer is at a disadvantage in judging the story alone as here it is enhanced by gorgeous cinematography and amazingly realistic battle scenes. Lee Hall and Richard Curtis created the screenplay and seem to have allowed a proscenium stage story to expand into the spaces a play can only describe, and Steven Spielberg has taken it from there.<br /><br />The time of the story in set in Devon, England. To his wife Rose's (Emily Watson) dismay war injured and silenced farmer Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan)  buys a thoroughbred horse rather than a plough animal that might save their leased farm form landowner Lyons (David Thewlis), but when his teenaged son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) trains the horse and calls him Joey, the two becoming inseparable, Albert does indeed manage to train Joey how to plough fields. When his harvest fails due to rain, Ted has to sell Joey to an army captain (Tom Hiddleston) who takes the horse into the battlefields of World War I the British cavalry and he is shipped to France. After a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed in a scene between a British soldier and a German soldier that is one of the most memorable scenes in the film. Joey is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey. However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off. The results of the final auction seals the fate of the extraordinary lad and horse relationship in a most touching way.<br /><br />There are many, many cameo roles in the film that though brief are extremely well delivered: Niels Arestrup is the wise grandfather to the young Emilie (Celine Buckens) who rescues Joey for a while; Toby Kebbell is excellent as Geordie Soldier as is David Kross as the kind German soldier Gunther whose younger brother Friedrich (Nicolas Bro) he protects, and Hinnerk Sch&ouml;nemann shines as the German solder who helps rescue Joey from the barbed wire in No Man's Land. Leonard Carow, Matt Milne, Robert Emms, and Eddie Marsan are likewise memorable.<br /><br />The breathtaking cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the at times lugubrious musical score is by longtime Spielberg associate, composer John Williams. The story aims for the heart and finds its mark - and there is nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps this film is much needed right now.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is my first real wilderness knife and I love it! First thing I did was baton some wood with no problem! Also used it to make an axe handle and it performed nicely. The sheath is solid and the knife snaps in securely. Wasn't completely familiar and nicked my finger getting it out once, but only once! The blade is \\"shave your arm\\" (yes, yes I did a little just to see) sharp from the factory. Will wrap some paracord around the sheath to hold ferro rod and probably strap on hip until I get a finer blade for outdoors.<br /><br />There is no all-in-one knife that I've seen so this one is for big jobs, not fine details. I will be looking for something like the BK7 next for finer work!
B004A8EI9M|5.0|oh no, not another zombie show! that's what i thought until i watched the first episode and i was absolutely blown away. if you like post-apocalyptic stories or zombie movies - or just plain good acting with great stories, then get this set. it's one to own. season 2 was just as terrific.<br />you might like<br />[[ASIN:B000YGIHOG 28 Weeks Later]]<br />and try [[ASIN:B000YGIHOG 28 Weeks Later]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like it<br /><br />It is fun.  all the games are different.  not boring.  I let my daughter play done of the the games and she enjoyed it also.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Very enjoyable read. Characters are engaging and the story is deeper and richer than just the first book. Be sure to read the whole trilogy to get the whole story.  This is one story that stayed with me long after I closed the cover at the end!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I write this review more to show the quality of book that is required to get a 5 star from me than because I think it will help anyone make a decision.  If somehow someone is reading this honestly trying to decide whether or not to read this book, I will say this.  It is a well written trilogy that makes you think about how the world works and should work with a story about a girl taking her sister's place in a battle royal to the death that becomes more than she intended to many people.  It's worth a read if only to know why the movie has become so popular.
B007G5GYHA|4.0|This movie had gotten very good reviews from viewers on Rotten Tomatoes so I went in expecting it to be good -- and it was.<br /><br />There's nothing spectacular about it; but everything is excellent. The animation, sound, music and writing.<br /><br />All in all, it was just plain fun to watch.<br /><br />Isn't that what you want from a movie?
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Our local newspaper sugested this author as a best read.  I know<br />they ment for us to buy the paper version of the book but I kindled<br />it insgtead and was hooked from the start.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|A little predictable, but a good, light read. It kept me guessing for a while, and was well writen and quite informative. I enjoyed it from start to almost the finish. It ended a bit too nicely for my liking, but good fun and worth the time. A good holiday read!
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King's 11/22/63 is a tremendous accomplishment. A wonderful love story that gives you a lot to think about. Not to mention a gripping page turner. This book is 800 some odd pages long, and when you turn the last page you will want more. It is THAT good.
030746363X|5.0|Has some really interesting sections on body development.  Interesting takes on diet, exercise, and sex.  His 15 minute orgasm was really funny, and could even be possible.

B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Its awesome, but confusing at first, with the talk of all the gods and things, it helps to read the index at the back of the book as well as reading the dramitca peronale at the begining, It starts making since about a third of the way through when the Twin Acendents Oppon apear to Captian parran
0761169253|5.0|A great read for anyone, but especially relevant to me as an emerging artist who wonders if my work is worthy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I kind of like it. I thought maybe the 101 games would already be included so I am not incredibly fond of &quot;buying&quot; the different games. I do like the variety of the games - there are some very fun and challenging ones!
B00005AQF7|5.0|The original gangsta. Nobody is cooler than snoop dogg. Nobody! This is the best of the best. This is a classic. You need to get it if you're into 90's rap instead of the crap we have now.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|What a great movie! After four viewings (plus once in the theater), I think this movie just gets better. As a long time Tintinologist, I was anxiously awaiting the movie's arrival and was not disappointed. The merging of the plots from three different Tintin graphic novels improved on the story (heresy, you say!). At first I was disappointed that Prof. Calculus was missing but he wasn't integral to this version of the story; wait until \\"Prisoners of the Sun,\\" Peter Jackson's contribution to the Tintin trilogy.<br />The biggest shame regarding this wonderful movie is how the American audiences stayed away in droves to but made garbage like \\"Chipwrecked\\" #1. Makes me question America's tastes in movies. Watch the blu-ray and marvel at the crispness of the picture! You see wood grain, rusting metal, the rolling oceans and characters' fleshtones, everything looking beyond photorealistic! Amazing! And the story is exciting with danger at every turn. (Tintin puts Indiana Jones to shame!) And who could resist the charms of Tintin's \\"soul mate,\\" Snowy? Do NOT pass up this picture (and afterward, search out Herge's fantastic Tintin graphic novels. They are still works of art many decades later.)

B006PGL7OQ|3.0|Curtis (Michael Shannon) is a construction foreman living in a rural Ohio town with his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and life is good.  They do have a 6 or 7 year old daughter who is deaf which creates challenges, but they seem able to cope and they are happy.  Then Curtis begins having horrible nightmares about a coming apocalypse.  At first he tries to ignore it, although sometimes even the physical effects persist.  While his wife and fellow workers notice differences in his behavior, Curtis brushes it off before eventually getting help.  His mother (Kathy Baker) was institutionalized years earlier for schizophrenia, so he believes he may also be a victim.<br /><br />The pressure of the delusions causes him to focus on expanding an old storm cellar as he foresees the coming storm.  As Curtis sinks deeper and deeper into what most believe is mental illness, Shannon's performance is remarkable and believable reminding me of another movie from 2011 involving another form of psychosis, \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" with Elizabeth Olsen.  The year also gave us a couple other movies in terms of similar theme.  For unusual sci-fi with strange behavior check out \\"Melancholia\\" and \\"Another Earth.\\"<br /><br />Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the movie does seem to take an awfully long time to get from point A to B, which sometimes adds to the suspense but sometimes is just confounding.  Jessica Chastain as Curtis' loving and steadfast wife is another performance in what has become a remarkable career.  The controversial ending may leave some satisfied, other will be left hanging.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is truly excellent.  The 1080p transfer is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is perfectly clear from beginning to end.  The colors are crisp and properly saturated.  The audio is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and is exemplary.  Quiet moments are enhanced by external sounds.  The storms both real and imagined truly thunder.
8866130109|5.0|This little book is great for jotting down ideas and being creative! Moleskine is already well known for having high quality products, but I had never purchased a notebook from them before. I love Lego Products and I just had to buy it. The green flat piece is a creative addition to the notebook and gives it originality. With the flat piece you could pretty much cover the whole front of the book in Lego flat pieces to give it a special look. I will definitely buy the notebook again once I fill these pages up.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This is a very fun game especially if you are a fan of the other angry birds games, the new birds are cool as well as the orbiting thing but its what you'd expect from any other angry birds. I would still recommend buying but don't expect anything new Ps they also don't give you too many levels to start with
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games books! I don't know why they say it is for \\"young\\" people- I'm almost 40 and I thought it was awesome! All my friends are reading it too... we are obsessed with the Hunger Game books.

B00003CXTG|4.0|This is one of those films whose subject matter removes it from coldly analytic appraisal for most for whom the event is still a living memory. I remember the Sunday in which the news on radio broke through the typical fare of football and, I remember the voice of FDR in the Congress asking for the declaration of War (a device we have not used in the more than 70 years since). Watching the last scenes of the film, Jimmy Doolittle's Raid, reminds me of the day in 1944 or 1945, when I took my 'kid' sister to one of NYC's Movie Palaces, The Roxy, to see \\"Purple Heart\\", on screen (and, on stage, Louis Armstrong and the band he fronted in the 30's and early 40's and Ella Fitzgerald, still in the first decade of her long career.). Purple Heart was a film that fit the bill perfectly for a nation which was striving for victory in two wars, part of the greatest military conflagration in World History (to this date). It told (the fictional) story of some of Doolittle's fliers being tried before a Japanese count.<br />So, I do agree that the love story is dispensable, that there was an absence of the kind of  star power, that Spencer Tracy, Robert Montgomery, John Wayne, Robert Taylor, and many others, lent to films of the war during the war. Still and all, the film struck a chord and revitalized never forgotten memories. That was a war in which  more of our people died than in the several wars since combined. The War in which the fathers (and some of the mothers) of the Baby Boom generation fought or waited desperately at home hoping never to get that telegram from the Government telling them of a death in the family. The War in which the United States was forced to become The Power in the World, a role for which it had so little taste.<br />Now I can't disentangle the reality from the memory nor treat this film as if it was my only experience of the story it tells. About all I can say is that it did serve to tap those memories and provide viewer satisfaction in seeing the story told once again for a younger generation.
0345803485|5.0|I definitely took me off guard at first but once i got into reading it i couldn't stop. It's very romantic in a twisted kind of way but very addicting and made me never want to put it down. Yes it is alot of sex but there's the romantic aspect of the book that makes you want more.
0345803485|2.0|So I read a headline about this book stating it was the adult twilight and a best seller. I figured I would give it a shot and was confused how a book could use f*** over 100 times and be compared to twilight. Spoiler the second book ran up a tab of around 175 times. My main issue besides the fact that it repeats itself a LOT is I didn't find the guy at all desirable. Hot maybe which I only say because she used it in every paragraph but so controlling and abusive. If I started seeing a guy like this the only document I would be signing is a restraining order. Not a favorite of mine....
B0045EA1P6|4.0|Aim and Ignite is good album overall but isn't super upbeat.  I prefer the Some Nights album to this one because it the beat is a little faster.  Overall it is FUN!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|super fun. don't normally get addicted to phone games, but this one got me hooked. so creative and it makes you think. love it!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This album is upbeat and a great album to listen to while working out.  I have been listening to it all week and I still haven't gotten tired of it.  I recommend Fun. and this album in general.  There are a lot of good songs so it is worth it to buy the entire album.
0439023521|5.0|I thought the book The Hunger Games was a great read.  I became hooked as soon as I opened the paper back.  The first couple of chapters were slow I htought, but once I got through them, I could not put it down.  I suggest this book for teenagers and adults of all ages.
B0016J81B4|4.0|Very comfortable shoes, however, they have worn holes in several pairs of socks while wearing them.  I work at a restaurant and am on my feet usually 8+ hours in a shift.  Like I said, the shoes are very comfy, but the little bumps inside have worn through the socks in a shift.

However i received the video and it was in another language! and not even made from summit. It was awful and when I contacted the seller to complain and get my refund i was never contacted back. It has been 2 months now and still no reply!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are easy and fun in 101-in-one app. My son is 6 and it keeps him busy for at least 30 min at a time. He is able to try different games without opening and closing apps. The ad's are annoying and they appear very often. Since the app is free it is not that bad.
B00756GKBA|5.0|This audio disc is yet another success of the Queen B. Madonna!<br /><br />Can't stop listening to this disc over and over again.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a fun game but before you know it time has flown by. It makes you think and is frustrating at times and then when you figure it out you can't believe you did'nt see it the first time.
B000IJ79V6|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite superman!  This is the movie where Lois finds out who SuperMan really is and realizes that she loved Clark all along.<br />We Loved all the extras in this re-release, WB has compiled an impressive collection of rarely seen material. There is a commentary by the producers, a 1981 'making of' special hosted by Chris Reeve, 8 Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons plus a retrospective, deleted scenes, and perhaps the most eclectic...the 'Superman 50th Anniversary' TV Special.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! When I looked at the comments page I saw many supportive reviews, but I am disappointed at how many peope dislike this series. Oh well, everybody has their opinions.
0307463745|4.0|Executive summary:<br />Don't be dogmatic about the advices provided.<br />Approach it more like<br /> - In the area XXX, we as the authors think the usual problems in today businesses are YYY<br /> - Isn't that maybe your case too?<br /> - For us, the approach ZZZ worked to get rid of the problems<br /> - Do you think it could work for you too?<br /> - If not, why and what could?<br />IMHO, use it like this and you will benefit greatly from it.<br /><br />In detail:<br />My motivation for buying this book was that I saw that the productivity of the company I work for was really low; resulting in poor quality and repeatedly delayed product. The company is basically a start-up (no matter how many employees or how big budget it has), so as part of my elaboration of the topic, I also checked the state-of-the art books that are concerned with this topic, yet are not some \\"silver bullets\\" or pure theory books.<br /><br />The Rework book was mentioned in many places as one of the books that could be really interesting for me.<br /><br />Before I bought it, I had gone through the reviews and had seen many of them describing it as over-simplifying, too-short, and not too useful in actual business, yet others had described it as very useful and perfect for today's businesses.<br /><br />After reading it, the best word that would describe it for me is provoking. One may think that the advices provided are really a bit over-simplified and not possible to apply for his kind of business. However, for me personally it is more important that this book can bring you to seeing the problems your company has in the described areas more clearly, and also understanding their roots. If you use the advices offered is then up to your judgment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this is amazing. these book capture your heart and makes it impossible to put down! ive reread the series about five times and i kno what happens, yet im still shock! by the ending of the third book you'd be crying your eyeballs out
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app. its nice to play when I'm bored. I like having to earn points to get other games. its easy to play on my kindle fire.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This movie was my first Anime movie, and I watched it back in 1987 on VHS tape then.  I must say it blew me away!  It is extremely well done and the story is very good as well.  When this movie came out on DVD, I purchased it right away.  The other reviews seem to have done an good job of breaking down the essentials of the movie, and in my humble opinion, it is a must OWN for any one who claims to be an Anime fan!  It really is that good.

B004GYY714|5.0|This product is great!  I use it all the time at the gym.  It's a great free alternative for music, sports, and more.
0553386794|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my good friend. I can't thank her enough as I haven't enjoyed a book as much as this one is a long time. She did mention it was violent, but I tried it anyway, and indeed, it is very violent in parts, but rising out of the ashes are some really great characters, plots and stories. This is a sink your teeth into book. Get out the wine and cheese, read by the light of the candle and relish the battles and the journeys of brave men, women, cowards and children and behold who will take the kingdom!<br /><br />There are some evil characters, but do you remember stories of kings of the past of our world? Crazy kings, and power hungry lords abound in history. Raping and pillaging was a real thing. I must admit, I skimmed at times at the rape scenes as I don't need those rattling around in my head, but other events stand out in this book, the mystery, the loyalty, the cunning and action, the direwolf and the creatures who live beyond the wall.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book is a telling of a character involved in the story. Each chapter revealed something startling and most books cannot accomplish that. I enjoyed this book and I am glad to to have the opportunity and look forward to the many other books of the series to see what happens. I think the author did a miraculous job of creating this rich and fearsome world. I do admit, when I see a name above a new chapter, some names tend to make me cringe and some gladden my heart to discover what will happen next to that character. Many characters are so evil and power hungry, but others are driven by loyalty and love. I enjoyed the descriptions and the atmosphere throughout the entire novel.<br /><br />If things like Wildings, Valyrian Steel, Winterfell, direwolves, Night's Watch, Shadow Tower, Casterly Rock and Mole's town stir an interest in your soul, you should decide for yourself if you'd care to venture into the land of Ice and Fire.
B003Y5H5B0|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.<br /><br />For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.<br /><br />The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.<br /><br />While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.<br /><br />No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.<br /><br />Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.<br /><br />Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by. At this point, America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days, that a mediocre exercise such as this, is hailed as a comic masterpiece!ith a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.<br /><br />Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book 1 ended on a cliffhanger so I moved straight onto book 2. Being stalked by an ex submissive, Grey can't figure out if she is after him or Ana.  To be safe he drives Ana crazy about security and safety.  Even though their relationship has changed he still can't help but control things.<br /><br />Ana is still struggling to figure out if she can be \\"enough\\" for Christian. Since she cannot accept all of his kinky wishes she is struggling with \\"why her\\".  The crazy ex-sub doesn't help matters since she looks a lot like Ana.<br /><br />Ana has also started a new job and has a boss who is definitely crossing the boundaries of sexual harassment. Between trying to fend off her boss, and tame her control freak of a boyfriend Ana has her hands full and doesn't need crazy ex's running around destroying her property.<br /><br />I liked this book because I felt there was more substance to it, the first one was good but this one had more meat.  You really get to know Christian a lot better in this book and how he thinks, you also see Ana's struggle to figure out how she can love this man who is so broken and yet still maintain her sense of self.<br /><br />These books are by no means great literature but they are fun. Of course this one ended on a cliff hanger as well so of course I will be downloading book three.<br /><br />Not as hardcore in the kink department as the first book, but there is still plenty to go around.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. I usually only play it while waiting around. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants a good card game on the go.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is a fun game. It has a good theme, graphics, music and controls. One of the best tower defense games I have ever played.
B003NX75B8|5.0|Despite critics' complaints about the controversy of the book, I think any educated person with an open mind would get a lot from this novel. While I am one of John Green's minion nerdfighters, I also read all of his books before I knew about the hype surrounding them. It wasn't until I saw The Fault in our Stars in Entertainment Weekly that I knew John Green was such an insane fandom.<br /><br />Things to look forward to:<br />- intelligent humor from the great minds of the co-authors<br />- themes from Green's Will Grayson about what love really is<br />- the other Will Grayson makes you feel better about yourself (hey, you have to take everything into account)<br />- TINY COOPER IS HILLARIOUS.<br />- a musical!<br />- not useless romance scenes but some you can actually learn from<br />- constant plot twists -- the ending will NOT dissapoint you<br /><br />A great thing about this book is that there were gay characters without it being a gay book. My only criticism is minor, and is that I found the first Will Grayson's relationship issues to be sort of reminiscent of Katniss and Peeta's in that I simply never understood why they liked each other so much.<br /><br />I recommend the audio version if possible! Have a good time reading.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The orchestra is recorded perfectly to my ears.  Sierra Boggess is heavenly, and Ramin and Hadley just give me shivers too.  I'd never fallen in love with Andrew's music like this before, but hearing the musicians in the orchestra and onstage produce such brilliant sound.  It's a monument to Cameron's excellence.<br />My wife was out of town last week; I listened to this performance for several hours every day.  Constantly discovering new magic from all the players.<br />Congratulations, Sierra; call me when you're in Oregon!<br /><br />Fred R.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|I have to agree with nearly all of the one-star reviews. The plot reminded me of the Lassie series which were very entertaining.  Lassie is a super-dog much like Joey is a super-horse.  They each overcome terrible circumstances, avoid death, and eventually are reunited at home with their owners/guardians, in an emotional and heart-warming way. The filming was top-notch as one would expect from Spielberg, but the plot was on the lightweight side; the acting as far as it went was professional but could not save this movie. Also the overriding narration was very distracting and really defeated both the story and the acting where this technique was employed. It struck me that the director must have felt it was necessary to bolster a weak plot and perhaps keep the viewer awake during this very long, slow show. The movie also plays heavily on stereotypes which became a little boring, except for the scene near the end when a German soldier saw the plight of Joey entangled in the barbed wire and the inability of the British soldier to free Joey. The German comes out of his trench with a wire cutter, and his comrades watching all of this, throw out more wire cutters to facilitate getting Joey free. So, in my opinion, this movie had its moments, but overall, it was just one star.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Finished this series in three days. I must say that in the beginning (book 1), I did not have a personal/emotional connection to these characters. However, by the end of book 3, I was crying in places - in sadness and in joy. Christian becomes increasingly developed as you read through the series. It is sad what he has to go through (prior to meeting Ana) in order to find happiness with someone and most importantly with himself.<br /><br />This is essentially a love story with a little spice and quite frankly the love scenes take a back-burner to what is really going on in the story. As I asserted in book 1, it is two people falling in love and redefining who they are by these new parameters.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the little blurbs Ms. James put in at the end of their first meeting and thei \\"coincidental\\" meeting at Clayton's. I would love to read more from Christian's point of view.
B006X08FDA|5.0|I must admit to being a fan of the Carolina Chocolate Drops.  We've seen them twice in person, and I own all their CDs.  This is their latest CD, and is wonderful.  It includes the newer members of the group.  What can I say?  Live performance is best, but the CD is well worth it!
0307891372|5.0|This is a very useful and helpful guide for skyrim. I highly reccommend it as skimming through it can save alot of time from having to go back and search for things you may miss.
1423140591|2.0|I hate it when people complain about an author's older works being better, but this once I have that kind of stance on this particular book.<br /><br />Let me defend myself -- I read The Lost Hero, the entire Percy Jackson series (I even have The Last Olympian signed by Riordan), and I started the Kane Chronicles today and I love it! I am not disregarding Riordan's creativity, which is part of the reason I began to write seriously myself. Rick has a very good voice and it's hard to put his books down. His utility of characterization and how it connects with the plot makes him one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />But I don't think he quite used those skills in this installment of the series.<br /><br />I thought I would be excited about Percy being a main character again, but I realized that from the outside Percy really is not that interesting. Being in his brain (having a first person point of view) is what I loved about his character. His thoguhts were just funny, and Riordan made characters very relatable using the technique.<br /><br />In fact, I'm going to talk about the point of view in general for a moment because I feel it is a big part of the issue. I'm totally cool with switching from three different characters; I understand it was a creative decision on his part to keep readers interested, knowing that he was moving on. But this omniscient nonsense does not demonstrate Riordan's talent in any way. It was fine during The Lost Hero, I think because I didn't know the characters, thus I didn't notice. But knowing Percy, I honestly didn't care as much about his decisions because I wasn't being entertained by his character's logic.<br /><br />Yes, it was be cheesy and vaguely fan fiction-ish to follow three characters all using first person, so I have no solution, but then again I am not writing these books.<br /><br />These are very weird books that bring you into an entire new world. And frankly, introducing us to it using third person is something only JK Rowling can get away with. (Not trying to compare the books, just the authors!)Rowling can get away with. (Not trying to compare the books, just the authors!)
0440419514|5.0|Love this book!<br />Very easy to read, and very compelling for every age. It's a book for all the family not just for children!<br />I had never read it before and i love it! I will read it to my nephews. Very recommended reading!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game a lot--it's the best solitaire app out there...but I wish they'd offer an upgrade to a paid ad-free version. The &quot;commercial&quot; that hijacks your screen between games is pretty annoying.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|I like how simple it is to use.  There are no confusing menus and it works smoothly.  The text is to sensitive when rotating and that's my only complaint.
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One was well written, engaging, and more fun than I have had with a book in a long time.  I'd love to know how things work out for this world.
B004LROUNG|4.0|For anyone out there like me who thought that his books had taken a turn in the wrong direction and just weren't good anymore, he makes a great comeback with this one. The Litigators is a fantastic and quick read. While certainly not his best and not as intriguing as The Client and other of his earlier works, this is definitely a step in the right direction and still a fun read nonetheless.
B006NFKUF6|3.0|Really weird I got the full but it said I didn't really CONFUSING I am not kidding don't get it

B0028RXXE8|5.0|The delivery of this video was in perfect condition. I received the product within 10 days without any complication.  I have absolutely no hesitation in buying other items in future as well. If you wish to know about ROME-- excellently done and well researched but discretion required if you want to view with children aside.

B007N5YIUS|1.0|I hate the fact that this app costs cash! The other Angry Bird apps cost nothing but this crap is pooped up! Amazon is dumb cuz it doesn't have Temple run, a free kindle compatible angry birds space, and etc. Please say this is helpful cuz amazon stinks! and if a amazon staff worker sees this, tell your fluping boss to please get temple run, a free angry birds that is compatible with kindle fire, and the smosh shut up app
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Fun game with lot of combinations.  I have been addicted to triple town which has a somwhat similar idea of combing things to create new stuff. Makes for a lot of interesting discovery.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I could not put this book down!! I read all 3 books over the weekend. I found myself intrigued by Ana and Christian's relationship. Christian has a lot of issues and he is a control freak, but Ana really balances him out. I agree with other reviewers- the author used the same sayings over and over throughout the book...it gets a little old.They have a lot of sex!! I wish she could have just had the setting of the book in England since there were some sayings in that we just don't use here in the US. Overall great book and series!!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The cover is everything I wanted, light, easy to use and the stand is perfect for reading during long sessions.  The Fire is a little bit heavier than the Touch so it is nice to have the stand.  Well worth the money.  It will last a long time and provides plenty of protection from surface scratching.
B00466HNHM|3.0|Please accurately describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Aspect ratio is about 1.85:1, which completely filled my widescreen LCD.<br />Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which was satisfactory, but nothing too special.<br />The movie lasted two hours an five minutes.<br /><br />The video quality was disappointing.  Half the time it looked like a DVD.  Other times it looked high-def, but not real good high-def.  I rate it from 8.0 to 9.0 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />I thought it was a pretty good movie, and I am not a Whitney fan.
0345456343|5.0|This books puts the movies to shame. Anne Rice is an amazing author and this book should be in everyone's collection.
1596432594|5.0|Delivered fast and the graphical novel is great. I actually meet the author in one of the talks at my university. The guy is not your average English major, he graduated in Physics, Nuclear Physics I believe. And you can see that on the interesting way he explains QED.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The unlock mechanism for new games is cool.  It is a nice reward as you play through and more fun then if they all started.out available.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|Recieved immediately and in excellent packaging.  Not my kind of movie.  Bought it because we like Jim Caviezel knowing we might not enjoy it.  Was interesting enough to keep us watching to the end.  Probably well done if your like this kind of movie.  If sci-fi is your interest you will probably like it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Overall it is a pretty fun game. I like almost all of the story type games but this one the bakery one and the petshop one are my favorites. Feel free to add me aliey17
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  I have my 83 yr old mom playing it too and she loves it.  It is very challenging and she loves keeping her mind active and alert.  This game will make you think!
0439023521|4.0|I have just finished the first book. Even though they are very popular and have a movie. I have managed to be spoiler free. Katniss is a strong likeable hero. She is manages to mix being strong,caring and distant with being vulnerable and caring. I loved the relationship between Katniss and her sister and also between Katniss and Rue. The book is great with an intriguing world. I like when Katniss is in District 12 or thinking about that. Those are rootable moments for me. I like self depricating/humorous characters. Pacey Witter is my favorite example of that. Twilight's Jacob has it, Damon from Vampire Dairies but for some reason it's not endearing with Peeta. I love love romance. I read alot for love stories but this was blah to me. I am a romance nut but cringed at the peeta/katniss stuff. Also I like to read books for escapism, for good guys to win, for everyone to survive and romance and happily ever after. I get the feeling that I won't like how the series goes. That I won't get the ending I hope for and am hesistant to continue the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this was just another hyped up trend, I thought it was going to be really boring...but IT WASN'T. I was told to read the book before I watch the movie. I finished this book in 2 days.  I literally brought this book to bed with me. Found myself reading at 2:30am, had to FORCE myself to put the book down and go to sleep! I love Collins style of writing also. Her writing mimics a great show/movie. The chapters are amazingly written and developed then right at the end of the chapter Collins drop a huge dramatic \\"scene\\" that pulls the reader in and forces the reader to keep reading!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|If I had to read Anastasia and Christian referring to each other as Mr. Grey and Mrs. Grey one more time, I likely would have put my head through a wall. Seriously!?!?! Are we suppose to find that romantic or sweet?? It's completely unrealistic and incredibly nauseating, along with the rest of this series.<br /><br />There was way too much repetition of phrases and actions throughout the series (twitching palms, biting lip, copper hair,...). This quickly became extremely obvious and very annoying.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this whole series.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|This has to be almost as bad as \\"Clash of the Titans\\". A real snooze fest especially in the middle. You can tell that everything is fake. The only reason to watch this movie is for the hunky guys. I enjoyed all the actors much more in other movies or shows (The Tudors). Don't waste your money. I had a free promo code at Redbox otherwise I would be really angry.
B006UG909U|5.0|Oh, good morning.  How long was I out for?  I answered an ad in the newspaper yesterday about some sort of cryogenic freezing procedure.  I asked for them to wake me up when David Lee Roth re-joined Van Halen and made a new album.  How long did it take?  Is it still 1985?  Is it kind of warm in here, or is it just me?  What are these - little speakers or something?  And you want me to put them IN my ears??  How does that little cigarette lighter play music - mini discs?<br />Tattoo?  This sounds enormous!  What's a \\"tramp stamp?\\"  Michael Anthony's backing vocals aren't quite what they used to be... wait, what?  Eddie Van Halen's son is on bass now?  Ha - good one.<br />She's the Woman - I know this song!  My friend Scott ordered a cassette with their demo tape on it a couple of years ago out of the back of Creem.  Did Creem give this album a good review?  Circus?  Hit Parader?  Why are you looking at me like that?  This sounds a little slower than the version I have, and David Lee Roth doesn't seem to be able to hit the high notes.  They replaced that part that they stole for Mean Street, too.<br />You and Your Blues - Yep, it's a Van Halen song.  What's the big deal?  Every year or so, a new Van Halen album comes out.  So far, I'd say this album is better than Diver Down but maybe not quite as good as Fair Warning.<br />China Town - Tubular!  I was worried with 1984 (which came out last year) that they were going to move into Keyboard Land like Kajagoogoo or Flock of Seagulls or all of those other bands that are popular now.  It can't be later than 1989 considering how fast Alex Van Halen is playing these drums.  This song is up there with Hot for Teacher or Loss of Control.  Where's the back of that television?  Is the President black now?? I woke up to a futuristic, post-racial utopia!  Radical!<br />Blood and Fire - kind of more subdued than the other songs so far, but it's good.  All of these songs are good - I don't know how I'd feel if I wasn't cryogenicallyfrozen and had to actually wait 5 years or so for this album to came out, but I expect people would have unrealistic expectations if that was the case.<br />Bullethead - is this song about traffic?  Looking out the window here, I do see a lot more cars than what I'm used to.  Gas is $4 a gallon??  Again, is it warmer out than it's supposed to be?  I'm sure there's no relation between people using gas and it being hot outside.<br />As Is - Wow, another fast one!  Eddie's guitar sounds like it's tuned really low - how does he do that?  This album sounds more like a sequel to Fair Warning than a sequel to 1984.  Wasn't Van Halen going to get Patty Smythe from Scandal to sing for them?  What?  Sammy Hagar?  The \\"I Can't Drive 55\\" guy??  How did THAT work out?<br />Honeybabysweetiedoll - That doesn't sound like something Michael Anthony would play... that really is Eddie's son??  Is everyone riding on hoverboards now?  Did Israel and Palestine sort out their differences?  This song really cooks, but what is a \\"soccer mom\\"?<br />The Trouble With Never - Wow, so it has to be 30 years into the future!  This puts things in a different context.  Roth's pillow talk in this song is kind of creepy now, but whatever.  Still a solid jam.  Did he just say \\"text me, baby\\"?  What does that mean?<br />Outta Space?  This sounds like Let's Get Rockin' from their demo.  The words are different for some reason.  What on earth is a face/book/page?  What year is it anyway?  What are those weird devices that people are talking into and using to take pictures of - is everyone James Bond now?<br />Stay Frosty - Oh, it's a continuation to Ice Cream Man.  He might be an old man, but David Lee Roth's wit is as sharp as ever.  \\"Trust in Allah, but tie up your camel\\"?  Did America convert to Islam?  What's that?  The World Trade Center?  No way!  What happened?<br />Big River/Beats Workin' - It's Big Trouble/Put Out the Lights from their demo tape.  It's pretty cool to have a good copy of these songs now.  The version I have is a tape copy of a copy of a copy.  Now that it's the future, is it easier to get your hands on rare/hard to find songs?  Hold on - this little thing can hold how many songs?? And I can get them all for FREE?  Oh hey, did George Lucas ever make the prequels to Star Wars?  He did??  They're really good, right?
1582701709|5.0|I recommend this book with the notion that it will not work if you do not put in a lot of work.  It taught me to change my attitude, actions, and eventually my entire life from basic principles that have been here since the beginning of time!  However, an unwilling heart will not grasp the most simplest concept of this book.  So proceed with caution before buying.

0439023513|5.0|I keep wondering who is leaving all these negative reviews for Mockingjay. Who is doing it?<br /><br />The obvious answer is Hipsters!<br /><br />They probably 'discovered' book 1 before it became popular. Those over age 15 thought they were 'ironic' for reading this 'new' 'undiscovered' kids book. Thinking to themselves, \\"HA!  I'm over 15 and reading an obscure kids book.\\"<br /><br />Of course then book 2 came out and the series became popular. Then book three comes out and this series is now 'mainstream'. Then the worst thing happens that could ever happen to a hipster. The series is mainstream AND it is going to become a movie!<br /><br />So the Hipsters probably spent a year convincing everyone they loved the books before they became 'mainstream'. But after a year of convincing, they have to maintain their hardcore hipster edge. So what do they do? You got it.<br /><br />Come on Amazon and lament about how bad book three is.<br /><br />Listen hipsters, we're sorry we crashed your obscure and ironic party, but that is no reason to now lament on book three and leave negative reviews.<br /><br />Don't worry, we'll believe you, that you liked these books before they became 'mainstream'. No need to vomit your Starbucks onto your Mylie Cyrus scarf out of total disgust.
0345803485|1.0|Ok so this is my very first review on Amazon. After reading all 3 books (yes I read all 3 despite my bad review), I felt compelled to explain my issues.<br /><br />First off, I also read every Twilight book. However, I readily admit they are horrible in terms of literary quality. I actually at one point tried to re-read the first Twilight book and could not get through it the second time because it was just so much more blatanly obvious how bad the writing is, and how extremely corny and nauseating the dialogue was between the two main characters.<br /><br />What amazes me is how completely similar my experience was with Fifty Shades. Maybe it shouldn't shock me so much because it is based on Twilight after all, but I was stunned by how it was just as badly written (if not worse). It was especially disappointing after hearing so much about the books and how they were flying off shelves.<br /><br />Just like Bella, Anastasia is a complete pushover who lets her boyfriend/husband basically control her entire life. I literally at certain points found myself screaming at her to punch Christian in the face for his horrible treatment of her. He's extremely manipulative and manages to turn any argument around to somehow end up with Ana feeling sorry for him. Just like Twilight, the dialogue and the hero's treatment of the heroine are completely frustrating and nauseating. But hey if you're into that...<br /><br />As for the \\"erotica\\" --- the sex scenes were extremely tame. This is by no means erotica. It is softcore Skinemax, where the heroine can't even use the word vagina to describe her nether regions. It's merely \\"down there.\\" I suppose I can see the appeal for women who never read anything even mildly racy, but if you're looking for something graphic and hot, this is not it.<br /><br />I can't really explain why, if I had such issues with the books, I was able to get through all 3, or why I wanted to. I suppose I was intrigued to see how the story ended.  Similar to Twilight, I recognized while reading how bad the books were, but there was something about the story that kept me interested enough to want to know the ending. With that in mind, I highly doubt I'll ever be able to pick these books up again and be able to resist the urge to completely lose my lunch.<br /><br />And if I never see the words \\"inner goddess\\" for the rest of my life, it will be too soon...
B005EGXTEE|4.0|This isn't the best written story I have read, Katniss is not a particularly sympathetic / relatable main character, and yet I could not put this book down. The Hunger Games has a way of getting into your head, it is an example of some very clever story telling that explores some very dark themes, and despite not being able to fully connect with the main character, you can still admire her skills and determination.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice concept. good graphics. different from the run of the mill offerings for games. uniquely calming. nice progressions between levels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app very up to date weather forecast. I enjoy the other city and state forecast as well in case I have to travel or plan a event according too the weather. like I said before great app and the best part it is free.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|So far I am really pleased with EverNote. One feature I like is the ability to automatically send a Note from Shazam so that I can easily keel track of songs I will want to maybe purchase at a later time.<br /><br />Plus, having this product on my Android Phone, IPad, and Kindle Fire all syncranized is also great.<br /><br />One thing I 'd love to see is the ability to save/share notes from Kindle Books. I can bookmark pages now,  but it would be so much better if I could share notes with EverNote so I could categorize the notes for easier future reference.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I remember this movie scaring the living wits out of me as a child of the 80's and it's still kinda spooky as an adult.  A very unique movie I would reccomend, and I have played for my niece (9) and she loves it too.  {insert scary deep voice saying dorothy gale} Still can't believe Disney made this!  Fast delivery, great quality dvd.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|OK I am a James L Burke fan and since he is between books, I tried, on a lark, Michael C. and before I could say Harry Bosch, I had read 10 books. This being one. Burke's Robicheaux( [...]) is a dark character with a violent temper and a 12 step alcoholic. Bosch is a dedicated detective and brilliant, feels for the vic and his methodolgy deserves study, although fiction. All of my M. C. purchases have been for kindle, although I prefer paper, the convenience takes controlled restraint. Bosch's character is very thrilling and overwhelms any of the TV detectives. You will find very few, if any, errors in the plots and they advance in a manner I do not predict. Read them if you like mystery and a modern Sherlock Holmes. Well done Mr. Connelly. I wish I had discovered your work 10 yrs ago.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Ok I read the bad reviews and just figured there are a lot of Metallica haters.  Having been a fan of them for nearly 20 years I figured they couldn't put out a bad album.  I also thought that something different could be good look at S&M for example.  I know that this is \\"Art\\" and tried my hardest to give it a fair shot.  I listen to pretty much anything and like nearly all types of music.  Now that being said is listened to about 30 seconds of track one and started contemplating jabbing a spoon through my ear into my brain to end it but somehow missed the spoon and hit the next track button.  It didn't get better from there after screaming and smacking my head multiple times on my keyboard I somehow hit next track.  This one started out ok so I though maybe the pain was over then the noise started again my vision blurred and the basic animal instincts kicked in and after much screaming (don't know if was me or Reed) passed I was able to hit stop.  Don't waste your time with this is my advice it is probably the biggest POS I've ever had the displeasure of putting myself through.  If you are into pain or bored may I suggest hand feeding alligators pig hearts, or slamming your head in your freezer door for three days straight, or spend the next six months individually pulling out arm hair; because any of these activities are less painful and more interesting then listening to this album.  Lars commented saying they wanted to do something different, well congratulations you did it now may I suggest that the next time the band needs different try taking up stamp collecting or chainsaw carving and not subject your fans to another abortion like this.  But you could take the gamble that track four gets better and maybe the rest of album is listenable if you do you are braver than I.

B00005O5CM|4.0|I say good fun since it is a comedy and its supposed to be fun and i imagine a great success since a sequel was produced! The critic i read found the film's solace centered around the star and the story not being much...and this is true it is a kind of stereotyped story but if you listen to the audiotracks it is laced with serious aspects to it. I do congratulate the makers on putting intelligent commentary with such distinguishing comments as 'experience''contrast''atmosphere''socratic method''self realisation'...i dont know the book but i pioked up on these themes while watching the film,and these are all things to look at when watching a film,and right after i watched it i clicked on elvis at amazon,it must be all that 60's type clothing and<br />interest in fashions,that i recall from all my elvis movies years ago,and we can watch this film as those,in terms of fashions and hairstyles,and how people are reinvented in this way,and look in vogue,like 'elle' in the film at the start,so there's much more to the film then meets the eye and the contrast between california and boston sights,and the changes in atmosphere. At the beginning of film the Reese character is interested in latching onto a politician and becoming a 'part' of him, a political wife,but he drops her and being a smart person,she goes to harvard what with her 4.0 gpa and there is much comment on the school system,and how she begins to not want to be part of something else but to value herself,and begins life and relationships from there,how she becomes a modern woman,or better person,and this is gone over in the commentary. The film works though since the drama and conversation is good and dialogue funny,and ideas are never present but realized through the characters and not as ideas...there is much legalese and the court scenes<br />well realized and realistic,and listen to the song at film's end. Reese elicits and gets our sympathy in this film,or the film fails,you have to bond with characters infilms or they dont work,perhaps what critic found in her being the whole show. Good minor characters are the hairdresser,and the small dog. Of course this great concern on self realization in modern life may make us wonder about the value of children in modern life,who are not surprising absent from this film not even pictured,we are too immersed in realizing ourselves which not only effect the character but the producers of this film,which is a realistic pastiche of our world.
B002C949KE|5.0|The first few chapters alone make it worth punching the book.  The look at social vs. market norms is a very interesting idea and is better presented than in other books (such as Drive by Dan Pink).  The book reads easy in a similar way to Freakonomics, but sometimes leaves you wondering for more specifics on a particular experiment.  However, I believe the book became more interesting because of the fact it wasn't an academic paper.  I look forward to exploring more of Dan Ariely's ideas, writing and Ted talks.
B005UBNKWO|1.0|No wonder they are so cheap!!!!!!<br />bought for 107<br />sold it on ebay for 150 lmfao.<br /><br />I was using a Phenom ii x4 820 overclocked at 3.750 ghz when I saw a 6 core. OOOOOO multi threaded applications went through my head. Man did this thing lack performance. I had it overclocked to 4.813Ghz and the old Phenom ii quads still blow this things socks off. Sold it on Ebay for a profit and went with the Phenom ii 980.<br /><br />So if you want real performance and don't want to build a new system and have your old amd parts. Just go with the newest 980 or 975 or if you can find a thuban 6 core phenom get that.<br /><br />But if you want new don't go with bulldozer these things suck and don't scale worth a crap when overclocked. Instead go with the 1155 core i5 or i7 those things clock to 4.7 4.9 and will blow your mind.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It follows a logical sequence of events and places you in caracter. You basically live Katniss and Peeta's experiences in the beginning of the uprising. Much more detailed than the movie.
B006PTZNQQ|5.0|I REALLY want this so badly! I love her rap and pop. If I was to choose only one, it would be pop. She kills it on this album! I'm not sure which songs are better than Starships. Yep, some songs on here are better than Starships! I've always wanted to hear the album version of Roman Holiday. Every single time I look to listen to it, it's just her on the Grammy's. If I was a critic, I would say, \\"BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!\\"

B0017OB12O|5.0|I had never seen this film. The picture and sound quality combined with the plot makes it a great movie.
1612130283|1.0|Shockingly poor on so many levels, this book reads like a poorly written Harlequin romance gone bad. I read about this highly anticipated book on Twitter (note to self: I should have known better), and downloaded it to see what all the fuss was about. The author clearly is relying on the shock value of S&M sex, and not character development or plot, to sell novels. The popular idiom 'sex sells' is being put to test and proving itself truthful.<br />Surely, a protagonist who's reaction to almost everything is 'crap!', 'double crap!', or, to add intrigue, 'holy crap!' - is one not worthy of our high esteem. It is ironical that Anastasia's favorite heroine ranks amongst literature's best: Tess of the d'Urbervilles - to mention this book within the pages of 50 Shades of Grey is sacrilegious.<br />I don't blame the writer for writing her own meal ticket - the proceeds will put her children through university, no doubt. But if you're looking for a good - albeit titillating - read, keep looking. Or alternatively switch on a reality television show - even that would be more worthwhile.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|So, everything has been said so I just wanted to say that mr Lucas indeed knows how to keep bleeding money out of the franchise.  Star Wars movies are a piece of art that just keep getting upgrades since its original release.  Now,  you had to put the infamous \\"NOOOOOO\\" that everyone complained and taged as being just \\"the single most ridiculous scene in the Star Wars history\\", dont you???.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I think anyone who is reading these reviews understands the film is going to create controversy by its non-traditional style of film making. That's fine with me, I don't mind if you hit that this review isn't helpful, because I strongly believe this is a masterpiece of American cinema. \\"The Tree of Life\\" is a story about how one family survives through grief and setbacks, told from the perspective of the eldest son. The film's cinematography is its greatest asset, the shots are like moving paintings and it's hard to turn away from the screen for fear you would miss one frame of this beautiful work. I recommend the film to people who want to see movies that are more artistic, and have a theme and message, rather than manufactured Hollywood formula. Nothing about this movie is formula. It's got a deep, resonating message that's worth the time and investment.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie are the performances by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. Both of them give convincing portrayals of the parents in the family. Pitt gives maybe his best performance of his career (other than Assassination of Jesse James by Coward Robert Ford) and Chastain should have been nominated for an Oscar in my opinion for her work in this movie.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|All i really need 2 say is the dvd that comes with this set (as well as the siamese dream set) is worth the $ in itself. I saw both these shows 20+ years ago and forgot just how explosive the band was live back then...you also get a bunch of cool unreleased versions and demos and the studio album remastered. But the d.v.d. In this set and the other set are the true jewels.
B0071WQ7WU|1.0|It sucks!  This is not the Shinedown that I know and love.  In their pursuit to sale albums, they have forgotten what made them who they are.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent. I especially liked the ending after reading all three books and the lives of Katniss, Peeta and Gale. Suzanne Collins did a great job with all 3 books.  The movie was good also.

0060873086|1.0|Crichton was an amazing writer, the world is worse for his passing.  Crichton's method of using a solid scientific understanding of technology and using that solid science throughout his books made him one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, Preston fails at his attempt.<br /><br />First of all, even if you buy the original premise of shrinking humans in a magnetic field (interesting!), the science behind this book falls apart very quickly.  Are the micro-humans shrinked by shrinking their atoms (meaning that they could not eat or breathe because their bodies would not be able to interface with normal size atoms and molecules)?  Or are the shrunk by some other means?<br /><br />The book never gets into the details, and there is even a paragraph in the middle of the book that comments about how the premise doesn't make sense, that they shouldn't even be able to breathe when shrunk, but they leave the reader with &quot;I don't know why it works&quot; as the answer.<br /><br />If you just want a romp like &quot;[[ASIN:B000065V42 Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]&quot; then you will like this book, but if you are looking for something like Crichton's classic approach to SF, you will be extremely disappointed.  I wish they had listed this book as a Preston book instead of Crichton, because that would keep expectations quite a bit lower...
B004LWZW8S|2.0|The movie looked like it would be pretty impressive when I saw the previews but this is the first movie that I can honestly say I would never have any desire to watch again. The story line had ups and downs. Some parts were pretty good while some parts left me thinking \\".......what?\\"<br /><br />Like everyone else said they combined the elements of a lot of other movies and jumbled them all together so much that I really didn't know what to think.<br /><br />Some of the fight scenes are pretty impressive but the actor roles could have been so much better. I know it's a movie but I can't imagine anyone using actors in their late 20s-early 30s to portray the gods, especially Zeus and Poseidon. Also along the \\"I know it's a movie but\\" lines. Making the titans look like human sized parkour practitioners fell very short of what I would like to see.
0060873027|4.0|PREMISE<br />A pharmaceutical company has learned how to shrink objects, machinery, and even people by orders of magnitude.  They shrink people for the purpose of exploring and collecting samples in a Hawaiian rain forest.  Greed gets in the way of ethics, requiring a cover up.<br /><br />CRITIQUE<br />The body of the novel was written by Richard Preston.  Crichton's introduction is crisp and brilliant.  The plot is pure Crichton and well constructed.  The premise is decades old, at least from Ray Cummings &#34;The Girl in the Golden Atom&#34; in the 1910s, and is NOT successfully updated.  Undoubtedly, Crichton would have &#34;spun&#34; it new, with real documented cutting-edge technology.  There is little character development---but that's tolerable in adventure/science fiction.  Much of the dialog is awkward or stilted---&#34;Micro&#34; could have used a little more polishing by Preston or an editor.  If &#34;Micro&#34; had been written by Crichton, most of the complaints would be valid--i.e., that it falls short of Crichton quality.  What if it had been written by another current established science-fiction writer?  Say, Douglas Preston? (Richard's brother) (I've read lotsa Douglas Preston, but no other Richard Preston).  The BEST of Douglas Preston is comparable to &#34;Micro&#34;.  If &#34;Micro&#34; had been published under any other author's name than &#34;Crichton&#34; most reviewers would give it 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />GENERAL<br />Micro doesn't have the feel of meticulous research of Crichton novels.  The best Crichton novels (Airframe, Jurassic Park, Prey, Andromeda Strain etc.) are utterly believable.  The &#34;worst&#34; (albeit still among the finest science fiction ever written, e.g. Timeline, State of Fear, Next, etc.) contain one or two far-fetched premises, requiring minimum &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; but everything else, no matter how fantastic, was clearly possible (or at least Crichton succeeded in presenting a convincing argument based on well documented phenomena).  Indeed, translating the fantastic but real world of science into &#34;ordinary English&#34; was Crichton's greatest skill.<br /><br />FLAWED SCIENCE<br />The fundamental premise is that the size of atoms can be reversibly shrank many orders of magnitude. The implications even if possible, are untenable---the shrunken humans would be unable to interact with the normal size world.  For example, they would suffocate within minutes because they would not be able to process ordinary size oxygen molecules.  They would have no sense of taste or smell.  Eyesight and hearing would be so greatly altered that their brains would need days or weeks just to learn to process and interpret the incoming information.<br /><br />Crichton/Preston would have been better off to have proposed some sort of Startrek transporter which could scale up or down objects by adding/deducing atoms.  He could even have cited real supportive evidence of plausibility.  Carefully designed-to-be-scaled-down mechanical devices could be scaled down by such technology, and would work.  Hypothetically, &#34;scaled down&#34; humans could have interacted with the world, and even could have survived for a short period of time under tightly controlled temperature and humidity conditions.  However, most biological system already operate on the molecular scale, and you can't scale-down most molecules by subtracting atoms. Hypothetically redundant whole cells could be deleted to reduce the size of organ systems and tissues probably by factor of two or three, but reduction beyond that would call for a &#34;total system redesign&#34; which would drastically alter body proportions, etc.  &#34;Reduced&#34; &#34;redesigned&#34; &#34;humans&#34; less than 5 or 6&#34; tall would probably resemble bipedal tail-less mice with flat faces.  Crichton/Preston's characters get &#34;the bends&#34;---but that is a plot device to create suspense, not a realistic assessment of the effects.<br /><br/>OBFUSCATION<br />Ignoring for a moment the hazards of &#34;shrinkage&#34;:  There are many reasons that there are no ½&#34; tall humans, nor any other kind of mammals, and darn few vertebrates that small.  Crichton/Preston was/were clearly fully aware of the phenomena, and &#34;pay lip service&#34;--meaning that characters mention the effects, even the inherent contradictions in the premise, but the characters do not realistically experience most of the effects.  For example: Because of the enormous increase in surface area relative to mass, tiny humans would die of the cold even at 70 or 80 degrees within a few minutes.  If the cold didn't get them, they'd be suffering from dehydration within a few minutes. So (although unstated in the novel), Crichton/Preston put them in a warm humid environment--but not one which would have been warm and humid enough.<br /><br />RATING<br />Compared to Crichton at his best, 3 stars; compared to &#34;typical&#34; science fiction, 5 stars.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.:  There are many reasons that there are no ½&#34; tall humans, nor any other kind of mammals, and darn few vertebrates that small.

B0014Z4ON4|2.0|Most of the criticisms of this movie have already been made in other reviews, but I thought I'd jump in real quick. The main problem with this movie is it gives the audience nothing to care about.<br /><br />I didn't care about Willie Scott. She seems to have been made intentionally repulsive and the result is I don't care what happens to her...I wish she'd just go away. The only part I liked with her was at the end when Indy tries to woo her; she yells at him and says she could never share in his adventurous, thrill-seeking lifestyle. \\"What a great twist for the end of this movie! It defies cliche, and it follows logically from what we've learned about her character throughout this entire film,\\" I thought...then she immediately kisses Indiana...for no other reason than she's a woman, he's a man, and these type of movies usually end with a kiss of some sort (it wouldn't do to have Indy kiss Short Round).<br /><br />I didn't care about Short Round. At the climax of his character arc he tells Indy, \\"you're my best friend!\\" Now, I assume this scene is supposed to be heart-warming because there's a little kid talking about friendship...and it could have been heart-warming! The problem is we never saw their relationship develop into a friendship. We only see them play cards once (while Willie Scott screams a lot like an idiot) and we're told that at some point before the movie happens Indy kinda saved him from a life on the streets and poverty. Just a couple scenes of them interacting like human beings would have made this final \\"friendship\\" moment more meaningful. Also, at one point Short Round tells an elephant, \\"you're my best friend\\"...kind of hard to take his friendship seriously after that.<br /><br />I didn't care about the villains. Their ultimate plan was some sort of vague threat that they'll topple all other religions and somehow institute worldwide worship of Kali Ma using magic rocks (they have three out of the five they need but they promise that they'll find the other two...somehow...). Because I don't know how they plan to do this I have no reason to take them seriously as a threat. Yes, they had child slaves, but the focus of the movie was shifted from this to the magic rocks. Really, the child slavery thing could have been an engaging conflict for Indy to tackle but, again, because this is an Indiana Jones movie they felt the need to focus on something supernatural...even if it was stupid and didn't make any sense.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't care about Indiana Jones. I really respect that this movie was trying to do something different, I have no problem with the fact they decided to go dark...but the darkness in this movie just isn't meaningful or even entertaining. Some of the best movies of all time were engaging and \\"dark,\\" and most of the time they did this by bringing characters through the most strenuous emotional turmoil. Fears were faced, choices made, and ultimately the events left an deep impact on the characters...for better or worse.<br /><br />Temple of Doom tries to be dark by having Indy literally go underground. It's hot, it's sweaty, and bad people do bad things. But Indy isn't really phased by it...he does turn evil at one point but he's under mind-control at the time so it makes no difference to his character. He just spends the whole movie acting like a weirdo and inexplicably falling for an incompetent bimbo. The fact that he wears a fedora and cracks a whip doesn't make him interesting.<br /><br />Anyway...I just felt this movie had WAY too many good reviews and I thought I'd give you my take. Long live Raiders and Last Crusade!

0062011847|4.0|British author Terry Pratchett can be an amazingly funny writer while at the same time being amazingly thought provoking. His best books are the ones that have a great balance of the two.  \\"Truth\\" being a great example and one of my favorite books.  The satire present in every book is used to skewer society and culture in both broad and small, sly ways. Just consider this quote from \\"Truth\\"<br /><br /> There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say: this glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half empty. The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What's up with this glass? Excuse me? Excuse me? This is my glass? I don't think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!<br /><br /> The books about the City Watch have always been among my favorites because you're mixing my fantasy and mystery genres again.  I do have to say that the Moist von Lipwig books \\"Going Postal\\" and \\"Making Money\\" rank right up there as well.  Ah, but the Watch...what a group of characters.  An odd collection of misfits that you can't help but love.  And Sam Vimes, what can you say, when your creator starts you drunk in the gutter, there really is no where to go but up.<br /><br />\\"Snuff\\" is a City Watch book and I have a feeling it might be the last one.  Maybe because of the author's health or maybe because he's just come to the end of the story.  Either way it feels like an ending.  While the humor is there, this comes down on the more the serious side.  There is alot of self reflection going on inside Sam Vimes.  At the beginning of the book Lady Sybil has dragged her husband Sam, kicking and screaming, off to the country for a vacation.  What's a city boy to do in the country.<br /><br />\\"The countryside! What's to amuse you in the countryside?  Do you know why it's called the countryside, Carrot?  Because there is bloody nothing there except damn trees, which we're supposed to make a fuss about, but really they're just stiff weeds! It's dull!  It's nothing but a long Sunday!\\"<br /><br /> That might be funnier to me than others because my dad had to plant two trees for evey one he cut down.  Of course Vimes finds all kinds of things going on in the countryside. Pratchett explores where the law starts and stops, personal resposibility, slavery, and justice verses law.  And it does it all in his own trademark style.<br /><br />\\"But of course, who would tell anything to a twerp like Flutter?  He wasn't even a henchman - you needed a certain amount of tactical thinking before you could properly hench - but henchmen hang about, and when they're with someone as thick as Flutter they don't always gaurd their tongues.\\"<br /><br /> I've read that some people feel this book isn't up there with Pratchett's best work.  I don't disagree, but it's still pretty damn good in my opinion.  If you've never read a City Watch book, don't start with \\"Snuff\\".  Start at the begining with \\"Guards! Guards!\\"  otherwise you're just not going to appreciate this book as much as you should.  You need the history and the growth to understand where Sam Vimes is now and the questions he's struggling with.  I also enjoyed having Sybil present as a main character in this book and having her and Sam truly interact as a couple.  Last, but not least I laughed my self silly at the \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" send up.  If you haven't read Terry Pratchett, start now.
B007M6P01O|5.0|I feel like season two was a bit of a roller coaster. Some ho-hum episodes that seemed to drag, and some very exciting episodes that left you exclaiming, \\"Holy S#$%!\\"....This was the latter for sure. The herd finally reaching the farm was pretty perfect, and the loss of even more of the group was as it should be. Two things really stood out for me....Andrea deserved to live. I feel like she, ore than anybody else at this point, has come to grips with the world as it currently is, and is keen on surviving it. Seeing her running through the forest, desperate, out of bullets, and exhausted after what seemed like pretty much a full day of running and gunning was pretty gripping for me personally. When it seemed she was about to die, and then Michonne saved her (at least we hope. :)), i was like, \\"F345ing ay. She definitely deserved to live.\\" and so i was glad she did. The other thing that stood out was Rick. In his efforts to lead everybody while trying to keep them happy, he lost sight of the fact that while people leaped at the opportunity to let him take risks, they then kicked back and scrutinized his every move, judging him....AS if they (Daryl and Herschel aside...and to a lesser extent Glenn) had actually done anything proactive themselves. So, when he tells them to take off if they think they can do better, but that if they stay, to understand this was no longer a democracy, i was like, \\"About f'in time. Good man!\\".<br />So, i cant wait for season three, which i assume will center around them living at the prison which was shown at the very end.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00756GKBA|5.0|I love this new Madonna album it makes me want to dance. I listen to this album while I am working out it keeps me moving the whole time. the only song I don't like is Free Falling it is not a dance type song. I love electronica club music so this album has some clubbish songs. My favorite songs are Gang Bang, Girl Gone Wild, Love Spent, Turn Up The Radio and addicted.These songs keep me moving all day at work. If you are a Madonna fan and likes clubbish dance music this album I will recommand it.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is an amazingly fun puzzle game for the Kindle Fire. Rather than blocks or bubbles, here you get physics puzzles with swinging candies on ropes.<br /><br />I loaded an image in the image set to go with this review - you can see it by cycling through the featured images at the top of this page. The image shows one of the starter puzzles, so you can see how the basics work. You have a little green pet named Om Nom. Om Nom lives on candy. You have to cut the ropes - with swipes of your finger - to get the candy into his mouth. The candy always falls down, just like in real life. So you have to figure out which ropes to cut, in which order, to have it fall into his mouth.<br /><br />Along the way you want to collect gold stars too. So the puzzle gets even trickier. You want to get the candy to swing in the proper arc to snag the gold stars.<br /><br />In this example, you would first cut the very top rope. This causes the candy to fall straight down a little, and get that first gold star. Next, you cut the rope on the right. Now the candy swings left, to get the second gold star. Finally, you cut the left-most rope, and the candy, now only attached by the bottom rope, swings through the final star and into little Om Nom's happy mouth.<br /><br />The puzzles of course get FAR harder than this along the road, with bubbles, cutting devices, and far more intricate items appearing in the mix. The game does a great job of building skills as you go, helping you learn what you need to do. And of course you can retry a level as many times as you have to until you figure it out.<br /><br />There are no \\"mysterious hidden wizards here\\" - it's all straightforward logic. This is a great skill for anybody to learn, whether they are 8 or 88!<br /><br />The only downside I see (besides its highly addictive nature) is that it's all about eating candy. Really? In our day of obesity? Surely they could have fed him moon rocks or something else. It didn't need to be reinforcing a constant diet of candy.<br /><br />But with that one minor caveat, I love the game, and highly recommend it for all ages.<br /><br />I bought this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.a constant diet of candy.<br /><br />But with that one minor caveat, I love the game, and highly recommend it for all ages.<br /><br />I bought this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.

B0074EIQUG|5.0|Although not as \\"swampy\\" as \\"Gris-Gris\\" this album captures the thickness, the humidity, the layers of New Orleans.  Every song is a mix of a catchy groove, with appropriate psychedelic coloring, and even traces of almost Trip-hop/Hip Hop beats, all under the great Doctor's growl.  Truly a musical gumbo that although made in 2012 feels at home in the any late 60s and early 70s playlist.  Also the fuzz and slide guitar work ain't bad either.

0071373586|5.0|I was introduced to Ries and Trout almost 25 years ago. I've read most of their books (probably all) and still believe this is the best - and one that's perennial in it's message (although admittedly, the featured cover is different than my ancient copy, so I may not be privy to the latest 'improvement' - wondering a bit how you can enhance this spot-on tomb, hope they didn't ruin it with editing). This isn't about manipulative sales, deceptive branding or the latest craze in culling suckers. Instead, it provides ideals that help you to see how to make what you say and do appeal to your customer in an honest and creative fashion. The story illustrations they provide make it so easy to begin to understand how it's done right. Long before others started suggesting inverting the long argued effective pyramid approach to selling (hi how are you, let me tell you about my product, sell sell, close close close close) these two put forth the idea of reaching prospects in a way that appealed to them by understanding the personal issues regarding a purchase. If you own a business or are thinking about starting one, read this book. It will make you smile as you witness results gleaned from their advice and experience. Don't worry about the publication date. While the stories may be old, the ideals are timeless.

0321647440|2.0|I would give this book a 4 star rating were it not so sloppily prepared, edited and presented.  What Peachpit has given us is like a cookbook where no one has actually tested the recipes to see if they work.  The text has incorrect instructions -- for example on page 57 it says \\"press T\\" when it should have said \\"press Control-T\\"  The CD I got was missing images that are to be used in exercises in the text.  For example, chapter 6 asks the reader to work with three photos of a Rhino to see what effect various adjustment sliders have.  But my CD did NOT have any Rhino images.  Kind of hard to learn when you don't have the materials needed to understand the author's instructions.

B001HN69AE|2.0|Here is the thing about this movie people. I am a HUGE dragon ball and Dragon ball z fan. Now if you watch this movie and you are a fan like me than you will be INSANELY disappointed and angry. They really take a great amazing anime and spit on it, with annoying hollywood influences and annoying actors. The acting is pretty cheesy and the fighting is mediocre, however the special FX was pretty cool. If you erase from your mind that there is no such thing as an anime then i give the movie a 0.5 out of 5, but as a movie inspired by the anime? well its certainly gets a 0 out of 5, the movie is pretty awful and i am happy it did not do well. The acting;again, is terrible and i felt like the Dragon Ball i loved so much was murdered right in front of my eyes. This movie shouldn't be $5 because there are great $5 movies out there, this movie \\"Dragon Ball Evolution\\" should be $1 or less. Honestly, if you are considering buying this movie DON'T DO IT! it's not worth your important time and money! if you want to see it badly find a way to watch it for free because the money you pay for this movie could be money spent on a beautiful bottle of root beer and chips. Really people...this movie is awful.
0061928356|4.0|I enjoyed reading Secret Daughter by Shilpi Somaya Gowda, and I thought it was a wonderful debut.<br /><br />The story centers around Asha, a baby adopted from an orphanage in India by her American mother and Indian American father, both doctors. Throughout the story the reader experiences Asha's growth from child to young woman.<br /><br />The author is gifted in the way she reveals each character's story. Kavita, the birth mother, risked everything to ensure that her daughter would survive, and despite her selflessness was haunted for the rest of her life for giving up her daughter. Somer, the adoptive mother, and overly critical of herself, centered her world around Asha, and yet, in many ways made herself an outsider in her own family. Krishnan, the adoptive father, struggled as an Indian American, trying to balance his passion for America and his love for his native homeland. Sarla, Asha's paternal grandmother, played an important role of bridging the two worlds. I learned a great deal from many of the minor characters as well, and each added to the story. I enjoyed the journey I shared with these characters, and their ultimate self-discovery.<br /><br />The reader learns what these characters are feeling and thinking, and discovers their past struggles and how their past decisions influenced their future. I felt many varied emotions for these characters at different points in the book. In the end, I learned that life is complicated; there are joys and hardships for everyone. All people shine at times and are less than proud of themselves at others. Those that endure have amazing stories to share and lessons to teach.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil the story by revealing too much, but I have to say that the weakest part of the book for me was Asha's final decision on whether to meet with her birth parents or not. Although in many ways a realistic choice, I wish the author would have gone in a different direction. The ending felt slightly flat to me.<br /><br/>The writing was excellent, the story was fast moving, the alternating perspectives was engaging and the glimpses of India, both spectacular and tragic, were inspiring. I respect the author and her creative abilities; it was her story to tell, and there is no doubt that I would read her future work. I would have given this book a 4 1/2 star review if I was able.
0307454568|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, but this, the third, was really a waste of time.  By page 400 I was burned out -- I just couldn't see myself plowing through the remaining 300 or so pages. I punted:  I followed the advice of several other reviewers here and began to read the synopsis of the book on Wikipedia.  But as I was reading, it occurred to me that I really didn't care anymore about the book or its characters.<br /><br />Hornet's Nest fails on a number of fronts, the most egregious of which are:<br /><br />1. For the first half of the book Salander is really a non-participant.  She's confined to a hospital bed.  In the earlier books, she was the fascinating character who kept you spellbound.  Here, in the pages I read, she was bedridden and thus, unexciting.<br /><br />2. There are far, far too many characters to remember -- most with unfamiliar Swedish names.  Scores of characters.  Then there are a number of government organizations and you can't remember who's connected to which organization.  The book assumes the reader is knowledgeable about Swedish laws and governance.  This adds to the confusion.<br /><br />3.  The first half of the book is mostly people moving about, mainly talking to each other.  Very little action.<br /><br />After 400 pages, I realized that I was lost and really didn't care any more about Lisbeth Salander or Superhero Blomkvist or anyone else, for that matter.  Life is too short to wade through any more of Larssen's maze of a book.  I enjoyed the earlier books and even the Swedish films based upon them.  But this one -- nah!  He shoulda stopped after the second book.

I just wish the highlights would show up when you reread a passage.
0743454537|2.0|I really liked the idea of this book, I liked the fact that it wasn't your typical \\"cancer story\\" book.  Most stories about a person with cancer, be it a child or adult, revolves entirely around that individual's personal struggles.  This book deals more with the effect a child's illness has on the rest of the family.  The characters surrounding the cancer patient are the most developed and most intriguing.  I liked the fact that we only \\"heard\\" from Kate at the very beginning and the very end.<br />The premise could not, however, redeem the fact that Picoult seems to struggle with the format of using several different narrators taking on a first person point of view.  The result comes off choppy, with scenes shifting all over the map.  It's less interesting and inventive than downright annoying.<br />Picoult attempts to portray Sara, the mother in the story, as a complex character who loves her children but feels so forced to protect the one child that she can't give 100% to her other kids. The intent is to portray Sara in such a way that you almost feel sorry for her, you can't hate her even if you disagree with her actions. At this, Picoult fails.  Sara is such a wretched mother to her other kids that the idea that she loves the other two at all becomes completely unbelievable.<br />The father is a poorly developed character who remains 2-dimensional throughout the book.<br />The brother, who could've been a very complex character, suffers from the same drawback as the father.  He has a lot of potentially to be a deeply affecting character but he just doesn't get there.<br />The love story between the lawyer and the guardian ad litem is sort of shoehorned into the story line.  It ends up more as a needless distraction than as a way to offer anything of value or import to the narrative.<br />The ending is perhaps the best part of the book.  I like the fact that she didn't take the ultra-predictable route, that she did twist it a little although not to the point where your neck snaps back and you go \\"whoa, I did NOT see that one coming\\" but it's enough of a twist to make you think a bit.  I don't see the complaints for it being \\"too sad\\".  The story is meant to be a difficult one and the ending is one of the few places in the book where the struggles and sacrifices really shine.  It was vital in shedding some light on the relational dynamics within the family, specifically regarding the real place that Anna held in the family, a place most of the family didn't register on the surface until the very end.  There was an aspect to the ending that wasn't entirely believable but the overall ending was necessary and perhaps the most emotionally engaging part of the book.

0439023513|4.0|After reading \\"Mockingjay\\", I came away feeling genuinely disappointed and, for lack of a better word: insulted.  I felt that I had been robbed of the deeply engaging experience that we are taken through on the first two books of this trilogy.  That I had been misled.  I wanted more, and at first I wanted to blame the author for taking that from me.  It took a few days of wondering if I could possibly read the book again and have it end a different way -- not so rushed and devoid of emotion -- but knowing it couldn't be so.<br /><br />Then, it hit me that THIS is exactly what we are supposed to feel.  The Hunger Games story is told with Katniss giving the narrative.  From the beginning we are RIGHT THERE with her, feeling EVERYTHING she feels, because she tells the story with such meticulously appropriate words and emotion. She's telling it first-hand, and it is vibrant.  Katniss is alive, and young, and afraid, and confused, and angry.  We FEEL this all.  We feel her as she struggles to survive.  So, it should be no wonder that the ending should leave us feeling lost and without.  That's what has become of Katniss.  She has been tortured, her spirit dying many times over, until her reality has killed it completely.  She is left a wreck. Damaged entirely.  And so are we.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  I am angry that I just feel numb at the end of the book.  I am angry that I can't feel anything of what Katniss is going through after her last mission, and especially after the death of Prim. I want somebody to blame. But, of course I don't feel anything.  By this point, Katniss doesn't feel anything.  We are still RIGHT THERE with her.  It's sad really: Her disjointed thoughts.  Her disconnect from emotion and human contact.  Her apathy.  We argue that this is so unlike her.  But, we can't change that this is what has become of her.  She had no control over it either.  This is what happened TO her.<br /><br />The ending is perfect.  Katniss is forced to gothrough life, not necessarily alive anymore. Peeta wouldn't let her die, after all.  So now, she is more like a witness, not an active participant. She is no longer attached to anything. Tragic, yes. Insulting, yes. But, it explains the non-mention of the pearl; why we are suddenly leaping through time with brief, unsatisfactory descriptions; why she sums up her ultimate bond with Peeta in a simple paragraph of them \\"growing back together\\", and her love as a simple affirmation of \\"real\\" vs. \\"not real\\"<br /><br />This was not a love story. There is no romance left to be expected. Her vibrance has been extinguished, and there is hardly much that she cares to tell. And we feel it in how she narrates the end. After so many years, Katniss is still taking her doctor's advice -- going through the motions -- trying to hang on to what is normal.  We aren't even told her children's names; they are simply \\"the girl\\" and \\"the boy\\". Just pieces in her story now.  Just part of the motions.<br /><br />Through the Hunger Games, all that Katniss escapes with is her life. Nothing more, nothing less.  I don't think she really survived

Just thought the latter was a good \\"popcorn movie.\\" Glad others enjoyed it too. -- Bruce Westbrook, Houston  [...]
B0079K4WMG|5.0|I first saw \\"Perfect Sense\\" at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival, and I can honestly say that it was one of the most visceral movie-going experiences of my life. I have never walked out of a theater so happy to be alive- in a good way! Ever since then, I've been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to see it again. Unfortunately, the film didn't receive much of a theatrical release in the US, so I look forward to introducing it to my friends and fellow film lovers once it's released on Blu-ray.<br /><br />To be fair, I can understand why \\"Perfect Sense\\" might not have got the release it deserved- it's a hard film to categorize. The film focuses on two residents of Glasgow; a chef, Michael (Ewan McGregor, \\"Trainspotting\\") and an epidemiologist, Susan (Eva Green, \\"Casino Royale\\"), as they meet & begin to fall in love- meanwhile, an unexplained illness begins to cause humans across the globe to lose their senses one-by-one. In the beginning, it's just a few people losing their ability to smell, but things escalate quite rapidly from there. While this might sound hokey (and usually is, on an indie budget), director David Mackenzie and his team succeed in evoking an effective & terrifying global disaster from a local perspective, and the film does enough to suggest plausible causes for its illness while keeping it ambiguous enough to allow the larger metaphor to shine through.<br /><br />The effect of the disease is made even more immediate thanks to an interesting side effect: prior to each new sense that is lost, victims are hit with a uncontrollable wave of emotions, varying from despair to hunger. This leads to terrifying scenes such as crowds of people devouring everything in sight like animals- edible or not! These montages are quite effective at putting the viewer in this situation- one can't help but imagine how you would feel if you were losing your connections to the world and had no control over it.<br /><br />Adding to the cinematic power of the disease are the unique perspectives of our protagonists. As a chef, Michael finds his whole livelihood threatened with the loss of taste and smell, and struggles to adapt to a world with little needs beyond the base essentials of \\"flour and fat\\". Likewise, epidemiologist Susan finds herself on the front lines of the disease, desperately trying to understand an illness that is clearly beyond comprehension (and one could argue is punishment for humanity's sins).<br /><br />With all the mysterious disease and global chaos, one might place \\"Perfect Sense\\" squarely in the burgeoning indie apocalypse/sci-fi genre (a la \\"Children of Men\\"). However, it's clear that \\"Perfect Sense\\"'s dark backdrop exists to illuminate the film's true focus: the romance between Michael & Susan. These two lovers are hardly an ideal pair- both come with their own set of very human flaws, sabotaging their efforts at intimacy and admittedly making it hard to relate to either of them at first. But for this reason, their relationship feels very real - their flaws reflect humanity's flaws. Both Ewan McGregor & Eva Green give excellent performances, anchoring the film with their natural characters and physical chemistry, even while serving as metaphors for the whole human race. As Michael & Susan find themselves drawn together, each new sense that is lost brings an examination of what it means to be human, and what is most important to us in this world. In the end, when even our bodies betray us, the only solace to be found is in the people that we love.<br /><br />It would be criminal of me to spoil all of the film's pleasures, but I must mention several other aspects that made \\"Perfect Sense\\" such a powerful experience. First, the supporting cast is fantastic, and collectively they sell the reality of the situation. The film features several familiar faces, including Connie Nielsen (\\"Gladiator\\"), Ewen Bremner (Ewan McGregor's \\"Trainspotting\\" co-star, \\"Black Hawk Down\\"), and Stephen Dillane (currently starring as Stannis Baratheon in HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\").<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly of all, I must call attention to the incredible score by Max Richter (\\"Shutter Island\\"). His beautiful and heart-breaking music on piano & strings was truly captivating, and hooked me into this emotional journey from the very first frames. Indeed, the score elevates the entire film, adding layers of emotional depth & power to the larger ideas the film could only visually suggest for the sake of budget. I hope somehow there is a soundtrack release, because if you're like me, once this music gets in your head you may not want it to leave!<br /><br />\\"Perfect Sense\\" was one of my favorite films of 2011, and I am delighted that it is finally being released in America. It's not for everyone, but it may just make you appreciate the world more, and realize that the things we should value most aren't possessions, but people. I hope you walk out of \\"Perfect Sense\\" as I did - thrilled and appreciative of the wonders of life, and filled with a desire to share them with your loved ones. As the narrator so eloquently states, \\"without love, there is nothing.\\"<br /><br />(Update 10/17/12: I just wanted to add that Max Richter's amazing soundtrack for \\"Perfect Sense\\" is now available to download in the U.S., via Amazon, iTunes, etc.)
B000093FLA|5.0|to em this was a good movie both funny and some excitment. I like when mickey mother was killed and it looked like was mourning both he was plotting he's revenge. also when abby was going though the solo vincent office and looking for the diamond and they said the dog ate it both he really didn't there were stalling for time. but after they gave  the diamond to abby the dog ended up up eating the diamond anyways. I thought that was funny. there many more I could tell you but don't have the time.
0062073281|5.0|Unlike some of the other reviews, I actually read this book.  I don't write reviews based on whether or not I like the author.  I read all 3 of the LA Candy books.  They were a fun quick read.  I'm not going to compare her books to other books I've read because I like to read different books depending on my mood.  The Fame Game is simular to the LA Candy books.  It was a quick read and I enjoyed the story.  If I liked the book, I give it 5 stars.  I'm not going to over analyze her writing skills like some other reviews. I'm not going to act like some sophisticated reader who has something to prove by criticizing every little issue wrong with her writing.  It's not that type of book.  So, if you want to read a fun, quick story then it's a good book.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|As far as songwriting Bob Dylan is the best of the best. No one comes close. The fact that this compilation can find 4 cd's of very good songs to cover testifies to that. They could have made it 8 cd's without running out of quality songs. Is there another artist that has produced to that level? Sorry, none.<br /><br />To me Dylan covers are very predictable. If the artist has any talent at all I know the song will at least be pretty good. How can it not be? Even Miley Cyrus can come off well covering a gorgeous song like You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go. But the flip side of that is that it will almost never be worth listening to over the original as sung by Bob himself. Covers of great non-hit tracks here like New Morning, Simple Twist Of Fate, or Changing Of The Guards are fun to listen to. Once or twice. But then I just want to hear the Dylan original.<br /><br />I have my dozen or so favorites here that I will want to hear again, but the rest is pretty disposable and generic. Last night I had this set on my ipod in shuffle mode. After a while the lone genuine Bob track Chimes Of Freedom came up. I can probably come up with about 200 Dylan songs that I like better but it still stood out here. What they say is true - Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan.

0765315246|5.0|ohn Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\" is \\"Starship Troopers\\" without the politics, \\"Star Trek\\" with more vicious enemies and \\"Star Wars\\" with better dialog. It's set several hundred years in the future, when Earthlings are colonizing the planets under the aegis of the Colonial Defense Force, a super-secret organization solely responsible for getting Earth's excess population off the planet and settling other worlds. Attached to this peaceful mission is a military one, since the colonists are competing for resources against alien races, some of whom have discovered that, raw or cooked, humans taste just like chicken.<br /><br />To fill its ranks, the CDF recruits Earthlings who are at least 75 years old, and who agree to leave the planet forever. How they're turned into super-troopers is as secret as how they've managed to build space elevators and ships capable of faster-than-light travel, but that doesn't stop a steady stream of retirees from signing up.<br /><br />John Perry is one of those recruits and \\"Old Man's War\\" follows his journey into the brave new world. Scalzi tells his story in prose that's pared down, stripped of the \\"writerly\\" curliques that draw attention to the writer. His dialog is plain and direct and the characters all tend to talk alike, but that's most readers won't care about and it gives critics something to carp about. Who cares if they all sound alike, when you can still tell them apart, and you get scenes like this:<br /><br />  The recruiter was busy typing something on the computer and didn't bother to look up as I came in. \\"Be right with you,\\" she muttered, by way of a more or less Pavlovian response to the door opening.<br /><br />  \\"Take your time,\\" I said. \\"I know the place is packed.\\" This attempt at marginally sarcastic humor went ignored and unappreciated, which has been par for the course for the last few years; good to see I had not lost my form. I sat down in front of the desk and waited for the recruiter to finish whatever she was doing.<br /><br />  \\"You coming or going?\\" she asked, still without actually looking up at me.<br /><br />  \\"Pardon me?\\" I said.<br /><br />  \\"Coming or going,\\" she repeated. \\"Coming in to do your Intent to Join sign-up, or going out to start your term?\\"<br /><br />  \\"Ah. Going out, please.\\"<br /><br />  This finally got her to look at me, squinting out through a rather severe pair of glasses. \\"You're John Perry,\\" she said.<br /><br />  \\"That's me. How did you guess?\\"<br /><br />  She looked back to her computer. \\"Most people who want to enlist come in on their birthday, even though they have thirty days afterwards to formally enlist. We only have three birthdays today. Mary Valory already called to say she won't be going. And you don't look like you'd be Cynthia Smith.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I'm gratified to hear that,\\" I said.<br /><br />  \\"And since you're not coming in for an initial sign-up,\\" she continued, ignoring yet another stab at humor, \\"It stands to reason you're John Perry.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I could just be a lonely old man looking wandering around looking for conversation,\\" I said.<br /><br />  \\"We don't get many of those around here,\\" she said. \\"They tend to be scared off by the kids next door with the demon tattoos.\\" She finally pushed her keyboard away and gave me her full attention. \\"Now, then. Let's see some ID, please.\\"<br /><br />  \\"But you already know who I am,\\" I reminded her.<br /><br />  \\"Let's be sure,\\" she said. There was not even the barest hint of a smile when she said this. Dealing with garrulous old farts every day had apparently taken its toll.<br /><br />  I handed over my driver's license, birth certificate and national identity card. She took them, reached into her desk for a handpad, plugged it into the computer and slid it over to me. I placed my hand on it palm down and waited for the scan to finish. She took the pad and slid my ID card down the side to match the print information.\\"You're John Perry,\\" she said, finally.<br /><br />  \\"And nowwe're back where we started,\\" I said.<br /><br />Part of the power and pleasure in \\"Old Man's War\\" is Scalzi's unveiling of the brave new world Perry finds himself in. Armed with advanced technologies Earth's scientists can't even begin to understand, the CDF keeps its secrets on a need-to-know basis. We don't learn how Perry goes from geriatric to super-trooper, or is transported across galaxies until he does.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I ordered them and in less than two weeks I got them and the x41s are the best headphones I have ever had. I would definatly suggest to get rechargeable AAA batteries though. The headset can use fiber optic and can go into most tvs so you can watch movies/tv with loud volume without disturbing others. The x41 is a great investment if you are a late night gamer. The only draw back to the system is that the wireless frequency is just about the same as ones normal wireless internet modem which creates a cracking/popping noise in the headphones, although it does not bother me that much. The range of the headphones are quite large unless your trying to talk through 2 walls. The transmitter should be in direct sight of the headphones to reduce the cracking/popping noise.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are well worth the money
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The best game I could find in arcade category can't  wait till next update. and I can't believe that its free. :)
0439023513|1.0|What in the world happened to the great writing of Suzanne Collins?? I loved the first two books so much, they complimented each other like peas and carrots. I finished both books in 3 days, and I have two young children!! I just couldn't put them down b/c I couldn't stop reading them. Then I get to Mockingjay......:(<br /><br />Let me just say, I can go on and on about how horrible this book is, but I don't have to. Just read all the 1 star reviews and thats basically how I feel about it. To me it seemed like Suzanne got lazy and was in a rush or something to finish this book. The best way I can describe it, as I did to my other family members, is like this.......A brand new television drama starts up, first two seasons are awesome, then the third season comes and the character's story lines get hokie, then it becomes unintersting and you stop watching. Thats exactly, to me, what the trilogy was like. I was struggling to get through Mockingjay b/c of how uninteresting and hokie it became.<br /><br />I'm really saddenend by this book, I agree with others about maybe having someone else take it and start from scratch. I would have loved to have seen Katniss live up to becoming the Mockingjay. I would have loved to have seen Peeta becoming the great speaker to all the districts to help fight forward against Snow and the Capitol. And I would have loved to have seen Gale actually become a great character, he had so much potential to build him up and make him so interesting, but I think he wasn't a favorite with Collins, so he became nothing more, and that angered me!!  Oh, and the death of Finnick, that was pathetic!! What a great character to end him like that.<br /><br />So in all who happens to read my review, don't buy the last book! Its not worth it! It will ruin every greatness of the first two.  And I hope Hollywood rewrites the last movie into something completely different b/c the book sucked!!!  Suzanne, I don't think I could read another one of your books after you butchered this one. It was pathetic and sloppy. Thanks alot!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I chose this Lee Child novel for a reason, I have read 10 Jack Reacher novels and enjoyed his character in every one including The Hard Way. They are very enjoyable, and are hard to put down. Jack is a very large man and solves many off his problems with size and strength, as he does in The Hard Way. In all of Lee Child books he describes Reachers as 6'5\\" and 250 lbs, an needs these attributes to solve many if his problems. How can Lee Child sell out to the movie industry and let them cast Tom Cruise in this role. I will continue to read the rest Jack Reacher books but can not see myself going to see The Hard Way with Tom Cruise as the star. In closing keep up the good work, I will continue to \\"read\\" anything you put out.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Jim Wright
B0054JZC6E|1.0|title just sums it all up. there is no actual fun game on this app. do not get it. don't.
0440241901|5.0|Plain and simple..... I laughed, I cried, I fell in love! Sophie Kinsella writes this book in so much detail that I actually was feeling what the characters would feel.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The characters (especially the main) are will developed and I felt myself instantly rooting for and identifying with her (even though I'm a guy :-) I was somewhat disappointed by the mystery part, of which the built up to its conclusion suggested a much more interesting and reasonable solution. I don't want to give away anything, but one of my earlier guesses for a possible solution seemed more compelling and satisfying than what the actual solution ended up to be. Swank's psychological writing is more interesting and rewarding to me than her mystery writing, and that is why I enjoyed this book.
1612130283|5.0|I thought after the Beauty series I'd never find another erotic series that mesmerized me so. Fifty Shade of Grey is my long lost passion BDSM story of this day and age. Bravo!
0439023521|5.0|I loved the book. I thought it was a great storyline. I am excited by the setting, the politics, the repression and hints of rebellion hiding in the people, and the idea of a game such as the Hunger Game. Especially because a game such as this reminded me of the current shameful fervor for reality TV.  I thought the plot twists were exciting and emotional. I cried my eyes out with Katniss. I feared for her. I fought with her. I despaired with her. I was truly caught up in the magic of this story and I'm so excited to see what happens next.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I ordered this item just for me and my husband as we have most of the strips from an earlier time . Brilliant , and now in disc form.
B003V4ASV8|4.0|I like how the personal experiences described are placed in a social, political and hostorical context of North Korea. The stories are heart breaking, but all in all reading this book does shed some light on how on earth a country like this can exist. Many questions remain and I found it makes me want to read more about NK in general.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|John Grisham departed from his past path. This book is full of humour, insight into the mind of store-front lawers on one hand and the extra-large law factory on the other hand, not to forget the courts, that reading was a real pleasure, even before the many twists and surprises in the story.
0743496736|2.0|\\"!9 Minutes\\" is fine for teenagers. But the book seems reductive.  I lived through the shootings at Virginia Tech, and I feel this novel barely scratches the surface of the emotions involved in a mass shooting and the aftermath.  The author's basic idea that a bullied kid will lash back is not wrong, it is just simplistic.  Many more factors come into play.  I do think that Jodi Picoult is really as writer for teens, whether she will admit it or not.  For that audience, maybe a simplified book on the problem of bullying is a fine thing.  Throw in a couple of well meaning mothers and you've got a shot the next version of the Oprah Show.  Personally I couldn't finish it.  Maybe the topic is too raw for me, and this author too glib and smooth and schooled in creative writing classes to do it justice.
B007DIQB50|5.0|Ok, I can definitely respect people's opinions that this is a pop album and that it is not as hip hop driven as Pink Friday.  I agree with you.  But the album is from Roman's perspective.  For those who do not know who Roman is, he is one of Nicki Minaj's many alter egos.  Nicki has said that he is a gay lunatic with anger issues that lives inside of her.  Now, if he is a lunatic and the album is from HIS point of view, would it not make sense that the album is disorganized and full of songs that are just plane strange, falling out of the genre of classic hip hop?  Also, if he is gay, would it not make sense that this album has a LOT of pop music on it (I'm not trying to stereotype, but maybe that is why she did it)?  Come on people; it's obvious why Nicki went pop on this.  On her first album, Nicki rapped most of the songs herself, but Roman is kind of a double-sided character; he's got an angry side as well as an \\"I'm a lunatic who just wants to have fun, oh and I'm also gay\\" side.  That would make the album have some very hard tracks as well as some pop/dance ones.  It is sad to me that so many people just don't understand Nicki.  If anything is going to be her downfall, I'd say it would be the inability of most people to think outside of the box when they listen to her songs and consider WHY she is doing things this way.  No, she is NOT a traditional hip hop artist, but that doesn't mean she can't be.  From what I've seen of her two albums, her three mixtapes, songs she's featured in, and other random songs, I think she can basically do whatever she sets her mind to.  If that isn't JUST hard hip hop, serious personal stories, or even pop/dance music, so what?  She can do ALL of these.  I mean, she calls herself a Barbie and is obsessed with pink.  If you don't think that means she's got some pop in her personality, you must be crazy.
B001KQZ7I8|3.0|For an account of one's personal experiences in a concentration camp, it's written with an almost clinical distance. This allows it to answer questions that other accounts not often have an opportunity of answering. To me it's still difficult to read without being overwhelmed by emotion, but the calm tone and clear analysis of the author constantly refocused my attention to the lessons that can be learned from experiences like these. For readers with a special interest in the subject, it's certainly a book that adds a lot to everything that has been written about the holocaust throughout the years, because of this particular analytical point of view. The second part, about the psychotherapy method, was very dry to me and might be more interesting for people with a professional interest in psychology.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I will be the first to admit I started to read the books because everyone kept telling me how they liked them and with the movie out I thought what the heck! But the first four chapters of th first book I was about ready to put the book down and not pick it up. But I kept at it and I just finished all three books! It gets a whole lot better! I mean there are twist and turns. The author does very well after the first few chapters to keep your attention and make you feel so many different feelings for each person in the book. I had tears for some and others I just wanted to scream at my kindle! These books are a lot different than what I usually read. But I am not disappointed at all.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|This album is fantastic and hasn't left the cd player in my car since I got it.  Every song is great there isn't a dud on the album.  Can't wait to see them live again this year.  One of the best live bands I've seen.
B006470HZ6|2.0|The first season was amazing, and this season is like a Lifetime movie of the week, except it has zombies in it. Stupid, repetitive plot; idiotic dialogue; not a shred of irony or wit; and fraught with gender and racial stereotypes. Too bad!!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|My husband almost died December 28, 2011.  Just like Bethany, he needed perspective to see a future. 'With God, ALL THINGS are possible' are the turest words ever spoken.  An inspirational story and a Keeper DVD.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Growing up I watched the Muppets constantly, from the Muppet Show, to all the movies. I love the fact that Segel brought them back for the newer generation to enjoy as much as I did while growing up. A lot of people claim to be disappointed with too many songs and dancing, but that is what makes the Muppets, the Muppets. It's great family fun, and I really hope they come out with another movie!
