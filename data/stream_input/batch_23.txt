B0012XIV82|4|I like these little guys, really quick to tighten and loosen
B004L5ITV2|4|product is good, but not easy to install
B00YLZ7C3S|2|It looks big in the picture, but it's small. My smallest purse won't fit.
B000M5QPSY|5|Great for my VW
B005BN46TM|5|I couldn't find a red Corvette script anywhere.  I had a silver script padded seat belt cover but replaced with these from Amazon to match my car.  They also have less padding that makes them more comfortable.
B006UH5520|5|Seem to be good quality and match the description but the loop is a little long 4 closer winches
B00VBK7GEG|5|Great flood lights! From the tops of the trees to right in front of my truck. Intensity seem brighter than my headlights.
B000J19XSA|5|Excellent product.
B00HJ6TYJ6|5|Used this to clean and polish two fiberglass tub surrounds.  They came out looking fabulous with very little work.
B00802FXVG|4|👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
B00K1C1WC2|4|They do the job!
B000WWSZSU|5|Very good!
B009WG296Q|3|quality is good but took much longer than expected to recieve
B00L2T5XIC|5|Quick delivery and the keychain was nicer than I thought it would be.
B00VU11PT8|5|Nice and portable! Only charger that worked with the 220v in our apartments garage. Has holes so you can hang on wall as a semi-permanent solution. Otherwise it's similar to the Volts charger, so it just hangs from the plug.
B000E346M6|5|Great product
B005G9CN3C|2|Not brighter than original lights plus gives off a bluer colder light NOT a white light!
B00GWEU166|5|As like the others before these, they work great and have good illumination factor.
B000NSMZUW|5|Work great
B00FYX2E66|5|This reasonably priced product comes in a package that includes two car seat covers. I was tempted to order the bright blue and black covers, but opted for the plain black. I'm happy with my decision because the solid black covers give my 2013 Sonata a classy appearance, enhancing the car's grey interior. They are also side-airbag friendly. Check to make sure the fitting works for your car before ordering; there's a list  of compatable automobiles on order page.
B007PPG0Q6|5|Great product, my headlight is finally working again! thank you!
B000W7J42G|5|The best #1 fast shipping.
B00X9Y2H8M|4|Super good! Definitely worth the money!!
B012GTTYEK|5|I ordered this because I have two kids learning to drive. It does make a difference in other people's attitudes sometimes. It tempts me to drive like a maniac, and laugh because I have this sticker on the car. That would be bad. I should not do that.=P
B003NOBLQC|5|Nice heavy duty replacement for the faded plastic factory emblems. Fits perfectly on my 2011 Avalanche
B001KSGFPK|5|Fits great, better than the dealer
B002Y37M0W|5|works fine 2001 sequoia
B00UZ4NG3Y|5|A perfect fit for my elantra 2012 gamma 1.6 L engine. Just installed. SOLI DEO GLORIA (Glory to God Alone)
B00XZ9OKAY|5|Worked perfectly! Easy setup!
B006QGD996|5|Worked out well after I figured out how to use them!
B0009IQZH0|5|good quality towels
B00480J4JG|3|Very cheap and low quality one .
B00W8ADB1K|5|We purchased this for our 12-year-old so that it gives them a place to put his iPad or phone, drinks, books and snacks during trips.  We have received it and hooked it up to the vehicle. So far so good! He really enjoys the flexibility that it gives to him allowing him to have his own &#34;space&#34; in the vehicle.”l feedback if you’d like:<br />“We purchased this for our 12-year-old so that it gives them a place to put his iPad or phone, drinks, books and snacks during trips.

B00JK0FHQS|5|I bought my MINI used, and the original silver-toned key fob wrapper was missing. This replacement (which I purchased in pink) fits perfectly onto the key fob and does not present any obstacle to inserting the key into the key slot. It has been several months since I purchased the replacement and it still looks brand new.
B001BT3VXC|5|Fits absolutely perfect, very shiny.  Would like if it rolled up a little tighter, but its great the way it is.
B00UBL8J5Q|2|Wouldn't work even with resistors. Wanted to return but I was being charged for a return on something that wouldn't work. Better off just keeping them.
B00U0T9PSO|3|This cord is OEM level quality but I have 2 issues: (1) it is too long for a 2010 GTI and (2) the plastic is wider than the hole in the cover, so its very hard to get in.
B001TFE38A|5|Easy to apply, easy to buff off, and it works pretty much as advertised. I like to put 2 coats on after claying, and then adding 2-3 coats of wax on top of the JetSeal. Doing this, you can maximize the life of your JetSeal coat. Just keep up with maintenance washes and add 1-2 coats of wax after every wash (or every other wash) and your car will stay protected and looking great.<br /><br />Without JetSeal and wax, my car gets dirty much faster as water does not bead off. I especially recommend this stuff if you do not have covered parking. It's expensive, but a bottle goes a long way as you only will use JetSeal 2-4 times a year, depending on how crazy you are.
B00IS951Q8|5|looks good on my truck and holds really well....make sure you get it straight when you put it on
B0034ZYE5U|4|All seems to be OK .now if just works when I need it.
B000E2CVI8|5|Love the nut!  All filters should have them.
B0029TQDLA|5|Does the job of protecting the placard nicely and seems like it will last a long time.  I get irritated when I'm hanging it, but that's because of the design of the Subaru's rear view mirror, etc., not the holder.
B010A6B6KG|5|This is really a unique tool.  Have used it on the cars as well as the bicycles and it works great!!  The dial is clear and very readable--has a natural feel to the hands.  The rubber non--slip shield is a good feature as I am sure it will be dropped a few times.  The pressure release and reset button<br />is really functional.  The customer service at Jaco  Superior Products is outstanding.
B000VKTULY|5|This cabin air filter is cheaper than Toyota filter. , sale a lot money , easy to replace it  by myself thanks
B000WK6SR2|4|Good looking and sounding but the right side muffler had a slight blemish in the chrome. Because it is under the saddle bag and about the size of a nickel I decided not to return. Without the blemish I would rate them 5 stars
B00I5ZWUVO|5|Great OEM part at a great price.  Fast Shipping
B005F9IJOK|5|Bought this for my 1997 GMC Sierra 2wd as one had popped off somewhere.Seems to fit well and looks good. Good product.
B00E9GVTZG|5|Love this cover money well spent.
B00M0YB7BA|5|I love these pants they look sweet and feel comfortable no more riding in jeans
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Perfect size. Thank you!!
B00O5MVFZI|1|Looks wack
B000UKJG7I|5|I purchased this kit for my 2005 Zuma 50 after the previous owner managed to melt the piston rings on the original motor in 1080 miles. Installation took a very reasonable amount of time, and because it's a 2-stroke, there's not much that one can mess up. The instructions are a bit dense for someone with no mechanical skill, but a quick search online of forums or YouTube makes installation a breeze.<br /><br />A couple notes: When you install the new top end, torque everything to spec, take a short ride, and check it. Also, break in with rides, not idling on the stand (remember its air cooled), making sure to vary the throttle. After a tank or two, you should be good to go! I've put 600 miles on mine since doing the swap a month ago, and it runs as well as stock Zumas.<br /><br />For reference, I have a 17.5mm Dellorto Carb with autochoke (running needle positions/jetting exactly as I pulled it out of the box from Team Calamari), a Leo Vince ZX exhaust, and the rollers/springs that were included with the ZX exhaust. I've gotten a GPS confirmed 50 MPH out of it with great acceleration, holding 35 MPH up some of the steeper hills in the Seattle area. I highly recommend this kit, but make sure that you retune your carb (or invest in a larger one) to prevent a lean condition that could cause premature wear.<br /><br />**Update** I've put over 1500 miles on this cylinder kit (longer than the original Yamaha) with zero issues. There has been no drop in performance over this time. I'm very impressed at the longevity and durability of this single-ringed cylinder.
B0027M3A1U|4|Application went well leaving a fine finish.  Two coats recommended.
B00FQ1YVLC|5|Great Rotors Look fantastic!! Quality to be tested, just put on my 02 F150
B008OAECW0|4|Saved me 40 dollars by stringing the blind with this kit myself actualy very easy
B00UH5B07A|2|They didn't fit with existing hardware
B00HWI46S0|5|Nice item thanks
B00JGJG6EU|4|overpriced for the length, but it works well and appears to be good quality
B00CYLKBUM|5|Absolutely amazing! Love!!!
B000JYD6V2|5|Great fit and color.
B00YED9032|2|guess you get what you pay for does not have good volume
B0093A9ST2|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Mazda.
B0110CO95S|1|While sorting  the stickers  I found some were good, many simply brand advertisements and I came across 4 that were absolutely offensive.  One encouraged rape by saying &#34;No means yes&#34; on the animation of a woman handcuffed, naked and crying and the others were women in sexually explicit poses.  I was just ordering stickers to put on my radio. I didn't intend to spend my money for something so offensive and  mysoginistic.
B001GBIEIM|5|great product
B000C11JIY|5|Easy installation and works great!! Superior product!
B009AXGCSC|5|I've used this instrument repeatedly for AC systems.  It's a fantastic device and extremely accurate, durable, and reliable.  Best advice I can offer is to keep a good battery in it (and have spares in the van), keep it out of direct sunlight while on a vac, and keep it out of the hands of folks who have no idea what they are doing with it.  Try not to use this on a system that still has a bunch of oil or flush in it or you'll be sorry.  Valve it off from the vac pump for an accurate picture of what your lines look like.  Hell, vac down your gauges to see if you have any leaks with it.  Happy vac'ing gents.
B000IG20RW|5|Can't beat the best!
B004EPU2TQ|4|These were a little bit thinner than stock endlink but the worked and fit was exact
B000COMXCM|5|Just what I needed to store my key in for easy finding.
B00YARDINA|5|product fits great and meet my expections
B00HYK8FQK|5|Perfect!!
B001O81TIE|4|Works great, did not come with high pressure switch(reused old part)
B004I0E9YG|5|Perfect fit!!! Recommend it, came with light bulbs installed, excellent!!
B00ELBCSZY|1|Very thin material. These used to be made out of heavier material so I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Too much trouble to send back.
B006VFEJJQ|4|The battery does require a vent hose just like the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) battery had. Fortunately, the original vent hose and plastic elbow that goes into the side top of the battery can be reused - IF - you know what you're doing. When the battery is installed properly the vent hole faces forward away from the Do It Yourself installers (DIY) view. When I removed the old batter there was bit of a problem disconnecting the vent hose but after doing a bit of twisting it came off easily. Putting the new battery in wasn't that difficult but the plastic handle strap doesn't like to be moved laterally so putting the battery tiedown bar on wasn't that easy. Caution: DO NOT over tighten the tiedown bar! The battery is a PLASTIC case and the excess pressure on the battery top can cause damage.<br /><br />Getting back to the vent hose: Reattaching the black plastic vent hose elbow to the battery is difficult because the plastic battery carry strap is in the way and it doesn't like to be moved. Here is why the rating is only 4 stars: The OEM plastic elbow has a very small tit that stick out and isn't readily apparent. This tit likes to be engaged with a very small slot in the vent hole. It would be wonderful if Optima would have put a notation on the positive terminal that a vent hose is required in an enclosed space and needs to be connected, and that it is a twist-lock connection. As it is, I pressed really hard getting the elbow in the hole (not being able to see what was happening, and it finally went in after doing some twisting. HOWEVER, the little tit is not really bent!<br /><br />Note: Optima caters to the DIY customer as is clearly visible upon a visit to their web site. I have installed a Prius battery previously and it did have the twist-lock feature but that was several years ago and I'd forgotten about. If I were a shop mechanic I would have know better 'cuz a mechanic does this all the time.<br /><br />Also Note: Another part of the 4-star ratingis they have &#34;up to a 10-BUSINESS day turnaround&#34; [my emphasis] on their emails and there is no phone support after their normal work day so there is virtually no support available except for their Q&A list that doesn't provide a solution to the problem I had. Ten business days can equate to over TWO WEEKS. Bottom line: LOUSY customer support! This is not a DIY job if you depend on your car for transportation. Fortunately, I own three cars to there were a couple others available. Pity the poor customer who doesn't have this option.<br /><br />I did leave this recommendation with Optima.
B0009IK5WG|5|My husband did a lot of research and decided on these.  They are great.  Even got them for our daughters car.  Just bought our second set.
B004FJKDP4|5|Worked great and less price than the dealer.
B002ITBPI2|5|I love it bought it for my 70 year old brother who still rides
B000AA4RWM|5|fast shipping, packaged great, works good no problems
B0018YIL4O|5|It says rancho right...nuff said
B00BRL6M76|5|maybe OEM, maybe not. Don't care, fits perfect on my 2006 camry and much better then the nasty ones that were in this second hand car.
B0052UIKL4|5|Great quality! Installed in about 3-5 minutes. I bought it because my oem was leaking through the headliner. I hope this helps
B00681BE2S|3|remote worked great for the first two weeks. either the battery is going dead or theres something wrong with it as now it takes 3 to 4 button pushes to lock/unlock the car.
B00EDD6Q3A|5|Very Good
B00BFIINLE|5|Fit perfectly in on my 1998 corolla and the handle works just as the factory ones. Only problem is that it didnt came with a screw.
B00874NDN2|4|These are decent, but don't expect more than a few seasons out of it, this is my second one.<br />But, it fits, it works, year round expect a few seasons.
B00NGU9IKO|4|Looks like it was my mistake on the incorrect order it is being taken care of right now.
B001SLEPB0|3|Good product, good value for money.
B007KTINZI|5|excellent
B00KCI9LCI|5|very good for my car but if some one can help me to fix the 3G on this device.<br />thanks
B006X8ALKM|5|Fit perfect on my 2007 Sierra
B0000AXY62|5|Great quality and security!
B00029KA6S|5|fix correctly.well please
B000RZ5XXM|3|Cheap. Only last a year before sun faded painted chrome on it.  Now it's all black/grey.
B002QGVW3K|5|Thought I needed a new charger - but it was only the battery. Works great and was easy to install
B00R6ZC0ZA|3|This decal appears to be black and white under artificial light, but is green when exposed to sunlight.
B000EDQR4Q|5|Order this got it on time and it was just what I wanted .!! Camco products are great
B003RZ5YU6|5|great sticker
B00SYEE18G|1|Did not fit
B008A1BJNI|5|Excellent!!! This fits so wright the windshield from the sun. I love it!
B00GJ1MYGW|5|Perfect fit.  Easy install.  This kit was great.
B001F0IE7A|5|Superior product! Took about two hours to install, but works great- now my boat and trailer fit in my garage! Love it!
B00ZR55A0I|4|seems to work just fine. good item to have when traveling
B00IGCTEME|5|It is very to install. I've learned in YouTube first and fix it. It works amazingly!
B00FC22N06|3|It's ok i think but not work with my car...
B005MZYLAI|5|Wife loves it
B000UOBIZC|5|This will be awesome addition to our current lynx levelers to use for the 4 leg supports.
B000NU5LP6|5|perfect modifier.ford f250 xlt 460 limited slip differential must add 8 oz. 2 bottles
B0040CRTFI|5|Just what I needed!
B00YC28OUU|4|They go on, they are handles, they look cool and they hold up. What more do you want. These did get knocked one star because there are no instructions. However there is another peice that is like a little hook that I did not hookup/install. I am not sure what they are for. The hook peice looks cool, I just can't find functionality for it or where it goes. XIU JIE MING is the seller and for some reason I really don't think he is going to be able to give me an answer to what these hook peices are for. For this... it gets docked one star for the confusion.
B0036G97DG|3|Not standard but Metric threads.
B00J0ABS5M|2|Will not fit Class V Ford F350, too short.
B001EP27YC|3|I am a fairly accomplished mechanic had to spread the bracket out approximately 3/8 of an inch to make it fit proper, I don't know if it was in transit it may have gotten damaged or that was the way they made it it's made of good solid steel and well-designed.
B001O0BJUK|5|I was having trouble with my COP's on my 03 F150 and it was costing me about $50 to replace them one at a time from AutoZone.  Saw a whole set of 8 ACCEL SuperCoil COP for less than the price of 3 &#34;regular&#34; COP's and thought, &#34;why not?&#34;. I've had them on the truck for a while now and even with close to 214,000 miles on the truck, it doesn't miss a beat!
B00KTHXP56|1|Not what the description stated
B0002NYDYO|5|best item ever..where has this been...love it..
B008RU3FRA|3|Honestly I didn't notice much of a performance difference after installing this on my Baja Motorsports Dune 150.  I did notice that it revs a tad bit higher, which helps at the top-end of the powerband.  Really it's not much better than the stock CDI but for the price that it is, you might as well test it out for yourself.
B000BRLBSM|2|Matt have split in the grooves and are not at all weather m proof highly disappointed in product don't waste money look else were for different products
B00M5F8C26|5|Identical to OEM and is working perfectly after a month.
B007TY9Q3C|4|GREAT PRODUCT, LOOKS GOOD.
B00KQGPEQI|5|This came in a Hyundai package, so I know it's an original.  Once you cut the two plastic mounting posts off with some side cuts, remove the 3m tape backing and place it on where the old &#34;lazy H&#34; was.  You have to use a heat gun to remove the &#34;H&#34; logo first.
B0049J52VU|4|The muffler fit good and was installed at the same time that the resonator pipe in front of it was installed. The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because the warranty wasn't lifetime.
B00026Z3E0|3|They work.  But smaller than I expected.  I guess I did not read the product descriptor close enough.  And they are not as solid as I thought a 3 ton stand should be.  But for the small stuff I use them for they are fine.  I would not buy them again though.
B0012RI7DM|5|love it thank you
B00OZVOGL4|1|Came in broken. I installed before I realized there was a missing hose broken off sensor! Hose was hidden in box.
B00KTIGSTK|1|Did not work with my 2006 Chevy HHR LT, and I had to pay the dealership $21 to find out it didn't work. Do not purchase this product. I'm only giving it one star because zero isn't an option.
B008YDKHJY|4|worked, little pricey for pleather
B000C9RYE4|5|A perfect fit for my Cadillac Deville Base 1998.<br />I don't know what about the quality but with AC Delco I think I won't have any pb.<br />My car rides smoothly
B006WQRH1Q|1|Piece of crap wheel hub made in China that went bad after only 8 months. The sensors failed & wheel was making bearing noise again. My ABS, traction control and service stability system lights came back on. Took it to a pro and sure enough, my &#34;new&#34; part needed to be replaced.<br /><br />** I figured this was a US-made product with a name like Detroit Axle but after some digging I found out that wasn't the case; their alternate name is Dearborn Axle and they sell the cheap Chinese BS and have had many issues like this in the past. **<br /><br />Contacted customer support for a refund but their 12-month warranty only covers a replacement (if they deem it their fault) not a refund, also customer has to pay a deposit and for return shipping. I said 'no thanks I don't want to have to keep paying for labor every time this thing fails.'<br /><br />Ended up ordering a Timken from RockAuto which seems to be one of the most reliable according to reviews and forums (https://www.rockauto.com/catalog/moreinfo.php?pk=1118451&cc=1432045&jnid=458&jpid=18)<br /><br />My advice, don't skimp and get the cheap one like I did. Buy the quality option and don't have to worry about replacing again and again and dealing with customer service headaches.
B00N3VGPYS|5|This gauge is the cats meow! I got it to tune my carburetor. it helped me discover that even with the carburetor idle screws out as far as I could go the engine was still not getting enough gas at idle (lean condition). I decided to upgrade to a throttle body fuel injection system by FiTech and I'm never looking back.  The FiTech system has an air fuel sensor as well which is in my left down pipe, while this one is plugged into my right pipe. It is nice to see both readings, I can tell this one is more accurate as it is sometimes lower by about .5 at times, other times they match almost perfectly. The FiTech system I have came with a 4.2 sensor, this unit uses the latest Bosch 4.9 LSU sensor.
B000C0TE8M|3|wrong hose, the auto part screening tool needs an upgrade!
B008M1WCTG|5|The matts are a little stiff and it takes a second to install them, but they adjust to fit in place very quickly, and look great in the truck.  I haven't spilled anything on them yet (I try not to), but the lips appear as through they will contain a moderate spill and any water/mud that may be on the bottom of my boots.
B005HAYDR4|5|Bought so my 86 yr old father could get in my jeep more easily.  He loves it!! Makes life a whole lot better for him.
B000182EUU|5|Good
B00GI78CQ8|3|I purchased these lights for my 2011 Yukon XL to replace my break lights. They work great and are very bright! My only complaint is they slightly smaller than the slot they go in and can fall out of the socket pretty easily. I used a small thin piece of plastic to hold the bulbs in better so they did not fall out.
B011T6W4DO|5|Very pleased with these levers.  They were well packaged and arrived earlier than expected.  They were easy to install on my wife's 2015 Honda CB300F (took 20 minutes).  She's petite and these improved her confidence.  The only improvement would be to include an Allen key (wrench) for the extension lock screw as my set had a 'close enough' but not perfectly fitting key.
B007KCYRZK|5|BETTER THAN I WAS EXPECTING, EXCEPTIONAL PRICE AND VALUE
B00NX340M0|4|Easy to install. looks like new, Now I have to change the other side so they match!
B002BHWZFI|5|Only brand we buy! Husband works in a hot kitchen and his glasses always fog without it. Add a little Cat Crap Anti-fog and he is good to go. A plus is that it freaked out the teenage daughter when we got a container marked &#34; Cat Crap&#34;
B002G3Z7PC|4|Easy install and decent quality.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Pretty easy to put together and light to handle on your own.
B00ABW6DO4|5|Perfect fit and quality is very good.
B009O91SEK|3|This remote does not have the Mercedes emblem on it. Just FYI.
B006B7YOZS|5|Awesome
B001RB83G4|5|Excellent
B003CEFJ2A|5|Must have.  OK, you don't have to have it but I like it.  But now I want one for the winch to match.
B002JH4GMK|3|The colorful side is the sticky side, and this is all one piece.  I wanted it for my car but ended up just putting it on my sliding glass door because you wouldn't bee able to see it through my car's window tint.
B008LMO7Y4|5|Gift for friends who went over 9000 miles camping this summer.  Perfect.
B00496F0GK|3|Good for the price. Not very thick blades. Will probably have to replace the soon.
B000CNB5OK|4|Shipped very fast.  Used to replace rotted bump stops on the rear of a 2004 Silverado. Fit fine, only issue is that the replacements are about 1/3rd the length of the stock bump stops, not sure how much over all difference that will make good or bad, will certainly allow more unfettered travel of the drive axle.. [[ASIN:B000CNB5OK Energy Suspension 9.9101G All Purpose Bump Stop - Pack of 2]]
B00HLW18T2|5|I mounted these lights on my ridding lawn mower so I could cut grass at night.I made some mounting brackets<br />out of 1/4 x 2 flat bar and painted them red the same color of my mower. I mounted them on my rear fenders<br />just behind the seat and in line with my mower deck. I mounted a push and pull switch in my dash. To my<br />surprise the light beams cross about 10 feet in front of my mower, just perfect. you can see 200 feet no<br />problem.
B005HFYE1O|5|Relays work great.  So far on par with the equivalent Bosch.
B008CLNYPC|4|Good product for a DOT can.  The top strap is not for a Jerry Can.  I have modified mine a lot.  The steel is strong enough to take it.  I only gave it four stars because you have to lift the tank a little higher than the mil style.
B00KLEXOHQ|4|Overall I really like these magnets. They are large, bright, easily readable with great reflectivity.  I found it a little strange that the &#34;student driver&#34; magnet was a much thinner material than the other 2. They work like a charm on the back of my Honda Odyssey! However, when my husband tried to put them on his Nissan Altima he could not get them to stick. I know others had reported them not sticking well. So I wonder if there is a difference in the materials of some cars that are just less magnetic.
B00MEUY1HC|5|Great sticker
B000BO9TMU|4|Nice little air tank
B004P9C5H8|5|great product
B00DSD4J12|5|Looks pretty awesome, just be careful when applying because it's extremely sticky adhesive and the wind blew mine while I was trying to put it on and it ended up touching the glass at an angle and I had no choice but to seal it that way because when I tried peeling it off it acted like it was gonna tear if I pulled too hard. So just make sure you apply carefully.
B005LGTRD4|5|Fit perfectly on 2004 KIA Sorento.
B00QU6P6NY|4|quick delivery and a great product.fit on my car perfectly.easy installation...
B0002JMIEK|5|Haven't found anything else to match finish with minimal effort.
B0037ZB7PM|1|Low quality made in china
B0077QL1F8|4|A little smaller than I expected.  Or I'm bigger than I admit.
B002LYROK2|2|The text on the frame &#34;RAVENS&#34; was not nearly the same size as it appears in the image.  The font was quite small.
B00WVLNJ54|5|I got these lights for my 2003 BMW 325i and they work perfectly they are very bright and look great as well. I am very happy with them .... if you need amber corner lights , get these !
B000YQQZCW|5|Just the right angle for using on those hard to reach places on the motorcycle.
B00C42T846|1|There were not instructions for mounting it or where. Surly someone that designed this thing had ideas of where they were going to put it. Nothing was shared.
B0028JQYPG|5|work great
B00PLCS2QG|5|Perfect just like original
B005LDBD3E|5|Very please
B00ZS9S1LS|5|I have never put a sign on my vehicle, but this sign works perfectly in my back window. I will be buying more of these!
B000CQBNMQ|5|Rugged construction with easy to read measuring labels.  The labels are actually quite ingenious: you fill the &#34;dispensing&#34; side (with the white cap) by flipping the bottle upside down.  To help you measure, the creators of the bottle have angled lines that correlate to the &#34;upside down fill level.&#34;  You can measure by the ounce inverted just as well as you could right side up!<br /><br />Make sure you get a good funnel so you don't have to turn the bottle sideways to dispense (like I do).  If you turn the bottle sideways or tip it more than 90 degrees, you risk getting &#34;fill&#34; liquid into your &#34;dispense&#34; area.  Hopefully these terms I'm making up on the fly make sense to you... if not, let me know what you'd suggest and I'll update!
B006BAQ6Y2|5|very happy with the clicker and service
B00496RE82|5|Installed on my 1961 Alfa Romeo with a 2 barrel carburetor. Supplies plenty of fuel and was easy to install. Does make a loud clicking noise when it's first turned on but quiets a bit after pressure is established.  I'm very satisfied and will likely purchase another for a different old car.
B00BXLEI2G|5|Worked out well for loading a lawn tractor on the back of a four wheel drive pick up truck. Mower deck did clear ramps. Unloaded equally as well.
B00CST9BC4|5|Shipped quickly and fit perfectly!!  Very happy!!
B00GN0P2UE|2|the color is very different!!!!
B007S0H5DU|5|This combined with the Happy Camper Extreme Holding Tank Cleaner eliminated the odor. That was the goal :-)
B007V2D07U|4|This sunshield looks great and works great. 4 out of 5 stars because it is difficult to install if you have the grab bars installed in the corners near the windshield.
B00BAZCUZC|3|One of the outer casings broke during install. I ordered 2 sets, so had a spare. Work good.
B000C580O6|3|Purchased these along with the K90430 (driver's side) and the driver's side went in just fine, but these I had a very hard time installing. Note that I was installing into Skunk2 LCAs, and the problem is that this one requires an allen key (because the bolt at the end of the shaft loosens, whereas the bolt on the end of the K90430 shaft is fast). I ended up stripping the allen key on install.
B007SCNWD0|2|The front mats contoured decent to my floor but the back seat mats don't contour very well at all.
B00SVXS3A2|4|Simple product. Worked well. Great price
B00J594B5C|3|Works but very small amount for the $$$
B00BK262SQ|4|Fits perfectly. Breathable and good grip.
B00FP14W4E|5|Highly Recommended! One year in and still working perfect.
B0006GF5SK|5|Good Product.
B00GZR48DM|1|My mechanic installed it, it did not correct the problem. It did get rid of the engine light but did not advance timing like the knock sensor is supposed to do
B00DZ4GZUC|5|Great product to wash the car with.  My advise would be to order one for each hand - that way you can quickly wash with both hands. Rinse and hang dry - well made.
B00HLPRAM8|5|It looks very nice well suited to my honda 2013 Pilot ex. Thanks.
B00NTVMLTA|5|The dead pedal isn't an easy install plus it looks cheap. But the gas pedal and brake pedal were easily installed. The use of a quarter made bending the tabs easier. Total install time 15 mins. Took longer to make sure everything lined up right on the gas pedal.
B009EZ5DX6|5|Sweet deal, fits just like it should. Thank you for the savings on this part. Quality is very good as well. Thank you.
B0014GCDAE|5|great replacement for the earlier models with multiple small screws.
B00OVBBOTK|5|Love these bars. Well made, the fit was spot on, no regrets with my purchase.
B007Y853DA|4|Fit my '03 wrangler TJ and delivers the same performance as OEM. I like that it came with a performance curve in the box, but have to give 4 stars because it has developed a high pitched whine after about 1 year in service that I suspect is the bearings going out.
B000C5HZSS|5|Motorcraft the best parts ever I used it on my Villager problem is resolved.
B00ZSB1WP8|1|Haven't had this battery for more than a month, it's already come apart.<br />With nothing to block it , concentrates are able to leak thru to the battery inside. Never had this problem before.
B00H7SCXR6|1|Did not look like the picture
B00KHAMBBO|5|Loved it!  Colors holding up well so far in the hot Texas sun.
B001CA9CN8|1|THIS IS NOT THE SEAT FILTER !!!! This is the plastic COVER !!!!….Dont waste your time ordering so you can return it.<br /><br />This is NOT NOT NOT the filter element.
B0031ZDU62|4|I've been using these one at a time - as needed - for my 97 Expedition.  It's been over a year (6k+ miles) and no failures yet!
B0033WDIB0|5|Instructions are very clear and all the connectors are correct for the install.
B00HV2KFZU|4|Came in the mail quick and looks great on my 2004 nissan titan!
B00F9LPIAC|5|Great battery for my 2006 KTM 450EXC.  Had to replace a dead AGM battery and figured I would save some weight on my dual sport.  This thing holds a charge really well and doesn't need to go on the charger that often.  Has not failed to start the bike yet.  No issues with the TrailTech Stator/Regulator on the bike keeping it charged and running the DC conversion.  Even with the fan running the volts don't drop below 14.  I have ALL LED lighting though - even the headlight.
B00F2GRR3K|2|Didn't fit wrote to vendor for return
B000IY29AM|5|Great product, as expected, fast shipment, bolted right on, no issues whatsoever!
B009IPD5UA|4|Good stuff
B00BITKSW2|1|I item broke within a week so they me a second one it broke in the first few days after I put on the door so I'm very unsatisfied to say the lest.
B000WJBLDE|5|It was just the right tool that my husband needed to work on his motorcycle.
B000IZSB2Q|5|Wish I had this years ago. Works great. I now can fill the water tank in no time.
B006Z8C6BW|5|Great product at a good price.  Service and delivery were as good as could be expected.
B000WJX2PY|1|Defective product with no warranty<br /><br />I purchased this Yuasa YTX24HL-BS battery for my 1988 GL1500 Honda Goldwing on 3/31/14.  It never held a charge for more than a month and now it won’t take a charge at all.  I always used a Schumacher 1.5 amp automatic charger.  The indicator light on the charger never switched from yellow to green to indicate that the battery was fully charged.  The battery was fairly warm to the touch as it was being charged.  It would charge enough to operate the bike but if left sitting for 3 to 4 weeks it would go dead with no load at all on it.  I swapped an identical battery charger from my Kawasaki 1100 Spectre to the Goldwing.  Same result, the Kawasaki battery charged just fine with the charger from the Goldwing but the Goldwing battery failed identically using the charger from the Kawasaki.  This confirmed for me that the battery was the problem, not the charger.  The battery was defective from day one but worked well enough to get by with.  I should have returned it immediately but didn’t.  When it totally failed today I decided to see about a warranty replacement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I did not read the warranty clause on Amazon nor Yuasa’s websites before purchasing this battery. The warranty clause on Amazon’s webpage reads: Manufacturer’s warranty can be requested from customer service.<br /><br />From Yuasa’s website: Yuasa Battery, Inc. does not handle warranty issues directly. All inquiries should be directed to the dealer where the battery was purchased. The dealer's distributor sets the warranty period and handles all warranty claims. The warranty time frame and terms are not specified by Yuasa.<br /><br />I spoke to both Amazon and Yuasa customer service about the warranty and each told me that it was the other’s responsibility.  I got nowhere.  Yuasa did tell me that it is a bad idea to buy their batteries from Amazon for this and other reasons.<br /><br />So beware, you may receive a defective battery as I and many others have.  If you do, try to return it to Amazon within 30 days and you might be taken care of.  Beyond that and you will end up with a $100 paper weight.
B007Y697V6|5|Everything matched. No problem.  Good job!
B00HNKYD0I|2|it falls apart easily, the oem stuff from the dealer holds better in my opinion
B002807WWO|5|Works great, fits 2014 Toyota Tundra.
B0008FUH46|5|Works well.
B003C01BZS|5|very satisfied!!
B001PTS35O|5|nice quality, works great on my sons go cart.
B00S9OWC50|5|First let me say that this part did not work for my vehicle.  I purchased this part for a front wheel drive and this one is for all wheel.  With that said,<br />the seller was EXCELLENT in working with my return (although not free-but it was MY mistake) and refund.  Thank you.
B0049H8RNM|2|I ordered the Kokopelli mat but received a totally different mat.  It's not a high-quality mat but the price was right.  I didn't have enough time before a camping trip to return it and replace it with a Kokopelli mat so it was a bummer to get the wrong one.  If you don't care about the pattern you should be fine.
B00C3CQTEY|5|All i can say ts { AWESOME} Love it  [[ASIN:B00C3CQTEY HQRP Strobe Blue Light 240-LED Emergency Hazard Warning LED Mini Bar Strobe Light w/ Magnetic Base for Car Trailer RV Caravan Boat plus HQRP UV Meter]]
B0002SRD00|5|Worked great on lexus a/c lines
B00ZR39JY8|5|Very Happy with this Light I may be getting one more for a friend
B00YWGSAW8|4|Great looking lights! Happy I saved my old ones as most bulbs wernt included
B00WJ4DH8C|5|Although I had to get a different bolt for the bar ends once they arrived I was very pleased with the condition and new look they gave my bike. Look forward to dealing with i5 in the future.
B001MU5JOE|5|OEM Plugs as listed in the 2005 Honda Odyssey Owners Manual.
B00KQXYSR2|5|nice
B009NTGTOA|5|Great product. Exactly as described. Fit my application perfectly.
B0002STSQ2|5|exactly as described
B00A5XKKTI|5|I bought this as a surprise gift for my boyfriend and he immediately put it on his car. All of the letters  have stayed intact and he loves showing it off.
B007XZK5XW|2|I put these lights on my 2002 chevy Silverado 1500, they fit good and look nice. The lenses are clear not tented. The only bad part about these lights that I found was where the bulb goes in at. The plastic pieces came unglued and it threw the beam of the light off. I tried to super glue it back and it still isn't making the beam shine at the right angle.
B00QXUFCAY|3|installed these in a 2011 VW Golf TDi and still gave me errors.  tried switching sides to see if still gave me an error on one side and it did. not a true 'error free' LED in my case.  they are, however, very bright and the color is matched exact to my HID factory headlamps.
B008PK947C|1|Poor metal alloy quality, after a year of usage, the drill slotted plate warped and causing unsteady of steering at brake. Do not purchase these rotors.
B001JT1CEE|5|Nice set. Works great.. I'd get it again.
B003CWUOTK|4|Just arrived today.  Appears to be very well made. But I'm surprised it does NOT come with a storage bad of any kind and when folded it is quite large.  It may not fit in the trunk and I'd hate to have a huge wet cover sitting on my seats.
B002LRQOZK|2|It's so enormous that I hardly think that the bracket will hold it so that it doesn't fall down on the first wave you hit .. L. But that being said, I did not get to try it as the bracket was not big enuf, all though it was round...for a 2015 Bayliner BR 175
B000PL0CTI|5|Have used these for over tens years now and love them.
B004PFYCM8|4|This is an extremely strong magnet. I originally got one for the drawers in my RV, but it was too strong and too large. I ended up attaching the L-Shaped piece to the door on my RV and the other piece to the screen door and use it as a way to keep the two doors attached without using cheap plastic.
B00H79VO7K|1|Doesn't for sportster as advertised.
B000630AZQ|5|As advertised. no complaints
B003YCA64Q|3|201508 Highly overrated here. Used it few times on my grill, and nothing as the adverts. It's OK.
B00HDPO8YE|2|Wrong size
B009II5LVI|5|Great for running my gold prospecting equipment.
B001B7TSP4|2|Box says it &#34;will fit&#34; my 2012 Chevy Silverado, it is built for a FORD F-150, I had to cut into my liner, add 2X10 wood blocks, and drill about 5 new holes into my truck bed. The truck beds are not the same, it was very angering.
B00VA5N26S|5|It successfully jump started my car, what else could I ask for?
B002G9R39O|5|love it, got this for a female 10 week old pomeranian we named Harley.  She looks cute in in. Will outgrow it but we will get her a bigger size later on.
B0022ZKW0Y|5|Awesome plow bracket fit perfectly on my 2015 sportsman 850 sp way stronger than a front mount system  takes 2 minutes to hook the plow up to this and go. There is no loss in clearance and will never have a resin to take it off
B005F6NP4C|5|Excellent product that is very well made.  We actually received the product a day earlier than expected.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone needed a faucet.  Their customer service is second to none as well.  Very satisfied with fit and finish and the company itself.
B00LFL779K|5|This product works fine for my 2098 ford focus.
B008GVFZKU|1|Worst product I have a bot online lights weren't bright enough
B00HESFIJ4|5|My tire pressure monitor came on in the middle of driving. I had gone from driving in a cool coastal climate area to being a 100+ degree heat 30 minutes later. Wasn't too sure if there was actual deflation or if the TPM was triggered as a result of the sudden extreme temperature. Turns out my tires was inflated properly and used the Accu-gage. Real easy and super helpful!
B00V5QDIPW|4|Fit and function are flawless install took all of about 10mins. The only down fall is they should include blue semipermanent lock tight. Idk pay an extra few dollars to have it come back in the package.
B00HVHMCXI|4|good product, good price, does what it's supposed to.  Can't complain.
B000CMFSFS|4|fit nice. on the outside side of the mats the ridge (for the mud and water) is a little high, its fine for me but my wife doesn't like how high it is for her to get in the truck she says her shoes get caught on it.(trimmed off the ridge a little) now perfect.
B000HAB9LM|4|its good!!
B00L9NEI2I|5|They're awesome!!! They fit nice and flush and look beautiful on my car. Only things is in my previous lights they had xenon bulbs and unfortunately they didn't fit into my news ones, so I ambliiking worsts to drilling the unnecessary metal for the halo lights so I can fit my old xeanons. Besides that it brought out my color on my car and people are always asking about them.
B0002KKIUA|4|nice nice will buy again
B00AESZ42C|4|It showed up in soft packaging and was a little bent up. It ended up working out ok, but it would have been better to have it encased in some light cardboard.
B00DR67P9I|5|Bright bright bright !!!!!!!!!!!
B0009VA8PC|4|came on time, and fits perfectly.
B0041TS6UM|2|Mirror came warped like a fun house mirror
B000JFHNEC|5|arrived quickly. I haven't had time to use them yet but they look to be a quality product which will last a long time.
B00ZC2VLGS|5|I was shipped the white/cool white instead of the warm white.  Customer service was very prompt and helpful.  I was able to exchange for the warm white wedges quickly and without any issues.<br /><br />If you are into or can use white/cool white, these work really well.  They are bright and spreads out light in  approx 180 degrees.  For license plate lighting, that works just fine.  I much prefer the warm white, and they are also very bright.  These wedges are designed very short and flush, so they easily fits into practically any location you need them, so long as you do not need 360 degree illumination.<br /><br />Caveat: I did notice an issue where a wedge will light up half way, but turns off when pushed all the way in. This happens if one or both leads are a bit short and go into the plastic groove on the unit. Another thing I noticed was that a wedge may work well initially, but some jarring (on a car) may cause the contact to get lost and the light won't turn on.  I suggest you check the lights once in a while to ensure the light still turns on when it should.  For me, there were plenty of wedges in the package (20), so I just choose another one for the location where I want to ensure a steady light.<br /><br />Overall though, I am very happy with these wedges.
B001KSG3QQ|4|Easy to install and so far it is still on!
B0018PDK6C|5|Great buy work like a champ...love them.
B00Y22JCG0|4|An attractive product but, you need some imagination for proper use. It is very deep so requires spacers (not included) for proper fit. Also, it lacks a bottom lip to secure the plate. It's advertised to include double sided tape to secure the plate to the frame. However, none was included.
B00QZHRPJ6|1|I bought this hoping I would be able to ride my bike for longer distance without a sore rear end, but after a couple of hours of riding I couldn't wait to get home and remove it.  If I hadn't of paid so much for this junk I would have yank it off and threw it in the trash, which I still ended up losing 10 bucks on it anyway. I read a review on here about a guy who rode his bike for 1600 miles and loved it, (bull) or this guy has a iron butt.  I wouldn't recommend this seat to anyone.
B00TG20HTW|5|Cute
B008P73IUY|5|Fantastic
B000C9KOUA|5|Like new quality, works great and great price.
B00JIHC36K|1|Burned out 2 weeks in.<br /><br />Just like the rest of the reviews.<br /><br />Thought I'd be a special butterfly and it wouldn't happen to me lol
B00N2JZPK6|5|Great!
B0040CW1VA|5|Just what I needed!
B00M9WLEDE|5|I was needing it
B00W31VMYC|1|Did not work,
B002P8T45W|5|This was pretty easy to put on. I only had issues with taking the interior screws off but that's because they were on tight. I don't ever put anything together but after a YouTube video it took less than 20 minutes. I am the absolute worst at putting things together but it was easy
B0009TTOLS|5|It lights!
B006YU7G8E|5|Genuine Honda part.
B001Y8NEX2|5|Easy to apply and appears durable.  I hope that this will allow me to get another year or two out of my RV canopy.  Like many canopies, it is showing wear after 8 years of UV exposure where it attaches to the camper.  This appears to have added some strength to the canopy and I like the clear tape.  Can't see it unless you know it is there.
B008IK507W|5|Works great! No problems. Arrived quickly as well.
B002R109DS|4|Did not fit my 2005 Silverado 1500.  The Automotive & Powersports Parts Finder at the top of the page said it would.  If I had not been in a hurry, I would have compared the pictures to my truck and would have seen that.  The product itself is of good quality.  New bulbs are NOT included, as they are with some of the other products available on Amazon.  If you have a 2005, search for GM2503257 GM2502257.  Those will be the correct lights.
B00NRVA4O6|5|Definitely brighter and makes for better night time driving.
B0040CU00E|5|good quality retainers
B0090OF9XA|5|Look great don't seem as bright as stock bulbs or the sylvanaina silver bulbs they used to have out.
B00INZ65B2|5|Came on time. Pleased with product
B00P6ONDUE|5|Filter fits and works fine in my 2011 Odyssey.  Good product - great value!
B001AY2WLU|3|Works okay, you have to keep the fastening rivets tight because the item swing out in you pocket.
B007ZHATNE|5|Be careful now to break the band's during installation! Other then that it was great!
B000C9OIS4|5|perfect fit
B00755JMYS|5|All I can say about these is they work very well and have a blueish tint to the light, very slight though.
B00D329DI2|4|They are much better than Mercedes All Season Floor Mats which cost 5 time the amount better fit front and back. You can cut to custome fit, the only thing the clear color has to much blue so their not really clear but I can live with that.
B007G2KL2M|5|Just what I was hoping for! Works well and seems to be made well.
B00COYNZJ8|5|who wouldn't love this?
B005LDBU0U|4|Good air pad. Definitely make the ride more comfy went to Sturgis and was glad I had this pad. Kind of a pain for short trips but for a long ride great to have
B00LBZ7A10|4|work well.
B007LQP9ZM|4|I bought these for my 2015 F-350.  They fit well and look great.  The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is because I wish they were a little softer rubber.  They are a rigid plastic, but they wouldn't be quite as slick if they were a little more rubbery.
B000BUU5YA|5|As I expected
B00KSXXALK|5|Excellent product. Easy installation...Great price!
B004HCOE8Q|4|Good product
B00KTIUG5C|5|works as described Great value
B000WEPI4M|5|Just like described.
B00EZUL6ZY|3|a lot thinner than I thought they would be but was able to cut to fit.
B0038AZO9Q|5|These look and fit great! Had to delete outside, small, parking light. The headlights would not accept the stock fitting snugly. Sealed the socket with silicone to avoid a leak.
B000CO7PPW|2|The photo makes it look like these are white, including the screw -- they are not, they are a clear plastic head with a metal corkscrew.  Disappointed.
B001J7PC60|5|great.
B0006IX7WY|3|Great idea, work pretty well to keep food in place while traveling.
B006YVYIHU|5|It fit perfectly
B00265M9SS|5|Very easy to use and beats pumping a brake pedal
B000C5C9SY|5|Worked perfect for my suburban doors on my crew cab. They look identical to OEM.
B004O8ZCS4|5|Worked well
B00853A6FI|5|SO easy to install... did some research before hand and didn't even read the directions...  installed in less than 10 minutes, works perfect!
B008Z8AQXK|2|Loved the rug when I got it - has only been on patio for about 3 months and it's been ( shedding) plastic for the last month. Tiny pieces are coming off of it - it looks like it's deterioating.
B002OPHNZ4|5|Very pleased with this item, and by far the fastest I've ever experience
B001V8U12M|4|works
B004GCLDCW|5|Good fit on my 2005 Forester XT. Would definitely recommend to anyone needing to replace a front bumper. Comes primed and ready for paint.
B00HSFB4TG|5|perfect fit and is making a difference in air in cabin
B00Y9ZXUOA|5|Great turn signals just don't over tighten easy to snap the hollow bolt but it's a simple fix if you do. I would definitely recommend them. They are very bright.
B007VRCNDM|5|A#1 Quality
B00684TIVE|5|Dropped old one in water.  Ordered this replacement. It is perfect and easy to set up.
B00O6WPVXY|5|OEM Quality
B003PJGC3M|5|Bolted right up without any problems.  Barely shows under the bumper, but it works great for our bike carrier.  I have zero intentions of towing anything with this, but it is built very solidly.
B00S7Q782W|1|Not useful for 7444 bulbs, as there are only two contacts - &#34;dual-filament&#34; bulbs only operate on one pair.
B00DVE92WE|5|Just what was needed
B00LIB49ES|4|Look great. Had a little trouble putting them in my 97 Silverado. But nothing to worrie about.
B001C6N7M4|5|very easy to install and look great
B001NZ4UZM|3|It did not fit on the 2012 Ford Fusion.
B0042ZIT7U|5|Nice
B00M9K3HYU|5|These are great signs for the car the new driver will be using. They are easy to put on and remove and they stay on the car very well.
B00JA1C4MM|5|Love it. Gives the car that Subaru rumble everyone loves. Perfect with a aftermarket exhaust. Didn't fit perfect but you just need to wrestle a little with it and it'll budge right in easy install took less then 30 minutes. Also Amazon said it wasn't for my car but I took a chance and it fit well on my 00 Subaru Legacy.
B0015GOA54|5|Best Garage ball, way better than old tennis balls . Like the blinking light.
B001BAL7W8|5|Better than candles.  Works instantly.  Buy 2 and keep one by the TV.
B00008RW9V|5|Being A mini I was surprised at the amount of dust it held.
B006OZF6PY|5|Will wait to see how they work in cold weather up here in the<br />Tundra.  (WI)  I mounted them on my grizzly on small blocks of wood instead of the hardware provided.  They will not move now.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Just finished the gun deer season and we had some below freezing temps.  The grips worked great.  They carried my gun and crossbow (bow season) perfectly.  I have a tip for those who buy these.  The buttons are harder to push as it gets colder.  If you push the single arm gently towards the closed position as you press the release button it opens much easier and Im sure it will extend the life of the product.  I highly recommend these.
B001C6MKU4|4|It's a clutch not much to say, it works.
B005UGUH4S|5|Very comfortable and just what a TRUE Dallas fan needs
B00HMG5Z4G|1|State is not Arizona shape!
B00WFHZ416|4|Good
B004CS3BPW|2|My trailer door is the within the thickness the description says. The lock fits fine, but the screws are to short. I have to buy longer screws. Also they did not mention it requires 2 different keys. Never had one not keyed alike.
B0067ECPS8|4|Good
B000BUU5YA|5|Don't go camping without it.
B000VJLWIY|5|It fit perfectly. Pulled old one out and new went in.
B00COYNVPQ|5|This was so awesome for my sons car
B00F05VDVU|5|I would buy this again.
B00XZ9NU6Y|5|Got it, took it to the locksmith and now using it.
B001LQOSTQ|3|Very cheap.
B000C9NMUE|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00G7VTN0Y|5|This sticker is f****** amazing! It sticks to anything! The best part is that it is a Texas flag. The best state in the United States. I recommend this sticker to anyone that loves Texas and wants everyone to know it.
B00XPL88NC|5|Very well made. Great solid feel. Highly recommended.
B004A42MZI|5|Got it quick and it worked perfect. not to mention the great price.
B00YML13OU|5|I love these. They're a great idea for anyone who is learning to drive. The magnets are strong and stay in place on the car until you take them off yourself and they're a decent size so anyone on the road will notice them. I just wish that it was a set of 4 instead of 3 so that all sides of the car could be covered.
B00TH99TI4|1|Small O-rings were the wrong size for the 2 inch Ortega. Useless
B009TRBWH0|4|Work great on my 2012 Prius c 4. Directions are poor.
B001D4JG0M|1|Purchased this brake light, not just for the looks (it does look very nice), but also to replace my leaking factory light.  Well, 34 days in (past the return period), I find this one is leaking at least as bad, if not worse.  I was exceptionally careful with the replacement procedure, so I do not believe it is user error (its two screws, after all).  Now, I have an $80 crappy part to go with my $122 crappy factory part.<br /><br />Sorry, I can't recommend.
B004A6JA2O|5|Does what it needs to do for a reasonable price.
B00M8UDCCS|5|I laid down my bike the other day unfortunately. Fortunately tho I was wearing this helmet, here's my story. I hit a cutout patch in the road and lost traction, and my front wheel turned sharply on me ( going about 40mph ) it all happened so fast I could not correct it. I went down shoulder then head first into the pavement. The helmet stayed firm on my head. The aftermath of it all was cracked and broken fairings, road rash on my shoulder elbows, knees, lower back, and possibly a broken knee. ( doctor could not determine due to the amount of swelling ) but the important thing is that I'm here to tell you all this. And for the money spent for this helmet it was worth more than what is asked. Highly suggest this helmet for anyone who rides!
B000EDOSNI|4|Installed easy. Them seem sturdy enough and the smoke darkens the roof slightly
B00UM9XBZK|5|Was just what I needed to complete my project.  All parts were provided with the system.
B00B8B88OA|5|Worked great.  Quality was A+
B00HOA4HXU|5|Easy installation, looks great , no problems. Thanks
B00JF5LRN0|5|very good product use it with my highlander ,drive around 3,000 mile ,no complain
B0014H94UA|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00FSQQ1QS|5|good
B0082365AQ|4|Well made product. It will smell for a few days due to the compositions of the tires/rubber. Leave out in open area, should be good to go in a few day time.
B00QGJGP5I|4|Yeah it's flimsy. But it is great for bag of little things you need to be able to reach easily: a few snacks, sunglasses, etc. I find it works best behind the passenger seat where it can be reached easily while driving.
B001GG2EUG|4|They are hottttttt pink which I love.. I cut them into 2, and placed them in the conner of my car window.. I like them, but make sure it's placed where you want them. They are hard to get off!!!
B004I0JYLY|5|as expected
B00VHSFG1M|4|Cool unit. Bought it for my '02 Mustang - does NOT read that ODB2 data for speedo, tach &c. Works fine in our 2008 Escape.
B0072UPCK4|4|Bottom line, Refund administered , I'm satisfied.  N-Fab Nerf Step Bars seem well made but the size of the company and amount of orders must be overwhelming.  With that in mind, my order was for textured black 3 step per side wheel to wheel (N-Fab D10110MC-6-TX).  What arrived was a gloss black and when they arrived the box was obviously torn from handling.  From the pictures online the product appeared to have a radius bend toward the cab front and rear.  The back end of the steps don't have a radius but are straight cut with a plastic plug.  I think it odd to have one end plugged and the other end open at the front.  I would prefer they both be open or closed to facilitate drying and prevent rusting.  They are a robust product shipping weight 80lbs I guess the shipping company that was subcontracted to deliver was unhappy with the weight as well.  They do come in a cardboard box with plenty of bubble wrap and are fully plastic wrapped inside as well so they must have dropped them in shipping from some height to break through all the protection.  I will be installing them very soon and will let you know how that goes.  Here's to a uneventful install!!!!!!!!<br />Installation was simple with minimal tools required, possible one man install, using something to hold up the opposite end while getting the bolts started.  The directions were easy to understand as well.  I didn't have to drill any holes, they were there already.
B003U1Q47E|5|Fit well. Color was a bit darker than the original piece, maybe newer trim color? Still looks great.
B004K1YU60|1|part doesn't fit; however it claimed to fit my 2009 Jetta can't return bad business
B000MIUHS0|5|works perfectly. great value for the price.
B00BGZ0LKW|4|The gray silicon fob cover fits the C6 Corvette key fob just fine.
B00GD99620|5|I like many others, wasted money on cheaper sensors that didn't work.  This fixed p0320 code on my 2003 jeep WJ.  This sensor is such a pain to get to Just buy this one first and be done with it.
B000CMHVJO|5|Where was this ten years ago?!?! I would not follow the measuring guide for drilling the hole in the tailgate again.  Instructions left me with an extra hole.<br /><br />Once you receive the product the drill guide for the side of the truck was great.  In hind sight I would drill the first hole which is on the side of the truck. Put the tailgate back on the truck and make an exact mark on the tailgate, remove the tailgate, drill hole, and re install (which is what I did for measuring the second hole).  Took about 12 minutes to install with two people (and drilling an unneeded hole).  Tailgate is so light that my wife opens and closes the tailgate with ease.
B00MUEHQ06|1|Too small for GMC Sierra 1500, cheaply made and thin!
B00FJUZY8Y|5|Received the cart sometime before 2:pm today 8/26/15 (the day promised). The package was not damaged.  I assembled it in a few minutes.  No parts were missing and everything fit perfectly. It rolls around my workshop effortlessly. I am very pleased with it.
B00J5QEK3S|5|These covers look and feel great.<br />I installed them on a 2015 Chrysler 200 and was pretty snug getting the back straps to fit on properly, but It just made it and now it's breaking in nicely.<br />One thing I would suggest is to just forget about the little metal clips. Get a few 6&#34; zip ties and it will be much easier and fit very tight without moving.
B00NFFDYO6|5|Very happy with product. Adds an impressive look to my car and plates are made of heavy gauge material. Recommend purchase if interested.
B004GZ56QS|1|This item is for a 2010 Hyundai Sonata GLS but was received broken so I could not instal it on my car.
B002ZTK734|1|She finally got forward controls. Cheap. Dis colored. But working.
B007VEYKB8|2|good pull start the rope that comes in them suck's<br />after putting in good rope it wasted for more then a day<br />so that was cool i gave it 2 stars over the rope braking<br />the first day if it was not from that happening it would of got a 5 star<br />review from me .
B012MZGKOU|1|Have not tested the product yet but my PC detects the min-DVD contains a virus called Artemis!3E3CB7800823 (Trojan) on ScanMaster-ELM v2.1\KenGen.exe. See the attached screenshot for details. Scary!
B0002SQVGC|5|Excellent
B009K6IW00|5|This lights my trunk up like daylight very unexpectedly happy
B00HSTX274|5|Good quality sticker.  Applied easily and quickly.  Fast shipping.
B00QPIQTD8|5|Nice I like it
B004EIAADG|1|These work for a few times. After about 10 charges mine would not charge anymore. Never worked when I needed it. Very disappointed.
B00J4ZCKCS|5|Very good, my moped is not so noisy anymore
B00D9E3GTG|5|Really neat product!  We have used it a few times and it's great!
B00HSHWF92|5|Exactly what we needed to repair our window.
B00EAJNSME|5|As described, quick delivery
B00HVHF22G|5|I love it!!!
B00BAX0MTA|5|Just as expected.
B0031I5Z6M|5|Great Price
B000ET9SA0|5|Thanks
B008RIEQXY|3|Worked as advertised, a thicker gauge wire would get 5 stars
B0068ESK1I|5|Best straps I be ever seen...worth the money.  I got them for my jet ski becaus normal straps keep falling off on bumps.  They also work great for my full size cruiser bike with the handlebar loop system.
B003ZTR4Z2|5|My husband loves this. Very nice set. He gets complemented on it everytime we're out.
B00WW0A1XW|5|exactly what i was looking for
B0009YDQE4|5|Ordered a set for our nissan Rogue. Liked them so much, ordered a second set for our Pathfinder.
B004GZ5M8A|5|Well built
B00ELASYIA|5|FAST DELIVERY, EASY TO ROLL BACK UP AND STORE IN BAG, NO TANGLING. HAVE NOT USED IN COLD WEATHER TO SEE HOW THEY ROLL THEN.
B000GZN7J0|5|Very confident in this chain. Put about 1000 miles on it already and nearly no sign of stretching. I'll probably never buy any other type of chain again.
B0059SA7PG|5|Just what I needed!
B0068EQUDS|3|The listing indicates this item includes two rings. There is only one.
B00G8UI238|5|This is a great sticker!!! It's one of my favorite sayings from the Beatles song &#34;The End&#34;<br />Fantastic customer service!!!
B001EOWRUW|5|Nice fit and solid. Very thick plate.
B000UTQUAK|5|Its great...very easy on and off no issues at all including rust but then this is Arizona and we don't do rust here. I am using it with a FireStick &#34;Firefly&#34; CB antenna and medium spring. I am now going to order another for quick swaps of my CB antenna and my FireStik 2 meter Ham antenna. FireStik is a local Antenna Co. been around for a long time and have always had great products.  Actually you can buy on Amazon for the same or less than locally.
B00CODF254|5|Fits great! The leather is heavy and smells amazing! Patches sew on well and it fits over my riding jacket easily.  It's pretty heavy, so might not be great fro all summer riding... definitely for fall and winter though and spring...
B0072ONV3K|5|Very good
B008S9CHZG|4|WAS AS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
B000BK5496|5|Easy to assemble anud, and fairly wesather proof.  We've driven a couple hundred miles in some pretty nasty weather, and the contents of the truck bed stayed perfectly dry. I highly recommend the youtube video on assembly.
B0052DVSTM|5|I like these. They do tend to fly off. This is my 3rd one. Best to use blue thread locker and tighten them down pretty good
B00KZJQ2L2|5|I recently took a long trip and this screen cooled the car down by 30%.  I had no problem folding it.
B007JWZ34A|5|Fit my Evo 8 perfectly.  Beautiful finish.  Doesn't get too hot in the summer or cold in the winter.  Slightly larger than the oem leather knob and has a nice weight to it.
B0054QPS2U|5|Great product.
B004Y4RP0G|5|great product!
B001KO84JE|3|Kit was OK. Float Bowl gaskets were crappy. Had to use the originals.
B004JV6OMO|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B00WFIK528|5|OMG.....IF YOU EVER HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THIS CHIP LET ME BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU IT REALLY WORKS!!!
B005BF2TDU|2|well... i love how they look, however, i attempted to put them on but the threading seems off. thus, for fear of messing up the threading on the stem i did not force them on :-(
B008WHNHO4|5|A no brainer to install, fit and finish are perfect! It looks great on the vehicle!
B00CNEQZZU|5|Took all of 5 minutes to install. Super easy and work great. Couldn't be happier!
B000CKGAV6|4|Perfect replacement fit. Good light output. Easy installation
B000GD5FMY|3|Cheaply made but the price was right!
B0029UJXEI|3|I wanted a CLING packer decal that would be movable to put on the inside of my car window. This is a permanent sticker. Can I return the sticker?
B00YSGOD1O|5|exactly what I expected
B00IFFGUQU|5|Have a black 2015 Veloster and will say these visors really fit perfectly and definitely added some zing to an already excellent looking vehicle! 5 stars definitely!
B007SJBDFM|5|great product, great price
B00KCBPFHA|4|Nice wallet for the money.  Took out the center card holder which makes it too thick.  Had strong solvent like smell which went away after several days.
B003BZD01W|5|Great product!!
B003D29T4A|5|Great product. Easy install.
B008697KXC|5|Shipping was fast and the key chain looks awesome thank you.
B00LVYRW82|5|Very nice for the price
B00VOLWEQC|4|Boyfriend like it, job well done :). Good size for his car as a decal!
B00WUMVSGG|1|It does not work, the hour glass timer picture is all that comes up. It won't do any thing else.  I would return it but my daughter misplaced the paper work.
B004SSBGH6|5|LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
B0009V1WQQ|3|Lasted about a year before jamming.
B004A11716|5|Good
B004XNESLW|1|The impeller broke when I powered it up.  Cheap plastic junk.
B00PM9OHXU|3|These look terrible and are to heavy for summertime wear.  The reason I bought these was to wear when it is to hot for chaps.  Might as well just wear chaps.
B00RK3H2A6|5|The only way to go if you have a broken boot and no time to pull everything apart. This is way less then taking it back to the dealership and having them fix it. Not a hard DYS project to do either. Works great.
B00MTIF1NC|5|Very cool!  They are great!!!
B00G620ZVU|5|Very excellent product at excellent price! These outshine similar lights owned by neighbor, install easily and are being installed on a number of my vehicles. LED's, as you know, are very easy on battery life  so finding quality at a good price is awesome! Now have purchased extras as Christmas gifts
B00EA0ZB7I|4|They've done pretty well. They aren't as bright as I thought they'd be to start off with but once you shine them just right it lights up everything. The beam could be a bit more concentrated but it's still works well. No moisture in the lens yet after some heavy rain.  Hoping it stays that way.
B00CGTVCIC|2|Not a fan. It wasn't as sleek as I expected and kind of bulky and cheap looking. But, I kept it so am using it and now I don't pay much attention to it.
B005DMZN02|5|Nice set.
B000E8P77O|4|good product, good price, shipping took too long otherwise good
B004WMDVDU|5|perfect replacement
B006VN38M2|3|This appears to be a quality product with a great lock (have had the locks before), easy to put on and easy to remove. Also, it appears to be rust proof with good paint quality. Received this item quickly, tried it on 5th wheel pin and it did not fit. We have a Grand Design fiver, one year old with factory king pin hitch. The lock is just a mm too thick (vertical fit) and would not even go on with some hammer taps. I am attempting to grind down one side of the U (both edges) so that it will go on. The metal is very hard and I have not tried it yet, but want it to work. If it will slide on, I will rustoleum the ground edges and use it. For the cost, I do not want to ship it back and just try another. It seems that the manufacturer would insure just a little clearance and that it would fit all standard fiver king pins? It is a little frustrating that it does not fit initially!
B00DDOSNH2|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B00LPUGWFG|4|I bought the extra pin. Good thing cause I broke it on the first rivet.  I've done three chains. I feel the diameter was a bit large and contributed to it breaking. But the rest of the tool is built really well. I'd also suggest keepin te threads well greased.
B00S7DCN7K|5|Now if Bernie could get elected.
B000IYBEQC|5|Toy Camry 2001 4cyl. I get 28-30 mpg doing 60-80 on the hwy. Removed muffler (less 40 lbs and not too nose) Bosch fusion plugs and i use Amsoil Syn oils.  www.amsoil.com/opportunity.aspx?type=retail&zo=539939
B000TYOS3C|5|Worked just fine!
B00407FUU4|1|No instructions, no screws, no gasket.  I do not install these for a living, a little instructions would have been nice.
B00GHT2V64|5|Great product. Fit the truck as advertised!
B001G7GRJO|5|Good product
B000CSIRWI|5|Spark plug does sparky stuff.
B00MWH72IW|5|Just perfect
B003TQGLFU|5|Follow the directions and it flows out very, very well. And using good rubbing and finishing compounds develops a mirror shine. It's pretty easy to work with and mix can be adjusted to work with various temps and humidity. Very cool stuff. I'll use it again.
B00152RH4O|5|Great seller. Would repeat buy again.
B0058I0T7S|4|So far so good.
B00PY1U8TI|5|Bright but only useful for reverse lights
B00PKFANFC|5|I loved it. It does not look cheap at all.
B000A6X53I|4|good product, good price, shipping took too long otherwise good
B00029KA8G|5|Nice leather cover - the diameter was too large for my 14&quot; steering, but once I trimmed out the excess material and mounted it to my Firebird Formula Steering wheel it looked perfect.
B004C443R6|3|Works well.
B0028MQPTS|3|The oxygen sensor went bad in my 2009 Nissan Xterra and I purchased this as a replacement.  I tried to install it myself, but unfortunately could not access the sensor without taking too many other parts off the car.  My local Meineke took the part and installed it for the cost of labor only.  Labor + buying the sensor online came out to less than the quote I got for a turnkey job from a local mechanic.  I'm going three stars because I still think it's too expensive for what it is, as are most car parts.
B00TEF4ZZI|5|Cute decal.  Fast delivery.
B00HVVVEYM|4|ties loosen over long haul but it is perfect for what we need
B0051D3MP6|4|works great
B004O9ZB3E|5|It was exactly what I needed and the condition was excellent.
B009CNYJG2|4|For the price unbeatable
B00WWZC432|5|So cute. I usually am not the bumper sticker type, but I put this on my new HP laptop and it's really cute.
B003VBGE3C|5|Works good and fits.
B00JH1HR5E|4|as needed and looked good. just remember to re torque lug nuts after a short drive. The finish can come off cause the nuts to come loose
B002A6RIRA|5|Bought this from horn blasters and I couldn't be happier. Installed in minutes and works great. It is running with Monroe max air corvette shocks on a 2003 Honda vtx 1800 retro. From 0 psi to full extension of the suspension takes roughly 15 seconds. That's with me on it and I run around the 220 lbs mark. So it's doing great. I had a Honda goldwing compressor on it first and it took several minutes to even start to pick the bike up. If you have a doubt or are trying to go the cheap route, DONT. Get this first. I promise you that you won't be sorry.
B008QR1AXU|5|Great for the price. They last a while
B002OQVCDM|5|the headlight was excellent my Santa Fe looks brand new now!  thank you!
B00CIOAJC0|5|Perfect, Just I needed
B00MC46NL2|4|practical product
B0002SQYTG|5|Nice gauge.  Good quality/good accuracy/good price
B00W4IDIGE|5|If you stick it like the instructions it'll be last through everything. It makes my car looks very different in a good way.
B000BQW5LK|5|Yep, made filling my Differentials a breeze
B0009SQQ1A|5|Works Great.
B00KTIYXLU|1|Did not work
B000XW47SQ|4|Worth it's weight in gold
B00KTJ9I46|5|The description said it would not work with my 2001 Nissan frontier, however I decided to get the product anyways and they worked flawlessly it only took 30 seconds to program.
B00C7XVYBM|4|Originally, I was looking for a gray one to match, but this particular handle is worth what I paid for.  So far, it is still holding up well
B003BZD08U|5|Very functional.
B00W3ZSIVI|4|Did not fit the bike we bought it for return process was easy
B007ZLLLZK|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00WTKIS2G|5|A must I bought after market halo fog lights, which came with no harness at all. This harness works perfectly and I was able to adapt the fog halo so that it runs with my headlights halo in the day time. Really a useful piece for any aftermarket fog lights.
B0049C6CE8|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00GOXWRIU|5|great quality and perfect fit!
B00LLV4DA0|5|switch is rated for 3 amps at 250 vac. this is not a good switch to drive a 12 volt load this is a good switch to drive a relay that is driving a load and wire the 12 volt normally open side of the relay (load side) to the 12 volt positive pole of the switch and put a ground on the negative side so the switch illuminates only when the relay is actually driving the load, this way you are aware if something goes bad.
B0015YC0PI|5|Great quality
B005CLNUC2|5|great door handle. replaced my original handle in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ half doors. Look and function perfectly.
B008SEBQ2G|3|Does not have strong signal
B00KBZON0C|5|excellent!
B00LQGR38E|5|Took the guts out of the old one and works great.
B00NRG0EO6|1|Don't buy this snow plow for Can Am Commanders.  The mounting plate has two 5&#34; long tabs that hang down and interfere with your ground clearance.  The plow system has quick disconnect pins that work fine, but when you disconnect the plow you're left with a mounting plate that then needs to be removed and reinstalled every time you want to use or move the plow system.  The mounting plate cannot remain on the side by side if you plan to use your SxS for any hunting, climbing, trailing or four wheeling activity that requires any kind of ground clearance.  This is a really bad design!
B000C7ZUF6|4|great product
B004KEL4LG|1|WARNING Part is described as a Solid State Relay.  THIS IS NOT A SOLID STATE RELAY.<br />Description when I bought item &#34;HELLA 931680011 12V 20/40 Amp SPDT RES Solid-State Relay&#34;<br />I received matching part numbers and I confirm this seller and listing is misleading.
B00HVGS256|2|The diameter of the product just ahead of the oring was 10 thousandths to big (1.975 vs 1.965). It would not fit into the hole in the engine. Rather than return it and waste days, I ground it down to fit. The connector pins were not straight and had to be forced to fit the receptacle on the engine. Just some poor quality control at the factory. Once installed and plugged in, it worked fine.
B000C2EH14|5|Valve Cover set worked Great. Was able to stop the oil leak
B008D2VWE0|4|works fine
B00RW4MCDA|3|Had to do some cutting to make it fit right
B00NM3MOLU|5|I love my lashes! I purchased them back in September 2014 and had them on until today. I had to take them off, the last person to close the hood on my car closed my lashes in the hood. I did not realize it right away and now my lashes have been bent back for so long and with me living close to the water one of the lashes broke off. As others have said the tape does start to wear after a while, especially with weather changes and such. It is to be expected. One side of mine had been half way detached but stayed on for months still.
B003AYUXGE|5|Good product, I used two of these to mount a 20&#34; LED bar on the front of my Polaris Ranger
B001U04NCA|5|Love it<br />Thank you
B007CDYWSE|5|Nice product!
B00MD1R9XA|5|Love the decal fast shipping wish you had more, and ones with a different piece of equipment.
B00737GY3U|1|TERRIBLE CONSTRUCTION! Wire gage is way too thin and cheap!
B007P5DTA6|5|makes my 06 duramax a total launching rocket!
B0041Q5BG2|5|What a difference in my riding comfort! 10 minute installation, highly adjustable, look great. Well made.
B00N23UDE0|5|Amazing! They fit and feel like my $200 pazzos I had on my old bike! Would recommend these to anyone! Look dope!!
B000BQQN2M|3|springs are too strong,i am currently looking to replace springs with something with less tension
B0026M9D80|1|The old worn out shocks worked better then these things.  For all the time it took to install, these are a piece of junk.
B00M9II09Y|1|Not at all like the photo......but still works ok. Like vacu-form plastic and came damaged. needs a blinker module too. NOT stoked.
B00K3XW4TO|5|I Bought This Lip Last Week And Wow I Couldn't wait For It To Get Here! Once I got it I installed it and had the perfect fit no need of a heat gun. Super fast shipping and great for the price. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone. Only took like 30 mins to install !!
B003U2HUMG|5|Awesome! One key for all the my trailer locks!!! Works great.
B00KCQSIRY|4|It was good product it looked nice for such a cheap product it works  it looks great feels great
B0031H3CP4|1|This compression arm is low quality, replaced both sides along with other brand new suspension parts from Mevotech in December 2013, ......15,000 miles later, its now August 2015, the bushing has come apart from the housing.  I will keep an eye out for the other bushings since the same company manufactured them.  Mevotech never again.
B00B8KF7L8|1|Less than a year till worn out. Very disappointed in Raybestos. 31 year Auto tech. The people I purchased from though were quick on shipping so they get 5 stars. Raybestos gets 1
B00LOLTWUS|1|Replaced item in April and as of today not even 5 months the part has went bad again costing a lot of time and money to repair the problems this has caused
B0009IBJAS|5|works well
B004W4ME8G|5|Great quality, medium difficulty installation but very worth it
B006LO4L6I|4|I should have bought 9ah instead.  Lasts about 15 minutes on a razor electric scooter.
B00AGAGCRE|1|Needs to be sealed alot better i have it mounted uo high on the back of the truck and now has moisture in it and no longer works
B00QJ4QI2U|5|This was exactly what I needed. My original key broke from the casing.
B00L8431Q2|5|excelente
B003XVJOXC|5|Beats the heck out of cheap, imported cast iron master cylinders.  Great for non-power brakes.
B001GJ3E5C|5|Great brush Mother's!! The rubber inserts to grip on to it are great.  Bristles are sturdy and are great for scrubbing carpets indoor and out. I'm sure it will last a long time.
B008OAE982|5|Replaced this arm from the original (which flew away during a wind storm).  This one is more heavy duty than the original and it seems to function more easily.  The one before jerked up and going down.  This is more smooth.  Would recommend this over the original.  Shipping was on time and the product lived up to it's expectations.  Would recommend this vendor to my friends.
B008SERWQA|5|Perfect
B00897P2U4|3|Received one of the brake pads and one sensor cable broken. Had no option but to make it work since we already opened the brakes and I didn't wanted to spend extra money on labor. Luckily the car had only one sensor and there was a way to make the brake pads work. The product overall is pretty good, I believe it's the packaging and quality check that needs improvement.
B00B0CPPC0|1|This was not a direct fit for the 1979 honda 110 atc
B003YCEMUA|4|These towels are great. I use them in the ktichen and they pick up messes pretty well. However, after a couple of washes they are still a bit rough. I am hoping that they will get softer. Another downside is the color. It would be nice to see patterns or themes to decorate my other kitchen towels.
B010GFDAK0|5|2000 Tahoe. Seats were worn out. For the money  these are great covers. Better fit than I expected.
B007ZCQD9S|5|luckily i had an old discontinued unit from rostra so all i had to do was splice in the new unit. works awesome.. also make sure you use the small black boots for the ball chane to other pieces it will save you a lot of headache. i didnt think i needed them so i left them off, i was driving around and it was working and then i hit the brakes and then the next time i tryed to set it it woldnt work.i went through the whole troubleshooting and everything checked out fine and i happened to look down and noticed the cable came out of the clip
B00JXB2DZC|5|Great headlights, really bright, they look<br />So cool!
B009SX0J88|4|8-26-2015: This product works as it should.  However, there is a simpler way to mount a gps:  http://smile.amazon.com/Garmin-Portable-Friction-Mount-Frustration/dp/B002OL2MU4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440657130&sr=8-1&keywords=garmin+dashboard+mount  I use this weighted mount for my Garmin--simple and foolproof.  Plus, it can easily be removed for security, without leaving a telltale circle on the windshield.  Security?  A thief sees the suction circle, or the RAM mount, and thinks it is likely there is an expensive piece of electronics in the vehicle.  Smash and grab.  Unfortunately, car alarms don't attract much attention.
B000BN3A4Y|5|present for my sister
B000ALDYJI|3|Very brittle after hardening
B0000AXNMO|5|Love this stuff.  Makes driving in the rain no problem at all.  I do not even need the windshield wipers when driving above 40 mph.  I can see so much better when driving in the rain, because the rain beads right off of the window.  Fairly easy to apply, but it will need to be applied about every three months to have full effectiveness.
B001DKV5H8|5|Prolong is an excellent lubricant. Don't get me wrong, you'll still see jerkiness in the morning when you first start your car and accelerate from first gear to second gear in an automatic transmission. However once you're engine warms up, you'll see a dramatic reduction of up to 80% in force due to the heavy acceleration and mass of your vehicle in terms of transmission transitions. Perfect! No more whiplash injuries
B004GED3NM|5|It fit as expected. Looks great
B00BK7MYEW|3|PROS:<br />- works as intended<br /><br />CONS:<br />- tiny<br />- should be more like $9.99 at most
B0085X4IZM|4|Pump is great, easy to use and really nice having both outlet options. Accuracy is a bit iffy hence 4 stars but I use a pressure gauge to check and make sure as a work around.
B0006IX87S|3|Had this before and it worked good, we are at a seasonal site now that the water here is well water and has a bad oder and lots of sediments in it.  Camco filter helps a lot, Con's is that it restricts the flow of water and as a result looses pressure. it works good but only last about 5 or 6 weeks. Update!! as of 1 week later it was so packed with  sediments it stop the flow completely. this one only lasted 3 weeks.
B003VAL5OQ|3|Really cool, gives your keys some character, smaller than I thought and the little black part will come off the metal chrome piece if pulled hard enough, I baby them
B002GUELES|5|good product
B00WRQA8UW|4|Easy to apply &agrave;nd looks good on my 2015 Outback. The manufacturer, however, advises against using of strong cleaning solutions on the product. It is unclear what will happen to the product after I take my car to the carwash...
B0024NSMWY|5|fit the van perfect, still in use no issues at all.
B007V2BMSY|5|I have been using a Covercraft UVS100 in my other car for ten years and it has held up quite well.  Covercraft does a good job cutting these accurately for a nice custom fit to the windshield.  I recently purchased an Audi S4 (color-Black) and this was the first aftermarket item I ordered.  Its made a big difference in the summer heat and is quite effective. I can't imagine getting into my car with black interior without this Heat Shield.  I looked at other Sun Shields but this is made with superior materials.<br />One thing to be aware of is the heat shield is made out of foam core board covered with a vinyl wrap.  The foam core board can crack if handled roughly.  If you crack the foam core it will never be quite the same.  It will not fit as snugly because it won't be as ridgid and that will cause sagging which will let in sunlight and heat.  You just need to take some care when folding and unfolding it.<br />When I have passengers in the back seat I stash the Heat Shield in my trunk and then I don't worry about it.
B000EVU8X4|5|Works
B00D3QUIUA|1|Easily torn apart, lack of protection to the product.
B00AZPUF96|5|Fit perfect finally a way to keep all the sand and dirt in one place and get rid of it at once!
B00L31QCPC|5|this may sound weird but I'm really grateful to this product for keeping my family safe from danger. thanks!
B00AWPQK8E|1|It would help if the item described was shipped. Out of 2 RMA's I received 3 different covers, all black and for different Seadoo's models. The item states viper red and black, I got all black 3 times!<br /><br />The cover does what it is intended to do but I would expect it to be as described in the information.
B00UIUUYDK|5|Excelente
B009IJQ8HS|5|I had this product years ago when I was actively boating and remembered the convenience and storage advantages over a conventional hose. Now that I am an apartment dweller, I purchased this product again for the same reasons. Good quality and fairly priced!
B0006IX7W4|5|Worked great to hang lights from our camper awning.  Not sure if you're supposed to remove the plastic parts when you roll the awning back up, but we decided they were small enough to leave (we did remove the metal hooks as we wanted to make sure they didn't damage the awning).  The metal hooks were large enough that they held our rope light with ease.  Much better that using spring clips to hold up your lights.
B001QVD07M|5|Thank you to all who answered my question.<br />Good quality,<br />Fits rear wheels BMW 530XI 2006.<br />I saved $400 by replacing my own<br />rear brake pads and rotors and I have<br />a hard time working out which end of a screwdriver to hold.<br />My first time doing anything like this.<br />Give it a go, plenty of good &#34;how to videos&#34; on Youtube
B0097MXLTE|5|fit the van perfect, still in use no issues at all. comes ready to paint
B00LNOV2VS|3|The cover fits great and looks beautiful.  I had trouble installing it though, and I am very handy.  First, the wrench supplied with the cover did not fit the bolts.  Fortunately I had a set of hex wrenches and was able to install the side clips.  Secondly, one of the hand screws on the corner clips is completely stripped out.  I did not use excessive force.  It just stripped right through the aluminum fitting the first time I tried it, and now is not very secure.  Overall, I am liking the cover.  I just think the materials and installation could have been better.
B00BCRMA9Y|3|Good for certain vehicles.  Not mine.
B00WLJII3O|5|PERFECT!  Fits my 2015 Volkswagen Beetle key perfectly!  I love the color....exactly what I wanted!
B00AZ4TU98|2|I had to return these because they did not fit my 2002 Tundra SR5 although they were supposed to- bought another brand and they fit perfectly!
B009TAKBWE|1|Not a direct fit, for a 2007 SAAB 9-3 convertible.  Another reviewer mentioned they were recalled, not sure if they have an updated mat yet.
B003CGDSBC|1|I don't recommend this for anyone mounting this in a JKU on the angled bars. Fire extinguisher flops around too much. Poor design.
B00KYSTDNI|4|Very happy with product would recommend
B007JZKBVW|3|If need a real xenon color white then need to get the ballasts and xenon bulbs, otherwise this diamond white will not give you xenon 5000K white (at minimum)
B00KZD8HNE|5|My car looks pretty bitchin now. I 100% like this product. The projection is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but when people open the door, it leaves an impression
B0015AEHY4|3|While functional and adorable, the side connection does not snap into the mechanism like it should. I'm afraid to push or pull too hard as it could &#34;pop off&#34; as one reviewer said. I am going to contact the company and let them know. I am somewhat disappointed because this is a licensed Nissan product and there should be better quality control.
B006573KF4|5|Bolted right on my 07 KTM 450 XCW. Very high build quality and very sturdy
B009DJYAIW|5|Nice
B008V1D1LU|5|right thing for right price
B00K65NIL2|1|This product is a waste of money, I tried to contact SLK for product support and got No response.  The Installation instructions where vaige and generic... Had no real information on how to use product... Any research done on the web search shows up as SCAM products  Don't waste your time or money
B001IH8Q0A|5|I love either the powder coating or the thick paint! I really dislike towing assemblies the look so bad because of rust!
B001GC9E1C|5|Had to cut it down to work on 7.3L Super Duty, but I knew that when I ordered. The shorter model was not in stock. Worked great and looks even better.
B00H9T3X3G|5|Great stuff. Lowered my oil temperatures and increased my gas mileage.
B004HE1YLY|3|Stops nice no shake but makes high pitch noises when going down road till you hit brake and noise goes away
B00FJUEO12|5|Great cart. Great price. Will buy again.
B00J5KRUHM|5|It fits perfectly on the floor behind the front seat. I like that the base is wider than the top for stability. The lid is a nice feature. I have not put much trash in it, but I have used it to bring home leftovers and take out food! That way I don't have to worry about it spilling or leaking all over my seats. I just got it, so we'll see how it stands the test of time.
B0051ZXGI2|4|Perfect fit for my 2011 GMC Terrain SLT1 (front). Less than an hour to replace all four front pads. So far so good.
B00YWGSI84|5|Thanks
B00E8TAEZU|5|Husband very Happy with his new toy.
B000F2KSKA|4|Exactly what the doctor ordered. Black interior on my mazda3 and huge dash surface make for hot interior in summer even with AC on. This reflects heat and allows AC to do its job more easily. Fits perfectly. Inexpensive.
B001AVW05Q|5|works great.
B00GD8OL62|3|Very dissapointed as the light is more of a blue light than white.  I purchased the Cyrstal Vision rated at 4000k and they are definitely white with the same illumination distance as the Diamond.  To me the Diamond is somewhat hazy and does not provide clear vision.
B004BWU8H8|5|My vehicle: 2015 Wrangler JK Sport, 4-door.<br /><br />Just finished install.  Fit is nice.  Seems sturdy and secure. Overall, I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />Install Notes...<br />My 2015 does not have power seats.  Under my drivers seat, there is an overly large bracket that holds the wiring for the seat belt connection.  This bracket hangs low and was preventing me from installing this lock box.  I had to remove the bracket (unnecessary piece anyway) and then the install went fine.  Removing the bracket was very simple, but the screws are at a weird angle.  Luckily, they are not put in with much torque or any thread lock<br /><br />Not sure about the existence of this bracket on other model wranglers though.<br /><br />The seat bolts...holy chr***.  I didn't use my impact gun, but I really wish I had.  Great workout if you use a simple ratchet with socket.
B002P8V7WK|5|Solid replacement mirror:<br /><br />I ordered this mirror to replace one on a Nissan Altima that was side swiped. Very cost effective solution. I would recommend purchasing both sides so the mirrors match as an alternative to painting them.<br /><br />What I did was plastidip both the new and existing mirrors to make a perfect match.<br /><br />Not much else to say about this product.<br />If you need a replacement, this is it.
B000OR18BE|3|Perfect size for week long family camping.  Assembly was pretty easy. HOWEVER first time using not so good..... the hose that came with the tote had all kinds of holes in it!! Needless to say this created a very angry husband and further expense as we had to purchase additional hose at campground for more than I would have had to pay if I had the opportunity to shop around (never mind the fact that I should NOT have had to buy another hose).
B001O22NVM|5|This solved all my ignition problems!<br /><br />I have a modified Pontiac 400 that requires a specific timing curve that is hard to obtain with weights and springs. My first distributor was professionally curved, a Pertronix Flamethrower. It worked great at first, but one day it started retarding the timing rather than advancing when rpm's increased. I never put 300 miles on the car and the $$$ distributor was junk. I temporarily put a Cardone distributor in with light springs to get by until I came up with another solution (MSD locked out distributor with this MSD 6AL2 programmable ignition box).<br /><br />Tip: Lock out your distributor and use the built-in software to set your timing curve! You can set starter cranking timing so it's not so hard on the starter turning over your high compression engine. I set 16 degrees between 0-500 rpm. Remember the software you set the retard, so think in terms of setting your timing all-in, then work backwards with the software.<br /><br />You can read my full review by searching your favorite search engine for &#34;mods and rods tv MSD 6aL2&#34;, should take you to my blog post which includes pictures and more suggestions.
B00GHRSKTI|5|Hey, it fits, costs a lot less than the the dealer price. Not much more to say
B00FLNKVYQ|3|UPDATE:  6/15/16...  It finally died.  Of course, 13 months after I bought it.  (Warranty is 12 months)  I treated this with great care, and I am very frustrated that I already need to replace it.  I have no regrets, as it was awesome, and never gave me any fuss.  However, I bought LED due to their longevity.  Obviously, that wasn't the case here....  Hence, I must degrade the review to 3 stars.  At least I have an extra 25' cord now  :   9/15/15  My shop foreman bought a cordless Snap On for $250, and his battery lasts about 2 hours.  Meanwhile I plug mine into my lift outlet, strap it onto the hood of anything that comes into my bay, and wrench without interruption.  Sure, cordless is a bit easier, but I don't have to worry about leaving mine on.  Two brightness settings are nice, but I stick with the brighter.  Light output is FANTASTIC!
B00W0X2X1E|3|This program indeed is a good program and works, however better instructions would have saved me a lot of time. It does well with Windows 10. I spent a lot of time looking on the web for instructions that worked. Finally I came across RheingoldUSA and the YouTube video instructions got me to a point where I could figure it out and it works well.
B00HE90MZI|5|Used them to modify a Tiffany A/C chandelier for our RV. Had to fabricate them into an A/C socket in a cluster of 3. Works great
B001KO6KS6|5|Replaced factory air cleaner with this. Much nicer installation.
B0040CYZQ4|5|PERFECT
B00O1C2L7S|5|thank you
B00P8CVKO0|5|Very  nice!
B0073METK0|5|Radiator arrived on time,  description was 100% accurate. Fit in with no problems (2003 Ford Ranger Edge V6 4.0). I noticed others had issue with tranny lines, I had no problems. I lined them up and hand tightened almost all the way in and no worries of stripping. Truck runs cooler with this radiator. For this being made in china I am truly impressed with the workmanship and fit.
B001OMATUE|5|Looks amazing on my truck. Thank you for the great product
B00P6MX8LA|5|Very nice stickers and are extremely visible
B00753S8CC|5|They were fast and its looks good on my car
B005K0LSXS|5|Good
B00XZ9OMAC|5|Works great, would order another from here if ever need one again!
B006VWT4UI|5|THEY LOOK GREAT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I . I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME... SUPER EASY TO INSTALL !
B003SS62PS|5|Great.  Bought to use for when I travel with my therapy dog in the hot Philly summer.  Blows the air conditioning back to her in the back of the car while I am driving (I do NOT leave her in the car).  Clip holds well to my headrest but doesn't open wide enough to clip onto the center console cover of my Honda.  Not loud at all.  Fan can oscillate or hold steady with a simple switch.  Head moves in any direction.  Working great for this purpose.
B0049Z2WMQ|5|Used when changing the knock sensors and wire harness on my 2001 Chevy 1500 HD. There's a lot of cheaper gaskets available but I figured my OEM gasket isn't in bad shape after 15yrs why not use an OEM gasket again. I've had it in for over a month & drivin from LA To Monterey while towing 6,000 pounds and had no leaks I highly recommend
B000182DII|5|Great carb, only issue I had was my fuel line was too small to fit over the fuel filter inlet, but a little bit of drilling and it's running great. The factory tune isn't perfect but it's good enough to be a daily driver.
B00C58D47G|1|Came with no wiring diagram ended up ruining it
B004QEKGA0|5|Following other reviewer's advice, don't tighten all the screws until you get the whole thing together. It was pretty easy to set up. Took about 30 mins with 2 people. Fits and hold our belongings nicely. Just watch the exhaust.
B0009IQXG8|5|Great leather conditioner.  Cleans and conditions.  Helps hide small scratches and dry areas. Highly recommended.
B004N5S5PA|4|The tank fits perfectly in my 2002 F350. It is very well built and attractive. It is so nice to be able to travel many more hundreds of miles before fill up.
B001AVQOQW|5|Fast delivery  and easy to install. looks great on my lt230s
B0002MABJG|2|Poorly made, very hard to keep in place as it so flimsy. Luckily, it provides a psychological deterrent to my dogs so I am keeping it in place.
B0058DIAPG|5|They make my wheel look classie
B00QHZV7IQ|3|The product works as advertised but could use some help. The camera body is produced out of very cheap feeling parts<br />and the quality leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi signal seems sufficient for the task of backing up to a trailer but<br />it does have some lag so watch out for your bumper. The usb charge port is directly opposite from the lens so when you have it on your tailgate pointed at the hitch the charge port is facing the sky so be careful using it in the rain, this unit is NOT waterproof.<br />Overall the concept is great, the price is a little steep for the quality and I would probably look around to see what else is out there before purchasing again. That being said I own it and use it almost everyday.
B001N74DDY|4|Worked great. A little pricy for what it is.
B001MXL71A|5|Works great.  Just keep an eye on the duty cycles.  Easy to use and long enough to reach all tires without any issues.
B007OW6MD6|5|works great
B000BNS9FE|5|I just replaced an older identical Westin Bull Bar. I got it standard shipping in a timely manner. I'm completely satisfied. Installed in about 15-30 minutes, which included removal of the old one.
B004INCV3Y|5|Very easy to install. Adds an even more richness to the look of my white Ford Edge.
B00RGGQ19U|1|I cleaned the surface just like the directions said and a couple days after instalation they were already falling off
B00LH8PFYK|4|Had to do some modifying to make it fit, but great plan!
B00OTYPC9M|5|Very nice covers, they fit really good
B00651CLCS|3|Ordered my 2nd one in about 6 months; first one broke for unknown reason.  Cheap enough to simply replace.  Reception is not the greatest.
B000UKHHQ0|5|Works great, gave me the room I needed to shift in MX style boots and pegs.
B000OAG63G|5|Exactly what I wanted. Very good quality, but the hose could be longer.
B001R93JV0|1|It was a Tyrannosaurus Rex not a Brontosaurus.
B003L9K9HQ|5|Put a large ball bearing in the bottle to help shake it up. A must have to save your chain. So many friends gripe about poor shifting and a few drops and time to penetrate.  Problem solved.
B000FQ7A7U|4|I ordered and installed this in an early (1966) International Harvester Scout 800 because mine was missing. Looking at all the parts houses for IHC parts, a replacement accelerator pedal is about $80 &#60;gasp&#62;. I could see that for some of the later more complex pedals assemblies, but these old scouts are very basic, much like the early Jeeps, and Willys. Many of the parts do interchange, as they all used parts from the same sources, as well as each other's parts  back then on their assembly lines. At any rate, this at $20, and it being almost an exact duplicate as the old Scouts used, I saved $60 bucks, and it installed and works like a charm. Took me a total of 15 minutes to install, and most of that was instructing the wife under the Scout to start the nut. I would have given this a 5 star, because it works well as simple as it is, and the quality of it is &#34;ok&#34;. Not as heavy of course as the original, but they never are. If it were made in the USA I would give it a 5 star. But, even as much as I hated to put a product of India on my 100% (now 99.9%) Good ol American steel, I say again, $60!!! I could use that on another part I need worse on the old Scout.
B003ZWHMGU|5|The deal was great!
B000BGJWA2|3|Had to cut to fit.  After that works good
B005JV912S|5|Perfect!!
B00HNW8MJ4|3|I like it. Thanks
B00G6DE8KS|5|Good lights!
B008MISDII|5|Recommended for my scooter
B00ELHTC5C|5|pretty expensive but worth it
B00N2DLJRU|5|Fit prefect
B0081SQY1W|5|Love this product!  I received two holders! I gave one away to a friend.<br />It is so easy to use. The holder is easy to place on the rear view mirror, and it is<br />easy to remove it!
B009S9RURU|5|Too funny and too cute
B00I0H27EW|5|Fit great!
B004AIJ0W2|5|It was  what I needed! !
B000O0WOFA|5|right part worked great
B000S2UGWC|5|I replaced the rear lifthatch glass switch button to my 2007 GMC Yukon. Installation of this item took approximately 2-3 minutes thanks to install video i viewed on Utube.
B00496RDVA|5|Did what it was supposed to do and working well now hopefully it lasts a while
B001INL9JE|4|Good quality, bright color. Stands out really well among my other stickers.
B00H1I5NMY|3|??? don't know because had to cancel the order
B00NTU18KY|4|I bought it because I was curious how much power my usb chargers were actually putting out.  the display is easy to read, cable seems durable.  I wanted to be able to calculate how much power my solar panel was putting out, but the panel didnt output enough to charge the batteries and power this device.  it would have been nice if I were able to plug it into an alternat power source, so it wasnt using power from the source.
B008G1WT0Y|4|Easy to install. I did use one old clip off each light. New ones were to hard to get on post.
B007JKPUUE|5|I installed one of this drain plugs to a 2012 Honda Odyssey. It's been 4 days so far and there are no leaks. I noticed that the original drain plugs are slightly thicker and with slightly smaller opening (hole), but this ones seem to work just fine.
B000F38HVG|5|Wonderful quality and fit. I just wish they included a roll of Velcro instead of just a few strips. To get it to fit nice I would use more Velcro around the vent openings and around the whole outline of the dashmat
B000V6SX5M|5|These look so adorable hanging off our camper awning.  Get lots of comments :)  Fast shipping and compact shipping.
B00ODF5ED6|5|Very happy with the quality of the license plates. Thank-You
B00LGIHYHC|5|We love the board over our gas stove in our RV.  It stays put when traveling and gives us much more counter space in the kitchen area!

B008IK7TSA|5|As described fast shipping
B00A5UEOLG|5|Easy to install, leaves large enough spaces for common items.
B005O52SLK|5|Great deal for the money. Fits my wife perfectly and she loves it.
B000NV2OQE|1|This did not fit my '06 Dodge Ram 1500. I looked up the specs twice to make sure I was ordering the right part but it did not want to fit and it arrived late. Not happy.
B0097MX32O|3|there ok
B00V9XGQ5U|5|Great trunk organizer with little pockets in the front.  I love anything that makes life more organized.  This is a great item to have.  I was surprised at how sturdy the sides are, it makes it seem like a good quality organizer.  It folds up so it's compact when not in use.  I have a small place, so being able to fold it up and carry easily is great.  This sure beats the cardboard boxes I used to use to organize my trunk.  My favorite part about this organizer is that it has 2 different compartments, even the little pockets in the front which are a very useful thing to have.  The handles are a great idea for carrying groceries or items to the beach.  Great product!  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
B00PQWN5DQ|1|I bought because of need for 100 psi gauge for my new high pressure RV tires.  The diameter is only 1.3 inches, too tiny for my eyes. The distance between markings for 10 psi, for example 50 and 60 psi is less than 0.3 inch.  Too tiny for my eyes.  Even worse, it is not accurate.  Measured pressure was significantly lower than shown by my other two gauges which agreed with each other and have worked well for over ten years.  An inaccurate and too hard to read tire gauge can be the difference between life and death for tires.  I sent it back for a refund.  I am looking for a gauge that is at least 2 inches in diameter, easier to read and more accurate.
B00HAPEUNQ|5|good
B00BITKGL0|3|they are ok
B00URS6F5Y|5|looks great and easy to install.
B007QBR8BA|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000CPCRS6|3|I tried using it for my craft to use as a see through type of thing. Didn't turn out well. I did not use it for its intended use. So cannot give a full honest review.
B001FAO8I4|2|poor materials
B0002UNON8|1|I was going to buy QUIXX paint repair pen but the their bad reviews guided me to this product, I  shouldn't have listened. I applied two small amounts and it actually seemed to make the scratch more noticeable. Meguiar's please direct me further or I'm returning the product. Disappointed! And just learned it's not eligible for return! SCAMMED
B003WDEYPE|5|ok
B006TMMJ52|5|Cant tell it apart from the OEM taillight on the passenger side. Fast install with 3-10mm bolts.
B0016KFWGU|1|did not work on my 2002 expedition.
B012JHWQ80|3|Ehhh. Not bad not great. Definitely need to take time and throw heat at it and fit is a bit large requiring razor trim. Worth the money if you don't want to remove factory emblems.
B007OW6MD6|5|Perfect fit.
B00TJ8ECF8|3|left mirror mount broke after three days of rough trials.from vibration,
B000BGJWA2|5|fast shipping, packaged great, works good no problems, fit great
B003VLBPJA|1|didn't need it
B005M229Z0|5|worked out great and came with mounting tape
B002ZTGN5U|5|fits like a glove....!!!!!
B004X96ECW|1|Garbage cap doesn't come off. Paint watery.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Works great. Stops stuff from falling in between the seats
B0000AZ9J0|5|Great price, check around. Made a 3 step job into two. Very respectable Fisheries Supply store guided me to this 3M product. $58.99 there.<br />It worked well, did not use electric buffer as the areas were to cluttered to do so. My old arms felt like they were going to fall off, but great results.
B000C57XEY|5|Great product
B006YTTV4W|5|This stuff is awesome for sealing head gaskets/side covers on motorcycles.
B004HZKZ7M|3|Agree it fits fine but as another reviewer mentioned the bottom needs support  and thought the net would be a little tighter.
B005O01NPW|5|This did the trick and replaced my broken mirror.  Saved lots of money with replacing just the interior mirror and this sticks to the backing really well.
B00ONHW10S|1|Did not fit my 2004 Silverado either, Amazon still has it showing that it does. Going to return it.
B001SZIFJY|5|fits pretty good!
B00EZUL6ZY|4|good product, good price, does what it's supposed to.  Can't complain. like the weight, seems sturdy and heavy.  fits my 2015 rav 4
B007Q92GT6|4|I bought this because it held the most CDs for its size. The outer shell is stiff and holds its shape. The blue color was accurate as pictured. I stuffed it full with the max # of CDs and they all fit. You do have to push it together and kind of force the zipper around when its all the way full though. The main reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of all the time I had to spend tearing off the extra plastic cut-outs from all 20 double sided sleeves. You cant put your CDs in until you do.
B00IKSRTBM|1|Wow, 2 DOA.....Remove Old Light, Install New Light, Hook up, NO Light, Unhook, uninstall and reinstall old lights...nice.
B00XKY89AG|1|This is something that is not very durable, has no bottom support and you can't move this without everything piling up in the center of the box. It needs support to keep this more stable.
B003FXNCQS|5|Must have for any off-roader!
B002669U3O|5|I ordered this item on a Monday and it arrived Wednesday. It took me all of 20 minutes to unpack it and install it on a  2011 Sentra. Great item
B00QPI35XA|4|Gog these promptly in the mail. Overall im happy with the lights. I gave it 4 stars for two reasons. It does not have the mounting hardware and they only have one row of LED's. Aside from that the quality looks to be decent and the LED's are bright. For the price I can't complain.
B00EWSE5HA|5|Works beautifully on my 2008 Hyundai. Took only 2-3min to replace. No more visor falling on my head!
B008OEQ6WU|3|Took almost 2 months to get to me so I couldn't even use my buggy for that time safely, with it running well.  It fit my Baja Motorsport Dune 150 fairly well, I did have to remove my carburetor in order to put it on but that was not a problem.  Overall I would recommend this.
B0000AY4YT|5|I have used this kit before on an older boat, it worked very well. Brought the hull from a dull look back to glossy, just follow the directions and you should have the same results.
B00OXMDTSG|5|A+
B00OZ5OIFE|5|We're using more and more USB/5V devices, such as MP3 players, cell phones, bluetooth adapters, etc., but our old vehicles are lucky to have a CD player and a cigarette lighter. This solves at least one of those problems! The adapter fits in the socket nicely, has a small blue indicator light that tells you if it is powered, doesn't protrude more than about 3/4&#34; from the socket face, and provides more than enough power to multiple cell phones and an MP3 player at the same time to maintain AND top off the battery. Perfect!<br /><br />Do keep in mind that, if your cigarette socket is key switched, you'll should be fine to leave this in the socket. HOWEVER, if your socket is always on, this adapter will also be always on, and it might run down your battery over time. For us, one car is always on and one is switched, so the switched just stays in the socket and the other is removed when the trip is over.<br /><br />Hope that helps! Highly recommended if you're looking!
B00LHMC710|3|Not as bright as the picture shows
B000BQYA7W|5|Works great
B007GR3UC0|5|Fits
B0000AXPDU|5|Good
B006IUVFKK|5|Good very Good!
B0041CDPQO|5|Dose the job. I like it. Easy to connect.
B00H9KHA4S|5|Fits perfect and does the job here in Houston.
B00RMEDMYS|4|good fit
B00BEZKGM2|5|Great product
B00QN2SZQK|5|Look good and work perfectly on my 09 Tundra.
B008MISDII|5|Recommendedfor my BMW R1200 GSW.  The motor is running fine with this oil.
B00MGESELA|5|I bought one of these for my team's design competition this past year. I was a little concerned about the size of the board, but it fit perfectly in our robot. It does what it says it will. We were able to successfully connect 2 motors to the driver and they worked simultaneously. There was no difference in speed between the motors (I've ran into this problem with other drivers before). Simple assembly and compatible with an Arduino.
B00FYX2E66|3|I bought these seat covers because my car has leather seats, and I hate it when my legs stick to the seat in the summer.  These seat covers accomplish the goal of keeping my legs from sticking to the seats fairly well.  However, they curl forward along the sides, which doesn't look very good.  They also move around easily on the leather seats, so I have to be careful about how I get into the car or they get a folded crease, or move around to much and my legs end up touching the seats anyways.  I'm looking forward to cooler weather so I can take them off.
B000JFHNQA|5|Has never let me down, No stupid stuff like an air compressor that doesn't work, a flashlight you will never use, no switch to break because its always on(great feature). Starts anything that I hook it up to, lawn mower, big block chevy, big ol' diesel in -20 no hesitation. Way better than waiting 10 minutes for the crappy jumper cables to charge the battery enough to barely crank over. Worth every penny
B00PWG6AC4|5|Perfect fit on my truck keeps sun out.
B005P5DSW2|5|Perfectly fits my stock 255/75r17 Goodyear tire on my 2011 Wrangler sport.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Easy to setup and works fine.
B00EC0Z8T2|5|fast delivery, and great materials, exactly what I'm expecting.
B00BT1GS3W|5|Got these to fix a fallen window in a 2002 VW Passat. Works perfectly.
B00FNXBTMC|5|Great price, exact replacement, does the job as expected.  Could not ask for more.  I will be ordering the same as we update our UPS'
B003VAYK48|5|Used this to add a third roof top ac. I cut the wiring at the wall switch for my ceiling fan and tied it on to this so i dont overload my panel or branch circuit. This installed nicely its just barely deeper than the rv walls so i just trimmed a little off the black rubber backing. The install was very nice. I have no worries about water leaking as the rubber seal is a good quality and plenty wide. You can install this with three screws on the outer flange or a large threaded ring from behind the mounting surface...or both. I did not have access behind my mounting location so I only used screws on the flange. Very good quality product just plug in a 20 amp extension cord and your good to go.
B00M78820I|5|I bought this shade for my 1977 F-250 and it fits great, it is thin and slides behind my tachometer that i have sitting on my dash. Which is what i was hoping it would do. Customer service is awesome, 0 complaints. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00K5NEIOG|5|Way better than sheep skin. This is more absorbent and easier to use.
B000C8RASK|5|ATP GA-4 Carbon Activated Premium Cabin Air Filters fit my 2002 Silerado, so I am happy with this product.
B00475I38K|4|Excellent value for the money and the shipping was timely. One minor caution. Be sure to inspect your items as mine came with a tab and guide broken off on one of the lamps. I was able to fashion a quick fix but before you get headlong into removing the old ones, inspect the new ones first. Other than that, I found this to be a terrific transaction!
B001KQD7YE|5|Got a old 2002 f250 with power locks that never worked. After some Web search found it to be a common problem. Bought one at first be to sure it was the problem. Installed it and it worked. I ordered 3 more for other doors..
B00JU3QPIO|5|i like it
B000COBCF6|5|Just what I needed.
B005HV9SPK|5|Great
B003CVKWXY|4|It fit as expected. No problems so far.
B006N9I7BG|5|installed smoothly, no problems, fit as expected
B001PWFPE8|5|does its job well
B00KNCB3HY|5|Gorgeous! We just recently bought a second car for me, a 2008 PT Cruiser. the car is bright blue same as the floor mats. The mats really brighten up the interior and make the car look so nice. The mats are heavy and appear to be very durable. Although they are trimable, they fit the PT cruiser perfectly. Very, very happy with this purchase!!
B001GH1PTG|5|GREAT
B0015C8HT8|5|I use this in my suv to keep things from flying around in the back. I dint not think that the plastic locking mechanism would hold up but it has for the last six years. The elastic is still as good as day one.
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Good absorbing!!! Spilled lots of drink on the kitchen floor, like 2 gollons, 3 of these towels absorbed it all!!!
B00QG1NJYG|2|This cover is too thin, the wind blows it right off my car.
B009KUEVWY|5|it was a new genuine toyota wheel cover!
B001NIAH9W|3|I have had this for only a few months it seems strong and is doing its job, but i have noticed that it is begining to sun bleach already this could lead to it failing quicker than it should.  Will post additional comments if it does fail prematurely.<br /><br />v/r<br />Rocky
B008VLVDII|3|its ok, basically I put my kid's car seats on top of it.  Center has a shoulder strap that I will have to rerun.
B002807SF0|5|As described, arrived promptly
B00EHHV2OU|5|Have had no problems getting accurate air pressure & tire temperature readings from both truck and travel trailer while towing without need for an extra receiver.
B00OMIPV96|3|I purchased both the clear and the tinted visors. I have yet to put them on the helmet because I just bought the helmet as and purchased these for future replacement. I also purchased due to several reviews commenting on the original visor distorting vision somewhat but that was not my experience. Everything looks great but I can't give it more stars until I actually put it on.
B000EDSSDY|5|Best level for all around quick check for level.  Good price too.
B001HC0QXG|5|Great price with fast prime shipping!
B00L40ZQGS|5|This fan is ideal if you are working off of solar power or rechargeable 12volt battery's. It does not pull that much ohms so it will last all night on a small battery. I have made my own rechargeable battery box with USB and car charge adapters with two small motor cycle battery's and have use the fan on it for a whole night and still had 10volts left the next morning. That was a constant pull on two 12volt battery's on high for 12 hrs with no charge. That's not to bad. I am going to buy another one soon.
B000KKOGLO|5|Great product at a great price. Fast delivery
B00Y1HSY1A|4|Arrived on time and money well spent
B0056GUSNM|4|Works as it should works as it should
B00IN5BVZ2|5|Worked and fit. Sold car a few days later.
B00523AV54|5|You can really taste the difference in the water.  I love this filter!
B001GJ3F3S|1|Says you can use it with water, do not do it... Streak, streaks and more streaks
B00080QHMM|5|works well
B003RQBKLC|5|this keeps me from having to take turns with electronics in the car.  works great.
B001810SHA|5|Worked great on my 89 Dodge RAM 1500. You have at least an idea of what you are doing and be careful not to over-pressure the system.
B00YD2HVOE|1|Said that it comes with instructions to work, my vehicle was on the list. Does not sync,
B00KTIS83Y|2|just o.k. the hard plastic is harder to push but works fine for the price
B005GGLXCM|5|This product makes my car look brand new and beads the water like crazy. No more dull finish. This product works.
B00FSDBP8U|5|Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Quick delivery, also. I highly recommend this seller.
B009IYFR34|2|Too little light output for my purpose.
B00NF180US|5|Fit great
B007KSZQU4|5|Great value
B004ZF3YD6|5|Great product with great customer service
B00LOS5TJ4|5|Perfect match for 2000 Bear Tracker.
B000OEDQQW|5|great product!
B000ETUD22|5|Makes changing wheels studs a breeze!  I was able to swap a stud out in less than 5 minutes on my subaru.  Normally you'd have to pull the hub to hammer or press a new stud in, or use washers and old lug nuts with an impact gun to pull them through.  Neither of these are optimal since the first is time consuming and the second puts unwanted stress on the new stud and usually messes up a few washers and lugs nuts.  This tool is great, it rotates on a bearing allowing the lug nut to simply pull the stud into place without much force at all.  I would definitely recommend this great tool!
B00KQNPL0U|5|came in a good time, everything works great thanks!
B0041C8YPG|5|87 virago 1100  perfect fit ..well made tool
B00KFM900O|5|I'm expecting to put this on my truck next year.  2016
B000NOUQSY|5|WORKS GREAT I LIVE IT
B0009JB7GI|4|Very bright. Great cord length
B006FUT09G|5|best glass cleaner I've used
B009FU7ELE|5|Bilstein when nothing but the best will do the job.
B00HV2KH9E|4|Install difficulty depends on one's experience. I've done this before so it was straight forward. Refer to YouTube if unsure, there are at least a few solid instructional videos.  2013 Tacoma 4x4. 3&#34; rise on the front, 3&#34; rise on the rear. Rear end slightly higher. If you're going for a leveled look then substitute the 3&#34; blocks for 2&#34;. From the factory, Tacomas typically sit a little over an inch lower in the front to compensate for ass sag when the bed is loaded up.  Took a star off for the insanely long u-bolts included in the kit. Grinding is necessary in order to cut the 3+ inches of excess thread hangin down from the rear axle.  Tacoma owners expect a negative caster. Anything over a 2&#34; lift will throw the truck out of factory alignment. Camber can be dialed in properly but at the sacrifice of your steering's pivot point. No big deal if you can live with the minor steering float at freeway speeds. Focus on your camber and your tires will last longer.  In case you're wondering.... My Tacoma in this photo is sitting on 275/70/R17 BFG KO2s. 1.25&#34; wheels spacers to allow UCA clearance (I love my stock wheels). Front mini flaps removed. No pinch weld mod required.
B000BZJP3M|5|Appears to be very high quality. I've always had good luck with BOSCH products!
B00EC2CA0K|5|Heavy duty
B000EQ9OB6|4|good product, good price, shipping took too long otherwise good
B00K1CSEFA|5|Best sticker i ever bought
B009XIWRXI|5|GREAT ITEM
B00KC66OMK|3|I like these interior door lock buttons, however, the threads are wrong for my application. Check the fit before ordering
B007NGBGFC|5|Great love them
B004KEIIXS|1|After waiting 2 days for the tool to arrive to repair my out of service vehicle I was completely let down.  I can only assume their idea of a &#34;universal&#34; pulley holder is different than everyone elses!  Bad picture of only one view.  EVERY other &#34;universal pulley holder&#34; I looked at on Amazon, or auto parts stores online looked exactly like this one and had the pins to hold my water pump pulley.  I made my choice by price, and Prime eligibility.  It appears I bought the ONLY &#34;universal pulley holder&#34; that only holds ONE TYPE of pulley!  Thank you so much!  Now I guess my Jeep is down for the weekend!  Im NOT paying for &#34;overnight&#34; so it can be delivered on Saturday!
B0053ZJXVY|5|Got it on time and have used the product before. Works very good.
B013SAJ1FS|5|The Rum River Tool Co 2 Cycle Carburetor Adjustment Kit is a nice set with Splined, D, Double D and Pacman Tools. The tools are sturdy and no handles are loose. The tools come in individual plastic bags for each and then the whole set is in a sealed plastic bag.  They come backed by a money back guarantee which is always a plus! The tools are the most commonly used and will work great for tuning the carburetors on most 2-cycle engines.<br />We will mainly be using ours for outboard motors, lawn equipment, and for chainsaws.  The tools are just the right length and you can get good torque with the handle.  The handle is a textured and very tough and they are formed to fit your hand very well.  I can get a grip on them even if my hands are oily or wet.  The texture makes all the difference.  Overall this is a good set to have around and will be useful for anyone who has many of those 2-cycle engines around that need constant tuning.  My friend was just pricing them on ebay and the 4 piece set was going for around 30 dollars with a case so the price for these is pretty good.<br />**I received these for free or deeply discounted for an honest, unbiased review,  My opinions are my own and not influenced by any business or person.**
B00K87WD8C|5|WORKS GREAT!!! BEST 30 DOLLAR FIX FOR MY BEAR TRACKER
B009D41M9C|5|does what they are meant to do
B000FJ1MAI|5|Works as advertised, delivered on time. My old but still strong and reliable 2000 Honda Accord needed a replacement, so went right along and got this part. Installment wasn't too hard, but to make it easier I did need a special tool from my cousin to make this a 10-20 minute process. Works well, now the car doesn't threaten to stall up at every stop and goes back to purring just fine. Recommended (and needed, if the 'check engine' light reveals this to be the issue. Don't ignore these warnings, they're legit!)
B000C9RTSA|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00OGO9EXU|5|Great looking oem parts!
B00ASY23M6|5|the T connectors behind tail light are very short could stand to be about 6 inches longer.
B00F8IDD1W|5|Great, keeps the car a lot cooler. Steer wheeling not so hot . I live in Arizona
B00WQBU4YI|5|Really works well.
B00802GIW4|5|I just installed these headlights, but overall the quality was good. Everything seems to be well made and weather tight. As of now I highly recommend this system, and hopefully I will get a long life out of all of its components. The only thing I would say that needs to be improved is the packaging of the product for shipment, as there was some movement of my system in the box during shipment. Otherwise the lights look great and were very bright.
B005Q13BI6|5|Its a battery. It fit. It works. nuff said.
B003G6AORE|1|i bought this radio a little over a month ago and just got around to installing it and it doesn't even work! It won't turn on or anything extremely dissatisfied I waisted my money on this thing!!!!!
B00WRIYG7Q|1|The sticker that I received was not properly printed.... my sticker reads..ITALIAN PRNCESS... THERE IS NO &#34;I&#34; IN PRINCESS.
B008OJ85M4|3|Not a review, but after reading a bit on another website, it is basically for hauling bikes, and the extra hitch extension is for adding another basket or bike carrier. it is NOT intended to add a hitch ball to it. here is the ifo copy pasted from the WMASTORE:<br /><br />RAIL HOLDS 400LBS MAX. + CARGO SHELF HOLDS 400LBS MAX. + 200LB TONGUE WEIGHT RECEIVER=1,000LBS MAX.<br /><br />IMPORTANT INFORMATION: ITEM# AM1306B OUTSIDE RECEIVER PURPOSE IS NOT FOR TOWING TRAILERS, ETC. THE OUTSIDE RECEIVER RECOMMENDED USE FOR BIKE RACKS OR HITCH BASKETS.
B0085TKJ5E|5|Not bad at all! Put on a motor bicycle and look great work well. Very well made wouldn't recommend for a street bike because they're a little small in my opinion but do buy!
B0052FRS4O|2|handles did not fit my 96 corolla. the stems were too long so that the handle did not sit flush with the door. sending back. don't believe it's an actual OEM part.
B006T7AS6Y|5|Beautiful...a little pricey but it's as described.
B000C9PKNQ|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B006OQ35GU|5|Much easier, no guessing if holding tanks are still releasing contents.
B000CPAFXK|3|Installed on my 2000 excursion, it's a little longer than stock but nowhere can I find any info on if I need to move the oem bracket...as it is you can't move the braket unless you go out and get new larger u bolts...the original ones sit in grooves on the bar...and stock shock it on the last grooves...
B007Q1DQHK|5|Worked great, saved $$$ vs going to the gm dealer.
B00OCEFQGS|1|Received mine today.  the threads for the head fit on the barrel is very sloppy.  It was leaking grease at the head/barrel threads so I took the head off and put Teflon tape on the barrel threads and screwed the head back on (very carefully).  It is still leaking some grease but not much.  I have to grease my travel trailer wheel bearings twice a year.  Not sure it will hold up for even that light duty.  Be warned.
B00QSDYC8E|1|Dont buy
B000FQ7QWE|5|This really finished off my dash on my 78 cj5 well worth the money
B007Q3O5E6|1|not loud enough!!! Hella is louder!
B0031HI0HY|5|Product as described and met my needs
B00NFF2N5C|4|For the price what do you expect? It is a shift knob with universal adapters. Part of the description says they are rubber but they are plastic that is the only reason I took away 1 star.. otherwise it is solid, has the weight I expected and the H-patern design on top looks nice.<br /><br />If you want a cheap shift knob this is one.. It is rather small around but the measurements in the picture are accurate enough.<br /><br />I drilled out one of the plastic insert adapters to be large enough to be forced with a hammer over four stacked m6 sized nuts that were threaded on an m6-1.0 x100mm bolt. I used that as a shot shaft shift kit for my sim racing thrustmaster th8a shifter.
B0009IQYBC|5|Same as I have been using in the past
B009YR00MI|1|Item arrived on time (Thanks Amazon!) with the packaging in great condition. Upon removing the item from the box both side panels appear to be slightly separated from the unit. When the unit is moved you can hear a clunking noise and a large shift in internal weight as if the battery pack is free moving. The side panels themselves do not feel loose although they are clearly not in the correct position. Afraid to turn the unit on and start a fire with the insides moving around. I was under the impression Duracell was a quality brand?   Update: Amazon wont take a return on this product although they offered a refund so the boat anchor I received it at least free.
B00MGTS1WW|5|very good product use it with my highlander ,drive around 3,000 mile ,no complain
B00FGKGI2I|5|Let me start off by saying I buy and use lots of products from Chemical Guys. I find most of them excellent and urge anyone to give them a try. They are like Chemists gone wild. lol Their prices are reasonable. Now,I recently bought New Car even after the reviews posted here and I think it is much better than what others have written. I simply sprits the interior of the car twice (two trigger pulls) and that lasts about a week. The stuff is on the concentrated side so DON'T spray too much. A little goes a long way. The smell may be strong at first but it mellows out within a day. It does not smell exactly like a new car but it does have a smell that is rather pleasing - not tropical or fruity. I can't describe it other than very clean like. Like others, I have tried other types of air fresheners like Fabreez and this smells the best or even the nearest to what a new car should smell. I actually use it around the house. Anyway, give it a try.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE (5/10/11): Be careful wha... Read more
B000C541W6|5|Fit perfectly on my 2000 Chrysler 300M and it rides great.<br /><br />This was way cheaper than what was quoted by the mechanics for the EXACT part number.
B00M3ILR5Y|4|Good looking hubcaps. Just what I expected, they look better than the stock hubcaps on our '09 Impala. Decent price, easy to mount. So far, so good.
B005PCBOU8|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  It's sturdy enough and seems like it'll last for a while.  Great for the price.  Be aware, audi rings is a sticker but seems like a durable one.
B0097CDPBI|3|The fobs worked fine after programing and then one of them just stopped working. I changed the battery in one of them and its working fine now. I guess I need to do the same with the other one and reprogram them both
B00JRV1V2E|5|It works surprising well. Takes a little finesse to realize how it works but once you figure it out you can pull out all the injectors no problem. The price is high for a tool you might only use once, but knowing I could easily pull injectors made it worth it.
B002LOP5IA|5|love it will be getting more
B0006VORDY|5|the best camp stove you can buy
B00CLVE430|5|I was so excited to get this since it matched my car perfectly - I never looked to see if I had a place to attache a front plate.<br />I don't so it looks just as good hanging in my office.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Brought the boys to college and it supplied the additional luggage space needed to get down to school with one car.  It attached to roof rack very snugly and no problem driving the NJ Turnpike.  Would highly recommend.
B010XZRQCG|5|Very impressed with this little bulb. Put them in my backup light and cargo lights on my 13 ram. And what a difference they make. One bulb I had only the top LED bulbs would work. So I contacted alla and they are sending me a replacement bulb for free. So great customer service also! Very pleased
B00WOY33EA|5|Easy to install, and a permanent fix.
B00KTIUG5C|5|great
B000GV3FLY|5|Very nice bag.  I rode to the airport several times and used as a carry on.  It's a bit big now that most airlines are cracking down on size.  Very sturdy.and doubles as a backrest on the bike.
B002VW3OVC|3|Great product, but 3stars since the description didn't tell it is 1/4&#34; O.D. Line. I was still able to use the switch thought, with a T from NAPA.
B00KSO87SA|5|Nice
B00C9DO4SA|5|fit perfectly and works as advertised
B0013FBQXG|5|2007 Chevrolet Avalanche 5.3lt, direct fit. Perfect description and easy installation.
B000C9RXSQ|5|bought three of these for my front axle rebuild,replacing the 20 yr old stock units,fit perfect / price is right / fast delivery.
B002PCFYN4|5|Product as described, Works great.
B00KMAS6UE|2|I realize this isn't an issue with the seller, and more an issue with the manufacturer but I figured I would let people know of the issue I've had. The bushings I recieved were correct but do not fit properly on my exhaust hangers causing the exhaust to be able to shift excessively. I'm currently in the process of proving this to return the items purchased. Will update once everything is set I will say MAPerformance has been very prompt at answering my emails
B000AA4RWM|5|Works well
B007NLQO0O|5|I am happy these are a good value with the filters and washers.  It has worked well for my 2013 WRX.
B00C5SKX1Q|5|This emblem is actual lightweight metal, not plastic, thus it is a much higher quality than I had expected - especially for such an inexpensive price.  The finish is very good, the enamel color stripes appear well-cured.   The only con is that while there is a custom fit adhesive foam back already applied to the emblem, it is not the expected 3M gray automotive quality tape that the ad seemed to indicate was present, instead it's a regular white foam tape, which will likely degrade after a couple years.  With that said, at this amazing price point for a very fine quality emblem, I can't knock any stars off - if you're worried about the mounting tape, just do what I did & replace the provided foam with a piece of 3M automotive foam tape - you can find it for ~$5 here on Amazon.  Excellent Product!
B00GLLW3AM|5|Awesome lights  BRIGHT
B0083K2O62|5|These are great quality racks. I believe they are manufactured by Yakima for Subaru since the straps have Yakima imprinted on them. I bought two sets, and they both fit on my 2014 Forester with 10 foot kayaks on them. Installation was easy too, once I figured out exactly where I wanted them placed. I would buy again!
B00MATVMC4|5|Nice military tank.
B009HCOOMM|5|The wiper is OEM so it fits as it should and works well. Received the wiper quickly.
B00MQMG8OM|5|Fit perfect
B003N9MQCK|5|These are fantastic! I tried them out at first with just some ice water, and it stayed cold for hours. The ice, even, stayed frozen for hours. I was actually amazed at how long my cold beverages, even if I leave the lid completely off, stay cold. The same goes for hot beverages (well, minus the ice staying frozen), which is impressive as well in its versatility.<br />Sure, the lid doesn't have a secure hole in the top, but the mug is sturdy enough to not be knocked over at all easily. I suppose if you're looking to put 34 ounces of hot or cold beverage in a bag and tote it around without it spilling, this isn't for you.<br />But if you want a hot beverage to stay hot or a cold beverage to stay cold, you've found the right product, and at a great price.
B00KMUE7D4|3|But these pads were not a very good fit within the calipers, and I'm not sure whether they are exerting even pressure on the rotors. I have a good comfort level with them.
B0046DQTQQ|5|Love it!
B0051PJWQW|5|Good quality and price.
B00TPX8WWQ|5|I looked at several different bed mats for my 2015 Chevy Colorado and this works perfectly well!  It's very easy on your knees if you're loading/unloading from the back of your truck or just want something that looks good in the bed of the truck.  It goes on very easily with two very strong velcro-type strips.  I personally found it easier to put the velcro strips on the truck bed first and then walk on my knees on top of each side of the BedRug mat to make it stick securely.  With both strips on, the BedRug isn't going anywhere!  I liked this mat better than other brands because the ridges contoured directly with the truck bed and because the mat does not hold water at all.  You can throw whatever you want to on top of the BedRug and it still looks great because you can vacuum or pressure wash it when you're done.  So far I'm very impressed with my first BedRug purchase.  Getting the tailgate BedRug next.
B007CDYWSE|5|I've been using these in my 2006 Volvo XC70 for a long time now and have found them to work perfectly.  The quality is excellent, the oil stays clean, the engine runs nicely with this installed and the price is better than most other filters.  This filter also fits nicely when installing.  My oil change interval is 5,000 miles and this filter does a very nice job at that interval, even with a good deal of hard driving.<br /><br />I do not use Fram filters in anything because I found, long ago, they are of inferior quality.  My engines are worth far more $$ than some cheap junk filter.<br /><br />My favorite oil is Car Quest brand generic full synthetic.  It's Valvoline oil in a cheaper bottle with a generic label, but it works very nicely and the price is very good.  Napa may also have a generic full synthetic that is the same oil as well.  Napa and Car Quest have been using Valvoline for their generic brand oils for many years.  I also replace 1 quart of oil with a quart of Marvel Mystery Oil.  All the engines I've done this with have functioned very nicely, for many, many miles.
B00L4TF32G|4|I've used this product for years and my vinyl pontoon boat seats have continued to be protected.  The only reason I can't give this product 5 stars is because the product claims to be good for 30 days upon an application.  I find this NOT TO BE TRUE.  In order to maintain the protection, I've had to reapply each time or every other time I uncover my boat.  The shine of the protectant noticeably fades after a few hours out in the sun.
B00BPAK9BE|5|i have tried one of the key for catterpillar and it really fits perfectly...nice item and a big help it you run out of option to use got alot of different keys....highly recommeded...but they need to add  the key for electric forklifts too...
B00HXJ8MBK|4|Love the pattern of these covers, they are sturdy and thick enough that I am confident that they will keep my seats clean.  Only downfall is that they're not very easy to put on.  It took two of us to get them on and then about an hour of pulling here and there to get them to lay in a way that didn't have any ripples.  Once you get them on, they look great though.  If you're willing to mess around with where you clasp the S hooks for these then you'll love them, just make sure you set aside an afternoon to get it done.
B000BWE242|5|Chrome  rusts paint them as soon as you buy them cheap chrome
B00LLZFIJ6|5|Smaller than I expected, but it works exactly as advertised.  Although I have not used on a car window, I did test the breaker on other items, and it definitely packs a wallop.  The blade edge of the seat belt cutter is also ready for action, and was very sharp, such that I have no doubt it would cut multiple seat belts with ease.  With their size, utility and price, I really don't know why everyone doesn't have one.
B000KKLLFS|3|They are tire valve caps. They do the job.
B003RWYYPK|5|Perfect!  Easy to program with the included instructions.  Works great!
B0002RNSKK|4|Works perfectly- Now have a legal trailer again.
B0046I9FSU|1|The item works on and off it work for a time Now it stopped
B0007ZAJRM|5|good price
B003WLXR5Y|5|Installed and worked well.
B0016I4NRG|4|This hitch was installed on a 2009 Nissan Xterra and has done well. That being said, I have done a similar installation on a Chevy pickup, and this installation was not quite as easy as it should have been. I did not have to drop any of the exhaust hangars as was indicated on a couple of the internet videos I watched. Maybe this was required on a different year model Xterra. The issue was that the mounting holes on the hitch ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT line up with the mounting points on the frame. The were really close, but as hard as I tried I could only get 3 out of 4 to line up at any give time. I initially though that the problem was due to the fact that I was laying on my back in my driveway and it was about 95 degrees outside! So, I packed it in and took it to a nearby auto service center where they put the truck on a rack. After the two techs there wrestled with it for about 20 minutes with the same result I didn't feel so bad! They ended up reaming one of the holes in the hitch very slightly and got all of the bolts to torque all the way. I have no concerns about the installation with the very slight mod that had to be performed, but it did cost me an extra $30 for their labor that I should have been able to keep in my pocket if the hitch were designed with a little better tolerances.
B00VHFAZ8O|5|exactly what I was expecting
B00RK7EZTI|1|I loved how this looked....thought it was very classy BUT I had to send it back for a refund after only a couple days because it ripped!  I did get my refund very quickly though....bought a Silicon one instead that does the job....
B0009JKI72|5|Super easy to install and love the quality
B00CASDZKC|5|Bought the for my new 2015 Honda Oddesey. Works great when you have 3 toddlers that do nothing but kick the back of your seat with muddy sneakers. Great product that fits snug
B001GJ3DZS|4|nice
B00YWN49YY|5|They fit perfect and look grea . Looks like when she was brand new!
B00KTJ7ZXW|5|Works great! Great price!
B00AFK2ORC|5|Daughter bought for her boyfriend He really likes them
B004SSAFAU|3|Works well enough if you just want to keep dust off your car when parked long term in your garage, but this fabric does not hold up well for prolonged use outside.  Flimsy and can tear.
B00144D77E|5|Direct replacement on my 1979 evenrude single lever control.  Diagram on back of switch packaging
B0083W16SM|5|We needed a new carburetor and it worked great.
B004NJNKFG|1|adhesive poorly works on my dashboard. battery died in a few days. caliberation annoyed
B001B7A2OU|4|Runs a little louder than the old one. Other than that, it is working well.
B00G23NN0S|5|Prompt shipping looks good on my Honda civic si awesome!
B001AR67VS|5|Good
B0051S60TQ|5|Good quality gloves. Used them for cosplaying Captain Hammer, and they were perfect.
B008ZTX05K|2|Didn't fit  I wear Large on my other helmets. This one fit my Daughter (12 years old) so I gave it to her
B000C2UKLA|5|I took a chance buying this online and I am glad I did - it arrived with the alternator and is better than the orginal Ford belt.  Gates is only slightly more than the replacement belts you get from online autoparts (and instore) but the quality and noticble durability is well worth the money.  This belt was a perfect fit for a 2004 Ford Expedition with a 5.4L V8.  It's also quite with no notible noise at all.  Highly recommend buying a Gates belt over the cheaper replacement belts.
B00274JM7E|5|Perfect... as described.
B00IEYDZTC|5|Great deal and speedy shipping
B00JZR3IEO|4|Wish the wires were shrink wrapped so they would not look so messy in use.
B008NO5YUG|5|Easy install, inexpensive, and works.  What else is there to say.
B004WLXRGC|5|perfect replacement
B00Q43YFD0|5|Delivered right on time and product exactly as described!
B000IG5PZQ|1|After a couple of weeks, it lost two hours on the clock.  I'll just throw it in the trash.  It was cheap.
B0008F67JU|5|As I expected
B00186BF36|5|Great product
B000J3G8FY|5|exactly what I wanted
B000BTNVQA|1|Never buy
B006GFLI0O|3|The one size fits all doesn't always work, this beanie is a little big and comes down over my ears but I'll get that fixed.  It's a good product for we who are bald because it keeps our heads from laying against the floor whenever we are Crossfitting.
B008FXT5WI|5|Perfect
B001JT0EZ2|5|A set screw in the toggle secures it tightly. These make it so much easier to toggle short posts. Very well made.
B00316Y2IG|4|Thought the whole item was metal; the only reason why I did not give it 5 stars. Great style and easy installation.
B00092893E|5|BMW recommends this exact product at every oil change for my M3.  For them to make a recommendation for a non BMW product when they don't have a co-marketing deal going makes me feel it's valuable.  I try to take excellent care of my car and do a lot of maintenance myself, so finding this online and being able to dump it in when needed is great.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Nice and big for my truck window ...
B004HYSIUY|5|FITS GREAT
B00J65ILO2|5|Good stuff at a great price!
B00U6G798Y|5|Very happy with these.  Very sturdy and great looking.  Easy to put on.
B003LZ4IK4|5|Yeah its the real deal puts out 12 volts and 30amps in indirect sunlight .. Have not checked it in sunlight because its cloudy out  but that's good enough to maintain any battery .. I will buy another one if needed .. http://www.amazon.com/UPG-SOLAR-PANEL-CHARGER-ALLIGATOR/dp/B00A8K7QOK/ref=aag_m_pw_dp?ie=UTF8&m=A24WV2YRRJEBAG
B000B6AFE4|5|Very good
B00KXK0GNI|5|Awesome
B00853NUMO|5|They were as advertised and what I wanted at a good price
B0001XPCCC|5|generic-like, but fit fine!
B0022UP9V6|5|Great product!  High quality.  it so nice that I hate leaving it out in the rain.  It keeps my bike dry and clean.  EAsy to put on and take off.  I highly recommend it.
B00AQ2O9FO|5|Great replacement for rubber lines
B007TYQZVS|3|Hasn't been installed as of yet. Husband said he didn't think it would fit a 1991nissan truck. Rating to be determined later
B00M482H8Y|5|Excellent.
B003AL23TC|5|works great
B00KVU70NY|5|They work great and came to my house fast.
B00L9NELES|5|Looks great in my 97 Silverado. I can see at night a lot better also. I do recommend getting some.
B002ZTK9B4|5|No complaints. Pretty easy to install. Looks good.
B00VGL6LY6|1|Did not make a tight connection.
B000RMT7UK|5|how this adheres to plastic without sanding !
B00VZ4L68A|5|Excellent and looks super sleek on my Nissan Juke
B003FBV8ZW|5|great price, great product. a different set for each time of day.
B007I7D66S|3|Work great for a short time then they start flickering. Had to replace all but 2 of them within 6 months.
B00J62Z9EK|3|No problems until it came time to actually put the side rail onto the bracket...holes only line up one direction, not sure if it is correct tho since the directions don't say if the curve goes towards from or rear, and the picture shows a straight bar. Also, the brackets don't angle up enough to meet the holes to hold the rail at a level angle. I had 12 large locking washers that were not used anywhere in the instructions...I was unable to complete installation and will have to pay someone to do it.
B000C9SP4W|5|Perfect
B0024E6W02|4|Works as it's supposed to. Like having two 10ft sections compared to a long 20ft one. End caps are nice also.
B002NUABUO|1|Don't buy this, this doesn't do anything, you would rather put coke on to you rust area than this useless spary.
B000A09MGI|5|I came back to the Fram Air Filter after I purchased an off brand the last time to save a few bucks. Is the Fram Air Filter better than the rest? I didn't conduct any scientific nor air flow tests or whatever. But, I do know the build quality is better than the off brand filter - and whether imagined or not, that gives me confidence. That's why I came back to Fram quality. Would you rather have name brand Pepsi Cola / Coca Cola, or grocery store branded Cola?<br /><br />This review is my opinion - and your experience can be totally different. I'll try to report back as I use this over the months ahead should anything noteworthy occur. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I'll try my best to answer in a timely manner.
B00DNX94E4|5|I love this little bag. I was looking for something small to carry a few things on day trips. Exactly what I was looking for. The magnets are awesome too. I've had my bike upwards of 100 mph without any movement at all.
B009DJSEM0|5|great fit at a great price, good company to deal with
B004O3YV6S|5|Great product
B01092I9LA|5|Fit well and are good quality. I have a 2012 Nissan Sentra SR. Happy with my purchase.
B00C0XCHKG|5|Worked like a charm. Installed in about 10 minutes. The shipping is what impressed me the most. Standard shipping and it arrived the next day!
B008SA5YN2|5|Fantastic distributor for the price. Just finished a dyno session on a Chevrolet 355 ci. this unit was able to help produce 513 hp at 5,800 rpm. out of the box, perfect dist. for street  performance. running, edelbrock 2x4 air gap intake, dual edelbrock 600 cfm carbs, 1.5:1 compression, Pro Comp heads, hooker pro comp long tube headers Milodon 7qt pan and Amsoil 10w30 oil. yes there are more expensive ones out there and cheaper ones as well, but I am convinced this is a great distributor for the price. And I have wasted money on both, with 48 years experiance as a state licensed journeyman mechanic. And a lifetime of street , circle and drag race experiance. This engine is now in a 27 Ford flat top Tee coupe, and it is a beast, weighting only 2,500 pounds. The engine now has 6,000 miles on it and still runs strongI have been using and installing Pertronix ignition parts professionally for 44 years since 1971. Mke sure you use only high quality spark plugs gapped .040 to .045, quality secondary wires, timming  set properly for all stages of advance including total at 32 to 36 degrees. If you dont have the tools or experience to set it up right, shop around for a professional with the correct understanding and knowledge of all igniion systems to do it right,
B004QQ8SEY|4|great
B000HAB7B4|5|These work much better than the &#34;Keeper 05637 Movable Anchor Points&#34; that I purchased earlier for the little Carry On utility trailer that I use to haul the riding mower and four-wheeler.  No matter how much I tightened the other ones, they'd move around.  Not with these... they seem to stay in  place much better.  Also, these are much easier (on my arthritic hands) to loosen/tighten (using a wrench) than the other brand with the pin and wing nuts.  I'm definitely ordering a few more pairs to keep on hand when I need them.
B007SXQFP6|5|Worked as advertised
B0006JO0X8|4|This is a good quality product. It works the way it is supposed to.
B00MXC0BFM|5|good
B000GVOQDK|5|good quality material. easy to work with. I needed to modify it as my battery has side terminals, works great
B000WJ3LMS|3|The red coating is already coming off and I have only used it 1 time for the safety wire on my exhaust headers. This tool will probably function forever but isn't going to look very good... Who cares, though. It is cheap and does what it is supposed to do.
B00WTL4AWM|5|Exactly what I needed, cheaper than the local dealer
B000BRQ0TW|5|Fixed the hole in our hard plastic pond.
B003VGO8SK|4|nice quality-not exact fit, used old hardware to mount
B000A0EJ9S|5|GOOD PRICE; A GOOD FRAM PRODUCT.
B00IMPEWHM|5|it seems the tailgate handle is a common issue for trucks like ours (2008 Silverado 2500) this fixed ours up just right. it was easy for my husband to fix it himself. If it did ever does break again down the road I wouldn't mind buying these latches again, great value.
B007PJ9VFO|5|Great
B00AC6TE6I|5|Worked very well
B00J3FMHN6|5|love this little gadget
B005NLQAHS|5|It worked just fine I like it
B001M0Y98G|4|love it !!
B004ZF39T0|5|Part didn't work and they sent another immediately great service and product
B00SNCYQL6|5|Love the helmet not to heavy fits correctly. Measure your to get best fit before you order.
B00KTIBY4Y|5|These were a perfect replacement for worn and discolored key fob cases.
B004WLXRGC|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B003L31RK0|5|Best of the best.
B00PRPVXDQ|5|Not to big or small. Cut mine in half and throw them in behind our golf cart. Work great.
B005CHT4W6|5|Excellent oil.  I use it in my 2000 SV650.  Will buy again.
B000QQZ9K4|5|Great Ball joint but don't try to install it in an aluminum arm.
B007TWOK4Y|5|I really like this lift on my 2003 WJ.  With new spring isolaters (purchased separately) my jeep is finally happy.  The shocks are a little stiffer than stock, driving on pavement but thats what I wanted. I can feel the road better.  I also installed new swaybar links in the front and rear and a steering stabilizer. Easy to install only took a couple of hours. I love it!!
B001RPV1BY|5|worked great
B00B2HMHQU|5|quick shipment and fit perfectly, solved many of the issues I was having with header fitment on my 2F
B000NC0SA2|5|Perfect for my Honda Rancher

B004BHZR1A|5|Good size. It is what is advertised
B005NLQAHS|5|Works like a charm, tried it on several vehicles, easy to pair with your phone, easy to run diagnostics on your vehicles.
B008SO71Q6|5|Item arrived quickly and as described.
B008T3LBOE|1|This was the absolute worst helmet I have ever purchased I feel robbed and frustrated to know that this Helmet would have killed me in the event of a fall. I rode my bike to the gym and the helmet fell off bike onto the floor the helmet then fell apart into pieces the inside of the helmet padding busted loose from the cheap glue and material the company used the visor broke off as well I do not recommend this helmet to anyone who rides at all I would just rude this helmet to hit things with save your money
B006X8AEUY|5|love it ,installed it the next day ,made a classic difference
B007DMWILM|5|Works great
B000OV31FQ|5|Works to remove the pita oil filter on my dodge cummins. Once you start you are committed though because it'll start deforming the filter.
B00BB1UMEG|5|These fit my 2015 4runner TE very well. The front lock tab is a bit tough to lock into place but the mats do a great job at trapping dirt and liquids.
B00PJX549A|5|The BEST blind spot mirrors money can buy. I barely have to look over my shoulder when I change lanes, very reliable. I drive a Dodge Challenger with a terrible passenger side blind spot.  Very easy to position. Every time I wash my car I have to reposition the mirror, if I don't I'll pull over immediately, they're that good.
B00FZVL8SW|5|These chrome door handle cups were just what my car needed for that extra flair.  They were easy to install and they look great.
B00G3JVS8A|1|I would return it if it wasn't such a hassle. Came &#34;new&#34; but had scratches and glue on it. Horrible packaging. I would return it but I need it for work.
B002PUROAM|5|great part, works great.
B00AYEVRWW|5|I never write reviews. These parts fixed harsh shifting in my 07 Pontiac g6 2.4l. Awesome and totally worth the money. Awesome buy.
B000WK5PWQ|5|Great product. Will order more
B00S1LOYEI|5|Fast service at good prices. The manual was just what I needed.
B00KN6L8G6|5|nice and bright, cheap mod to bring your 350 Z up to modern standards .
B000B69V6C|5|Exact fit, easy to install and looks great!  Great replacement value.
B00M0657RS|5|Thanks!!!!
B004JAVPRO|2|Like one of the other reviewers noted this bracket is built crooked not bent or damaged but was simply built incorrectly.
B00JDP4AJA|5|Love it big and bold look great in man cave
B010JNS2QG|5|Highly recommend! Reusable lint free and strong! Best on the market
B00X2TUW1I|4|These shades really are awesome. They cling to the windows with ease and you can move them around to different spaces/windows with no problems.  They also do a good job of keeping the direct sunlight and harmful rays away from our baby.<br /><br />My only complaint is that even the larger size for SUVs are a little too small for our windows. We drive a minivan and that is a lot of window to cover. If it was a tad larger in both width and height I would have given 5 stars! Perhaps in the future there will be one specifically made for those annoyingly large minivan windows!
B004I5RY16|5|Great product and so easy to fit to vehicle.
B0000AZ6CR|5|Great replacement Tach.  Does what it should and that is all I need.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Came with plenty of wire and relays.. Great item!
B00ELNGAU6|5|No one is better
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Fits perfect in my SUV and my preference for use is to put small items such as mints, Kleenex, po key, etc.
B000FOUWNQ|5|I put this in the fairing on my motorcycle works great
B007MUY5G6|5|good product
B00D6YI7CA|1|Does not stick on vehicle.
B003RQTJ88|5|I bought this for myself when I got married in 2011. In 2015, the edges started peeling (I don't have a garage to park in). I bought another one to replace my old one and bought my husband one, too. Great quality. Also, even if the edges are peeling, this is not easy to remove. Would buy again.
B000EA5WLS|5|It fixed the crack in my windshield when a tree fell on my car during a winter ice storm... It stopped the crack from spreading and you can no longer see the crack. Great stuff!! Just make sure you follow the directions correctly.
B000EQ2PP8|2|Squeal/squeaky noise when cold (when vehicle starts moving after a long stop with engine off). I bought a set for replacement after 1-2 months of these.
B006TMKX5U|5|Perfect match, pluged-in in just a few seconds.
B008UOLOB2|5|If you want to clean and protect you sun glasses, i reccomend it...
B00TSP6XTA|5|This is so cute!! Fast shipping!
