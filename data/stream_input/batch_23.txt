B004J4WKUQ|1|I'm honestly insulted to be recommended this in response to reading other &#34;takes place primarily in a virtual world&#34; books. The storyline might almost be interesting if it wasn't buried underneath the constant pop culture references. Sometimes pop culture references are fun, and I usually enjoy them, but I felt like the narration was trying to impress me with the sheer quantity and detail. I mean, I have internet. If I want to know the cast of the Breakfast Club, I can look it up. I don't want to have to pick through pages of trivia just to hunt down a bland semblance of action.<br /><br />On top of that was the occasional eerie moralizing (like &#34;computer nerds are fat and disgusting,&#34; which is definitely a new sentiment I have never heard before) sprinkled with a surprising degree of racism. Daito and Shoto, a pair of Japanese brothers who love old samurai movies, are sad caricatures that suggest maybe the author has taken old samurai movies to heart a bit much himself.<br /><br />The thrilling conclusion to this wild ride is the revelation that the virtual reality internet absolutely solves racism and sexism and any other form of prejudice, because all you have to do is pretend to be a straight white boy online. Which obviously works, looking at the state of the internet in the real world.
B007J4T2G8|5|I heard about this book on the Today show...saying it was the dirty little secret of the suburbs.  I live in the burbs so thought id give it a try.  I liked the characters from the beginning.  A couple chapters in I needed someone to share the book with, so I convinced a friend to read it too.  We loved the book(trilogy).  I couldnt put it down...and didnt want it to end. The sex is delicious...but its the need for each other thats so captivating.  Loved it!!!
B00P7PBD2C|1|Shoving knives into my eyeballs while forced to listen to a thousand fingernails scratching on chalkboards and simultaneously being slowing dipped into a vat of acid would've been a much more pleasurable experience than this ridiculous pile of crap. This is what I get for being a good boyfriend. You're welcome babe, you definitely owe me for this one.
B00G5G7K7O|4|Of course the kids loved this movie!  :)
B00MIA0KGY|5|Great as always, Barbra.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Can't wait to watch the 3rd Season!!!
B00005JKCF|3|i liked this movie. but... yes but it seemed weak and slow and sometimes boring. i liked tobey maguires portrayal, his mannerisms and he did an excellent job playing Peter Parker. The one liners and punchlines were few but nonetheless funny. still it makes for a good popcorn flick. maybe the dvd will have some cool extras...
B000FCKC4C|5|A great story that confirms simple truths that we sometimes ignore or rationalize away. Follow your dreams; the journey alone is a treasure.
B000QCS9NM|4|I loved this book until the end. got very confusing in the final chapters. overall though, great book would read again.
B0069G5Z9K|4|This is a great game but I hate how all of the jetpacks cost and other things... Overall fun game:)
B000FFJYCU|5|As one of many F1 fans who eagerly awaited the release of this DVD, I wasn't a bit disappointed.  After seeing the theatrical release in the late sixties, my fascination and love for F1 racing began. I attended my first race in 1969 at Clermont Ferrand, one of the circuits featured in the movie.  The movie does an incredible job at depicting the essence of Formula 1 and, for those who have followed the racing series, it's a fascinating look at the evolution of the cars and tracks.  The inherent lack of safety in F1 racing at the time-both for drivers and spectators is hard to fathom in terms of today's level of safety when drivers walk away from horrendous appearing wrecks.  Similarly, it's amazing to see the virtually unrestrained nature of spectator access to track areas as shown in the film.  I can attest to the accuracy of that as I recall actually walking (maybe running) across a section of the track, during the race, at Clermont Ferrand during the race to gain a better vantage point.  Foolish as that may sound now, it was common at the time  The special features segment with commentary from the actors, director, actual F1 racers from that era, and current Formula 1 TV personalities and journalists is terrific.  For any fan of Formula 1 racing, this is a must have.
0743243315|2|some good writing, but poor structure, meandering material and opaque & flimsy characters make for a very tedious read.  only the husband is sympathetic.
B00GAVJ77K|5|Great antivirus app
B00DR0PDNE|5|Works really well.  I'm a complete novice at this &#34;tech&#34; stuff.  But a very nice young man (compared to me- everything is relative you know) had it connected up & running in not time.
B000B8QEZG|2|While I like the song \\"Hung Up\\", I have to say I listened to this album a bunch of times and I have to say: overall, the album is mediocre at best. If you think about it, this album is from the same artist that gave us classic pop music. Madonna's \\"Like A Prayer\\" album had one hit after another. Even if I put \\"Bedtime Stories\\" side to side with this album, \\"Confessions...\\" doesn't share well. Everybody complains about \\"American Life\\" (that one sucked too!) but at least you had a song like \\"Die Another Day\\" on it. I think the problem with Madonna is that she is trying too hard. The beats are not hip enough (Hip Hop has the best beats around: Kanye West, 50 Cent, etc.) The songs are not fun. I feel like they're trying to teach me something with a dance beat in the back. The album feels tired and uninspired. Sorry, I've been a Madonna fan since forever, but I'm getting tired of her trying to make a quick buck at my expense. Give something with quality (the quality I'm expecting from somebody like Madonna) and then we'll see.
B000P407K4|3|too strange
B00B5HQL50|5|More of a classic Bond feel with this movie. Can't wait for the next 1 to come out. Now that Montypenny and Q are back. The new M seems to fit great as well. Lots of classic 1 liners in this movie. You will not be dissapointed.
B007HO392S|5|Another great hit CD. She is so talented and such a super person. She has a true niceness about her. Love her music.
B000002WYT|1|I had to invent a new genre of music to describe Dave Matthews Band: I call it progressive pop.  It is boring, over-blown, and pretentious like progressive rock but it is mindless and aimed at the lowest common denominator like 90s pop.  <br />You know, if they played this live just as it appears on the lp it would be okay, i suppose.  Live performances (or better yet, in their own garage) are the RIGHT place to experiment, show-off their musical prowess, and to just relax.  An lp is the place to concentrate and play well-conceived, concise, fully-formed songs.     Dave Matthews Band is the Eagles of this generation.  (Sorry, Eagles).  They're laid back, safe, and boring.  In other words, they're an affront to everything rock'n'roll is supposed to stand for.  <br />Somebody needs to buy these guys a punk album.  Or maybe take away their millions so they have the opportunity to live life so they can experience some real human emotions so they don't just write about uninspired drivel.<br />   Good luck, Dave and the boys.  good luck, Dave Matthews Band fans: please smarten up and try to find something that's more interesting than the crap your parents listen to.
B00FB13Y74|5|This is a new thing for angry birds Its cool but the only thing I don't like that much is the animation : /
0064471837|5|This book sets the story apart from many others in this Genre. The challenges that Sabriel has to overcome can be likened to many things that each and every one of us face every day, without the undead of course. It's relatable and really does a great job of introducing some really important story concepts without making it hard to understand. The characters are all interesting and seem to progress through lives that keep you interested in who they are becoming, and what will happen next to them.<br /><br />The system of magic used in these books is interesting and illustrates a clear defining point between good and evil. Or rather chaos and order. Free magic tempered by charter magic infusing the bells of the Abhorsen as he or she fights the forces of death to keep humans safe.<br /><br />My favorite part thing about this book would have to be that Sabriel is such a good person. She is actually a decent human being and the way she's introduced as having already been trained to know these things from the book of the dead, and yet be compassionate towards her new kingdom friends and teachers was great to see.<br /><br />Not to give things away but to complete my review I really enjoyed everything that Garth Nix did with this story. He wrote it in a way that anyone could read, understand, and enjoy. In these pages human emotions are captured and shown with such a completeness that you can actually tell these soldiers at the wall are frightened and you can feel their fear. I own this book, as well as Lyriel, and Abhorsen. I've read them each through a half dozen times in the years that I have been a fan of Garth Nix's work, and I probably will read them another half dozen before too long.
B000PFU7OO|5|As a music lover from the age of rock and roll to today's eclectic range, I found this soundtrack both lyrically and musically captivating, soothing, original, and very, very real...The simple piano background and the unique vocal quality of the lead singers Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova can be listened to over and over...especially the first two songs.  I play it every day and never tire of the beauty and simplicity of the words and the music.  Don't miss the DVD \\"Once\\", either.  My favorite movie of 2007, by far.....and emotional,timeless, musical journey....
0767803434|5|DVD edition. A wild ride from start to finish.  Don't you wish your thirty round magazine held so much ammo or your heroes had such integrity and ability?  An exciting fantasy adventure and not just for the first watch.
B000FCKC4C|4|This book is an amazing read with an interesting story and should be required reading for everyone. It focuses on a Shepard boy who has a dream about treasure and goes to find it. Along the way, he meets many different people that help him on his quest, including a: gypsy, old king, storekeeper, Englishman, a girl, and an alchemist. Each person gives him important life lessons through stories and ancient parables. If you are looking for a good book and a quick read, pick this up!
B00WP9HSJU|4|A must read for those of us who are Outlander fans. The adventure described is fun, as a fellow Scotland traveler, I also went to some of the sites described in Outlander (unfortunately didn't get transported thru the stones) but still had a wonderful time. We all are in search of the perfect Jamie Fraser!
0743496736|5|Picoult is such a talent.  Perfect for infomaniacs who like all the psychological, biological, and legal intelligence.  But this is the first time she shows she can be a Stephen King too.  Realistic portrayals of the bullies, the mean girls, and the horrors of public humiliation and the pressures on an American teenager.
B00I6IKSZ0|4|Lvls are a chore to gain after 20 and the guns could use some balancing and maybe better guild and friend systems

B005MLOKXA|5|Greatly addicting
B000000W3G|5|i don't understand how this perfect box set was passed off as b-sides while mellon collie had several poor tracks (ex. we only come out at night..). if the pumpkins had these songs at their disposal at the time mellon collie was put together, whoever chose what to cut did a terrible job. TAFH is nothing short of amazing. if offers a much more dynamic view of what the pumpkins were writing during the mellon collie era than the mellon collie album itself does. the five discs are all completely different from one another and james acually gets to sing here more often, which sounds great.<br />bullet with butterfly wings - this is probably my least favorite, but it's still good. mostly covers, the new-wave-ish ones aren't that great. ironically, \\"said sadly...\\" and \\"a night like this\\", the two james iha songs are the best on the single. overall, this one is the biggest mishmosh in the set. not necessarily a bad thing, but i think this one goes a little off the deep end.<br />1979 - i really like this one a lot. all the songs are practically mezmorizing. i get \\"ugly\\" and \\"cherry\\" stuck in my head for days on end. james has two songs here also. not his best, but they really help pull this single together. \\"set the ray to jerry\\" sounds like a throwback to the siamese dream era. i don't understand what possessed them to discard it in the first place.<br />zero - this is the heaviest disc in the set. \\"mouths of babes\\" might be my favorite song out of all five discs. i can't decide, they're all so good. \\"pennies\\" is way to soft to be here and seems vastly out of place, but is still excellent. \\"god\\", \\"tribute to johnny\\", and \\"marquis in spades\\" flesh out the disc's pounding theme. surprisingly, i don't find \\"pistachio medely\\" to be as pointless as many other reviewers do. i think it's interesting. let's just leave it at that. except for the last 5 minutes or so, which really get on your nerves with that same chord over and over.<br />tonight, tonight - this is possibly my favorite. aside from the title track it's all accustic with a drum machine here and there. \\"medilla of the grey skies\\" is amazing. i can't even describe it. actually, this whole disc is amazing. i really like the accustic version of tonight, tonight. it does more justice to the song than the overproduced version.<br />thirty three - this one is definitly the weirdest of the five. i guess everyone wouldn't like this disc, but then again, if you're crazy enough to be looking into a pumpkins box set you just might. it's basically a collection of art damaged alt rock songs. none really stand out that much to me except maybe \\"last song\\" and \\"the aeroplane flies high\\". also, \\"my blue heaven\\" is a cover with just billy and piano, but it's a great way to end the set.<br />overall i would only recommend this to fans. it's not for anyone looking to buy their first pumpkin record. but it is truly something beautiful. i can't give it enough praise. unfortunatly, commercially it's been completely overshadowed by mellon collie, which pales miserably compared to TAFH box set, and that's saying a lot because that album is a masterpiece in it's own right. also, for people who were upset with the path the pumpkins took after siamese dream, this set is more reminiscent of their early days than mellon collie.
B0053B347M|4|I purchased a pair of these to place on the back of my two monitors in an effort to ease eye fatigue from long coding sessions.  The lighting itself is excellent, creating a soft white light reflecting off the wall that certainly helps with they eye strain.  My issues are with the design of the kit itself.  The adhesive seems to be holding well after weeks of use on both monitors, one with a matte finish and the other being very glossy.  The problem is the adhesive near the end that has failed to hold up to the weight of the USB cable after the first few minutes of installation.  I have been forced to place a bit of tape on both units to hold the end of the lighting strip down.  Antec needs to address this issue in future versions of the product.  The second problem is with the length of the USB cable itself.  On one monitor I have built-in USB ports and the cord is more than long enough.  On the other monitor however, the cable is not long enough to reach a USB port and I had to use a USB extension cable in order to get it to length.  It seems that Antec has designed this product solely for monitors with USB ports.  The lack of an off switch is evidence of this.  On my Dell UltraSharp, it is not problematic since the ports lose power after turning the monitor off and the light goes out accordingly.  On my other monitor, the lights stay on when plugged into an always on port and have to be manually unplugged.  I have instead had to run my second monitors cable to my UltraSharp in order to not have to plug and unplug constantly.  Overall, the lighting performance of this kit is more than adequate.  However, Antec needs to redesign this kit to address a pair of glaring deficiencies in their design.  Having to supplement the adhesive with additional tape is inexcusable and the lack of an off switch and a cable of suitable length makes using this on monitors without built in ports a hassle.  A new version of this kit is warranted and hopefully Antec will address the design problems.
B008MEM24S|4|nice and good, i like it its a brand of disney nothing to see about that only trusting.Thank you .

B000LXQVA4|5|The best gift ever!<br />El mejor regalo del mundo!
B00HHJPUFM|5|This is a great movie for all ages.  You will laugh all the way to the end!!
B0018QOIXU|5|Wonderful recording - Excellent presentation in all aspects. An award winning recording by my favorite new singer. Highly recommended for any Adele fan
B00LPUSR3Q|2|I don't see how anyone who loves the books can enjoy this movie. I saw it in theaters and almost left as the number of inconsistencies increased and, in my opinion, key points were changed or left out completely. I stayed hoping it'd get better... I should have asked for a refund. I have seen tons of movies (probably averaging one a week for the past 10 years) including book-to-film adaptations, and I am not so impractical as to think that it would be possible to match the book exactly. But I was so surprisingly, incredibly impressed with the book that the movie version crashed and burned infinitely harder than anything the Dauntless could dream of. The Dauntless themselves were mild versions of the book descriptions. Hard for 90% of the people, even just those in the background, to look pretty with the extreme hair, tattoos and piercings depicted in the book. But that's typical Hollywood, especially for a film with teen romance. But in my opinion that doesn't excuse Eric missing half his piercings which the book repeatedly gave detailed descriptions of. And speaking of tattoos, of course they had to change Four's... The ending was the worst - COMPLETELY different from the book, and I can't fathom why. To me, the specifics there were very significant to the story as a whole; it seemed very important the way it happened in the book. The changes to some of the fear landscapes were almost as bad. But I won't go into detail and give spoilers. My curiosity got the better of me, but I wish I had skipped the movie and not tainted the amazing universe and story that Roth created purely with words.<br /><br />My conclusion is you might like it for two reasons: 1. If you haven't read the book, you might like it if you can catch the wisps of what the book contained (the psychology). But if you think it's good, you're better off treating yourself to the book. 2. If you're looking for a dystopian teen love story, probably while suffering Twilight withdrawals, this might hold youover for a bit. (And if you saw \\"Fault in Our Stars\\" and think Shailene Woodle can carry this movie, don't hold your breath.)<br /><br />2/5 stars because 1 star is reserved for only those purely bad movies, and as I said this has wisps of what makes the book so great. And because by definition, an adaptation is not an exact replica. It should have tried harder to be, though.
B002R0F3Q2|3|I'm a big fan of Alicia Keys so I hate to speak/write negatively of anything she produces.  But this album has some issues.<br /><br />I applaud what is essentially twelve love songs bookended by an intro and an outro ode to New York City, but I think any artist would have a hard time sustaining an entire album across a single theme.  I don't think the idea was wrong.  Most songs attempt to shed light on love and heartbreak in some form after all.  But at a certain point there is the risk of losing boldness (and soul!) and producing something contrived.  And that's the trap this album falls into.  It's a lot of love song fluff with uninspired beats.  \\"Love Is My Disease\\" is a particularly painful example of prosaic sub-mediocrity.<br /><br />There are some positives.  \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" really is a fantastic track, and a great single for air play.  The first two tracks, \\"Love Is Blind,\\" and \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" are also a sample of Alicia on top of her game.  \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II)\\" is a great compliment to Jay-Z's record.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it's almost seven years later, and The Diary of Alicia Keys continues to see the most action on my iPod.  It remains, in my opinion, her strongest effort to date.  This album is her worst, but naturally with Alicia, not completely beyond recall.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game. Glad it is on kindle so much better than playing on my iPhone.
B004UID2LC|3|boooio booo boooboo boo  bo bo boooooo booooo boooooo bboooooo nooo way did i like this app it barley works
B000001DTM|5|Waiting for the laughing gas? :) Kings of reinventing themselves and progressing with the times and music of the present period without compromising artistic integrity, alienating former fans, or offending critics. This is U2, who is arguably one of the best bands of all time. Prolific, experimental, and even chameleonic at times. I say this confidently, although I have distanced myself from my adolescent obsessive-U2-fan years (must have been over a decade ago), and I can appreciate the music as an adult.  This album is a carefully constructed, vivid portrait with excruciatingly good songs like &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, and &quot;Love is Blindness&quot;. Lyrics are typically brilliant, meaningful, and fitting, and of course, the music, although driven in a new direction, is still the biting, pressing, and ever-wonderful U2 we all know and love.
B0068RHSZO|4|If you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen the movie. If you can sit back and pretend as if you're seeing it for the first time it's enjoyable. It would be interesting to see what this movie was meant to be before the studio got its hands on it.
B008WCP2PG|5|Who doesn't like a half naked Channing Tatum
0307592839|1|I bought this book based on being a pulitzer prize winner.  Ugh.  Even though I am fairly \\"hip\\", this book was incredibly boring.  To identify with the characters, one must be either a 1) indie music fan who is about 40 years old, 2) a person who is not connected to the real world and what is important in life.  Basically a \\"me, me, me\\" L.A. type person who has no connection to the real world.  The style is boring.  The vocabulary is mundane. I felt like I could have written a book just as good as this one (and I am not a good writer). I mean, how the heck did this win an award????????  I couldn't think of one person to give my book to, it's going in the trash!
B003Y5HWJU|5|I love this series.  It's well scripted, acted and produced.  The cast is excellent.  I highly recommend this show to anyone into series like The Godfather, The Sopranos or The Untouchables.  You will not regret it.
B00FLDG52I|5|Bought this as a gift, arrived quickly, and this year's edition is great!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
B004K4AUZW|2|Was expecting something different. Whats with all the preachy Jesus stuff? Some of the songs are annoying and don't really go anywhere. Saying random words because they rhymed over disjointed beats isn't much fun in my books.
B00MIA0KGY|3|I'm a huge Steisand fan, but this is not what I expected.
1455521205|4|Baldacci hasn't lost his touch. Multiple plots but Robie and Reel survive to the end. You could guess the ending as you flipped the final pages but it wasn't a disappointment. His writing is crisp and descriptive and he doesn't use a lot of filler in telling the story. Not a book where you can flip through a bunch of pages and still follow the story.

B004R13U6Y|5|Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I haven't really found a flaw with this app. I have some poorly OCRed scans that are unreadable on the built in Kindle Fire reader, but look good on ezPDF.  It has the page turn animation, if you are into that. It can also be disabled.  The turns are smooth, and the next page loads quick. even with large (50mb) PDFs. Highlighting,  underlining, making notes, and writing freehand are all easy to do.  This app has so many features, I only use maybe 1/10 of them. I think the app is worth much more than they are asking.
0847835073|5|Thank you!
B0097AQEOK|3|Lost all my vinyl to poor storage and warping in heat. Enjoy playing this when nostalgic for my youth, but haven't bought a cd since this as I can always find something on the free radio (usually NPR) to listen to. Missed out on the entire 80's music scene, apparently not much of a loss, now I'm doing it again for this decade. As my husband hasn't bought anything since the last Rolling Stones cd, I think we are a wash for the music industry's profit margin.
1609614798|1|Disappointingly, this book is simply Atkins repackaged.  The humor, if you can call it that, is probably the most annoying part of the entire book and I honestly had a difficult time getting through the whole thing because of it (at times, I was seriously tempted to throw the book against the wall).  I've read scientific reviews on the book and there seems to be a consensus that the conclusions the author derives at are simply him trying to fit the research to his &#34;theory&#34;; there is no real or applied basis for his conclusions or recommendations.  I recently read a book that is almost identical to this, but instead of wheat, that author demonized corn (an quite rightfully so).  The diet, itself, is much too restrictive and even demonizes some fruits and vegetables, which I find rather curious.  The calorie count, per day, is high and can be as much as 50% - 100% higher than recommended.  Essentially, our food sources have been compromised, I acknowledge that.  This book merely illustrates one food in that category and does not take into consideration any other aspects: all problems are wheat-related, which is too simplistic or as the author says, while heroically &#34;saving the lives of his patients&#34;, &#34;I suspected wheat.&#34;
B002MQYOFW|4|Was an amazing story and though the gore almost made me gag, i couldn't get my eyes to turn away. Amazing story that brings the standards of fiction to a whole new meaning

B0064MPXFA|5|Really well done! Great writing and acting. We've finished the season in a week. Addictingly good. I can't wait to start season 2. And 3 after that.
B002KCYIEA|4|I was surprised this movie was as good as it was given the not so great critics' reviews. I get it's the same old &#34;fatal attraction&#34; story, but I thought it was well done and Beyonce did a really good job of acting the part. Loved her character! Don't mess with mama bear!
0060531053|5|My wife bought this and a True Brew kit for my birthday (I know, you're thinking, \\"she rocks!\\"). Anyway, I've just started reading the book and I love it. There is a ton of GREAT information in the book and I would encourage anyone interested in brewing to buy this book.

B004XJRQUQ|5|My students read this and suggested I should as well. I will have to tell them it was completely engrossing and they have wonderful taste!
B00000I07P|5|Let It Rock:It has an unexpected opener from them and takes a while to get into the song, but does a great job kicking off the album by showing how fun it will be. I love the mention of Captain Kidd and the King of Swing also. <br />You Give Love A Bad Name:The song starts out fierce with no intro beats. It was one of their biggest hits, and the lyrics are awesomely naughty. <br />Livin' On A Prayer:I am in love with this song. I may just have to call it my favorite. It helps you get through life a little bit easier just by know that you're halfway there, wherever \\"there\\" is... It's uplifting and richie's talkbox rocks. We start to see Springsteen's influence in this one. It's the favorite among Jovi fans even though Jon doesn't really like it and never thought it'd make it big. <br />Social Disease:One of their many songs that relates love to a sickness. The intro is filled with sex noises...Anyways, it's not the best, but I love the call for \\"Dr. Bon Jovi\\" and then the prescription of \\"nothing a shot can't cure\\" in the end. <br />Wanted Dead Or Alive:It's a classic. One of Bon Jovi's many cowboy songs. It was basically a journal of how their lives were at that point in time. Jon dared by saying \\"i've seen a million faces and i've rocked them all\\" early in his career before they were headliners, but luckily he can truthfully make that claim now. It's always nice to hear Richie too! <br />Raise Your Hands: This one rocks when played in concert, especially Richie at the beginning. I love how everyone raises their hands together and all the cities are mentioned in it, especially Sayreville, New Jersey at the very end. It's a really fun song. <br />Without Love: It's okay, it's the kind of a song for when you don't care about the rest of the world and you're just in complete bliss. <br />I'd Die For You: This song is a great pledge of love with awesome keyboards, it was one of my favorites in earlier days. <br />Never Say Goodbye:It would make a wonderful graduation song. There are a few inappropriate mentions...drinking, smoking, sex......but still a great grad song.  <br />Wild In The Streets:Another song talking about remembering the good ole times.They always like to end the albums with fun and energetic songs. <br />
B0067Q42BY|5|Personally, if this wasn't free today, I probably would have paid for it later. I love this game. Mahjong Artifacts is a Mahjong game with superior control quality and a beautiful Asian theme that looks incredible on the Kindle fire. I don't even mind that the game producer advertises other games.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Downton Abby is probably one of the best series on TV. I have to give credit for the compelling story lines and the drama that the show has created. If you haven't watched this series I would suggest that start with season 1 and you will be hooked. This has to be one of the best shows on TV. I can't wait for season 4.
B00003CX5P|1|Lucas has defended this film (and subsequent movies) by saying \\"It's for kids.\\"  This is not only the weakest cop-out I've ever heard, but makes it plainly obvious Lucas has no idea who his audience is.  The man went from being a Francis Copolla to a Michael Bay.  It's sad and depressing.
B008ODZUN2|3|The movie was very well acted but moves slowly. The movie starts in the present then moves to flashbacks so the view never gets the full picture of the main characters relationships, just bits and pieces. I wish we were allowed to know a bit more of the relationship between Hester and Freddie. Though the entire movie is a bit depressing the ending seems like the characters have closure and the ending is a bit positive. I just felt a little down for the rest of the day after watching the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|John Gresham has again outdone himself.  O very good, well written novel.  It grabs your attention on the first page and does not let loose until the very last period.  Highly recommended read
B00003CXCT|5|I am so glad this finally came out on DVD. So what? Lucas changed a couple of things...big whoop, the movies are still excellent. However, for all you idiots still stuck on Full Screen DVD's, keep away from this one, it has the worst transfer ever you lose at least 50% of the picture. All I ever had was the full screen VHS, now I know what I was missing!
B00DRPVE3M|1|It takes a pretty long time for the game yo register moves by you and others, the game is very flashy and complicated, and the games I'm in will randomly crash so I lose the tokens I put in.  It only took 10 minutes flr me to realize how strongly I disliked the game.  I recomend this game to people who:<br />1. Have infinite money to spend on tokens.<br />2. Have infinite patience to wait for lag, ads, and more scratch games that obviously don't promote gambling and the lottery in a kid's game.<br />3. Can hack games like these for infinite tokens and no ads.<br />4. People who are so pationate about this awesome kid's game that they can look past the cheats you can buy with points, shameful attempts at milking the users of the app for every last penny they'll spend, the not-so-subtle gambling reference in a game reccomended for people of all ages, which includes small children, the confusing layout, and the various glitches, crashes, and other problems with the game.  If you are any of the above 4 people, you should get the game.  Otherwise you will be greatly disappointed.
B00CH26TL8|3|I prefer Bubble Witch Saga 2
B004FGMDOQ|4|The book took a long while to \\"get started\\", but once it did you find yourself lost. I am anxious to read the sequel
B001GKYBXA|5|I love Paul McCartney's music, so maybe I'm biased, but this album blew me away. It's incredibly superior to Memory Almost Full and Chaos and Creation. The first time I listened to this album I wasn't sure whether it was one of the greatest albums I'd ever heard, or the worst. So I listened a second time, and then I realized that THIS is great music. It's doing something different, not just making more fun little pop songs (which I love). If you like Helter-Skelter-esque songs, then you'll love this album. I recommend \\"Highway,\\" \\"Sing the Changes,\\" and \\"Dance 'Til We're High,\\" but really the entire album is fantastic.
B000SEGCRS|4|I'm just starting out in photography and it's by no means my profession.  I'm just a photo-junkie who finally decided to call it a hobby.  So I figured I might as well get a few books that could teach me how to get the most out of my fancy new digital SLR.  This book was at the top of most \\"top photography book\\" lists that I've found online, as it should be.  It's a really great starter-book and by that, I mean that it's non-technical and beginner-friendly.  This is both a good and a bad thing, but more on that later.  The author does a great job of spreading some light humor throughout the book and, while this was probably designed to make the book seem less intimidating, I found that it actually \\"swung the pendulum too far in the other direction,\\" so to speak.  Yes, I thought his joke about TACK SHARP being an acronym was funny, but now I'm not 100% convinced that I can trust his tip of referring to lenses as \\"glass\\" in photography stores (as in, \\"Don't ask for a new lens.  Say you need some new glass\\").  But that being said, his jokes and non-technical jargon made this very light and I was able to finish it in one sitting.  Now for the cons.  I say this book is \\"non-technical,\\" but that's actually not true.  It's actually at that awkward phase between total beginner and professional photographer.  He'll start name-dropping different terms and settings that you should set your camera to (i.e. aperture, ISO, etc) but never actually explains what they are.  He'll say that ISO is similar to film speed on the old film cameras, but that's about as much detail as you'll get.  So if you're a total, green-horned beginner, don't count on this being the only photography book on your shelf.  The other side of the coin is that by doing this, I'd imagine it would motivate someone to go out and get another book that goes into more detail.  The author does actually say that he hopes this book will inspire his readers to go out and learn more about photography.  So like I said, don't count on this being the only photography book you reference.  This is a really handy guide for beginner and intermediate photographers.  It provides some really great tips on everything from landscape and floral photography to shooting professional weddings and sporting events. And, because it shows you how to take great quality photos, the reader won't become frustrated and give up photography all together.  Keep in mind that this is a really short book, though, and by no means encompasses all there is to know about photography.  For something like that, I'd recommend turning to Complete Digital Photography by Ben Long.  That's a much more in-depth book...well it's really a photography textbook...but that can get you going on the technical side of photography.  In the meantime, I'd highly recommend The Digital Photography Book as a excellent source of information to get you started!
B00KA7JIII|1|Every time it goes to install my phone reboots
B00KK0PICK|1|Dont waste your time or money on this book! There is nothing magical about common sense.....sorting, changing bad habits etc. Watch a hoarders tv show and gleen from their organizers! The key is to not bring stuff into your home if it doesnt have a proper place. We are a society of abundance, over-spendering and materialism! The stress of all that &#34;stuff&#34; causes us to feel overwhelmed and then we shut down! Less is best! I limit my purchases to: 1. Is there an immediate need? 2. Is the up-keep (dusting, washing etc) gonna be worth the purchase? 3. When possible, wait 3 days to think about it......I obviously made a bad purchase with this book but hopefully helps others not too!
B0001WE6U2|5|Both me and my wife have one on our Nikons.  I use it whenever I am out taking photos.  It reverses so it can be kept on the zoom lense while in the bag.

B0002OERI0|5|This album will hopefully usher in a new era of intelligent, musically complex punk music. Definitely a new evolution.  I wish bands like Blink 182, Sum 41, Yellowcard, Bad Religion, Offspring, MXPX, etc could find their own inner \\"American Idiot\\". <br /> <br />This album proves that Green Day *is* the best punk band of the last fifteen years.
B000060P79|2|what can i say,<br />  i got the cd because i loved \\"i'm just a kid\\". THE ONE FROM \\"The New Kid\\" SOUNDTRACK!!! this version is pathetic. i mean, if they go big, horray for them but lets just say i won't be cheering them on next time im in some podunk club downtown.<br />get midtown or NFG if you want to enjoy some REAL punk music.

B000022TT4|5|People who rate U2 on account of popmart have to see this. It reminds us that they became the best rock band in the world through the art of song writing and live performance, not giant lemons! The dark and grainy appearance of the picture of this DVD means you'll be listening more than watching. I always forget this is classified as a 'movie'. To be honest I bought it for the live footage and dont care too much for the interviews and mini-documentaries shown between each song. But dont get me wrong, nearly the whole movie consists of live footage from the Joshua Tree tour. Great sound quality, great songs, great band, so buy it! Even if its just to see the explosive 'where the streets have no name' performance from Arizona.
1600240917|3|You can scrap most of the reviews based on a reading of the unabridged text version of the book. Listening is not the same as reading, Abridged is not the same as Unabridged.  I assume the reader of the review is familiar with audio books and familiar with the generic differences between the Abridged and Unabridged versions.   The first two-thirds of the book moves well as a story and is performed well by the reader. Editing of the text provides sufficient substance to provide life to the character and clarity to the story. At about the two-thirds mark, one of the basic flaws of abridgment takes hold as the story line includes too many characters too rapidly passed over and too many plot complications fully to grasp. The reader himself tends increasingly to go over to a more inflated tone rather than the good acting that preceded this part. The drama of the wham-bang conclusion is diluted although still reasonably effective. This listener had too many things to process to participate satisfactory in that ending.  All in all, at the price,I believe that it will make good listening on-the-go, less satisfactory when sitting comfortably at home. Of course, it is impossible for me to judge the virtues and defects of the written text or of an unabridged audio version.

1451673442|5|Very good
B005H5H3LW|5|Wow, I just finished watching the movie.  I am aware that a lot of my views on this movie are highly biased by my kid years watching this show in the 80's and now I am 46 and an aerospace engineer - but so what!  The movie plot did not follow the 80's anime exactly but again, so what? The movie fits a kid audience that has grown up.  Absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end in spite of all of the changes and I mirror the view that the Zero should have not been modified as much as it was.  For some it will be too slow, but I would like to add something here about the Japanese culture.  I was watching a documentary about a Japanese bicycle shop.  You go into the shop, design your bike on a computer and they will deliver it to you in 4 days.  The truth is that they could deliver it to you in about 2 days, but the shop (and their culture) feels that you will be more excited if you waited the extra days.  The Japanese know how to be patient - it is something that I wish we knew how to be.  So sure, their dialogue was quite extensive - but that is character development and I didn't mind it one bit.  We rely so much on CGI in our movies that I think most of them are crap.  Their love scenes and love development should teach Hollywood a thing or to about being human and classly.  Didn't mind the subtitles, other countries can make fine movies too.  Hopefully Kodai and Yuki's child will grow up and maybe they will develop a sequel of some kind. I can only hope.
B000JIN3J8|5|A classic~

0679777547|4|&quot;This mystery is considered insoluble for the very same reasons that should lead one to consider it soluble&quot;<br />The Club Dumas follows the adventures of Lucas Corso, a cross between a mercenary and an antique book dealer.  He has been given the task of authenticating a rare book - one that can be used to summon Lucifer himself.<br />But, as Corso begins to uncover the secrets of the book and its printer, he is involved in another mystery.  He is followed by characters that bear such a striking resemblance to Dumas's most famous serial, the Three Musketeers, that he begins to delve deeper into the fiction that has become his existence.<br />The Club Dumas is a fascinating read.  It is an adventure story in its own right.  Woven into the text, however, is commentary on intertextualism, the meaning of literature, and man's relationship with the occult.  Perez-Reverte does an especially good job of setting the scenes which are presented in the book - the reader feels the antiquity and beauty of the European villages which are the setting.  Overall, a fascinating read and highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5|Really fun and a great way to spend your time when you are having a boring day
B00DBSZJRM|4|OK, this was not one of those movies that you clutch and grasp your pearls as it reveals the meaning of life or has you weeping from how touching it is. Was it a fun watch for a Friday night - heck yeah! CGI was pretty durn good, the casting was decent - Jeremy Renner did an unexpectedly good job in a lighter role - he is kind of an intense guy and he made it work perfectly for this show.<br /><br />Well, worth streaming for $3.99. It was one of those where I turned to the husband and said, &#34;That was fun&#34; instead of screaming at the TV to give me my $3.99 back. I recommend it, just go into it with an open mind and ready for a fun couple of hours of mind candy. Oh, parent alert - F-bombs, which were not really necessary. I think they could have left that out and this show would be great for older kids. Just my two bits and the producers did not call and ask my opinion, so what the heck.
B00005MKA1|5|I've read articles, commentary and heard people accuse Robert Nesta Marley of going soft on KAYA as it's easily the most laid back and relaxed LP in his vast and magnificent catalog.  By the time of it's recording, in 1977 during the sessions that produced the Masterpiece EXODUS, he and the new incarnation of The Wailers had hit their creative stride.  Much controversy surrounded this album for several reasons not the least of which was it's title and people initially thought these were \\"leftover\\" songs form EXODUS.  Nothing could be further from the truth,this is an album where we found Bob in a relaxed state, perhaps for the first time in his life and these songs reflect that.<br /><br />On EXODUS there were traces of his more reflective side as well, however, it was still dominated by the themes of Rastafarian knowledge and African revolution and unity which were at the heart of both Marley's music and genius.  But KAYA was something different than what the music world was used to from The Wailers, an almost \\"at home hanging with the boys & girls\\" feel.  It's about the love of Jah, women, wine and ganja.  No overtly revolutionary themes in these recordings, Bob was showing us something few had ever seen or heard from him, having fun and finding peace with where his life was at that time.  And I for one happen to absolutely love it!<br /><br />This is a great album and a fine part of his legendary catalog, it must be viewed for what it is a fun & reflective album, nothing more or less.  He was showing his range and variety as a sonwriter, things that should and are praised for other well known and historic artists.  He gave us such wonderful, revolutionary and incredible themes in EXODUS, that I think he wanted to show some variety and do an album from a different & more relaxed approach and KAYA fits that mode of thinking.  People are always trying to lock artists into one or two themes never allowing for them to express another side of their thoughts or personalities.  This is a laid back Bob Marley and their has to be room for relaxation for each and everyone of us.<br /><br />This album mostly suffers from having to follow the album voted by Time Magazine as being the greatest of the 20th century!  It's a different album altogether and was released a year after he had blown the world away with EXODUS, that's why, in my opinion, KAYA has be given such a bad rap by many.  However, I think it's one of the most refreshing albums he recorded and I would highly recommend it for anyone whose a fan of The Wailers which at this time included: Bob Marley - lead vocals, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, percussion; Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett - bass, percussion; Carlton Barrett - drums, percussion; Tyrone \\"Organ D\\" Downie - keyboards, percussion; Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson - percussion; Junior Marvin - lead guitar; Rita Marley - backing vocals; Marcia Griffiths - backing vocals; Judy Mowatt - backing vocals; Vincent Gordon - saxophone; Glen Da Costa - trombone.<br /><br />This would be a nice starting point for anyone looking to get into Bob Marley's music for the first time.  It was truly one of the gems of Marley's solo albums after the breakup of the original band that included the legendary Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  This is a complete albuma and in hindsight, many have come to realize both it's importance and brilliance.ities.

0307588378|4|The first half of the book I wasn't sure who was the nastier person. But the second half was a no brainier. Funny at times and truly sick and disturbing for the rest. An interesting book for sure. I found some of the language to be a bit repetitive and overly descriptive at times.<br /><br />Several reviews stated that the ending was a bit of a letdown. I'm not sure about that. Both of these people were selfish and manipulative in many ways and they came to some weird and disturbing agreement in the end. It would have been interesting for the author to throw in a future chapter ten years down the road to see how everyone was doing.<br /><br />Overall, a fast moving summer read.
B00005QFE5|2|It is always nice to see an innocent romance without any sex involved. But this movie is plain boring. Throughout the whole movie Ziyi's character is running through the woods chasing the boy. It is unclear why they even fell in love with each other. I gave it 2 stars for excellent scenery.

B00FHB7398|5|This is one of those kinds of games that you are constantly looking for. It has great graphics and puzzles and the storyline is great.  You have all features you like to have available like hints, skip feature on extra hard puzzles if needed and a good mixture of HO scenes and puzzles to solve. There tons of locations to visit as well.  Big Fish is my favorite producers of games for my Kindle Fire.  I hope more are coming soon like this one and Dog Tales one.

B00005ASHM|5|The making of Pet Sounds alone has been one of the most fascinating pop stories. Brian Wilson writing and producing all the songs while the band was on tour. Brian bringing in a new text writer. And disregarding his successful collaboration with Beach Boy member and lyricist Mike love.<br />The album wasn't even as big a hit as many record company executives must have hopen for.<br />But more then 40 years down the road Pet Sounds still ranks in my personal top 5 best albums of all time. Why. Because of the beautiful melodies and ditto lyrics. The orchestration where the guitar no longer played an important part. Because of the fabulous harmonies. Because of the theme of 'growing up' which can be found in most songs. This is definitely a must have album.
6305718954|4|It is amazing to see the amount of time, energy, mental fuel that is in vain consumed to build and rebuild the plot theory that says the Catholic Church has hijacked Jesus Christ from a gospel of love to a gospel of domination and control. This film is one more stone along that road. It is an incredible story, meaning a story that cannot be believed, just as if when dealing with the Christian god there were no limits whatsoever as for the lack of any logic or reason. The haunting of a non believer by an Aramaic document that she has never seen, what's more understood, to the point of getting the victim of the reproduction  in her flesh of Jesus' stigmata and her writing on a wall the full text of the document still in Aramaic is unbelievable. A human being can only be haunted by something that has had a concrete connection or contact with that person. It is not the beads of a dead priest from Brazil, stolen by some non identified local person, bought by the mother of the victim in the village, who at least visited the place where that dead priest used to preach, and received via mail by the victim from her mother, that can justify that haunting of that person. Then the contradictory discourse of a priest who is originally a scientist and who turns a believer in empathy more than reason for the girl justifies in his blindness the extreme defensive attitude of the hierarchy of the church that prefers killing the evidence to accepting the disturbing truth, if truth it is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

B0011EU0NG|5|A very great and inspiring movie. My family watches it all the time and we love it.
1476746583|5|This is a magnificent novel, written almost poetically. The language is so beautiful, with each word crafted with great thought. I read it in just a few days and hated for it for end. When I did finish ALL THE LIGHT, I was left in tears.<br />Doerr's writing is so exquisite and full of metaphors and similes. I read lots of reviews on websites and on Amazon. Some criticized the facts but most wrote just about the story.<br />I think the writing is what sets this book apart. Consider this line, on page 218: &#34;The sky drops silver threads of sleet. Gray houses run in converging lines to the horizon, bunched as if to find off cold.&#34; Or this one,  on page 290: &#34;The sounds of passing cars are like the tines of forks dragged along his nerves.&#34;<br />The symbolism is profound in this novel. Consider this line, repeated several times throughout: &#34;Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.&#34;  Also, what is the meaning of Frederick's obsession with birds and the broader themes of the novel?<br />This book is the best novel of WWII that I have ever read. I believe there is much to be discussed and much to be learned from reading Doerr's novel. I also believe every middle/high/college school student should read this book.

B000N6TX1I|5|Children of Men is one of those movies that I really wanted to see in the theater but didn't actually catch until it came out on DVD. I was blown away by this incredible movie and would even say it was one of the best movies of last year. There's a reason this movie was nominated for its cinematography and editing and you can see it in every beautifully framed shot. <br /> <br />The movie centers on Theo (Clive Owen), a man who has lost his family and only floats along now in the nightmare the world has become since children can no longer be conceived and everything has turned to chaos. It's not until  his estranged wife, who is the leader of an extremist group, contacts him for help in getting a young woman who is pregnant out of the country. Though reluctant at first, Theo decides to help and becomes caught up in an electrifying race against time, filled with incredible action sequences, back-stabbing and a small glimmer of hope for the future. <br /> <br />The movie excels at everything it tries to accomplish. The story and plot move along briskly. The acting is top notch, with Clive Owen being the most notable. He continues to impress me with his roles and acting. Alfonso's vision of a destroyed future world is perfect and the sets are great. If you're a true fan of film and pay attention to how movies are shot, the action scenes alone will make you fall in love with this movie. During the big action scenes Alfonso doesn't make a single cut. You'll see people being shot, entire car chases with fire and mobs, running out of exploding buildings and through buses as a war rages in the background. It's some amazing stuff that'll blow your mind. <br /> <br />Like I said, this movie is amazing. It's thought provoking, well acted and filmed. I have only good things to say about it. Word of warning though: this movie is bleak and has a lot of heart breaking moments in it. It doesn't end all neat and tidy and it doesn't explain everything either. This movie makes you think, although it does offer a slim glimmer of hope at the end.
B0017MO10U|5|As a SG-1 fan I enjoyed this movie very much. It was great to see \\"Jack\\" again but it does leave you wanting more of his \\"sense of humor\\" that was his trademark.  Ben Browder does add his own \\"spin\\" to the show but it just wasn't the same.  The movie gives you the best of both characters but still leaves you wanting to see more of Jack.  I hope they will continue to make movies for the fans to see and hopefully will continue to incorporate both characters into the story line.  This movie was good but a little hard to follow sometimes, but then it wouldn't be SG-1 if it wasn't now would it?  That is why you want to watch it 2 or 3 times to catch what you missed the first time.
0307279189|5|I picked this book up not knowing really what I wanted from it, but something in the title and the first few pages drew me to it. As an occasional runner with a slightly kranky knee I was inspired by the suggestion that we were born to run, and that it should actually be an enjoyable experience. So I am slowly changing my diet and employing a forefoot running technique, and smiling while running. This book is really worth a read, and reinforces that it's the simple things in life that matter. Running & feeling free as a bird, eating simple healthy meals, inter-dependency on & loving our fellow humans, and not focussing on the material things that surround us.

B006FO3ERQ|5|Just read this book, it is not a crime novel but it has crimes, not a mystery but it has mysteries, not a coming of age saga but it treads in that territory, not a family drama but the whole theme is a family melodrama. It meshes all these genres  almost seamlessly.
006109594X|1|An absolutely abominable book.  Puerile prose, plastic characters and a preposterous plot make for an utterly miserable read.  Welcome to the world of the right wing military nut who doesn't know his subject, but spouts off  regardless.  Quite similar to Limbaugh.  Don't waste your money or time.
B00BDSRISA|5|I must say, this album surpasses Wolfgang in every way. I honestly do not get why people rave about Wolfgang so much (only 4 songs were great, rest were good). This album, on the other hand, is pretty much awesome through and through. I really didn't feel Don't or Entertainment, but they are still good in their own right.

0061537969|4|Whether or not we admit it, most of us would undoubtedly be interested in hearing what a dog had to say, if it were only possible. Thus The Art of Racing in the Rain was born.<br /><br />Author Garth Stein gives us Enzo, a highly intelligent canine who is first adopted as a puppy by a young man he adores. When Denny soon after meets Eve and falls in love, quickly getting married and producing baby Zoe, Enzo is filled with a mix of love and jealousy, having to share Denny with others.<br /><br />All his life, Denny has dreamed of a career in racing. Thus, it becomes Enzo's dream as well. He becomes quite the expert on the subject, learning from Denny as the two watch old race videos together, and Enzo relays an impressive font of knowledge to readers.<br /><br />Yet before too long, tragedy strikes the small family. Heartbroken, Enzo is powerless to do much other than watch what unfolds, hoping against all hopes that everything will turn out all right in the end.<br /><br />Of course, much of this story is a bit of a stretch -- particularly Enzo's intelligence, which quite possibly exceeds that of many people in our midst. But it's still enjoyable, and readers will find it difficult not to shed a few tears before it's through.

I kept putting off watching it, but I saw that it had Jewel Staite in it, from two of my other favorite past shows &#34;Higher Ground&#34; and &#34;Flash Forward&#34;. This show is amazing! It's funny, thrilling, and full of twists. It may have only lasted one season, but not for lack of being interesting, that's for sure.

B000HL09MG|4|The one subject that American filmmakers (for that matter, most filmmakers) are loathe to address is class. Sure, there are plenty of rags-to-riches stories, plenty of poor-man-sneaks-into-rich-environment-and-makes-good stories, but very few willing to attack class assumptions in a truly critical way. It seems Kubrick wanted to do this in \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" but got distracted by the rip-roaring yarn. It's more a story of the Tom Cruise character's journey, set against a backdrop notable for its strangeness and exclusivity.<br /><br />The fact is that these types of parties go on all the time, and it's not particularly difficult to get invited to them - just type \\"swing\\" into the Craigslist ads in any large city. What's different here is that the guest list for this party is limited to the rich and powerful, although with everyone wearing masks, it's impossible to tell. Nothing of consequence seems to be going on - the biggest difference between a regular \\"swingers\\" club and the one depicted herein is the number of thin, attractive women in their 20s. I should mention that any man who wants to get into the swing scene had better get used to having older and fatter women around. It's not a young person's scene by any stretch. But then, nothing seems to be happening at the party in \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" other than a bunch of nearly identical naked girls wandering around, who look like they just escaped from a Penthouse photo shoot. I would imagine that the really kinky Belle du Jour stuff is going on behind closed doors in the bedrooms - the coprophagia, formicophilia, \\"decanters,\\" hematolagnia, coulrophilia, thlipsosis, and urtication must be imagined as they are not shown - unless the only reason these people have gone to all this trouble is for the sake of mere voyeurism. Surely there had to be more going on than \\"hey, looka the warheads on that silo!\\"<br /><br />So there is this hidden (not really) world that the powerful (and any other interested person) are involved in, where nothing much happens, yet they are willing to commit murder to keep it a secret (or maybe not). Separate from any problems with the \\"story,\\" the film holds the viewer's interest, moving inevitably and inexorably to its minimally satisfying conclusion. No one who has committed to seeing every film ever made should miss this one.n, where nothing much happens, yet they are willing to commit murder to keep it a secret (or maybe not).

0375713751|4|I end up reading a couple of works of fiction per year.  For the 2004 calendar year to date, it's this book by Allison Pearson, which I found to be charming and clever.  Unlike some reviewers, I found all the events contained in here believable.<br />Pearson really has her finger on the differing attitudes of co-workers regarding a woman and man's involved parenting.  Protagonist and narrator Kate Reddy puts up with a constant barrage of inquisition, rolled eyes and backoffice plotting each time parenting needs infringe on her growing work responsibilities.  Meanwhile, she notes with contempt that a Scottish co-worker is \\"almost knighted on the spot\\" when he takes early departure from a meeting to attend one of his kid's school recitals (\\"Oooh, you're such a hands-in parent\\" coos one admirer).<br />The web is rife with reports that Pearson's book been optioned for a movie with Nicole Kidman as Reddy, directed by Anthony Minghella (who oversaw her in 'Cold Mountain').  That might work, although 'English Patient' auteur Minghella seems a serious touch for this book.  And I guess I had an image of Emma Thompson in my head, thanks to her similar role with two small kids in Richard Curtis' recent \\"Love Actually.\\"  [Thompson has the comedic chops to pull this off as well.]
B00006RU5B|4|When I first heard that Chris Cornell was starting a new band with the erstwhile musicians of Rage Against The Machine, my reaction could best be described as ecstatic.  Cornell is easily one of my favorite vocalists (perhaps eclipsed only by Jens Kidman of the almighty Meshuggah), and I've never considered Rage to be anything to sneeze at either.  I thought Ragegarden (as my college roommate and I still refer to the band to this day), would be nothing short of revolutionary, rendering all preceding music virtually obsolete.  Needless to say, I was rigid in joyful anticipation in the weeks leading up to their debut album's release.<br />When I finally got and heard the album, my reaction was one of extreme disappointment.  I just couldn't hear anything special about Audioslave.  Rather than sounding revolutionary, their album sounded to me like yet another grunge retread.  At times, it even made me think of Nickelback (Aaaaaiiiiiiiiyyyyeeeeeeee!).<br />However, after putting the CD away for about six months and then breaking it out again for a few more listens, I can see it's much better than I initially believed.  As is to be expected from a band consisting of Cornell and the ex-Ragers, the songwriting is tight, the vocals powerful, and the musicianship solid (and often spectacular).  But coming from such a stellar cast, I think I have the right to expect more.  Can anyone take this album, put it up against \\"Superunknown\\" song for song and say it even comes close?  I think not.<br />This isn't a knock against the singles.  \\"Audioslave\\" (couldn't they have come up with a better album title?) may be one of the few albums whose best songs made it to the radio.  The powerhouse opener \\"Cochise\\" proves conclusively that Cornell's voice has lost none of its ferocity, the mournful ballad \\"Like A Stone\\" is millions of times more eloquent than anything the likes of Puddle Of Mudd or John Mayer will ever do, and \\"Show Me How To Live\\" features one of the catchiest, most explosive choruses in history.<br />The rest of the album, while far from bad, doesn't fare quite as well.  There's certainly nothing wrong with it, but I just can't listen to this album without comparing what I hear with the brilliance that was Soundgarden's best work (to a lesser extent, the same can be said of Rage).  After \\"Like A Stone,\\" the band mixes hard-charging rock with more midtempo stuff, with results ranging from passable to excellent.<br />Unfortunately, the songs here too often seem stuck in the whole Seattle aesthetic that Soundgarden helped to create.  There's nothing wrong with sticking to your roots, but Audioslave is a new band, and as such I think they should have devoted more of their album to exploring new directions that their undeniably prodigious levels of talent and creativity would have allowed them.  When I heard that Cornell was getting together with the members of Rage Against The Machine, I expected something tantamount to genetically engineered super music, not a highly competent take on what's already been done by members of the \\"Seattle scene.\\"<br />The main problem here, in my opinion, is this album's length.  At fourteen songs clocking in at around sixty-five minutes, the it's simply not varied enough.  They should have either devoted a few songs to branching out from the alternative/hard rock template that characterizes the album, or cut out a few songs.  As it is, this album qualifies as a bit too much of a good thing.<br />Look, I really don't want to sound as if I'm bashing this album, because that's not my intention.  But I had *enormous* expectations for it prior to its release, and they just weren't met.  I think Audioslave could turn out to be a band worthy of its personnel, but I also think I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that there's some room for improvement.ive choruses in history.  <br />The rest of the album, while far from bad, doesn't fare quite as well.

B003JTHXN6|4|I really enjoyed reading this book with the exception of the second half of chapter 5, which the book got a little boring in my point of view. I would recommend this book to all to entrepreneurs. It shows how thinking of customers as the most important aspect of a business can grow your business. It also reveals all about the interesting and somewhat different culture in Zappos Company, which is very educational.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5|I found this book to be fascinating and very informative.  While no one could possibly classify me as a religious person, my roots certainly are grounded in going to church and Sunday school as a boy and young man.  Also, I enjoy history.  However, I was never really familiar with the details of the history surrounding Jesus, only the details of the history created by Jesus.  The distinction is not subtle as the author demonstrates.  He starts by telling the reader that this is not a book about Jesus the savior, but as Jesus in the context of the history of the area in which he lived.  The book certainly opened my eyes to things that I had no idea were happening just before, during and just after the life of Jesus.  The book definitely played to my interest in the history of this area at the time of Jesus.  Therefore, if a potential reader is looking at this book as an critique of the founding of the Christian faith, they should not bother.  However, if the reader is seeking a greater understanding about the historical events going on during the time of Jesus, the impact on Jesus and the roots of the Christian religion, then I would recommend this book.  I believe in some cases the book is a little repetitive, but generally, I would say that it is well written.

Nice transition from all the space themed tower defense games on Android.<br /><br />It works great on my Samsung Fascinate.  Menus are snappy and there is a quit option to exit the game right from the in-game options menu.<br /><br />If you like TD games, I would recommend this one highly, so long as you aren't afraid of the dark.

B0002OERI0|5|first of all,i love green day and have since dookie.also,i have had american idiot since it came out[before it got big].so im sure you are wondering why i haven't reviewed it yet.well,i find it hard to descibe it in a way that says how truly great it is.but im going to give it my best shot. <br />this is the best cd ever.whether your talking about punk,or rock,or whatever,this just exceeds anything else i have ever heard.i can listen to it over and over,every day[i do] and never tire of it.every song flows together perfectly and billie joe's lyrics just add to it.its hard to pick favorites[every song is just great] but Jesus of Suburbia stands out in my mind.instead of rating the songs in order of how they are on the cd,i'll instead put them in order of my favorites. <br />1.Jesus of Suburbia-this song is powerful.the lyrics are great.you have to listen to it to know how truly great this song is.5/5 <br />2.Homecoming-another long song,this is just a great song.5/5 <br />3.Letterbomb-again,the lyrics are superb.5/5 <br />4.St.Jimmy-this song's fast and very punky.5/5 <br />5.Holiday-a classic,everyone's heard it,the 3rd single from the album.the lryics are so anti-Bush-awesome!5/5 <br />6.American Idiot-again,everyones heard it,but you just never tire of it.again,anti-Bush lyrics.that rocks.5/5 <br />7.Whatsername-nostalgic feeling,a sad kind of song.very cool.5/5 <br />8.She's a Rebel-like St.Jimmy,fast.cool lyrics.5/5 <br />9.Extraordinary Girl-this is a cool song.5/5 <br />10.Give Me Novacaine-cool song,slightly slower,but nice.5/5 <br />11.Boulevard of Broken Dreams-I know alot of people would put this as their fav,but while its great,and a good single,others are better.i still love this song tho.5/5 <br />12.Wake Me Up When September Ends-this is not about 9/11.its about billie joe's dad dying.its a very emotional song with great lyrics.5/5 <br />13.Are We The Waiting-still good,but slower.5/5 <br />again,this is the best cd.and like i said in the title,i cannot possibly do it justice by describing it.you need to get this cd if you haven't already.whether you like punk or rock or not,this is just great music.GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!

B00FKAA3MA|5|I reluctantly pre-ordered MMLP2 because I grew out of Eminem since his release of 'Relapse' it's a good thing he bounced back with 'Recovery.' Fitting Em back into my music schedule this last year has been a good thing, old school stuff like 'Just Don't Give a ****' and tracks Slim fans listen to when we need a way to vent and blow off steam. Even though I've drifted, I've been a junkie since I heard 'My Name Is' in 6th grade. I'm loving Rick Rubin's style. I've been a fan of his since he produced Johnny Cash's last 6 albums, and the best of his career.<br /><br />'Bad Guy' is almost perfect and a great start to the new album. It's genius. The meaning behind it is larger than the verses it contains. The reason I'm writing this review is the most powerful track, 'Headlights' which is an apology to his mother, Debbie. I gotta say I haven't had a lump in my throat while listening to rap since hearing 'When I'm Gone' for the first time. 'Headlights' is worth the $14.99 alone. It's closure on this whole thing for Eminem and his mom, and frankly his fans.<br /><br />True raw talent can be heard on 'Rap God' he spits it faster than any rapper out there. There's a reason he has sold more albums than any other rapper because he is the best. Props to him for staying sober the difference is unmistakable, his talent has peaked.

B008P1EWIM|2|It doesn't show rain totals over the past day, week etc.  It only shows how much it is raining at the precise moment.
B007HC3LHS|3|It was so-so. From the details on the summary I guess I had a different expectation. The book was readable. Characters were okay. The &#34;back in time&#34; parts seemed confusing to me. Maybe if I could have read it all in one day.
B00005JNEI|5|You can argue that some things were edited a certain way to make a point, but there is way more than enough ACTUAL REAL footage of Bush, (and Bush sr.) Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney, etc. saying and doing f'ed up things. I'd say Bush is the real flip-flopper: \\"We have no reason to beleive Saddam has WMDs\\". a year and a half later: \\"We know now that Saddam has and intends to use WMDs...blah blah blah\\". And now over 1000 American soldiers have died, and still no sign of Osama Bin Laden. This movie is amazing, it's real, and Michael Moore is our savior. What's wrong with the truth being your agenda??

It's only a novel; people take it too seriously.<br /><br />If you want to hang onto the intrigue of the book, don't read \\"Holy Blood & Holy Grail\\".  If you want to ruin it, then read it.  \\"Holy Blood & Holy Grail\\" has an opposite effect on me than its intended purpose.  Not only it did not convince me, it drove me way off due to its many flaws in reasoning.
B008JFC6F0|5|On their second album the Australian psychedelic rock revivalists Tame Impala hit the bullseye yet again. Their last album \\"Innerspeaker\\" purloined the heart of many discerning rock fans not least with its trippy songs of loneliness which often recalled late period Beatles and was delightfully produced by The Flaming Lips soundboard guru Dave Fridmann. On this new album \\"Lonerism\\" a sense of isolation is once again the overriding theme but it is masked by the sheer variety of shade, colour and verve contained in these twelve songs. The bands unique leader Kevin Parker seeks his inspiration from polar opposite ends of the musical spectrum namely Britney Spears' `plastic pop' and predominantly from the well head of that \\"Wizard and true star\\" the gargantuanly talented but often sadly overlooked Todd Rundgren. It is difficult to know quite where to commence here since you sense that those who were smitten with the blissful \\"Innerspeaker\\" may find the sheer levels of experimentation here somewhat grating and overbearing. Alternatively if you give it sufficient time you will detect a wayward relative, an enfant terrible who clearly is part of the same close knit family but growing up at an astounding rate.<br /><br />Just listen to the first three songs and wonder about the fact that many of the the newer bands who have released albums in 2012 struggle to capture this level of creativity and innovation on an extended canvass of 45 minutes plus. Opener \\"Be above it\\" is all vocal loops and probably the most insistant drumming since Underworld's anthem \\"Born Slippy\\". Next in line \\"Endor Toi\\" achieves what Yeasayer have miserably failed to do on their new album by creating huge whirlwinds of pop psychedelica within the framework of a beautiful melodies, whilst \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" is as a funky as anything on Lewis Taylor's \\"Lost Album\\" and as equally brilliant. Timing is everything and on the same day that ELO issue a new greatest hits \\"Why won't they talk me \\" echoes Jeff Lynne while \\"Feel like we are going backwards\\" is pure summer of love and blissed out vibes. Mention in dispatches should go to the wonderful pop of the single \\"Elephant\\" a sprawlingly ambitious song which throws in the kitchen sink, the the gas cooker and the microwave. It is far the most rocking track on the album but pumps along with enough distractions to grab your attention with a vice like grip. God knows what is going on all together in the six minute plus \\"Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control\\" punctuated by whirring Parker vocals, spoken dialogue and almost a Syd Barrett like pop longing which makes it such a unmitigated treat. In this sense the last song \\"Sun's Coming Up\\" might be the least favourite track on here starting with a gentle piano coda and ending with synthesiser waves crashing on the beach it might just be a bit to clever for its own good but more listens are required. In any case you can counter it with one of the bubbling highlights of the album the echo laden and spacey \\"Music to walk home by\\" a song to wear your needle thin.<br /><br />Tame Impala and their burgeoning levels of \\"Mind Mischief\\" are turning this band into real contenders with their massive pop sensibilities combined with an eye for startling retro, so old its new. This is an album realised well in time for the forthcoming brightness of the Australian summer and no doubt will soundtrack the rising heat in those latitudes as the a hot sun slowly drifts down the line of beach. In the grey autumn of a dull October how we must envy our \\"Antipodean\\" cousins for their fair climate and for having one of the best new bands on any continent.ynne while \\"Feel like we are going backwards\\" is pure summer of love and blissed out vibes.

B003YY7BTW|1|The rating of this movie on Amazon is one of the reasons why I usually can't trust Amazon's ratings, especially on the ratings of tv shows and movies.  Bad script, bad acting and so predictable and unrealistic.  There was no chemistry from the meeting of the first two characters, and yet, they are so in love already.  I couldn't finish the movie, but upset that I wasted $4 renting it.
0385349947|4|Some early reviewers knocked Sandberg's book as elitist because she does not discuss the problems experienced by poor and low-income women. But that was a bad rap because Sandberg is quite clear in her thesis: Before you can have a country (and a world) that provides serious attention and solutions to the concerns of women and children -- improvements in health care, education, child care, family leave -- you have to have more women leading governments and corporations. Lean In is Sandberg's  analysis of the reasons women haven't achieved leadership parity with men (because given a choice between having a family and having power, many women choose family) and her prescription for achieving leadership parity (women should lean in to their professional aspirations right up until the moment when they must lean back in order to have a family.) Sandberg's key insight is that women lean back from their careers long before they actually need to -- when they're just thinking about having children rather than after those children actually arrive. If those women continue to lean in, Sandberg suggests that they may find that when the time comes for family, they may not actually have to lean back, either because they've achieved enough power to successfully juggle career and family or because enough women have become government and corporate leaders that the climate of professional life has become more family friendly. And while Sandberg clearly is hoping that those who lean in will develop a taste for power, she does not denigrate those who choose family, wisely endorsing the longstanding feminist goal of providing choices for all women. Although this book is clearly aimed at professional women, many of Sandberg's insights can prove useful to any woman in the workplace. For example, she notes that men apply for jobs when they have around 50 percent of the posted skill requirements while women don't apply unless they have 90 percent. Also, men are more likely to ask for a raise then women, and when they do, men generally ask for more money than their female colleagues. However, Sandberg's insights for professional women are often invaluable. For example, when faced with high child-care costs that almost wipe out a working mother's income, Sandberg advises viewing those lost dollars as an investment in future earnings. Professional women who drop out of the work force for a few years will never be able to catchup to that lost income, which in professional circles can be huge. For that and other advice relevant to any woman embarking on a professional career, Sandberg's book is a must-read for 20- and 30-something women.then women, and when they do, men generally ask for more money than their female colleagues.

B00BAXFECK|3|The first time through this novel I was completely enthralled, not so much by the novel itself, but by the narrator David Pittu.  What a joy for those who really enjoy audio books!!!  Sections of the plot that I personally found to be problematic were easy to forgive and ignore because Mr. Pittu did such an amazing job of continually drawing me back into the problematic world of Theodore Decker.  Is The Goldfinch as a great novel?  I'm not so sure.  Is The Goldfinch great listening material?  Absolutely!!
0375842209|5|One of the best novels I've read in a long time, deserving of more than 5 stars.  The story is moving, drawing you into the dark, dark days of a terrible world war with its accompanying Nazi brutality.  In the midst of the terrible suffering, the courage and beauty of the story's ordinary people is mesmerizing.  Zusak's stark, tight, gorgeous prose paints poignant and at times painful pictures that are as beautiful as any in a museum.  Read the book.
B00B04NJLW|4|The ABCs of Death is a horror anthology partially based on the Dark Forces novels and (of course) the classic ABCs children's books.  26 unique directors were given one letter of the alphabet each to create a short - some less than a minute short - horror film that must include at least one death.<br /><br />Because this film was an anthology it is difficult to rate the entire production without mentioning its individual parts.  So, without giving too much away I will highlight what makes this film great and what it lacks...<br /><br />A is for Apocalypse:  I can't give too much away with this one, other than we watch as a woman fails to kill her husband.<br /><br />B is for Bigfoot:  Very creepy, and very surreal.  A man and woman tell a young girl about a creature that tears the hearts out of children who do not mind their elders.<br /><br />C is for Cycle:  I really enjoyed this one, and can only say that it involves a man whose house is seemingly being invaded.<br /><br />D is for Dogfight:  This piece was interesting as it could be interpreted two different ways:  either the main character (a man) is fighting a dog for money, or the man is actually a dog and it is a genuine (illegal) dogfight.<br /><br />E is for Exterminate:  Here a man kills a spider that has been pestering him for days.  This one was just fun, and very reminiscent of many urban legends about insects that make their way into peoples brains through the ear.<br /><br />F is for Fart:  Yes, you read that right.  F is for Fart.  Oh, what can I say about this one except \\"What just happened?\\" this short was painfully bad and yet it was hilarious and worth watching over-and-over again.<br /><br />(As we go on with this review of the other lettered shorts I need to say that most of the films created by Japanese directors/writers were ridiculous and should not have been included in the overall anthology.  Most were pointless and more bizarre comedy than horror... F is for Fart was a Japanese made short, and thus ridiculous.)<br /><br />G is for Gravity:  After F is for Fart, G is for Gravity brought the movie back to its intended purpose:  to tell horror stories.  \\"G\\" was a very good story.  A man commits suicide in a very harsh and personal way.  It was shot POV (point-of-view) meaning we see what the character sees.  We also hear the character softly crying as he marches towards his suicide. Very good.<br /><br />H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion:  Wow.  I could only term this short as a live-action-cartoon.  In it a female fox and a male dog - both, of course, dressed as a 1940's British Soldier (dog) and Nazi (fox) - have an epic battle that was both bizarre and rewarding for the viewer.<br /><br />I is for ________:  I'm not going to tell you what \\"I\\" stands for because you can only truly understand the short (which involves a woman being held hostage in a bathtub) after the title has been shown at the end of the film...  \\"I\\" was very poetic and very unnerving.<br /><br />J is for Jidai-geki:  Another Japanese one... I don't know what to make of it.  It was too cartoonish and too bizarre.  I'm not saying it was bad, just weird.<br /><br />K is for Klutz:  A woman's poop haunts her... `nuff said.<br /><br />L is for Libido:  A lot of the other reviewers of this film really hated this story.  They hated it because child molestation was strongly implied.  But, I did not hate it.  In fact it was one of my Short-List Favorites that I will include at the end of this review.  \\"L\\" told the story of a group of men who were kidnapped, and then forced to watch various sexual acts that ranged from erotic to sickening, all the while these men were forced to ejaculate to what they were watching.  The men were paired and the first man in a pair to ejaculate won, the loser was run through with a steel rod mechanically positioned at the bottom of the men's chairs.  Of course the men are being held against their will and are being watched by a group of masked (obviously wealthy) spectators.  Our \\"hero\\" is truly put to the test, as each display in front of him grows more and more terrifying.  I thought this piece was well thought out and ended just the way a horror story should end, unhappily.<br /><br />M is for ________:  Like \\"I\\" I'm not going to tell you what \\"M\\" stands for.  This was the shortest film in the anthology - one-minute maybe - and is self-explanatory once you know the title. It was fun and fast.<br /><br />N is for Nuptials:  I love this one!  Very funny ending, and a very cool concept.<br /><br />O is for Orgasm:  This was the one and only non-Japanese short to be weird.  It was very artistic, but still weird.<br /><br />P is for Pressure:  A poor woman is forced to make tough decisions to keep her family happy.  I am not squeamish but this one made me want to cover my eyes at one point.  Not because it was gory - and gore DOES NOT MAKE true horror - but because of what the woman did to earn a little cash.<br /><br />Q is for Quack:  Very meta and funny.  I won't try to explain it, but it's worth a watch.<br /><br />R is for Removed:  I honestly have a hard time remembering this one.  I do not understand what was going on, but it was creepy.<br /><br />S is for Speed:  Two women are on the run from a hooded creature, but is it a run worth making?  This one was surreal to begin and sad to end.<br /><br />T is for Toilet:  Rather than review this one I will supply a link to the full short that you can sample.  It is a claymation piece that plays on childhood fears of... potty training.  Here is the link:[...]<br /><br />U is for Unearthed:  A POV... we are witnessing a chase through a dark wooded area where every turn could mean the capture of our main character.  This is a great perspective piece that lets us perceive what are nightmares see.<br /><br />V is for Vagitus:  It is several years into the future and procreation has been banned.  One woman, an officer tasked with sterilizing and eradicating those who have propagated without permission finds a truth about herself.  I really liked this one, although it was more sci-fi than horror.<br /><br />W is for WTF?:  I think the title says it all.  And although the titles are not revealed until the end of each short you will be saying \\"WTF?\\" as soon as it begins.<br /><br />X is for XXL: An obese woman finds a way - a grizzly way - to make herself thin.  I really enjoyed this short and I believe that it may rank highest in my Short-List Favorites near the end of this review.<br /><br />Y is for Young Buck:  Creepy, and pure gross-out.  I won't go into detail but this one was very gross in parts.  Like \\"L\\" it involved some child molestation, but unlike \\"L\\" other reviewers seem to have no problem with it.<br /><br />Z is for Zetsumetsu:  There's no better way to end a good anthology than to end it with a bang!  Too bad we were left with \\"Z\\"... It was horrible.  Stupid. Pointless.  I was so disappointed that this Japanese disaster of a film was made to be the last short in the anthology.  As far as I could tell some nuclear blast hit japan and made mutants that enjoy making sushi.  Also there is a woman with a penis/sword.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Okay!  We have formal knowledge of the short films and now we can give our approval or disapproval for the entire show.<br /><br />Horror is a tricky genre.  Those who don't understand it think it's all hack-and-slash and gory scenes of naked people covered in vomit.  Not so.  True horror is a story wherein someone overcomes or succumbs to fear.  It is a battle between good and evil wherein evil is often the victor.  Horror is the story of strength.  When you're telling a horror story you are inviting fear into the lives of your audience, what those people do with that fear is up to them and in essence feeling fear is to feel alive.  The ABC's Of Death offered up 26 stories for us to sample.  The goal when finishing a horror story is to walk away thinking \\"Wow, that was scary, and I'mstill a little nervous but I survived it and I maybe learned something new about death, or life, or how to persevere,\\" and I believe The ABCs of Death did that.  Mind you I do not believe they gave each letter a good story but they did create a majority of thoughtful nuggets of terror that I will not soon forget.<br /><br />Watch it alone, and then watch again with friends.  I think some of these shorts were meant to be discussed with a group.<br /><br />Finally my Short-List Favorites; the best-of-the-best (in my opinion) in the anthology:<br />X<br />U<br />I<br />L<br />P<br />S<br />Gitles are not revealed until the end of each short you will be saying \\"WTF?\\" as soon as it begins.

B004GNYGTI|4|I really enjoyed this action film. Some reviewers complain about it being unrealistic to have Angelina Jolie beating up a bunch of people, but aren't all action movies kind of unrealistic anyway? I thought the nonstop action was fun, and it kept me guessing about whether Angelina Jolie's character was good or evil.

0143113100|5|The history of Sigmund Freud's approach to the mechanisms of the mind has exhibited some tumultuous changes over the past century.  Norman Doidge reminds us that Freud developed a thesis about the mind's plasticity over time.  Freud's psychotherapy - irrespective of some questionable methods - was designed to allow the mind to search within itself and change outward behaviour by identifying memories hidden or repressed.  However, after Freud, researchers using diagnoses of stroke or brain-injury victims, \\"mapped\\" areas in the brain for function.  The first of these was the speech-producing region now named Broca's Area, after Paul Broca, its discoverer in the mid-19th century.  Brain modularity, or \\"localization\\" as Doidge deems it, became the norm in brain research for decades following Broca.  In this fine account of the history or recent brain studies, Doidge addresses a new concept being used to both treat and train - brain \\"plasticity\\".<br /><br />Rewiring of the brain isn't a new concept.  Among the more famous examples of how the brain reacts to challenges from the rest of the body is the concept known as \\"phantom limbs\\".  Patients suffering amputations have complained of itchiness or pain seeming to emanate from the lost limb.  V.S. Ramachandran and his colleagues have described this phenomenon in detail.  \\"Rama\\" is but one of the researchers Doidge parades in a receiving line of innovative cognitive specialists.  One of his more noteworthy is Michael Merzenich, who Doidge declares is the \\"world's leading researcher in brain plasticity\\".  Merzenich followed the work of Wilder Penfield at McGill University in Montreal.  Penfield used electrical probes to map the regions of the brain to identify which areas produced specific reactions.  Penfield's work reinforced the consensus regarding \\"localization\\".  Doidge goes so far as to deem neuroscience as long dominated by \\"localizationism\\" - a form of dogma.  Merzenich, on the other hand used more refined equipment than available to Penfield, has made vast strides with closer detail.  His work also demonstrated that \\"lost areas\\" in the brain have their duties taken up in other regions.  The brain, he demonstrated, can \\"re-wire\\" itself - and in more than one way.  The brain, then, isn't dominated by genetically assigned \\"localizations\\".  It's \\"plastic\\" and able to change, through training or even using its own resources.  In a sense, Freud's original concept has been vindicated by recent research.<br /><br />Doidge follows the work of dozens of researchers who have revealed examples of this re-mapping activity.  They investigate how stroke patients can learn to use limbs rendered unresponsive.  The treatment seems bizarre - restrain the good limb so it will not replace the useless one.  In a short time, the unresponsive limb begins to respond as the brain is forced to seek new pathways.  Patient recovery has been almost spectacular, according to Doidge.  He stresses that the theme is \\"use it or lose it\\" throughout the book, but is especially true in stroke victims.  Where traditional therapy enhanced the capabilities of the working limb, brain plasticity demonstrates that recovering use of an affected limb should be favoured.  This new therapy can be successfully applied months, or even years, after the stroke event.  In this author's hands, these accounts read like a script for a car-salesman sitcom.  He may be correct in his views, but nothing in brain sciences is entirely positive, as history has demonstrated.<br /><br />There's more than just therapy in brain plasticity achievements.  In Asia, particularly Japan, babies are born with ability to form the sound for the letter \\"L\\".  Since Japanese doesn't contain any words with that sound, children lose the capacity to pronounce it.  A new programme, using slowly sounded words can actually recover the pronunciation in immigrants to North America.  The technique is an indicator of what Doidge refers to as \\"plasticity competition\\".  Although the brain appears to re-route signals throughout the brain simply during daily use, there is also the possibility of patterns settling in and resisting change.  Doidge refers to this as the \\"plastic paradox\\", and sees it as the way habits are formed and retained - even against good sense.<br /><br />While Doidge has provided a comprehensive look at how recent research has overthrown the notion of \\"one area - one behaviour\\", there are numerous questions remaining.  How does the mechanism work?  What triggers neurons to reach out to make new connections?  Is anything already in place displaced, or are idle synapses or dendrites now put to work?  Does the old notion of our using \\"only 10 per cent. of our brain\\" - an clich&eacute; long dismissed by neuroscientists - have some validity, after all?  Although two Appendices enlarge greatly on this overview - one on culture and another on \\"Progress\\", brain mechanics in this process remain obscure.  This shortcoming requires vast amounts of further research but in no way diminishes Doidge's accomplishment.  This book will remain a major element in the history of brain studies for some time.  Written for any reader who has a brain, the author deserves the fullest praise for his accomplishment.  The five stars is given a bit grudgingly, but this book requires the widest exposure possible.

B00AHSIQWE|5|Really, this movie get's back to the flow of Batman Begins. This is a great movie, with lots of action! The movie really brings out the human aspect of Batman, really he's just a man that cares about justice. This movie is a collectors items. Out of the whole Batman trilogy I like this one and Batman Begins the most. The violence was just too much in number two. However, fans can certainly get back in the mode for Batman with this movie because it has so much to offer from story line, to special effects, to action. Bottom line, this is a must see movie, with close to 3 hours of story line.

0375826726|2|I was disappointed when I first heard some months ago that the Inheritance trilogy would, in fact, become longer.  Part of me wonders if the 4th book wont also end up being too long, and needing to be split.  Eragon certainly has more to do now than he did at the end of Eldest, and Paolini has made it clear that whenever Eragon swears an oath to someone, we're going to devote a whole lot of time to watching him do it.  Given that Eragon swears a new oath every 50 pages or so (give or take), it may be a while before he gets caught up.    I have long since given up on the tiresome fantasy series of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and the like as I noticed that after about the 3rd or 4th book, nothing new happens.  A series should be short, maintain our attention, and always keep in mind the primary conflict between hero and villian.      Books one and two of the Inheritance cycle did this.  At the end of Eldest, Eragon has three things that need be done, fulfill his promise to Roran, return to Oromis, and defeat Galbatorix.  The first of those is finished in the early pages of the book, but from there, we spiral away from the story and into tiresome cliche.  Eragon spends pages moaning and groaning about how he has been forced to kill, but it never amounts to anything.  Eragon and Roran spend pages pontificating at each other in conversations that make each of them sound as though they were raised in the hearts of academia, rather than on the farm.      As an aside, the characters talk way too much in this book.  For pages.  One wonders when they pause to take breath.  Even other characters notice this \\"He certainly talks alot.\\" says Saphira at one point.  Yes, I suppose he does.  But then, so do you, my dear blue dragon.  So do you...    As for the plot, what is there to say?  Of the three tasks Eragon had at the beginning, two are completed.  But with much else along the way.  Eragon visits and then leaves a mysterious hermit who'se only purpose in the book is so wewont be surprised again when he shows up next time, no doubt to give Eragon a crucial piece of information.  We spend page after page waiting for the dwarves to elect the ruler we all know well in advance will be elected in a process that isn't the least bit interesting.  One hopes that the elected leader is able to cut through the red tape.    We learn things about Eragon's father that don't suprise us in the least, and even dissapoint us, as they make Eragon a far less interesting character, and free him completely of the guilt that was the sole characteristic making him interesting.  Galbatorix's and Murtagh's inexplicable strength is explained using a plot device that I'm sure Paolini developed only after making his two villians untouchably strong.  And when Glaedr gives Eragon a gift towards the end, I knew it would mean only one thing.      This should have been the final book.      But instead of the planning and fighting against the forces of the empire, we get Eragon brooding whether or not he should eat meat or starve to death.  (He eats the meat, but feels real bad about it.)  Instead of studying new spells and magic, Eragon asks an Urgal for a bedtime story.  And instead of a climactic battle between Eragon and Galbatorix, we get a deeper insight into the dwarven political arena than is needed or even wanted.      At this point, I'm invested in the series, however, and I await the fourth (but will it be the final?) book with the same anticipation as I await a trip to the dentist, or the DMV.  It's just one of those things you don't really look forward to, except for the feeling of relief when it's all over.
B0070Y46UY|4|Long intro, but the actual  action is unprecedented. I read this as apart of a book club, and grateful that it was first on the list.

B00I2TV3NO|5|Great movie
1440423911|1|Before reading A Christmas Carol, I automatically gave the book the highest regard probably because I was influenced by the Disney's movie version, at least that's what I thought the book would be like. Well, it didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' novels and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I've felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style.<br /><br />What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made it difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale.<br /><br />What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I've felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge.<br /><br />One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force of the audience to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire story is too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I don't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit.<br /><br />All in all, I've found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters are unmemorable for me.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is fun and a bit challenging. My brother is the one who introduced this to me. And I was like WOW!!
6300183971|3|was this incredible book ever concieved as a movie?  THere is too much intense detail that,t hough necessary in the book, becomes heavy and oppressive in the movie.  They tried to simplify the story without damaging  its thick and overpowering richness.  UNfortunately, they chose the wrong  way to do it.  As the movie opens with a mindboggling narration, which  should have been left out as it only serves to confuse the audience, you  get a sense that there is something dreadfully wrong with the movie.  THis  is only amplified when you start hearing the voice over intended to give  you a further insight inot the character's thoughts.  THese voice overs  became doubly confusing when half the characters are telepathic and you  can't tell whether they're talking to themselves or to each other.  It is  sad that such an epic story was mauled in such a manner.<br />However, I did  give the movie three stars for two reasons- the wonderful cast, and the  incredible environments.  Unfortunately, though the actors are all superb  many are wasted.  They appear only momentarily as if to say, &quot;Hi, I'm  here too,&quot; and then leave.  On the plus side, the environments are  fanatastic.  The emperor's throne room is a sight to be seen.  All of the  environments were constructed with painstaking detail.  And yet agian it is  sad since it all came to nothing due to the mishandling of the  plot.<br />Fortunately, this is not the last chapter of the DUNE saga, Sci-fi  channel is working on a miniseries( a format to which a novel like DUNE is  much better fitted ) due out this December.
B002N2LEVM|4|Joss Wheadon had a five year plot line for this show. The last three episodes seemed so crammed full of story line.  I guess he was trying to wrap up three years worth of material in three episodes.  Wish he'd had all 5 seasons.

B003ZJJFKE|5|This CD seems like a swing back to Satriani's earlier work, like Surfing with the Alien and Flying in a Blue Dream. I like it very much.    There is little more that can be said about Satriani which hasn't already been said a thousand times. He is a fantastic guitarist and musician, very creative, great stage presence (check out his DVDs), and so on. The thing which makes him stand out for me is the extreme musicality of his work. Lots of people can shred like a buzzsaw, but Satriani's creations are melodious and deeply musical. I consider him the most melodious of all the shredmeisters.    Much of his music has an anthem-like or heroic quality. It seems to uplift and transport the listener (at least it does that for me - I have even had out-of-body experiences listening to some of his pieces - and, no, NO drugs were involved, in case you wondered). I also do some qigong exercises to certain cuts and find that they accentuate the flow of qi in some ways. Way cool music.    Cut number 7, The Golden Room, reminds me a tiny bit of the style of a band I heard once in the late 70s, called Carmen, that did flamenco music at hard rock volumes, complete with dancers on stage. Very cool. It is a style that lends itself to heavy instrumentation well, and has not been explored as much as other styles (at least as far as I know).      UPDATE: That number 7 cut inspired me to go looking for anything by Carmen, and sure enough, their albums have been re-issued on CD. More unexpected inspiration from Satriani - Thank you, Joe!      Another great release from one of the world's all time great musicians. Thanks, again, Joe. Your work is appreciated more than you know.

B000002W9Q|5|A great addition to the timeless classic.  I love all the songs on this soundtrack, because it takes me back in time.  These are the songs that will never get old.  This CD is constantly finding it's way back into my CD player, despite all the new CD's I'm constantly getting.  You just can't get enough of it...especially the song &quot;(I've Had) The Time Of My Life&quot; because that's the song that sticks with you, from the movie AND the soundtrack.  I also really love the song &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot; because everytime I hear that song, I can picture the scene from the movie, where Johnny is working on teaching Baby how to dance in preparation for their first show.  That's when you first see the attraction building.  It's a wonderful soundtrack and I highly recommend it.

B000N2HCM4|4|\\"Dreams From My Father\\" chronicles Barack Obama's inspiring journey of self-discovery culminating in a life-changing journey to Kenya, the country of his Father's birth. As he meets the African side of his family and hears their stories he comes to a greater understanding of the complicated person his Father was, and the ghosts that haunted him. He also explores the meaning of this heritage in his own life. Along the way, he offers keen insights into race relations in this country. This book was written with such depth, intelligence, and compassion that you will find yourself saying \\"This man should be President\\" and then you realize, oh yeah...he is :)<br /><br />I had intentionally stayed away from Obama's other book \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" because I'm generally wary of books written when someone is emerging on the national political stage. Since it was written in 1995, well before he began running for political office, \\"Dreams From My Father\\" offers the reader a unique window into the character of Barack Obama the man, not the politician.<br /><br />A must-read for anyone who's interested in politics, current events, Africa, or race relations.

0679745203|5|It's true that most of my recreational reads are action/adventure/mystery with a lot of movement. But I really am trying to get a bit more introspective and appreciative of different writing styles.  It was recommended by a friend that I read The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje.  In a word, wow.  It was far from my normal fare, but I quickly got drawn into the imagery and way that Ondaatje was able to take four separate individuals with different stories and weave them into a single plot.<br /><br />I did have to take my time and trust a bit that it would all come together.  The first scene involves Hana, a fatigued nurse holding vigil over her last patient, a severely burned pilot known as \\"the English patient\\".  While the end of World War II is almost there, she remains at the converted hospital, just her and the patient, amid the rubble of bombings and shellings.  There's not much background as to who they are and why she refuses to leave.  In the second scene, Caravaggio, a thief who's hands were mutilated as punishment, arrives at the hospital, and tries to figure out who the patient is in real life, as well as how he feels about Hana.  And finally, Kip arrives at the hospital.  He's an Indian \\"sapper\\", one who goes in and disarms unexploded ordinance.  He's never allowed himself to be close to anyone due to his particularly short life expectancy.  But Hana is under his skin, and he has to start understanding someone else aside from only himself.<br /><br />Once all the characters are given their time and space as individuals arriving at the hospital, the stories start to merge.  Caravaggio thinks the English patient to be someone else entirely.  Caravaggio teases the story from him, learning exactly what role he might have played in the war.  And via the wireless, they all hear news that completely changes their view of everything they stood for and believed in.  And that causes their own shared universe to go spiraling out of control once again...<br /><br />I enjoyed this far more than I expected I would.  I learned to slow down my pace and just let the story flow over me and unfold as it wanted.  I also had to trust that it was all going to come together in a way that was not going to make me regret the time I had spent reading it.  I also learned quite a bit on how a good author can paint the surroundings with words, and put you right there in the middle of the scene, complete with the appropriate emotions and atmosphere.<br /><br />Of course, now I need to see the movie version of it. :)more than I expected I would.

B0007TKNII|5|I watched the Phantom of the Opera theatre production 13 years ago, and quickly ran out to get the Original London Cast recording.  When I watched this movie, I was just swept away.  The movie was excellent, the music was right on, the costumes and scenary were beautiful, and the main characters were very true to form.  If some people would have preferred to have Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford in the lead roles, I would like to remind them that those two famous singers played the role of Christine and the Phantom almost 20 years ago.  In this story, Christine is only 16, and up close with a movie camera, Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing.  I am astonished that they found Emmy Rossum, who not only sings shockingly well (Sarah Brightman's London cast recording is the best, but Ms. Rossum was very good), but is also so ethereally beautiful and fits the role so perfectly and was only 16 at filming!  The Phantom was strong, mysterious and sexy, so much that the brave and loving Raoul was only a close second.  One reader commented that the Phantom's mask only covered part of his right face, but when the mask came off, most of his right face and head was disfigured.  I would note that the Phantom had several nice brunette wigs on his dresser, which would have covered the disfigured head areas and made him look nicer.   <br /> <br />The movie itself is very beautiful, and the movie format allowed us to see up and down the theatre, and gave greater depth to the musical story. On stage, the characters of the Phantom were seen at a distance.  With a movie camera, it allows us to see the characters up close (so that a 40+ year old Sarah Brightman would have been unconvincing as the young ingenue), and the sets really elaborated at the sets we saw on stage.  Watching the movie, I understood the plot much better and the singing seemed very natural.  For example, we meet the dancing instructor, the theatre stage hand, the two theatre owners, and follow their important roles in the story.  I especialy liked Carlotta as the spoiled musical tyrant.  The theatre was truly sumptuous.  The complicated scenes with the letters from the Phantom is easier to follow in movie format.  If Christine Daae is not the deepest female role, I would only note that Andrew Lloyd Webber did not create a particularly deep or rich role in the Christine; she's primarily beautiful, young, sings like a dream and strangely caught in love and/or mesmerized by two different men. The Phantom was dark, tormented, sexy and oddly pitiable, yet also contemptible with what he did to some people.  Raoul is the rich, loving knight in shining armour.  I thought the plot and tension between the three main characters, Christine, Phantom and Raoul, were great, and the romance was such that I was guessing at the ending until the very end (even though I've seen the stage production!) I have to buy this DVD so that I can watch it over and over again.

0060853972|5|I have very high standards for books. I have been known to spend half an hour stomping through a bookstore, having concluded that I have already read every good book in existence and will never read another good book. On the other hand, it used to be that when someone asked me what my favorite book was, I would hem and haw for a few minutes listing authors and subgenres and philosophies that interested me and avoid a straight answer.    This is my favorite book.    It's clever. It's witty. The characters are well-developed and interesting, the dialogue is snappy, and (SLIGHT SPOILER) you won't realize how much you missed books with happy endings until you finish this one. It's filled with the very best kind of pop culture references and the sort of very British humor you can find in Douglas Adams (and, of course, anything Terry Pratchett has ever written). If you enjoy the works of either author, you will love this book. Pratchett and Gaiman's writing styles are surprisingly complementary of each other and both of them can write in each other's style with a bit of personal twist.    May your copy be as worn and well-loved as mine.
0679746048|1|i've never read a book that wasn't ruined by the movie version until girl interrupted. this book was awful. though i feel sympathy for the author considering the book is her life story, i was bewildered by the poor  writing and lack of emotion. i was truly bored. for the first time, i'm  suggesting others to see the movie and avoid the book. i never thought any  movie version could be better than the book. but in this case it is.
B004HW7JMY|5|What a character Gannicus is!<br /><br />All characters are even more complex and full than they were last season (except for Crixus, he's like a blank paper). John Hannah truly shines with almost all other characters following closely.<br /><br />This is a prequel you simply can´t miss. I just wish it had been longer.

B000NDIAWY|5|In a musical industry that loves to pigeon-hole artists or put them into specific channels, there is not much incentive for a musician to blend styles, take chances, and come up with something totally new. Brandi Carlile was not dissuaded from coming up with something new anyway. She rocks, she sings ballads, and she does her own writing. She does not try to hide the country influence in her background, as her sweet lilting voice almost yodles at points.

This area is one of the most intriguing in biological science and revises our understanding of everything from evolution to the mechanics in genetic translation and expression. I will re-read it soon to better appreciate the ideas and just to re-experience the joy I felt when reading it for the first time.

The Marvel franchise of movies overall are like I dream come true!  I use to read a lot of comics when I was younger, and still do, and when I was younger I had always thought it would be cool if they one day broght these awesome superheroes to life in some movies, and I think it's so cool that they have the technology now to do them.  A good buddy of mine in Hawaii sent this to me on Blu-Ray as a birthday gift.  Super awesome!  So stoked for Avengers in 2012!

B00HWWUQYY|2|My wife & I have been looking forward to watching this at home for months.  We are dedicated Tolkien enthusiasts, overall quite impressed with Peter Jackson's handling of Tolkien's oeuvre.  I'm not a purist -- I don't object to creative departures from source material, as long as those departures are based on some sensible rationale and sustain a measure of tonal consistency.  \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" took some liberties but nothing stood out as glaringly obtuse.  \\"The Desolation of Smaug,\\" alas, is where Peter Jackson wanders into the proverbial Mirkwood and never returns (reminiscent of his \\"King Kong\\" treatment in all the wrong ways).<br /><br />Clearly, they wanted to make the film as contemporary as possible.  By \\"contemporary\\" I mean replete with cartoonish combat and camp, awash if not drowning in computer graphics.  My eight year old son got some laughs out of the interminable barrel ride sequence, but my wife and I were rolling our eyes and trying to stifle the yawns.  Over the course of the film, we witness a dozen or so orc decapitations -- their heads being far too easily severed from their bodies, and far too cleanly.<br /><br />There's just nothing here to make you CARE about the characters, despite Thorin Oakenshield's personality being transformed from grumpy old self-righteous curmudgeon to the second coming of Aragorn (complete with curly shiny long locks and breathy speeches delivered to his one-dimensional companions).<br /><br />Lake-town -- for no discernible reason -- is depicted with something of a Nordic palate, and the tenor of the town is a bizarre mix of Dickens and J.K. Rowling's Muggles.  Bard's personality and loyalties are more meandering and unpredictable than the Colorado, when I always pictured him as a calm and confident bowman (not a dwarf-smuggling bargeman).  Here, they are setting him up to use some sort of Dwarven ballista-like contraption to take Smaug down.  WHY?<br /><br />The more I think and write about it, the more this film doesn't even seem to deserve two stars, but I did experience some enthusiasm when they finally reached the side of Lonely Mountain and Smaug engaged Bilbo in conversation.  The madcap fight/chase sequence that ensues, however, had me thinking that Tolkien must surely be rolling over in his grave at this atrocity.  Save your money, save your 2 hours and 42 minutes, avoid this bloated bore.film doesn't even seem to deserve two stars, but I did experience some enthusiasm when they finally reached the side of Lonely Mountain and Smaug engaged Bilbo in conversation.

B000MV8AE0|5|This movie focuses on the last 3 years of Beethoven's life (1824-1827).  While it is likely to be compared to the great film [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]], their agendas are different.  Both movies cover Beethoven's triumph of the premiere of his 9th symphony.  This film, however, goes beyond the 9th and focuses on this late string quartets - most of which were rejected by the musical audience of his day.<br /><br />Diane Kruger portrays a fictional character who interacts with Ludwig.  She is his musical copyist who has ambitions to write music in her own right.  While she is technically gifted in music theory and being a copyist, she is missing the Master's innovative touch when it comes to composition.<br /><br />The relationship between the two becomes the center-of-gravity of the film.  Somewhat surprisingly, the movie does not water itself down to becoming some cheesy love story.  Granted, there are a few moments in the film that could be called erotic in nature, but it is a very muted eroticism.<br /><br />There is a slight, oblique parallel with [[ASIN:6304712936 Amadeus]].  Instead of Salieri being buried in the shadow of Mozart, Beethoven belittles a person who belongs to another art:  architecture.  In this case, Beethoven points out that the guy is a not-so-good bridge builder.  That was a curious segment.<br /><br />Ed Harris is every bit as obnoxious, pompous, volatile, ill-mannered, rude and bigger-than-life as we would expect from someone playing the Great Composer.  I have always been a big fan of Ed Harris, and this movie is likely to convert others to admiring Harris' acting prowess as well.  In the special features, Harris reveals that he read up on Beethoven's life and constanly listened to his music in preparation for the role.  It shows!  Diane Kruger is terrific as the young woman who gains Beethoven's friendship.  The fact that she was born in Germany adds to the lustre of the film.<br /><br />This is not a typical biographical film as it pinpoints a particular juncture of the composer's life.  There are only references to other epoch's of his life.  As is always the case with movies that deal with composers, the film has a nice built-in soundtrack!  As a sidenote, people may want to see [[ASIN:B00006L92U State of Grace]] as well.  Little did anyone know when SOG was made that both Ed Harris and Gary Oldman would go on to play the immortal musician - and both do a fine job thereof!ture of the composer's life.

B0006399FS|1|I heard this and it didn't catch me right away.  I don't have time to allow CDs to \\"grow on me\\" so I cannot give this any more than 1 star.  Please, U2, write some better songs, if you in fact write your own.  LAtely it seems like you have other people doing it for you just so you can appeal to the masses.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Honestly, through the beginning of this book I was pretty disappointed, being kinda bored. But then I fell in love with it, and I couldn't put it down. I cried, from the beautiful way he'd talk and ahhhh yes I definitely recommend it 100%!
B00CSR2J9I|5|I like the reactive levels. Please add water/mud,  and holes to jump/ fall in..  Great job so fare..  Keep it up.
B00BLCHZC2|3|Viewed this others. Was not really watching it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|When I pick up a Grisham novel, I know what to expect.  It will be an easy and possibly compulsive read.  I will learn something about how the legal system works. I will encounter a few down home characters whom I will like.  &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; did not disappoint.  Plus it is one of Grisham's shorter books so it is less of a guilty pleasure.
6305226296|5|Not one poorly done song on the entire video. The camera work was great. There is none of the usual &quot;fast&quot; quick-views of the performers, and the views of the audience are minimized and appropiate. There is no  useless chit-chat, nor silly childish laughter. Just straight forward  performing by three men in there 50s. I am an Elvis nut, never paying  attention to the BeeGees. Bought the tape for indoor exercising,and I love  it. Bought the CD,made a tape for ouside exercising. Its playing now as I  type this. Am considering getting a &quot;back-up&quot; video. Don't let  this one pass you by!!!
B00DY76Z32|3|The 3d bluray would not play, obviously there are 2 different disc versions. But Amazon was great and fast sending a replacement.<br />But the new one will not play either.I collect 3d so the only reason for the purchase. Consider this expensive for a non playable disc,<br />but will keep trying to figure out where the problem lies.Think it is the vc-1 format,but no response from Universal Studios. I'm sure Amazon would be happy to return it once again but I want the movie. Did watch the regular bluray and it was a funny movie don't see why it got such negative reviews. Very entertaining.
B000PC6A3E|4|If you have a HDTV with a HDMI cable to connect your Blu-Ray player you'll love this movie!
B007SOQBCM|2|Can't search or login. Very barebones.
B0000B1OFN|4|i like it
B005VMSATA|1|Poor plot, script, acting, and sadly special effects were just mediocre CGI that seemed more suited for a low budget PS3 game rather than a big budget movie. Wish I could get reimbursed for my wasted time first and money second.
B004DLPXAO|5|What's not to like? A real Kindle is better but this gives me the software on the phone I own
B006VRDZ44|5|Steve Buscemi is great in this mini series. Good story line, nice mix of gangsters, sex, and drama. Makes you want to see more.
B00S1VC3SM|3|A lot less heavy than I'm used to from Halestorm.  I've listened to it quite a bit hoping it'd grow on me, but it hasn't.  The songs they'd already released as singles are as good as it gets.  I'd say about half the album is good, the rest is just... not Halestorm.  Needs more of the ol' angry Lzzy.
B009VLX8FS|4|I don't love it as I did her previous albums, but it's still pretty good and nice to listen to.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Chromecast is perfect. I got rid of my cable when I got this, and I can't even tell. I actually got my friends to buy one too for their place.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Absolutely Devine reading. Everyone likes hero's, and there are many in this futuristic story about Mars and humans.<br />Science, chemistry, and magic mixed together with a spoon of Hope.
B00BQPEIT2|4|Kids were inspired to get this after the recent Oz movie. The graphics are pretty cool and it is fun.
B007V2UGPE|5|pretty cool game. kind of reminds me of the army of darkness game app. 5 stars for the addiction!!!! Thanks Glu.
B004LWZW4C|1|I would give it zero stars if I could. The Blu-Ray disc purchased will not play on my Samsung Blu-Ray player.  After reading many of the reviews I see that this is a common problem.  Very Frustrating!!!!!!
B003UAHIM0|5|I don't know if this is Mel's best work, but it's very funny and certainly a comedy classic.  It's hard to go wrong with a Mel Brooks movie.
B00F4386PY|5|Love this album, great tunes, powerful lyrics, excellent fret work, go Pearl Jam! If you have the opportunity to see the band in concert, go for it! Three of the best hours you will spend all year.
B00Y6QF0PE|2|Don't waste your money! Everything is the same in this book as Fifty Shades of Grey. However, it was nice to read about Christian Grey's backstory and what happened to his mother.
0061122416|5|This book was life changing to me and has helped guide me in my life journey.  If you are at a crossroads, or if you feel lost, I personally cannot recommend this book enough.  It is a great quick read and is just incredible
B000P12LWY|5|I sat in one day and watched all ten of these episodes.It is that involving!!    I like my history done with lots of panache,passion,seduction,betrayal and SHOWTIME had me glued to the tube with this \\"cliffhanging\\" 10 episode melodrama.    First off, it is BEAUTIFULLY produced,and there is a tremendous amount of \\"zing\\" in the production value alone.It is eye-catching,splashy with color,moves along nicely,plots are followed through,characters are REALLY developed,and the casting is brilliant.The music of court musician Thomas Tallis is wisely and expertly run throughout the entire series....very nicely done for someone who pays close attention to musical detail in production!    I must say, at first, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would not have been my first choice for a Henry V111, but after 10 minutes I got over that and was completely won over.The actors in THE TUDORS are passionate and I have got to say that Maria Doyle Kennedy who portrays Catherine of Aragon,Sam Neill as Cardinal Wolsey and Jeremy Northam as Thomas More are so in command of their characters that it is an absolute pleasure to watch them at their craft!!! This is a must see.Some of the best entertainment I have had in a long time!Come have a bodice-ripping good time!Looking forward to Season Two!
B007X15GRQ|3|Was an okay movie, nothing really spectacular in my eyes,  Rented it for a flight to kill time, had watched the ending on tv and wanted to watch it from the beginning.
B00JBGSHSQ|1|Very simply stated:  this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a shame that the top-notch actors they got would even consent to be a part of this debacle. Its only connection (that I can see) to the Bible is that the title character's name is Noah and he builds an ark. However, I don't remember anything about ROCK MONSTERS (seriously????) helping Noah and his family build and protect the ark. Maybe that was noted in the original Hebrew transcription and I missed it. ;) Uh huh. I knew within the first few minutes of this film that it was going to be bad but my husband and I stayed hoping it would get better. It only got more and more ridiculous. I wish I could have that two hours and twenty minutes back. Stay away; stay FAR away from this disaster.
B00HERGM86|1|I did not see this movie in theatres.  Was looking forward to buying the Blue-ray / DVD combo pack like I've bought most of my movies.  I refuse to buy any version of this movie until the Blue-ray / DVD combo comes out!  I have one Blue-ray player in my house, and it's not my main TV.  My PC's have DVD players in them.  I wear prescription glasses, so I don't like 3D movies to well.
B00DVKOYBM|5|I play daily and enjoy playing 8ball
B006ZE66P8|5|This is my 2 year-old's favorite book right now. That's right--he's 2 but he asks for the ghosts at least twice a day.  I'm not sure how much of the story he grasps, but the edited text makes it possible to read a classic like this to kids (we have a 5 year old too who loves the story as well) without boring them or losing them to the extended descriptions.  The illustrations are fantastic and it works fabulously as an ebook on both our iPad and Kindle Fire.  This is how adaptations are supposed to be. Well done!
B00003CWL6|2|'American Beauty' is just complete rubbish from beginning to end.  It pretends to be deep and profound, but it is actually shallow and manipulative.  It tires to find quick and easy solutions to people's problems and does not consider the long term conquences.  For example, the main character (Kevin Spacy) quits his professional job to work in a fast-food resturant.  At first he may enjoy it, but how long could he sustain that lifestyle.  How long could he be happy working minimum wage.  Also, his daughter is ready to run away with her drug-dealer boyfriend.  How long do you think such a relationship could last?  The movie does not consider these consequences.  Think about the characters' actions and apply them to real life and you will realize 'American Beauty' is full of crap.
B004DLPXAO|5|so very convient
B00HZ4ASEC|3|Before launching into my review, I must comment that it took quite a while for Amazon to provide a review forum for &#34;Last Vegas&#34; (hereafter &#34;Last V&#34;). So much time has passed that my memories of &#34;Last V&#34; have largely evaporated. It's really no wonder, because even though &#34;Last V&#34; features four Oscar-winning powerhouses (Michael Douglas as Billy, Robert De Niro as Paddy, Morgan Freeman as Archie, and Kevin Kline as Sam) having a wild, invigorating fling in one of the most outrageous cities in the world, it's only moderately enjoyable and surprisingly transient.<br /><br />&#34;The Golden Guys&#34; used to be close friends as pre-teens but, almost inevitably have grown apart and grown old. Each of the guys has his geriatric cross to bear, including languishing from children's overprotectiveness (Archie), lonely widowerhood (Paddy), or marital boredom and impotence (Sam). Only Billy seems to have really &#34;made it&#34; as some sort of  wheeler-dealer in some unspecified business. With Gordon Gekko hair, bleached choppers, and a complexion that makes George Hamilton look like an albino, formerly confirmed bachelor Billy plans to marry a pretty young lady half his age (whom he has proposed to during a funeral!). Billy starts calling and corralling his old pals to visit him in Vegas for his pull-out-all-the-stops bachelor party. Three of the guys, eager for a last fling, accept, but Paddy morosely refuses because of a smoldering grudge he holds against Billy for not attending his wife Sophie's funeral (Billy has his reasons). Still, the other three prevail upon Paddy to attend, but Paddy seems determined to cast a grumpy pall over all the fun.<br /><br />The rest of &#34;Last V&#34; is basically the guys doing the usual Vegas things (like blackjack and roulette) and some off-the-beaten track things (like judging bikini contests and having trysts). Meanwhile, both Billy and Paddy make an unexpected acquaintance of a charming and wise lounge singer (Mary Steenburgen as Diana) and separately court her. Besides the Billy/Paddy feud, this romance provides what little tension and drama &#34;Last V&#34; has, not only because Billy has to decide whether to continue the relationship with Diana and abandon his marriage plans or not, but also any decision he makes will hurt Paddy again.<br /><br />But of course in the final analysis &#34;Last V&#34;, despite the racy and decadent Vegas environment, is a comfortably innocuous movie that reassures us that &#34;The Golden Guys&#34; and Diana will somehow make the right, happy decisions. If you like the four &#34;Old Fart&#34; legends (and who doesn't) you will generally have a good, humor-filled time. If you like watching Las Vegas in the movies, ditto.e singer (Mary Steenburgen as Diana) and separately court her.

B0082RHRHC|5|Wonderful and suspenseful tale in the manner of what is lost will someday be found, with twists and turns unexpected and unpredictable, throughout.  The gothic elements only serve to pique interest and draw curiosity. The strong Christian theme is the guiding force that keeps true reader (and the main character) in a steady and assured state of awareness that all will eventually turn out well.

B002SF9YNO|4|Departures is a deeply moving, fictionalized version of the Japanese practice of casketing––or preparing the body of the 'departed' for cremation. The ritual of bathing, dressing, and honoring the departed is beautifully expressed, but the practice, not unexpectedly, won't survive modernization. As the global culture careens toward depersonalized materialism, this gem of a movie is a reminder of our terminal velocity and how the end game is/was culturally observed.
B00C0K6NUY|3|I bought this book without reading any reviews about it. we got into the story straight away. no messing about. the story is about a string of murdered priests and their connection to the murderers. the violence was very graphic, not leaving much to the imagination and not for the squeamish. There is an unusual twist and not your run of the mill abuse or revenge story. I had a bit of a problem with the investigators, I'm no Colombo but I thought they were a bit slow at putting the clues together. Also,how many times do we have to hear the name of the ringtone music?, once was enough to mention it. The secondary story was good also and didn't take away from the main one. Some may find it enjoyable, for me it was lacking in something.<br />If i ran out of books to read i probably wouldn't go back to this one in a hurry
B008Y768XO|2|Since it had Richard Gere my mom enjoyed it.
B000002KXV|5|A classic on every level.  Background vocals by New York's finest (mostly), brilliant.  So are arrangements.  The songs are quirky, original and juicy.  Back in the day, nobody did it better.
B007PT3QOQ|5|Liking it.....
B003102JDM|5|This is the Coens' masterpiece. Obtuse, perplexing, exceedingly clever and insightful. From the perfect synchrony between the physics concepts Gopnik teaches and the form and content of the film, to the great characters and perfect acting, A Serious Man doesn't miss a beat. It follows a physics professor whose life is falling to pieces. Ironically, his decline mirrors the very concepts he teaches to his students, but he can't quite grasp the application to the real world. He focuses on the math, but doesn't understand that the principles apply to life as well. As such, he refuses to SEE the reality of his situation, the causal factors that are leading to his crises, and that his lack of objectivity in this regard is the very thing that keeps things from getting better.<br /><br />At the end of the film there is a scene where Gopnik makes a choice and the consequences are immediate, as if the phone call he receives was a collapse of quantum probabilities determined by his own state as the quantum \\"observer\\" and the choice he just made. He constantly refuses gnosis (\\"I don't want Santana *Abraxas*!\\"), sees only the chaos, and is thus at its mercy. He is slave to the law of accident, it the terms of Mouravieff's [[ASIN:1872292100 Gnosis]]. The dynamic is explained in depth in Laura Knight-Jadczyk's second [[ASIN:1897244274 Wave book]]. When everything he thought was true turned out to be a lie, then what? He did nothing, and his life was the direct result. The film is really a meditation on the truth of the Rashi quote which adorns the opening titles: \\"Accept with simplicity everything that happens to you.\\"
0061950726|4|A quick, satisfying story. Stunning to learn how many children were shipped off to strangers. Love historical fiction!
B00A0A6F7C|5|One of her best albums to date---you felt as though you were at a Brodaway show when she sang with Michael Crawford!!!!
B00BBI9WD6|5|By far my favorite book of the honor harrington series. Great read for anyone who likes plots, fighting, and confrontations.
B0089EHWQE|5|A very beautiful and extremely thought provoking story.  Very few books move me to tears, but I was unable to stop.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B00HUNOS2G|5|Really good movie if u like the other 2. It follows the storyline ending with chronicles of Riddick. A lot of action and this movie mortalizes riddick a bit which I thought was nice.
B000002GXJ|4|Love them or hate them, the Eagles have had a huge impact on rock music. To paraphrase Ringo Starr, there are biggies and there are monsters. These guys were monsters in terms of sales, airplay and impact.<br /><br />Frequently  accused of being misogynistic (yep, some of their stuff could be seen that way)Henley & Frey are  still two of the most talented songwriting duos in music. Henley has one of  the most distinctive and rich voices in rock music while Frey is an  underrated singer who can easily hold his own with Henley.<br /><br />So how are the  performances? This album (it should be noted that this had a lot of overdubbing in the studio as the band members are perfectionists)is pretty good as far as live albums go. In many respects this is no different than listening to their studio albums although some of the energy of the raw performances leak through. While they  weren't noted for their spontanity in concert (their performances were  always rooted in recreating the sound of the albums, the band does bring a  harder edge to these performances. Joe Walsh acts as band clown on his  contributions and still manages to get in some mean guitar licks (with  Felder & Frey). Back up drummer Joe Vitale does a great job of helping  to fill out Henley's performance.<br /><br />The sound on this remastered edition is  exceptional. Producer Bill Szymczyk and remaster engineer Ted Jenson (although the previous edition sounded terrific as well)do an incredible job.  It would have been nice  to have bonus tracks (perhaps a couple of unreleased performances) and  better notes in the CD booklet (it would have been interesting to hear the  band's thoughts on this album twenty years later).<br /><br />Despite these minor  drawbacks, Szymczyk is to be commended for getting the ball rolling with  WEA to get these classic albums remastered. Regardless of the shortcomings  (and there aren't many) of this reissue, the songs are the most important  part. They still retain their vigor and power despite radio overexposure  after all these years.r and power despite radio overexposure  after all these years.
B00AREIAI8|5|love how real the horse looks and the beautiful graphics.  Does make me feel I really own a horse.  All the different tasks to care for the horse really keep a person busy throughout play time.  This is also enjoyable for children with guidance if the have difficulty reading.
0374533555|4|This book is a very interesting perspective on how our minds think and make decisions.  I catch myself, repeatedly, trying to slow myself down and let system 2 take over.<br /><br />This book started great, lots of useful examples and just a wonderful read.  I felt like about 3/4 through, the book bogs down and gets a bit overly technical and less practical.  This is fine, if you enjoy and follow the jargon, but for someone who only peripherally understands economics, it just gets a bit thick.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the examples and the challenges.  I feel like a better &#34;thinker&#34; by having read this.<br /><br />Worth it!
078322947X|1|If you look at all the other reviews, you'll rarely see anything less than five stars and the film deserves it.  &quot;SORCERER&quot; falls into that category sometimes referred to as an &quot;undiscovered gem&quot;.  My  reason for giving this DVD one star is technical.  Rather than creating a  new master from film elements, this DVD was created from an existing  full-screen SMPTE television broadcast master.  As a result, you miss all  of screen left, all of screen right, and a portion of both north and south.   &quot;SORCERER&quot; is one of my all-time favorite action films and I can  only hope that Friedkin and company release the original, theatrical  wide-screen version of this thriller.  I am so disappointed by the  technical failings of this DVD that I won't buy it unless/until it's  re-released in the theatrical format.
B003O86FMW|5|I really had no desire to read these books because I thought it sounded to cruel.  But I was on a cruise and ran out of books downloaded and only had these left.  What a surprise I had when I could NOT put them down.  They are well written.  Love them
B00881VLCE|5|Th I s is a great app , it is enjoyable and very relaxing-the music is wonderful.
B0000E2FLC|4|I gave this dvd 4 stars because i love ac/dc and i love this concert but epic really butchered the audio on this dvd.What i mean is that the audio from the original vhs version is not the same on some tracks.Basically what you see is not what you hear.They've put a different live version of the same song on some tracks and it's very noticeable in some spots.I'm kind of dissapointed with this almost great dvd.I don't know why they just didn't put the original audio of the concert on this dvd or maybe thats the reason why this dvd is so inexpensive but you wouldn't think just transferring the the origianl concert from vhs to dvd would be so hard.But on the up side the picture qaulity is great and Angus's playing is amazing, just wish i could say his playing was amazing at that concert 12 years ago but i geuss i'll have to go back the vhs version for that.<br />But check out ac/dc's other dvd's(that haven't been tampered with)\\"No Bull\\"(my fave) and \\"Stiff Upper Lip Live\\".
B001F12J0C|5|I thought I'd miss Jason Bourne, but we loved this version and really grew to like the main character.  Give it a try.  Here's hoping they have more !!!
0804137501|4|Well written, easy to read, and informative based on the authors' personal experience with their company.  It could just use a bit more 3rd-party research and numbers to back up their personal experience and be able to convince company executives that are still suffering from the old ways of thinking.

B00A9ET4MC|3|Very good insight into true emotions and cultural differences between several target populations.  I learned a lot about the fear and anxiety that  creates barriers between the races.  However, the main character becomes tedious with her self-centered pity party and the last part of the book is more introspective of her &#34;it's all about me&#34; final chapters. Too bad, it takes away from the first half.
B006UG90RM|5|I've heard all of the nonsense...specifically the \\"Dave's voice is shot\\" and \\"Recycled old tunes\\" thing over and over. First off, who ever said Dave could sing that great anyway? Bon Scott certainly couldn't, yet are you going to accuse him of sucking? John Lennon was much poorer a vocalist than McCartney or Harrison, but would you accuse him of sucking? Thought not. DLR brings attitude to the band, and better yet, does not \\"enable\\" Eddie, as Sammy did with musical direction. Dave, for what it's worth challenges Eddie for the spotlight and Eddie is all the better for it as evidenced on this CD. Now, for all you \\"long time fans\\" who are complaining about recycled tunes, you obviously do not play music or know any musicians. All bands hold snippets or ideas for songs that appear on other albums. Some entire songs are put to rest and later heard on box sets as \\"leftovers\\" from other sessions. The new, old VH songs probably have more to do with entering back into the public eye then they do anything else...familiar ground with your friends and fans. When you go to your 30th year HS reunion, do you dive right in talking about your kids soccer prowess, or do you talk about the old days first to get comfortable? Which of course leads us into the new VH CD, A Different Kind Of Truth. No need to go into what everyone has already covered here...It's a hard charging VH of old sounding record. Dave is back with his tongue in cheek commentary, and reworked take on cliches that evoke a snicker almost every time. Eddie sounds great and is doing what he does best...playing guitar. Alex is Alex, which is kick ass, and Wolfie does not miss a beat in replacing M.A. on bass. This CD reminds me more of the Women and Children First era than it does 1984. Anyhow, I have my favorites \\"Stay Frosty\\", \\"As Is\\" \\"Outta Space\\", but in reality I like every tune...well worth the price. Enjoy VH Fans! Love went walking out!

B004H4XLRE|5|We just got this and my 3 1/2 year old loves it. It is easy enough for him to operate and he is self-sufficient with it. Sometimes the door latches (2 per door, 4 total) are a bit hard for him to snap/unsnap but that's the only difficulty he has. The case seems sturdy and durable.<br /><br />There are 2 independent doors that swing down to become the exit ramps. Each has a spring loaded launcher that is cocked by pulling back the levers on the top of the case. The 2 gray buttons release the launchers, which propel the two sets of cars. So depending on how simultaneously the buttons are pressed one set inevitably launches first. You can use one side at a time as well, leaving the other side closed. Each lane/bay has the flag and number of the associated World Grand Prix car from the movie. As mentioned before, it does not work with cars that are too narrow - the wheels will not straddle the rectangular cutouts in the case and the cars will not launch properly. But for the 1:55 cars and standard Hot Wheels it works fine.<br /><br />The cars are pushed surprisingly far if on a smooth hard floor, with occasional spin outs. Some other reviewers has issues with the strength of the launchers, but our Cars go 15+ feet on tile. Cars with the synthetic rubber tires don't go as far as the ones with plastic tires.<br /><br />When closed up as a case the cars have room to rattle and turn, and do require repositioning when reopened.  But the latches are secure; if closed properly there is no way for cars to accidentally dump out.<br /><br />Overall a bit pricy for a case but it's much more than a case and well worth it for hours of unattended play. It's nice that you don't need any additional track or parts, just a smooth floor.
B00107FV4C|1|The dog is drawn in chalk<br />Built like a play set<br />Novel idea and good acting but the set is boring<br />Kidman gets raped on the apple cart that is &#34;moving&#34; but never leaves the set<br />Like a play in 2D format, it doesn't work<br />Waste of my time

And I must say this book is great for any Zelda fan (mostly from reading age and up of course. :) ) However!... as I said, while reading thru this book, there were some “errors” (possibly made by the Dark horse comics) and you’re a huge Z-fan you’ve prolly spotted them yourself, right? Buuuut...it’s nothing major! I would still say this is a great book and totally worth the money.
B005RUUUAI|5|I've never been much of a fan of zombie movies, but I've watched this show faithfully now. While there's certainly zombies (walkers) IN the show, that's not really what the show is ABOUT. This is an excellent character-driven ensemble show that'll knock your socks off. The story lines are interesting, the acting is fabulous and the action is intense. And keep that in mind if you have younger viewers at home...there's quite a bit of language and gore. If you're the type who enjoys the improbable, escapist type of show, then you're just gonna love this.<br />Oh...and I'm madly in love with Daryl Dixon and I dont care who knows it.

0060194995|4|I cannot deny that this novel pulled me into the story and maintained my interest.  The novel, chock full of human insight, doesn't opt for lies or platitudes.  But some schools teach this work as a profound statement on race in the USA.  While this may be true, the father's representation of a falsely accused black man despite threats from the white community, while admirable, isn't the key.  The key to understanding race in the USA lies in the fact that the author does not imagine in detail the lives of that black man and his family, the real tragedy, the real and profundly distrubing story that this book only mentions in passing.  The child narrator loves her father for his principles, but does not begin the fathom the situation of the black man's family.  By all means read this book, because it shows that even many decent and well meaning whites do not really understand the lives of American blacks.  And read it with a reading group and ponder whether this was the author's intention, or a limitation of her own understanding merely reflected in the book.

I dont care for most of the other games of this type. Personally, Im probably  one of a few, but Id like to pay $3 or $4 dollars for the game and get to play it all day or nite if I so desire.

0062082353|5|I am a married Mother of 1 Son and 2 Step-sons. I have never served in the military and honestly do not have any close ties to the Military, other than my Father who served in Korea and a cousin who was killed in Vietnam during the TET offensive. Though I would prefer the world was all Love and Light with no war ever; that is just not how it is. I have strong feelings about the war on both sides of the issue, I respect others thoughts and opinions as their own; but  no matter what I respect and support the courage, strength and patriotism of each and every member of our Military. I begin this review this way so that you can see I am a regular Jane.<br /><br />This book is written from Chris Kyle a Navy SEal's perspective. It is about his life growing up in Odessa Texas and follows him through his life as a Navy SEal, from BUDS training to the war in Iraq and life during and after from his POV. If you are looking for fluff, BS and watered down opinions this book is not for you. Chris tells it like he saw it good, bad or indifferent from his POV. During the reading of this book I cringed, I smiled, I chuckled, I felt uneasy and a bit queasy, I cried and felt sad, but I was completely engaged the entire time. At no point did I feel lost or feel like I did not understand something. (Keeping in mind I am just a regular Jane); Chris explains acronyms, procedures and operations as the story moves along and talks in plain \\"Texan\\". Peppered throughout the book, Taya, Chris' wife gives us a heartfelt view of life with Chris. My heart could only bleed for her, Thank you Taya and \\"God Bless\\" you for all that you sacrificed for your country. And Chris for the record though you say (several times I might add) throughout the book that you do not consider yourself a \\"Bad Ass\\".........Uh Chris, you were a FEARLESS BAD ASS, period end of subject.<br /><br />I am glad I decided to read this book; as honesty goes, Chris does not pull any punches and truly seems sincere in all his accounts of how things went down. I am not by nature one to believe everything I read and use quite of a bit of discernment as a rule, but at no point did I feel that anything but the truth as Chris saw it went from pen to paper.<br /><br />Thank you Chris and every single person at home or deployed who Stand and Protect our great country. And thank you to all the Mothers, Fathers, Sisters, Brothers, Wives and Children who sacrifice so those brave men and woman can do just that.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who wants to read a firsthand account of the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces endure on a daily basis.nt down.

B000005ITX|5|It is a real shame that Forever Changes never achieved the notoriety it deserves.  But most rock critics and fans who have heard this album deem it among the best ever recorded.  Forever Changes evokes the dark side of L.A.  psychedelia with drug-induced lyrics, haunting melodies, lush orchestration  (on some songs) and heavy use of acoustic guitars. But this album also  rocks hard in places.  The best song is &quot;The Red Telephone&quot;, the  lyrics of which suggest that Love's leader, Arthur Lee, either took too  many drugs or suffered some sort of emotional disturbance or was so  talented a lyricist that he was able to describe the mindset of such a  person.  The next song, &quot; ... between Clark and Hilldale,&quot; jumps  out at you with horns and punchy playing as Lee employs creative phrasing  in singing about life on the Sunset Strip, telling his buddies not to wait  for him if he does not return from a night on the town, where they  &quot;always play my songs.&quot;   Not much has been said about the  musicianship on this album, but the playing is real tight and some of the  best drumming in rock history is here.  <br />I reccommend this album to  anyone who likes the psychedelic-era Beatles (Sgt. Pepper, &quot;I am the  Walrus&quot;), the first Pink Floyd album, late-60's Beach Boys or the  first Doors album.  There is as much variety on this album than any Beatles  record.  I have owned this album for 16 years and I always hear something  new when I play it.

But i had to for this movie , I am highly disappointed<br />at first i really couldn't stand how bad of an influence Sutter was for Aimee , Typical Boy meets shy , small , hard working girl who hasn't been noticed and has a bright future and here comes this kid who befriends her and then i said ok he is trying to get her out of her shell and help her stand up for her self , but that was him taking out of what she knows and becoming like him , with the spike drinking becoming her first . I thought that in the end she would of changed him and not the other way around . After the Car accident i was in shock that she acted like everything was peachy and a bit clingy too . Of course her first everything was him and she felt she needed to compromise and be what he wanted .<br /><br />I get it Screwed up kids , absentee father . Working mother , he has potential at school but doesn't try . I so wanted to like this movie and I love Shailene Woodley, great actress . But the end of the movie left me wanting a bit more , i hate movies that have unfinished endings .

B0043IMW4W|5|I had the privelege of being at one of the two live performances at the House of Blues in Chicago in 2007 that produced this excellent collection of songs.  The concert was without question the best I've ever been to, over 3 hours of GREAT live blues and blues/rock.  The audience was electric.  We all knew that what we were witnessing was a once-in-a-lifetime show.  The performers seemed to know and appreciate that they were participating in something very special as well, and having a grand time doing it.  Hubert Sumlin, Willie Big Eyes Smith, Bryan Lee, Buddy Flett, and of course Kenny Wayne Shepherd with his longtime compadre Noah Hunt (oh yeah, and Double Trouble!!!) were there and in full force.  This album is an excellent representation of that performance, and I highly recommend it for any blues fan.  The breadth of styles and the generational span of the performers alone should give you some idea of what you are in for.  There are grinding, Chicago-style blues numbers, upbeat and flavorful Louisiana-style blues (Bryan Lee), and of course, KWS own unique brand of driving blues-rock that he has made all his own.  This recording is taken from the concert tour in support of Kenny's \\"10 Days Out: Blues From The Backroads\\".  Check out the description of that item and you'll get a feel for this item as well.  This is that, live, highly electrified, well-produced, and extremely satisfying.  \\"King Bee\\" is alone worth the price.  This is the first KWS live album to be released in his now 15+ year career, and the wait for this album has been worth it.  Bottom line:  Get it.

Nice pictures and the pull out map is a real bonus. It's also a nice size as some of these guides can be bulky or too big this is just the right size.

B008458O3S|4|Trainyard is definitely more Challenging and Enjoyable than it appears to be.  The Puzzles get more Complex and they have nice Tutorials to help you along.  Well designed and works Smoothly on Xoom Tablet.  Good Graphics Sounds and Function.  It could use some Sprucing up with Fancier Graphics and more Fun Sounds though.  Definitely addictive because of the nicely designed challenges but can be more Lively with more Vibrant Graphics, etc.  The only negatives so far are the Permissions, Advertising, Pop-ups for other apps, connections to Facebook, etc.  Overall, a SOLID  FUN FILLED APP.  I Recommend it to Physics/Puzzle game lovers.

B001HN6922|5|Great DVD
031606792X|2|While I have been a fan of the first three books in Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight Saga\\", I have been a different sort of fan than the books were geared towards. They are \\"young adult\\" novels aimed towards teenage girls. I am a college graduate with a Professional Writing degree. I was able to let my inner romantic teenager squeal delightedly over the first three books and simultaneously able to let my professional eye critique word choices and plot devices. I found \\"Twilight\\" to be well written and very entertaining. \\"New Moon\\" took something away from the series for me--not because of Edward leaving, but because of the sudden introduction of a vampire society and Bella being whisked away to Italy. \\"Twilight\\" had been so grounded in the \\"real world\\" that the scenes in Volterra made me uncomfortable. Eclipse regained some of the solidity of \\"Twilight\\", and I'd hoped for \\"Breaking Dawn\\" to continue the unique feeling of combining an average girl in the real world and vampires.    DETAILED SPOILERS BELOW      Unfortunately, I was entirely disappointed. There was almost nothing of the \\"real world\\" in this book. The beginning of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" reminded me of one of the deleted scenes from \\"Twilight\\" where Rosalie and Alice help Bella get ready for prom. Meyer had removed that scene because it catered too strongly to her girlish desire to describe outfits and decorations. In this book, it seems she emphatically gave in to that impulse. Everything seems like wish fulfillment.   What happened to Bella's distaste of attention and presents seen in the first three books?   Gone.   Instead, she is lavished with gifts and visitors and she never seems to mind. Sometimes Meyer references Bella's dislike of those things, but she never actually shows Bella having that reaction. Bella does little more than roll her eyes, and sometimes not even that, as she accepts the fancy wedding, the honeymoon on a private island, the new cottage with its extensive wardrobe, the jeweled necklace from Aro, and so much more. It's as if Bella's own personality becomes a shadow, mentioned but never seen. I noticed that after Bella's transformation into a vampire, Bella states at what times she would be blushing, if she could. I found this a strange add-on, though perhaps it would have been endearing if this hadn't been the way Bella's personality was displayed throughout the entire book.    I have not participated in the \\"Twilight Saga\\" fandom; I have not read the fanfiction. I do, however, remember a certain term from my younger years where I read a few stories in other fandoms. That term is \\"Mary-Sue.\\"   For those who don't know, a \\"Mary-Sue\\" is a perfect character who has everything, who looks perfect, who all the other characters fall over themselves to adore, and who is completely generic in their perfection. \\"Mary-Sue\\" stories are typically written by teenage girls as wish fulfillment, where they can design a character who has everything that they want. Typically, those stories also contain bad plot devices to put the main character in certain favorable situations and are lackluster towards any details that don't contribute to the adoration of the main character.   \\"Breaking Dawn\\" has two such characters. The first is our beloved Bella. She was so wonderfully imperfect in the first three books. So charming, so average. This is what made the readers care for her. Now, she is extraordinary--but not in the sense that every person is unique and extraordinary in their own way. There is a difference between an ordinary character who becomes extraordinary and a character who is suddenly changed into perfection and given everything they could want. Her personality and her endearing flaws are gone. Instead, she is suddenly faultless. The only flaw we are given is when Bella is looking at her new, vampire self in the mirror and sees that her upper lip is slightly bigger than her lower lip. Other than that, the only descriptions we have of the new Bella are detailinghow gorgeous she is or how strong she is.   Personally, I would have liked to see the world's first clumsy vampire. Who can relate to a perfect character the same way many girls could relate to average Bella? No one read \\"Twilight\\" and decided that they could identify with Edward the most. (In regard to Edward in \\"Breaking Dawn\\", I feel like he was barely there. Merely a bland background character being pulled along the plotlines after Bella.)     The second \\"Mary-Sue\\" is Renesmee, Bella and Edward's daughter. Given great beauty and fantastical powers from the start, Renesmee is less a character than a cliché. Where are her flaws? Where are the things that make this child a three-dimensional character? (Or that even make her a child rather than a tiny, beautiful person?) Everyone loves her instantly, she'll be fully-grown in about seven years, and she has met her soulmate immediately after birth. Who is she except a device to miraculously give Bella a perfect child, Jacob a perfect soulmate, and the Volturi a perfect reason to show up again. Meyer has said time and again that these are character-driven books, but her characters faded in favor of plot for \\"Breaking Dawn\\".    Despite the idea that Bella is the main character of this book, several other characters outshine her. Jacob Black, for instance. I was incredibly shocked when I reached the \\"Book Two\\" section, only to discover that we were suddenly reading from Jacob's perspective. After an initial unpleasant reaction, I began to grow used to Jacob's thoughts and soon found his point-of-view preferable to Bella's. Here's a real, three-dimensional character. He was working, he was suffering, and he was also extremely hilarious. (His chapter titles were the best.) His reactions were all very genuine and since these books are expressed to be character-driven books, several plot points made sense for Jacob Black that may not have made sense otherwise. For example, he becomes an alpha of his own pack. It made sense.It worked because the character made it work. We were reminded that this was possible because he was destined to be an alpha anyway. His imprinting on Renesmee worked, in my mind, because we saw Jacob actively searching for someone that he could imprint on. We saw him give up on finding his soulmate, before his soulmate found him. The reader was also aware that the imprinting process would try to select the mate who could produce the best offspring. And on top of that, there was already another case of a werewolf imprinting on a child. These were all things that the reader knew could happen.   This makes the reader's positive or negative opinion on Jacob's imprinting merely that--opinion. Did you like that this happened, or didn't you? The reader does not question the logic this point (though they may question the wisdom) as thoroughly as they would the actual existence of Renesmee.    Another character that had their day was Leah. I was extremely impressed by Leah in this book. She was a minor character, but she was incredibly strong and also very real. Seth was also a genuine character, though perhaps Leah had a little more depth. Her pain and her choices--to join Jacob's pack to avoid Sam and her decision to take human form and yell at Bella--made her understandable and even likeable.   Alice also continued to impress me. Her plan and her sudden disappearance did not seem contrived, though it could have in the face of the other contrived plot points. It made perfect sense for Alice to keep her gift away from Aro, and to leave clues for Bella, the only person Aro couldn't read.   Though Alice and Jasper's reappearance at the end, having somehow magically managed to find another vampire-human hybrid child, was too convenient. It's another example of something, the vampire-human hybrid in this instance, being expressed to be unique, impossible, or forbidden--and yet somehow suddenly exists in spades.    The rules of Meyer's universe are bent for this book. Vampirescannot have children. She had made this point clear. In this book, Edward, a vampire, has a child with Bella while she is still human. How? This doesn't fit with Meyer's own descriptions of a vampire's biology and therefore doesn't make sense.   Why doesn't the baby have a nine-month gestation period? Vampires don't age, so it doesn't make sense that being a half-vampire would make the child age FASTER.   Bella experiences none of the typical symptoms of being a newborn and it's suggested that this is because of her thorough preparation as well as her \\"power\\" of self-control. This could be believable, except that her power is later shown to be shielding, and the idea of self-control is lost. In the final scenes, Bella's suddenly able to master her shielding power right at the crucial moment, when she had not been able to extend it ten feet before.   I did appreciate it that she could later turn her power off, with great effort, letting Edward into her mind.    Of the entire series, I would say that \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the weakest link. Not to say that this book isn't enjoyable. Wish fulfillment is an entertaining concept and can be very satisfying for a reader. All the good characters get everything they want, and all the bad characters get everything they deserve. However, this doesn't jive with the world Meyer has created, nor does it create any sort of substance.   This book will certainly appeal to some teenage girls, but the older readers will be lost.
B005PK56TA|4|Im really surprised about this series. Although a bit graphic and gory it was so much better than I expected. I think it's cool  how each season has a different theme. I look forward to watching season 3!

B000000ORE|4|I was about 14 years old when I heard this album for the first time--and then as now, what blew me away about it was the conviction, and the songwriting.<br />Melody beats bombast every time--refer to Van Halen's early albums for this lesson--and song for song, \\"The Great Radio Controversy\\" is arguably Tesla's best album (others give that title to \\"Psychotic Supper\\").  \\"Hang Tough\\" (not to be confused with NKOTB), \\"Lady Luck\\", \\"Lazy Days, Crazy Nights\\", and \\"Makin Magic\\" all sway from verse/chorus/verse in various tempos but never vary in quality.<br />Besides, the harmony vocals are what set Tesla aside from their contemporaries--see them as a smart Poison with better chops and even better taste in influences.  Check out \\"Love Song\\" (one of the best power ballads of all time), and \\"Paradise\\" (note the G'n'R homage in the 2nd half of the song) for proof.<br />It's aged a little--I have to be honest--but it still holds up.

B000VH4OCW|5|I hadn't heard this entire album in decades,  but from the first note,  the first downbeat,  I was instantly transported back into time. Honestly,  every other artist would have to release at least five strong albums to get one quarter of the chart toppers from those ONE multi-album set. Bill board 'sold out'  giving an Icon award to Jennifer Lopez. There are certain songbooks that need to be the litmus test for 'Iconic'  standards,  and Stevie Wonder has one of the best.

0553108034|5|700 pages?  I don't believe it - it reads like a 200 page novel over before it seems you've begun.  This second book was WONDERFUL but too SHORT (if you can believe it).  Too many characters (too many INTERESTING  characters) that could all have books of their own.<br />Wow, what a book,  what a story, what wonderful characters.  Highly recommended - and there's  no doubt that Martin is here to stay if he continues to produce wonderful  books such as this!
1401235417|5|I had never read comics before getting this. I've always been interested and have a working knowledge of a fair amount of characters but I've never owned an actual comic until now. All i can say is that this book is amazing! I would highly recommend it to anyone who's even remotely interested in batman or comic books in general, I will be purchasing more new 52 books including the next batman volume when it becomes available. This book is a gem.<br />P.S. - the artwork is fantastic.
0345308239|5|It is with a sad twist of irony that I find myself reading this book while living in the United States at this moment in history.  All my life, I never would have thought to be witness to such an event as the current war on Iraq.  I hope this sentiment piques your curiosity to read this book and try to understand the mounting dread I find growing in the pit of my stomach as I compare the actions of our current government against those mentioned in this book.  Once again Santayana is proven correct:<br />&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;<br />I hope I am proven wrong by history.

B00005JKLZ|4|I went into this movie expecting absolutley nothing.  And, I came out a little surprised.  It was better than expected, but lacked in certain areas, mainly the story and characters.<br />Now, I'm sure most people were going to compare this to the original.  Of course it's not going to live up to the original, that's why it's the original!  And in defense of this particular remake, look at some of the other remakes these days - i.e. &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. <br />This time around, the story is greatly changed from the original, but the story isn't exactly what makes this movie &quot;good&quot;.  It's the special f/x.  The story, however, isn't tedious, and actually has some interesting thoughts.  I especially enjoyed the paradoxes involved, even if they weren't followed through after they were mentioned.  Guy Pearce does a marginal job, nowhere close to his role in &quot;Memento&quot;.  Samantha Mumba is okay, better than most pop stars in movies nowadays.  And Mr. Irons?  Even though his appearance is short, you hate him the entire time.  A good job for a villain.<br />As I said, the special f/x made this movie.  I was surprised that it was as different from the original as it was.  But it's not a bad thing.  The story is enjoyable, and I was pleased to see that Pearce's character didn't turn into a bonafide hero like Rod Taylor did in the original.  It could have been much better, but it could have been A WHOLE LOT WORSE.  I'd reccommend this to people who haven't seen the original, and people who are in the mood for some semi-mindless action.
B000SFJWLU|5|some true idiots on here, ashame. This band should be HUGE! They are far better than anything in the pop, r&b, country or especially the god awful rap scene. This was easily one of the top 5 albums of 2007 of any genre, each song kicks a$$ to hell with the people who are trashing it they know nothing. This is a 5 star album!
B00EL8I8IS|3|The movie highlights some of the crazy things that can happen in this world. Surely a one time watch movie
B001NLKXK2|5|I can relate to still Alice because my grandma who practically raised me started to get the symptoms of Alzheimer's five years ago and now at the age of 67 she's in her last weeks of life. Reading this book, even as a 17 year old, really opens my eyes to what this disease is really about. Thank you Lisa Genova for this work of art
B00H2EQFBK|5|This show is very well produced and doesn't try to gloss over the fact that Vikings were true barbarians with their own set of beliefs, values and rituals. That being said, it's also a well scripted character-driven drama. I'm looking forward to watching season 2.
B00I2TV3NO|5|I have read the books and I like the movie.
B00BHBBSZ2|1|I bought this to take notes in meeting on my Kindle Fire.  I have tried, really I have, to take notes.  The results have been totally unacceptable.  the program automatically resizes when you lift off the screen, and then when you start again, your notes do not follow those just made.  Further, my handrwriting is ot the greatest, and the program makes it appear worse than it is.  It seems to have a lot of tools to help, but nowhere can I find a manual that will help you out.<br /><br />A loser.
B007J4T2G8|4|This book is not at all what I though. Every Time i thought I knew what was gonna happen I was wrong. Which is very surprising because that is exactly what draws you into the characters and makes you not want to let go or stop reading.
B00005YTFG|3|Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor star in a visually stunning retelling of the classic Moulin Rouge tale. Ewan stars as an aspiring playwright that has come to Paris to make a name for himself when a dazzling actress/prostitute (Kidman) catches his eye when he happens to wander into Moulin Rouge, a berlesque house in 19th century France. They have an affair that is not meant to be. While the film is visually attractive and new age, the content is very thin. I know most fanatics of the film would argue that content is not the prime focus of film's intent and is simply a work of art in motion, I do appreciate that, don't get me wrong. I can justify my rating.  For its overall appeal it is lower on a five point scale-a two, but for its artistic value, a five.  Thus the average is three. It is an \\"artsy\\" film, sorry for the label, but there is no other way to describe it. I recomend it to true fans of the story or someone interested in seeing theaterlike productions put to film. Traditional movie viewers, beware.
B008NC1LJ6|2|When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match.  This didn't come close.  It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc.  But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much.  The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking.  Why did I waste the time.  A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc.  But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop.
B002M9WW30|1|Discs 1-3 work fine, but 4-6 will not even load.  Make sure to check your discs before the month return policy is over.
B00E00C70C|3|Good.

B00IR3W52S|5|My 16 year old daughter is the one who bought it and she loves it. If you are a teenager or are buying this for a teenager then you can't go wrong.
B0088O11NU|1|I got this game on my kindle fire but when I got to the forth level it restarted itselfe I was so mad<br />if I spelled  some words wrong I'm not a good speller
B00OKYQZDI|5|Fun game, Thanks
B00M4ADWTK|5|Purchased for less than at the local Walmart. Love it!
B00HIRTFZE|4|Let's start out by saying I really enjoyed this book, and am waiting very impatiently for the next. This story stars out with Sula a comyenti - a humanoid who has the ability to absorb the abilities of animals and use them for survival. Ar first, I was having a hard time grasping what was happening, it wasn't sure if she was a shape-shifter - which she's not, or if she was simply using abilities. As I continued to read, I became more clear and I was suddenly thrust into a very lovely story.<br />Beautiful descriptions transport you into the world of Sula and the planet Bhan. I was wary of her character, but after she meets Felix, I was hooked. The author is obviously very passionate about animal cruelty and her characters take the same stand.<br />We leave Sula and Felix and are introduced to other, very important characters. We follow them, get their backstories and I found I was having a hard time connecting with the character who drives the rest of the books story-line. I really wanted to like him, but he was callous and very closed minded. But, I loved the story he told of the sun and the moon, in order to help his travel companion.<br />From here we are thrown a few surprises and struggle right alongside Sula with emotions, confusion, and trust...<br />Overall, this book has a tightly woven plot, believable characters, and has set the scene of Bhan and the history of the comyenti in a style I really enjoy. I hate spoilers, so I'll stop there, but lets just say by the last page of the book, I was yelling, literally, I yelled...and can't wait to see what happens next.
B00FKF0F3C|5|Enjoyed this book just as much as the first 2.  So well written.......once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  Excellent@@@@@@@@@@@@
B009UX2YAC|5|It's awesome and really fun to play
B00DPM7TIG|4|One feels every step of the lives of these characters as the war evolves. The truly horrendous toll it took on so many.
B009AY04A8|3|Don't get me wrong it's a good game with a good story(very long). All Microsoft games seem to be plagued the same exact way. The story line is different but that is about it. They penalize you 20 seconds of your time to many wrong stops.  Biggest prob about that is the screen is so touch that it counts against even when u are just trying to adjust the screen. Their. Game is. Fun but I don't think out is fun enough to to play twice
B0000AQS0F|5|I discovered Firefly after watching Castle, and discovering Nathan Fillion was one of the lead actors. I am so glad I did. It may have only run for one season, but it has imprinted itself on the hearts of millions. Part western, part futuristic space exploration, and all about the good guys versus the bad guys, Firefly has something for everyone. There are 9 very diverse characters, all with very different backgrounds. What binds them together is the need for freedom, which they find on Serenity, the ship they live and travel in together. Whether you have seen Firefly a hundred times, or not at all, you should pick up this series. You won't be disappointed.
B0064MPXFA|5|The individual plots in this show are fascinating.  The skill with which they are combined results in a show you feel a part of i.e. a character in. (Personally I feel like an extra in the background.) Kudos to the writers.  It's a great show for women to watch and talk about.  It's fun to watch them argue about the characters they identify with.
B007FG9LIE|4|Very creative, kept my interest.
B00GN76K4Y|2|This game is good if you are competitive but if you are playing to have fun this game will tear you to bits they start you off with a terrible starter and everybody you play has a special move that wins the game it's a good game but sometimes this will make you want to tear your hair out.
B0067EKY7M|5|I don't know what other title might be used for this one.  It's not a sports show.  It's not a cooking show.  It is a love of fishing.  And a growing love affair that somehow doesn't give up.  And yes, Yemen is still Yemen. But I took a chance on this one and wasn't disappointed.
B00CUMM8LU|5|I've seen reviews saying these blu-rays are not Region Free/won't play on Region 1 players. All I can think of is that they were purchased through the Marketplace, because this box set does play on Region 1 (US) players (and it looks great).<br /><br />As for the show itself, it's one of the best supernatural dramas ever made, if not the best. The characters -- ghosts, vampires, and werewolves -- struggle through the day-to-day world, make mistakes, and face consequences as they try to find some normalcy and maybe even happiness within the walls of their haunted home. It's a smart and subversive take on the genre, and while it's often funny enough to classify it as comedy, don't expect a lighthearted, Munsters-esque romp. It's a dark show that faces the tragedies of the characters' conditions -- it's not about being special. There are almost no upsides to being supernatural, other than it led to them finding each other.<br /><br />There are two different main vamp/ghost/wolf families in the complete series, with Series 4 transitioning to a complete cast change for Series 5. Though, IMO, the show was never quite as edgy again after the climactic Series 3, the cast of characters in the last 2 series include some of the most memorable, with notable appearances by Mark Gatiss, Mark Williams, Julian Barratt, and Amanda Abbington (to name a few). Even if you're attached to the original quartet or you can't imagine a time before the trinity, the entire run is worth having. Lots of great extras, too!
B00280LYHS|5|I would recommend this book to anyone from the ages 8-12 I rated this book 5 stars because I never wanted to stop reading I could never put the book down!!!
B00GKKTZZU|5|Once again I am in awe of the way you can tell a story. From the beginning I have been a big fan. Thank you for being so wonderful.
6300213668|5|I have seen Grease and Grease 2 so many times, I know every last line in each movie.  I have always loved those 2 movies.  I have been watching them since I was in elementary school and I'm a grown woman now.  Those 2 movies are classics.
0375831002|5|I liked the author's choice of using the figure of death to narrate the child's story.<br />Books keeps readers interest of wanting to stay on the story. A book that I wanted read cover to cover because each<br />Person was muti-demential. In some ways those  beautiful moments between the children made the terror of living through the war a way to keep hope alive for a time when guns and bombs were the stuff of dreams.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves history told in a great novel.
B00CXX8KTA|5|Absolutely worth the purchase. Great songs vocals and guitar work. This album would make any Thin Lizzy fan happy purchase this album today you will not be disappointed
0545128285|4|This product was enjoyable, it arrived quickly and it was a quality purchase.  We are very satisfied with the book
B0045HCJSK|5|Nice DVD for the price
B0068853O6|5|Really enjoyed the show.  Shows the real life of soldiers, in or out of war.  Boredom, crappy leaders, subpar equipment, everything.  Look forward to more seasons.  I don't watch much tv but this is one of those shows I looked forward to watching.
B00HEQOAIQ|5|Great quality video. Fair price. Not a great story.
B005IQZB14|3|It was an interesting read of her experiences on the PCT.

B009CPJHY4|5|Loved it best I have seen .
B004JMZPJG|5|I bought this case for our Olympus stylus sp-100 and it is just what we were looking for. The case is well built and had room for extra batteries and the charger. Be sure to measure your camera and compare to the dimensions listed for the case to make sure it will fit. Nice case for a good price.
B0094LZY2A|4|Classic.
B00006FM77|3|If you like every aspect of Chicago, and cant get enough of every detail about them, then this CD is for you.  It presents a multi day live show featuring Chicago and only Chicago-noone else shares any concert time with them.  The result?  An overlong CD with overlong performances that go on and on, seemingly forever. A much better live showing of Chicago is on U-Tube, dating from earlier days for the group. The filming is not the best but the presentation far outweighs what's contained on this group of CD's. Again, if you are consumed by Chicago, buy the CD. If not, skip it and look up the live concert on U-Tube.
0060278234|5|At first I was hesitant to read Sabriel's sequel, afraid that, like so many sequels, it wouldn't live up to its extrodinary predecessor.  However, I was very much mistaken indeed.  This book was, although certainly filled to the brim with excitment, more about about characters than action.  And they are delightfully well-constructed, well-developed characters indeed.  My one complaint is the sudden ending.  As I turned the last page and read the heading &quot;Epilogue&quot; on the top of the next, I literally dropped the book in surprise.  Nothing major had happened yet!  This book is clearly a delightful preperatation for what bodes to be an incredable conclusion.  I might recommend waiting until Abhorsen is published before reading Lirael, because the suspense is intolerable!
0385523912|2|Based on reviews and the proclamations of award-winning greatness I was expecting much more than a rather mediocre book.  It seemed to me to be a &#34;stream-of-memory&#34; first draft, begging to be put into some sort of coherent order.  Was there no available editor?<br />There were quite a few instances where Ms. Demick simply repeated phrases...within a single paragraph!  Endless disjointed, meandering anecdotes related in fifth grade English.<br />I realize that these are real stories of actual people, places and events but the telling is as dreary as the DPRK itself.
B003Y059EK|4|While it's no match for &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;, this film is a pretty good extension of the story. It is based on another L. Frank Baum book, &#34;Ozma of Oz&#34;. Six months after returning from her first journey to Oz, Dorothy is languishing in the unfinished house that a beleaguered Uncle Henry is supposed to be building. Auntie Em thinks shock treatments will help shake Dorothy out of her doldrums. The Kansas scenes are again a stark contrast to the bright world of Oz. There are more villains in Kansas this time and they match some of the characters in the land of Oz.<br />The three characters from &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;, Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion have small roles, but the main characters besides Dorothy are Jack Pumpkinhead, Tic Toc, and Gump. The villain is The Gnome King and he is a dark, scary adversary. He is assisted by Momby, a witch with 31 heads to choose from, and The Wheelers, a very scary gang of squeaky-wheeled pseudo-humans.<br />Fairuza Balk made her film debut as a much sadder version of Dorothy. She did a good job considering her age and the impossibility of filling Judy Garland's ruby slippers.<br />The story has some similar plot twists to the original but throws in a few surprises and manages to keep the viewer intrigued. I gave it four stars because I liked the characters, especially the villains.
B00C7DGRL4|1|Seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was idiotic, the weapons were idiotic and I seriously couldn't hardly sit through this movie. I found myself fast forwarding through the stupidity of this movie and when I was done watching it, I took the dvd and threw it in the trash.
B000FA5STS|5|Baldacci never fails to deliver a good read.  Total Control takes you through the twists and turns of a complex investigation of an airplane crash that has you assuming one cause that becomes much more complex as the story unfolds. As always Baldacci makes you want to reach out and help his characters.
0062127241|3|Or who's the fool? This guy or the people that bought the mostly mediocre music. Nicely edited though.<br />Now I feel like my teen years were teenage waste land listing to this guy's stuff inspired by a bottle of Remy.
B00BJS7104|5|I don't ususlly go for Tarantino movies, but my son made me watch it and I was surprised.  Loved it!
B009JZSC9S|4|I really enjoy watching the good wife on amazon prime.  It is one of the show that we watch almost every night.  I am not looking forward to when we catch up to the current season. The shows are interesting and humorous.
B00006JQU1|5|Whatever melancholy soulfulness you've heard in previous performances of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, you won't hear in the recording by Rachel Podger. This Bach is the music of a youthful athlete, sounding as optimistic as Ms. Podger looks on the cover of the CD. There's no question that Rachel Podger has vigorous mastery of her fiddle, and that this performance is uniformly enjoyable. It would only dog-in-the-manger to wish that her \\"affective\\" range were a little wider, somewhere closer to cellist Anner Bylsma, for instance, than to Yo-yo Ma. But then perhaps I'd have to worry about over-interpretation.<br />I've been tacitly rebuked recently for not calling listeners' attention to Rachel Podger. One could do worse than to trust her \\"complete\\" technique to be worth hearing on any of her recordings of Bach or Mozart.
B00VRYCGLO|5|this is a good game .  I highly recommend it for all ages.<br />It has  good graphics. and loads fast.  fast paced and very good color.
B005XQLBU4|5|Pretty addicting starts pretty easy gets challenging. Just wish there were more upgrades or different levels. Best game I've come across on the kindle
B000AAF1U4|5|I love this movie. One of my favorites from Disney. Super entertaining with the optimum balance of funny and cleverness. Great for all ages.
1250027624|5|Bought this for a colleague of mine who just loves this show.  Hoping she will be surprised and happy with it.<br />The book is beautiful and was in great shape. Just like new and the price was right.
B0002YLC24|5|This is such a beautiful movie.  You could not imagine that two people talking could be so moving and beautiful.  And of course there is Paris, the City of Love.
B009IEXKXI|5|This is a great story about an astronaut who is stuck on mars after a mission went awry.  GREAT story, and the main character is hilarious.  Definitely a strong \\"BUY\\" recommendation at twice the price.
0374105235|4|One of the greatest qualities of African culture is the respect given to the elders and the sense of communal responsibility.  The reason being that they have life experiences that will help guide the younger ones through their journey through life.      In A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier a culture that Ishmael was born into and was being educated within the mores of his society all of a sudden is turned upside down.  Survival became the word of the day and in order to survive everyone had to do anything and everything within his/her power to ensure his/her self preservation. The community had lost its bearings and its members. Consequently, fear and terror reign supreme, most of the mores of the traditional society is thrown out the window. That leads one to ask, what will happen to all the oral tradition that has  died with the older ones as the younger ones kill them off?      All through the 228 pages of the book, the reader begins to question the rationale of war and the incessant need of adults to recruit children into wars that they (adults) started anyway. The author adeptly demonstrates how childhood and its memories is robbed as a result of the war and the scars that victims carry for life.     This book  should be one of the many mandatory readings in African Military Academies, secondary schools, colleges and universities.  Hopefully, future African leaders can draw lessons from the narrative and strive for peace and prosperity within their communities.
B002UXRGLG|5|Wonderful cinematography!  While this is also put on by the BBC like planet Earth the content is not a duplicate.  I have really enjoyed watching this!  If you like the Planet Earth series you will also enjoy this.

Also,I was unclear if all the US episodes would be in this British edition.  But they were and I loved it!
B003M70O5O|4|Pretty good story line. Interesting characters.  you have to stretch the imagination to follow how they keep getting out of trouble but all in all worth watching
B0031RAOVY|4|Movie was recommended by a friend. Ordered from amazon and received promptly. Really enjoyed the movie and would recommend for young and old.

B003ODIZL6|5|It is so helpful for school and for home work it is so awesome i can us it every day
B004J4WKUQ|4|Rating: 4 stars (above average)<br /><br />It was hard to be objective about this book, because I loved it for its content, reflecting my own experiences with gaming and early computers, movies, music of the era. \\"If I was feeling depressed or frustrated about my lot in life, all I had to do was tap the Player One button, and my worries would instantly slip away....\\" It's called Flow experience and, like the main character, I would play adventure and puzzle games all night and then try to go to work during the day (as an addict, I eventually had to go cold turkey).<br /><br />But reviews have to adddress things like plot, setting, characters, dialog. Setting? Great. Very believable, both the real world and the OASIS universe. Characters? The book has the standard range of sexes, ethnicities, life styles. Someone for every reader to identify with. Appealing though; I just had to root for the white hats. Plot? Every geek's dream--play the game and find the goal. Dialog was stereotypically adolescent. Note to author: not all of us geeks talk like prepubescent social misfits.<br /><br />The main character's thoughts about being human (when he realizes he is an anti-social hermit trapped in a player rig) and about the existence of God are set out early on, and the author does not belabor his viewpoints. Such restraint is admirable; his philosophy adds to the psychological setting of the story but does not require the reader to agree with him.<br /><br />Plot drags at times, gets too descriptive (but how else to convey a visual/tactile experience?).<br /><br />If you remember the TRS-80, audiocassette recorders, dot-matrix printers, and 300 baud modems, instantly you'll have a feeling of familiarity. Do you still have the telephone numbers for dial-up bulletin boards?<br /><br />Despite its flaws (Deus Ex Machina too often), this book is interesting and fun. Hacker skillz rock!

B00FAPF5U0|4|I love playing this game to relax and clear my head after a long day. If I had 1 wish it would be to play off line when not in a WiFi hot spot so I do not have to use my data allowance.
B0031KE9C6|5|I own all the seasons but am so excited its available on Prime. One of the first shows to have a strong female character and she doesn't apologize for it. Veronica Mars is smart, witty, brave and a big marshmallow! Season 1 follows her as she embraces a new life and deals with the murder of her best friend, Lily. Watch it, you won't be sorry.
B0094LZY2A|5|Awesome film..
B00BSBR9N6|3|This novel has an interesting concept but Don's voice sounds forced at times. He is a caricature of a nerd and it seemed a bit over the top at times. The plot was fine but not anything new. It is a bit of a mystery so if that's what you're in the mood for, it would be quite nice.
B007C3TVEY|5|Does justice to the novel . Would think Lionel Shriver(author) was pleased.Wonderful acting, beautiful cinematography . Don't know why this did not go mainstream.
B00D7Z4GQY|1|The writing style is a formula.  I felt it was a fluff chick book.
B008476HBM|5|This book is so beautifully written and captivating.  An amazing love story. The characters are well developed and surprise you and evolve.  I love the dictionary built into the book I used it quite a few time to help better understand the dialogue
B00003CY0V|5|This movie has plenty of excitement and John Travolta and Halle Berry were the best bad crew I have seen in a while.  I truly enjoyed the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3|As expected....good quality.
B004A8ZWW4|5|Well written and great acting, Hugh Jackman was excellent in his acting and the over all theme of the movie was great.
B00011F5DK|4|I bought this item as a gift for a 5 yr old boy and he likes it a lot.  He enjoys playing by the rules but also enjoys \\"freeplaying\\" and making patterns with the blocks.  The pieces feel good to the hand.  I recommend it.
B00GSZEBE2|3|I haven't had the not-loading problem that others report but I did get to the point where the game no longer earns money while you're away. I was totally addicted to this simplistic, silly game, and I was enjoying it thoroughly but earning money while you're not actively on the game is pretty important to progress in the game. I, like a lot of other reviewers, came here to the store in the hopes that I'd find an update or some info on fixing this glitch so I can get back to playing. Until then, there's really no point in downloading (for new players) or continuing (for current players). Hope this gets fixed soon!
0763668966|5|This book is beautiful. A treasure.
B0050KEVO6|5|This game is really outstanding.  Very original concept and very tricky.  This has become my default game to play at the mall while I wait for my wife.  Give ot a shot.
6305014140|3|After reading all the great reviews for NS, I was itching to watch this anime.  After seeing it I'd have to say it's pretty average in my opinion.  The animation is dated and flat compared to today's anime.  I preferred to watch it with English subtitles cuz the voice-overs were extremely cheesey. The action was pretty nice, I just wished the fight scenes were longer.  I noticed that a lot of previous reviewers mention the nudity and sexual content but it's really not that bad considering it's a cartoon.  Overall, I can't recommend purchasing this movie but it's worth a rent if you like martial arts anime.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|This is not only a cute game for the grands to play, it's a totally addicting game for this Grammy to play as well!  Fun, fun, fun!
B00KF1CWF0|5|Nice Item! Thank you very much!!
B00000JBFW|5|Missing this cd out of my collection.
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game is very entertaining!! I love playing every day. It's challenging and fun. You can't go without it. Get it today.
B00NQWTGZE|5|Floyd is the best.
B000VM9Z8K|4|I LOVEDDDDDDDDDDDDD THIS BOOK! Sophie Kinsella never lets me down. It takes a lot to make me laugh and this book will have you laughing ALOUD! Great, smart and witty humor and you fall in love with Lexi right from the beginning. Such a great read!
B005MYEQ4U|5|ONE OF THE FEW RECENT WOODY ALLEN MOVIES I REALLY ENJOYED. SAW IT FIVE TIMES AT THE THEATER. HEAVEN KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES I'LL WATCH IT NOW THAT I'VE BOUGHT IT -- WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT.
B000002GC2|4|OK album, delivered on time.
B00A8ECU24|3|fun but annoying they make you pay big money for gems. This is a fun game even for adults but it's pretty annoying that a lot of things cost gems and gems cost real money.
B00MO21WAY|1|Was very clear and am happy with selection.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This game is fun for anyone 10 and older some of them are actually challenging to figure out but all together its a good game
B00KIZ9F8K|5|My husband and I have been listening to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for years (the only group we both can agree on), and Hypnotic Eye doesn't disappoint. One of the best Petty albums ever.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Great!!!!!!<br />Must admit it sometimes can be a bit confusing when you have to find collection items which you already have . Saying that, I am totally addicted and keep having to go back to find a few more hidden objects
B00000099Y|5|so, i bought this back in 1996 when it was released and i expected it to be more commercial than the already very good &quot;undertow&quot;. hell was i wrong. this album is just perfect. it's hard to describe what i feel when i listen to &quot;aenima&quot;. the music is dark, deep and nightmarish still it helps to produce a good mood when i listen to it. it is very complex and well written. it has the coolest lyrics around... short this album is perfect. period.
B00IJJUIMY|1|Terrible writing and plot.
B002TLSSXO|4|I like it, practicle and beautiful!
B00GZ0ML4C|2|This video is nothing like the comic it is based on outside from the fact Batman has a son with Talia. The best part of the package is the extra-feature on the &#34;Batman and Son&#34; comic storyline. The extra gives a good look at what this movie could have been and provides a nice history of Damian Wayne beyond his introduction. The DC extra-features are still top notch even if the main movies seem to be on the decline.<br /><br />This is as bad as &#34;Justice League: War.&#34; Actually it is worse as &#34;War&#34; was a bad animated movie based on a bad comic and this is a bad animated movie based on an excellent comic making it more disappointing.<br /><br />Also probably the worst representation of Deathstroke in any show (and that's saying something... Smallville... Arrow). Instead of a master strategist and hand-to-hand combatant, this Deathstroke poses no greater threat to our heroes than &#34;random thug #4.&#34;<br /><br />Deathstroke is just worthless in this. Then again maybe that fits in with the new DC of Superman being a jerk, Wonder Woman being a Thor-like clown, and Billy Batson being a juvenile delinquent (how can he introduce himself as &#34;Shazam&#34; anyway without turning back into Billy?).
B000NYT1M6|5|Blue is our grandson's favorite color and to have different type of dump truck in blue is well over the top of 10+.  We have a &#34;construction site&#34; for our grandson at our home and one at his own home in which he has his construction equipment all in place.  Next, an earth mover and another excavator.
B002IYEQR4|5|I think this is as great an adaptation of the comic book series that could ever be made.<br />I won't review the film, you KNOW the film if you're perusing this page already. If you love 'V for Vendetta' and 'From Hell' well... I'm pretty sure you have an open mind and love challenging films - this is one of those type of films - challenging in many ways, theory, philosophy, people, abstracts, pop culture, power madism, grunge, holistic unholyisms etc.<br /><br />Alas, I WILL comment on the GOUGHING GREEDINESS currently on display here by  GottaSeeOdyssey trying to ripoff people at $149+!! Oh yeah... If you're an Amazon Prime member you get Free Shipping - WHAT A DEAL eh?<br /><br />My advice is to not encourage these price gouging sludgers and let them eat their stock UNSOLD.
B00E38KGF4|5|Bitdefender Antivirus Free is a good antivirus program.<br />works well for what it is, the payed version is better, but for free it cant be beat.
B00005R2M3|5|Now, more than ever I am happy of being colombian,  and the main reason is the pride of having such a great colombian singer-songwriter: Shakira. With her most recent album &quot;Laundry Service&quot;, She is demostrating all her potential: Great lyrics, excellent voice,  very good english. <BR>I could swear: This is gonna bring her great achievements.
1250038820|5|Living in Brazil but feelling to be with the crazy, different, lovely people of the City is what the HONY made to me. Since Facebook posts and now with the book I may stay in love and 'living' there.
B003F3FJQO|5|A great page turner to keep you going and I can't wait to dig into the third book of the series.
B001NZXI5U|5|Had to get it.  Lost the original album along with hundreds of others.
B000003B6J|5|N.W.A. Straight Outta Compton ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Your about to witness the strength of street knowledge,\\" and with that I was sold. N.W.A.'s major label debut Straight Outta Compton was and still is one of the most important albums in the history of rap. Not to mention that is one of the genres five greatest albums of all time and my personal favorite next to Commons Be. But I am going to dare to take this to another level, Straight Outta Compton is one of the greatest Punk albums of all time. It really personifies the punk aesthetic and what it means to be oppressed. \\"sighh\\" oh when hip-hop was worth something....<br /><br />The production and sampling for this record is a large part of what makes it a classic and separates it from the majority of the hip-hop from that time so a large amount respect and accolades go to Eazy-E for his master full production.<br /><br />As for the music itself at times it's more comicals than gangsta. the classic 'F*** Tha Police,'  'If It Ain't Ruff' and the E penned '8 Ball' all make the serious subject matter seem light hearted which is a good thing because it is almost as Ice Cube, Dre and the rest of the crew were finding something good in the evil of the time. Even though the funny can be heard the material is no less serious. Straight Outta Compton being basically a concept album about what life is like for inner city central L.A. black males at the time. It's a lyrical powerhouse with stolen beats and old Isley Brother grooves. It's one of the most honestly genuine albums ever as well as one of the most important of the last twenty years.<br /><br />Straight Outta Compton is classic.
B008UCJ7KO|4|definitely need to have read the book before this to make sense of parts of it, however i enjoyed the book very much! twists and turns that kept me reading.
B00CQHZ2LW|5|Nice playset. Each character is labelled in the box so I know who my nieces were referring to.
B007MC8YLQ|5|It is simple and efficient. Very easy to use.  I love it.  I'll try the other games by Brainium soon.
B00ICSVLPA|5|Beautifully filmed and the acting was superb. I like a movie that is well done but has a great story as well. Thoroughly enjoyed this and highly recommend this.
B001HN697M|5|Simply the best Underworld movie.<br /><br />Very well done and polished all around... Excellent acting and production value!<br /><br />5 big stars!!
B008JGSM6G|5|Looking for a game that wasn't too complex yet still made me think. Tried this because it got decent reviews. I'll have to say it is a good puzzle game.
0345529057|3|The price is very decent, you can get each book new for 5 bucks.  The story is overall good, many parts of the book keep you entertained.  I only have one book left to finish the so far series and my complain for now is that although overall interesting, the author tends to be very superfluous.  A couple of these books could have been 500-600 pages instead of 1,000.  Author is redundant, some chapters are dull and should have not been included and it seems like if the story had been written knowing that in the future there could be a TV show where they could have it for many seasons and make money...it is just too long and not that great when compared to other classical novels such as those of J.R.R. Tolkien.
B00CO5AQ12|5|More fun than a barrel of monkeys.
B007Y36K46|5|This a great movie.  I have watched it several times and each time I have found it to be equally enjoyable.  I do not understand why this movie failed at the box office.
193700788X|1|I was not expecting much from this book as the last few were almost unreadable. This series lost it's luster about 3 books back. I also did not expect Sookie to end up with whom I wanted. However, CH could have done a much better job giving Sookie's romantic fanbases some closure. You cannot please everyone, but at least make the ending not seem as if it came out of nowhere. Or better yet as if it was written by someone else with no real interest or feel for the characters.<br />Everything seemed to be rushed, with as little thought or imagination  put into it as possible. I think that CH lost interest in the series a long time ago but was continuing with it only for the sake of squeezing as much money out of the franchise as possible. Sadly, for me, this has hurt her reputation as a writer. One must know when to call it quits and that was about three books ago.
B003JTHXOK|5|The whole story was very well done & it was so great a today kind of story I loved how they put the deceased wife as the best friend untilthe end !! the violent Part could of been delented ! But hey there has to be gun playin the good movies lol  !
B007J4T2G8|1|What a dissappointment this book is.  To each their own but the fact that this book is all the rage is beyond me.  It reads like the thoughts of an 8th grader.  I'm thinking I should write a book now.  Way to make a dollar.  I could probably make a ton of cash by the looks of this.  Waste of time.
B004W2UBYW|4|I have read quite a bit about Steve Jobs in the last 15 years. Even know Jerry Mannock personally. Walter Isaacson's work certainly adds to the big picture and seems to be entertaining as well.<br />I recommend this book to anyone with a healthy curiosity about Mr. Jobs.
B006GLLXXK|5|Good show.
B003O86MY8|5|Very good violinist and a must have CD for all violin players and fans. His music is very impressive and my daughter listens to David all the time.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I fell in love when they did. This painful yet beautiful walk  through life and its many challenges made me laugh and cry at the same time. The banter was endearing.  Here's one of my favorite  \\"encouragements\\"<br />Life is a Journey. Love is what makes that journey worthwhile.
B003439LIC|5|This movie conveys a sad and obvious truth. Worth a watch..even if you are not a Michael Moore fan. Despite his notoriety I like that Moore allows many ignored people to voice their stories. The discussion on the \\"dead peasant\\" practices that companies like Walmart use were a real eye opener and something that needs to be stopped.
B007ZGO7EM|5|This is the best calculator available for Kindle Fire.
B001NLL0RW|5|This was a terrific book from beginning to end. I could hardly put it down only to pick it up again as soon as I could!
B0089LOG02|5|I had vaguely heard of the orphan trains,  but was unaware of the magnitude of what occurred.  Even though I am not an orphan, I could relate to some of the difficult experiences that Vivian faced. The book was well written and hard to put down.  Thanks so much for a story worth telling.
B00005JNBQ|2|This is my first review here and I decide to write it on this over hyped movie. I thought the plot was non-existant and very lacking in actual comedic substance. The characters were unique and pretty well made up, however they did nothing. I am a big comedy freak, but there is tooooooo much hype on this movie. I would watch a sequel to this just to see what they do to the characters, but this one was a disapointment.
B00FJ2YTLK|5|I love this series.  I will be reading it again and again.  I thought at first it would be a little too cheesy since it is marketed towards teens and I am in my thirty's but I was really surprised by the characters, their zest for life and how standing up for yourself and everyone else who does not have a voice can free you.
B0093BUWGE|5|Coming from an older woman, this guy has talent...absolutely impressed with his voice, no matter the music style/genre...sometimes you need to look past that and recognize talent.. this man has it!
086547897X|5|If you have any interest in animation, get this book right now! It's that good. Hundreds of pages of Fundamentals, tips and tricks for any animation style you can think of. The perfect book for an animation students.
B00CWY76CC|5|enjoyable app. I find myself looking forward to seeing what is next on each level. this game definitely makes me think outside of the box.
B0000257O9|5|I've had The Buggles \\"The Age Of Plastic\\" for two years now, and have listened to it extensively in that time. I purchased the newly re-released follow-up CD \\"Adventures In Modern Recording\\" just recently. In my opinion this first release is superior to \\"Adventures.\\"   There is just something about this futuristic world that \\"The Age Of Plastic\\" resides in that just makes me happy and makes me want to visit there from time to time, as I do when I listen to it. I think that's what makes it so good, this CD transports you away from your silly worries and stresses that get in the way of living your life. From start to finish, TAOP is my little escape. I have it playing right this very moment as I write this. I have it on repeat. I don't think I'll be coming home anytime soon. Perhaps \\"Adventures In Modern Recording\\" will have the same effect on me given some time. Gotta go...I'm boarding the Monorail with Johnny now.
B00005N5S5|5|I bought this DVD because of the special features. It was everything I wish for. The cut scenes are great, the menus are great, the entire movie is great. It sounds wonderful as well. If you are in to Terminator, just buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B00005T7I1|3|The entire concept of keeping the comic book flavor, characters and look through the entire movie definitely worked.  Dick Tracy is fun to check your brain at the door and enjoy a movie that does good justice to the comic strip that I read for years.  I would have rated it higher but it was the Madonna character (Breathless) that brought it down.  There was simply too much of her.  The songs, the dancing in the club, and &#34;More&#34; got so tiring that I felt it slowed down many fast paced scenes.  I don't think anyone but Warren Beatty could have played and looked the part of Tracy, the Kid was a show stealer, and the makeup on the bad guys was superb.  I don't understand why Madonna thinks that everyone wants to see her with less and less clothing, but her scenes and character actually sickened me.  Having met and worked with a lot of the cast at the Disney debut, Dick Tracy has a personal attachment for me, and know that just about any age would enjoy this movie.
044024630X|5|[[ASIN:1410430103 Killing Floor (Jack Reacher)]]<br /><br />I still think a 5 foot 5 inch actor (Tom Cruise) shouldn't play a character who's 6 foot 4 (Jack Reacher).
B0054JZC6E|4|this is a fun game. very easy to spend many hours trying to get enough points to open more games.
0451196716|5|I think this a well written detailed book. It had a great ending. I'd reccomend this book to almost anyone who loves horror stories.
B004AP9W46|4|Love the Vampire Chronicles - catching up on them after being unable to read for a few years'.  Loved the book, but found Memnock a little long winded.  Thought was so much, was rather confusing.  Loved the plot and story of Lestat  going through Heaven and Hell. It amazes me what Anne Rice comes up with for Lestat to go through.  Amazing!!!!!
0345442970|4|In the events leading to Episode I, political ploys were unhatched that would allow the rise of Senator Palpatine.  \\"Cloak of Deception\\" is an appropriate title for a novel which explains the maneuverings of Palpatine before becoming chancellor.  As one might expect of a book based in political posturing, there is less action then one might expect in the Star Wars series.  Still, the book does not disappoint.    In order for the Trade Federation to serve as a powerful pawn to the Emperor, obstacles must be removed from their ascent to greater power.  Among these obstacles is the Nebula Front.  While raising ethical questions in the eyes of some, Sumpreme Chancellor Valorum seeks to allow the trade Federation to amass a droid army for protection from terrorist groups such as the Nebula Front.  In a compromise, the Trade Federation must make an unpopular concession which reflect poorly on Valorum.  Considering the original source of the idea, the motive is not surprising.       As this occurs, an assassination plot is unhatched against Valorum as Captain Cohl's creates mayhem in the Outer Rim.  Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, chase the \\"terrorists\\" only to find the motives of the group to be confused.  A mysterious figure behind the terrorists knows the true motives for which Cohl's group is paid.  With bureaucracy, power, and money intertwining to make motives less apparent, the book ends where \\"Phantom Menace\\" begins.    James Luceno may be the premiere writer in the Expanded Universe.  In this novel, I particularly enjoyed being introduced to characters not appearing this movies such as Yaddle.  Though the plot may seem restrained by the extensive dialogue, it is a necessary element in setting up the Star Wars movie series.
031606792X|5|For an amateur writer I think Stephanie Meyer is very good. I love the ending of this book. Just how I'd like it to be. Bella and Edward married. Bella got a daughter. A brave symbol of her love for edward carrying it in her human form when she could have just had aborted it. The daughter named Renesmee or Nessie sounds very cute, She grows faster than normal humans includes mentally ofcourse otherwise she's gonna be a retard but I was thinking maybe that when she reaches like 15 or 16 years old, her age would stop right there and she would be 15 or 16 forever.  When Bella delivered the Immortal baby Nessie, Bella's supposed to die because her human body isn't strong enough to deliver that child  but Edward saved her by turning her into a vampire and I'm so glad that he did otherwise It would be a sad ending if she died. At least they're together, bella a new vampire herself as part of the cullen family and nessie too. In the End Bella's gift is a \\"shield\\", protecting people she loves around her. She have a very good self restraint as a vampire especially for human blood and She became Immortally Beautiful and Strong. Edward doesn't have to protect her from accidents and death threats anymore but ofcourse they still look out for each other.  Speaking about Jacob I really like his character, He's like someone you can run off with anywhere anytime, easy going, very happy to be with. I like how Jacob in this last book became friends with the cullens, and the idea that in the end Jacob and Nessie would be together too. Well Nessie would keep growing until she's like 16 and 'coz Jacob will be 16 as longer as he wants to be wolf I think they're meant to be together and my 2 cents, that when Jacob stops being a wolf and would age I wonder if Nessie can turn him into a vampire. hm I wonder... This book is actually one of those stories created from wild fantasies though impossible to happen in real life but whatever, it's just a book. very good though.
0446310786|4|This novel is a classic and a &#34;must read&#34;.  I first read it in junior high and recently read it a second time.  Harper Lee has stated that she meant for it to be a subtle childhood love story, but it's taken on a story other than that, and really gives insight into the complicated as well as blatant hypocrisy in our country's history in regards to [true] societal racism and the flaws of our judicial system.  Fathers will regard Atticus as a role model for themselves as men, and strong women/feminists will very much enjoy the strong willed, feisty, never-back-down personality of the protagonist - Atticus's daugher, Scout.  My only complaint is the ending.  I am harshly critical of book endings,  so one must consider that when I say that I did not like the ending at all.
B00006RCNJ|5|I LOVE this C.D.  I think ANdre Rieu is the greatest musician around.  He doesn't turn his back to the audience he brings his entourage and audience together.
B0060MYM3S|5|I felt it could use a lot more adult content. The locations and costumes are dead on, Sorry Ned. Looking forward to season 3.
B005DD7H50|4|Was very entertaining movie!  Decent acting and funny story!
B0034DGPEU|5|The writer brings you right in and captures your interest throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0017SWPXY|5|The story was very well written from a dogs perspective.  If you love your pet you should love this book.
B0064MPXFA|5|Love this show!! It's cutting edge! Story lines are fresh and unexpected! My new favorite show!
B006LSZECO|4|I thought it was well written,it held my interest,<br />The plot had many twists and turns. It was certainly Amazing Amy
0061122416|4|Let me start off by saying this is the third time I have re-written this review.  My first impression was that this was a simply worded book - not a complex plot, not a lot of characters, and as someone who reads an extraordinary amount while having a full-time job, thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m accustomed to. This book is a favorite of Oprah, Madonna and even Pharrell Williams. What kind of book can sit on the bedside table of celebrities who have made hundreds of millions of dollars; people who can probably find and keep anything they want to in that same place?  The story of this book doesnâ€™t suck  you in, like Gone Girl. Youâ€™re not turning the pages faster and faster in a need to know what happens next. You read this book slowly, because every line has a message. Every page brings an idea that makes you stop and think, damnâ€¦ I need to read that again.  The message of the book which, is a wonderful reminder: your heart knows where to go.It reminds me of the first book I read called The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment by Tolle. They both remind the reader that in order to find enlightenment, you must focus on the Present. The protagonist, Santiago (who, according to an interview with Oprah, is named after Hemingwayâ€™s character in The Old Man and the Sea), is a young boy who learns to listen through his heart through travel after he has lost every possession that he owns, and through a couple of mentors and focusing on the Here and Now, he learns how to trust his instincts on where he feels he must be, and how to trust the universe to help him get there. And this might be one of the reasons this book spoke to me. Six months ago I sold all of my possessions and drove from Alaska to Seattle in an effort to find myself. Thereâ€™s something easier about finding your soul and listening to your instincts when you own nothing but a cooler for food, a small suitcase of clothes and a jacket.  Santiagoâ€™s internal dialogue as he travels is a wonderful reminder that in order to achieve happiness, we must focus less on material possessions and social expectations, and we should focus more on what our hearts want and where we are today. Itâ€™s exactly the reminder that the twenty-first century (and especially those who have more money than they know what to do with) needs; itâ€™s easy for your heart to get buried under material things, unless you make sure you are listening.
B002ZBT84G|5|Spectacular strong finish to a career whose potential was sidetracked by drugs
B00FATEJYE|5|.Awesome game. Great characters. Very addictive very fun. Nice to be able to play lobo in a game and the joker
B0089LOG02|4|I did not know much about the orphan trains so I learned a lot. This was a very Interesting book and I thought it was well written.
B00EEDJHXA|4|.I.'m an oldster &amp; enjoy doing  this, but really like more of a challenge. However, I've only just begun so perhaps it will get more complicated as I get further along.
159102594X|4|In this darkly humorous debut novel, Joe Abercrombie introduces us to what might, in less sure hands, be the stock set of fantasy characters: a mysterious wizard, a trouble berserker, a conscience-ridden torturer, a wronged woman and a naive nobleman, all in a country with wars on its northern and southern borders and rot from within. But Abercrombie's characters are far better than the cardboard cut-outs that plague most modern fantasy.<br /><br />The plotting and setting are interesting, but not exceptional. The characters, by contrast, are vivid, earthy and all too human. Logen Ninefingers, barbarian and berserker, called Bloody-Nine, who understands that you have to be realistic. Glotka, former Champion, captured by enemies who ruined his body, now a tortured torturer. Jezal, a frivolous nobleman of sorts, untested and undirected. The Named Men, Dogman, Tul Duru, Black Dow, Three Trees and the rest, still alive in North despite the usurper kind Bethod's effort to send them back to mud.<br /><br />There are no happy endings. This is, if anything, fantasy noir, where disappointment and disaster are far more common than success and happiness. But \\"The Blade Itself\\" is a fine read, and a great start for a trilogy.  And the characters will stick in your mind.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B0051MKMNC|5|Great item and fast delivery!!
B00APUQRPC|4|Good alternative when there is nothing on TV. Amy Adams is so cute, Clint same as always. Justin Timberlake delivered a fabulous performance for a novice actor. As always, John Goodman is a gem. If love acting, John and Amy are the reasons to see this movie.
B000QRIGLC|4|This is an awesome book! I couldn't put it down.
0385539703|4|A very well written and enjoyable book. McEwan's writing is really lovely.
B009C7ZQM4|5|thanks for your support
B00DGNO3WE|4|Quartet gave an amazing view of the elderly population, about life after retirement and continuing to live life to the fullest.
0399160450|3|I love the Tom Clancy books.  This isn't really one.  The plot and interweaving story lines are great, but the writing, not so much.  Clancy's writing is elegant and tight and detailed; this isn't.  PLEASE--Don't use single sentences as whole paragraphs.  Don't start a sentence with \\"No\\".  Doesn't heighten the suspense at all.  And a little quibble--The parachute would be \\"taut\\", not \\"taught\\".  Who edited this?
B0079L2XTE|5|I had no idea there were subtitles when I viewed the movie, but the story and audio tracks more than made up for it.  The various tracks are an odd mix, but the ones by Enaudi are so outstanding, it is well worth the investment.
B008UCJ7KO|1|I was so disappointed with this book. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen and it never did! I can not believe I had to wait 6 months for this book to come out. I have lost interest in the characters so much that I really don't care what happens next! I can't believe they even published this book!
B005GFPZYK|5|You can read all you want about the military and war. This book gives you a true look inside what is going on. Kyle doesn't sugarcoat it and at times I found myself cringing at what he wrote. But that is what this book is about. The truth that so many people will never understand.<br /><br />Very emotional especially after his death last month. A lot of the book is foreshadowing almost and your heart breaks for his wife and family. God bless the Kyle family and our military.
B007L3BMGA|5|Finished the book in notime. Couldn't stop reading!
B007MNV5WU|5|My son is really into this and I must admit, his fever has caught on to me as well.  I like the different levels and challenges and we have both passed more time with this game than I will admit.  Only thing - amazon sent me an email saying a free update for the space HD was<br />available for download but I have been unable to find it to download.
B00DGGIXS6|5|Cher's voice sounds great and songs are high energy and ready to hit the dance floor. This is definitely Cher's trade mark.  It's a must have to be added to your collection....
B008M7JODC|5|Great series by J.J.  Amazing story throughout all the seasons, and a ending sure to not disappoint.<br /><br />If you like to binge watch seasons of shows like I do, and enjoy a good scifi mystery like I do.  Look no further.  Enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|1|Facebook is the Devils play ground.
B009NOVCTM|5|Great compilation of their music. So glad I bought it. Lots of memories and a reminder of just how good they are.
B004EB0CI6|5|This movie is sooo wrong!  It gives hope for those stuck in the friend zone.  But as a romantic, how can I not love this movie.
B00AIBZMD6|5|Well played movie fast action
B00004XQP4|2|Green day is longer a punk band, the have truly sold out.
B00CWVFPGO|4|One of his better movies of late!
B003TML0VO|3|While this collection of songs is listenable, I prefer the Santana of old. In preview trailers for this CD, Carlos made a point of saying that the entire Santana band had input and participation in this project. The Latin percussion, which contributes so much to the Santana sound, only appears sporadically. And the rest of the band, all competent musicians, never have a chance to shine.     The guest artist approach worked with Supernatural and, to a lesser extent, Shaman but by the time All That I Am was released it was wearing thin. I'm sure this CD, which follows the Clive Davis guest artist formula, will sell reasonably well and bring in the dinero, but I'm fervently hoping that Carlos isn't following the Rod Stewart, Great American Songbook road and is planning to release five editions of Guitar Heaven. If he does, I'll spend my limited CD budget on lesser known but more deserving groups like The Iguanas, Los Lobos and Alejandro Escovedo.     Sorry Carlos, you're my all-time favorite guitarist, but unless you've lost your mojo and are content to simply play your (and now others) hits in Vegas, I'll have to pass on GH2. Let's hope you find the fire again on your next release.
B001ANSSDC|4|really didn't understand the story until the middle of the book. would have been helpful to know what happened in the begining
B00HVLUR18|4|I probably should have read the cable length but they sound amazing on my sound card
034580404X|5|Read the books through the library and liked them so much bought the set. While the first book covers some intense material, the EL James does so in a way that's caring and insightful. The subsequent books move into deeper territory. I thoroughly enjoyed them all. Ordering from this merchant went well and I'd recommend them to others and would shop from them again.
B00BW5K5DO|5|Great game if you like time management/strategy games. You can continue after your time has run out, just no gold star, then you can go back and try again. Have it on PC also and this kindle version seems to be working well,  no problems so far. So even if time management is not your cup of tea, you can still enjoy this cute game. A lot of fun!
B001KDQ4KQ|5|This book really draws you in the lives of the two families.  It made me more aware of the affect of having to live up to parents' expectations and pressures of kids that age.
B006C3Q6GG|4|There are so many old usage words to learn, but luckily, a kindle makes it easy to look them up.
B00125WAWS|5|A reminder of the difficulties some folks have faced, and overcome with hard work and determination.  A must-see for young people who have no idea how Negroes lived in the south, and what they had to contend with.  Great performances by the stars.
B005ZTFPFQ|1|totally not worth it.
B000OVLINI|4|The book kept me on the edge of my seat ... beautifully written
B004EWFV9K|4|Kurt is indeed the troubled man and I am even more troubled to find out that this was the end of the series.  I am going to miss the Swedish detective....his fears, muddling through life a great deal of time....I have fallen in love with him, his Baiba, his life.
B0042TV4IW|5|The characters are richly engaging and even those cast in almost villainous rolls, have sides to there character that make it difficult  to dislike them entirely. The plot is intriguing and comical.Over all  Lark Rise to Candleford is my favorite new addiction.
B00IXF85CY|4|Interesting to observe how the ordinary German citizen survived durring Hitlers reign<br />They suffered ,but not as badly as the Jews
0307277887|4|Book was a little warn but over all good condition. Pretty much as described, great book would recommend and pleasant buying experience.
1441761268|4|Our book club read for September, this engaging tale quickly captures the reader's attention and holds it til the very last page.  The characters are well-developed, the historical associations accurate, and the glimpse into our nation's passion for slave labor is enlightening and embarrassing.    The audiobook is well-read and develops the characters and their voices in a clear manner.
B00QW8TYWO|5|So awesome also warning<br />REACT QUICKLY or else you get run over by the car it is so addicting! UNLOCK NEW ANIMALS
0439023513|4|Those who are fans of the Hunger Games series were probably eagerly awaiting the final installment of the trilogy, Mockingjay, this past August. I myself was in this group, and only had to worry about how I would fit in reading the book around the birth of my son!    Unfortunately, I don't think the final book lived up to its billing.    Mockingjay picks up where Catching Fire left off. Katniss has been rescued from the arena, and the revolution has begun. The book follows Katniss as she plays the public role of the Mockingjay, the figurehead of the rebellion.    This book is dark, even darker than the previous two books (which is saying something). Without following the combat of the larger war, it still fits in tons of carnage as we follow Katniss around. Nothing and no one is sacred or safe in this book, and life in the heart of the rebellion is not much better than life in Panem.    What I like about Mockingjay, and really the entire series, is that it vividly illustrates the dangerous nature of power. Even those in the rebellion aren't immune to its allure, and fall prey to some of the same atrocities commited by the Capital in previous books. The novel paints evil as a wave that must constantly be kept at bay, not as something that can ever be completely eradicated. In this way, it's practically a tract for libertarianism.    My knock on the book is that it ends without any final message of hope. Without spoiling too much, even a win in the end is empty. Does this reflect reality? I don't know. But I like a little hope for our world, at least in my fiction.
B002KYXO7A|5|My kids didn't want to watch it. They ended up loving it. Still one of the greatest musicals ever made. The kids loved Donald O'Connor, and now I have to find more films featuring him. We played Make 'Em Laugh and Moses Supposes over and over again. There is nothing else like it.
B00AHG9KYE|4|Nto as engaging as earlier books, but tied it all together.
B00377V6IS|3|I KNOW what fans will say is \\"well, duh.\\"  I didn't realize that Opeth were mostly a death metal band.  I had only heard them through a Porcupine Tree Pandora radio and I liked what I heard, so I bought this.  Not really what I was expecting.<br /><br />I personally don't like death metal.
B00W6XM002|5|Great game!
B006GLLXXK|5|Excellent
B004XDYJRU|3|Amazon will not sell the updated version. Go check the playstore and check their version. I wrote to the developer and he said that Amazon is holding the update. Do not give them money for this app, this is not up to date.
B003O86FMW|5|This is such a great sequel to the Hunger Games. Once you start reading it is difficult to stop. This book takes you to multiply directions leaving you with a cliffhanger. Do have the third book on hand \\"Mockingjay\\" as you will immediately want to continue reading.
B00IDI8KLC|5|Kids love it
0385504209|2|This was a really disappointing book.  I enjoyed &quot;Angels and Demons&quot;, and from the first few pages this book was just too similar.  It seemed like an obvious attempt to capitalize on the formula.<br />I'm not concerned either way by the religious issues, by the way, and I'm no grail scholar.  That said, the puzzles were insultingly simple.  How long can it take for a cryptologist to recognize a Fibonacci series?  Does anyone not know that Da Vinci was known for using mirror-image handwriting?  The big puzzle at the end of the book (I won't spoil this one for you) was introduced fully 100 pages before it was solved, but as soon as the full poem was printed (after 10 pages) the answer was obvious.  I spent the next 90 pages hoping that the answer would be something more clever, but it was exactly as I thought.  Am I some sort of puzzle-solving genius?  Not likely.  I know plenty of people better at it than I am.<br />If you haven't read &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and try not to think too hard, you might like this book.
B00A2AHU2E|5|One of my favs!!
B006VRDZ44|4|Excellent
B003L77GRO|5|good movie, arrived in good shape
B00LD1OHE0|5|Yet another WOWSA from Colleen. It goes without saying that I'm a Colleen Hoover fan. I think her books just continuously surprise me for the better and offer something new for me to love. I loved the entire premise of this book. I loved that it was based off of real confessions from her readers, I loved that there is an artist (Danny O'Connor) who produced the stunning artwork that is not only read about but SEEN in the book, no matter the digital or paperback version. I loved everything about it. I read it with almost a bit of trepidation, in fear I might read my own confession in there!  Another reviewer mentioned that they didn't like at the end how there was this culmination of issues and plot twists... and I can see that. However, I truly felt that this is a typical style for Colleen. I don't necessarily see that as a downside though. I gave this book 4.5 only because I had the most difficult time following the jump at the very end. I was at a loss as to how any relationship could exist with such a secret as large as that between them. But life is unpredictable as I well know, and this was only the beginning of theirs. So who really knows what their future holds? Maybe one day down the road a true revelation will exist.  On another note, I loved what this book brought out in her readers. As a fan of Colleen, I follow her on social media. The honesty and confessions that this book brought out were amazing. heartbreaking. wrenching. disgusting. hilarious. Like with everything she touches, a wealth of emotions were brought forth. And OMG the gnomes!  Thank you Colleen.
B00FPOSDGY|4|I loved this book! I loved the writing and the mystery, I didn't see the ending coming at all - so I was quite shocked. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, but I did feel like I got to know the Liars. Such a good book that I can't stop thinking about.<br /><br />It's very true that you need to read this book without knowing what it is about, if you know anything about it before - the whole feel of the book is spoiled. I didn't know a think about the book except for the summary on Goodreads, and I'm SO glad I didn't cave and do any research on it before picking it up.
B00M7UTFW0|2|dumb
1628600543|5|Started eating the way the book suggests and doing fine.
0736430512|5|Great quality for price
B000ICXQF6|5|One of the best sci-fi movies ever made in my opinion. Brad Pitt is semi-annoying at times and the story is without a doubt not bulletproof, however, overall if your into science fiction then this movie works. The ending is what makes it worth it as one walks away thinking it is not too far fetched that the Army of the 12 Monkeys could be real.
B0009XNUK0|5|I have always loved Michael as a singer and entertainer.  Loved watching his moon dancing and his video of Billie Jean.
B00T47ZXIE|4|A beautiful re-telling of a great classic.
B00488SU02|4|I'm a Kevin Spacey fan first of all so I view all of his work - this wasn't his best but still intriguing . I'd recommend it
B005LAII12|1|I had heard good reviews about this movie, so I thought I would buy it. Stupid mistake; it was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I'd never recommend this title for adults. It maybe FOR adults, but it is far from funny, it's just plain stupid.
B002RKRGQ2|5|Funniest speech ever from Gussie - also great crosstalk with Aunt Dahlia, and good description of a cold collation, and good Anatole talk
B00EL8I8IS|5|Ok, it wasn't like the book. Purists might freak out about this. But I thought it was well made, action packed, tense and original. Most of the gore happens off camera, but it's still scary. Brad Pitt manages to stay dreamy even after fighting 100s of zombies and nearly dying in a plane crash.
B0009IOR6Q|5|I adored this movie since the first day I saw it on TV. I had looked in a lot of places before coming here to find it. I watch it all the time now.
B00GP1ANXC|5|I'm a kid who's not aloud on the internet, so this app lets me watch achievement hunter with Gavin,Geoff<br />, Michael,Ray, Ryan,and Jack best YouTube's ever
B00AREIAI8|5|I really enjoyed playing this game. You don't run out of energy very often.  I can't stop playing the game.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I liked the book, but didn't like it as much as I thought I would based on the reviews. I am kind of tired of reading books where the main character is drunk all the time.
B007REV4T8|4|ok
B004J4WKTW|3|I feel guilty writing this review, guilty because there is so much beauty and so much potential in this book.  Unfortunately, I felt as if the book was an unedited first draft after reading it.  There are some great chapters, and as other reviews point out, very magical images that really capture your imagination.  The characters and the plot line were the weakest points in my opinion.  The story often dragged and I found myself putting the book down for days at a time.  The main characters felt flat and one-dimensional, especially the darker characters.  I found myself more interested in side characters than the two main love interests, Celica and Marco, who seemed self-involved and pompous in varying degrees.    If you enjoy the excerpts with the intriguing imagery you'll probably get some enjoyment out of the book, but just be prepared for some tedious chapters in between.  I'm not sure what other book I could say this is like, other than to remember reading Proust thinking what a beautiful chapter, only to feel as if the next 50-100 pages dulled in comparision.    Again, I really feel like the problem is with the editing, not the writing.
B00JB3MVCW|5|I loved this depiction of the events surrounding the life of Noah.
B00J2PFPVI|5|Best sister movie ever!!  must have!!
B00F9F1G4U|5|Great when working with Cox Cable, they referred me to this. I can keep a daily log when having trouble to help them figure out the solution for speed fluctuations. Can't stand freezing up and dragging so slow, but when they look it seems fine. This is my back up.
B007EC27QM|5|Great calculator, always good performance. I recommend this for everyone. Helped me in all my problems. Keep great memory. Good on percentage problems as well. Enjoy using this calculator.
B00005JNEI|3|HE REALLY DOES HATE BUSH. SOME VERY GOOD POINTS ARE MADE IN THIS MOVIE.
B004QOB8SO|5|Captivating. Mesmerizing. Enchanting. Enthralling. There's nothing not to love about this. From Lara Pulver's magnificent turn as Irene Adler to the moors of Baskerville to the \\"final problem\\", they all capture and keep the viewer a willing hostage. Or at least that was the case with this viewer!
B0024Y9EYS|5|Lena Headey is great. I like her deplorable character in Game of Thrones, but her headstrong Sarah Connor is is pretty good.
B001V58BUY|5|My Grandchildren loved it.  And my 7 year old grandson couldn't figure out why he couldn't fly, also.

B00BFUUMO8|1|I have found this a brilliant game to play and I have invested quite a bit of real money as well. So when the ice age update came along I thought it would get even better.....WRONG. it is now impossible to a) update it, and b) go back to the original version. The result is that, having got to level 41 I have lost everything it seems. Can anything be done to rectify this disaster?
B00AQL8VU4|1|I wanted to be able to watch my Amazon prime video on my tablet. Can't do it. Therefore I am disappointed.
B004X75RK4|5|I cannot say enough good things about this movie! This romantic comedy is one of Sandra Bullock's best!  I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it. It is a great date night movie and I would recommend it to anyone!
B00GKKTZZU|5|Fantastic as always<br /> COLE IS SIMPLY A GENIUS.SHE NEEDS TO HIT THE MIDWEST FOR A BOOK TOUR. CHICAGO  needs her

B0095ZQ36G|3|Since this was a \\"full price\\" book with over 1,000 reviews, the majority of them 5 star I was sure this would be a great read.  Perhaps it's me.  I fond it OK, certainly enjoyable, but 5 stars?  No.
B005K17RU0|1|It's a waste of time to download if you own a Kindle Fire. Wait for a Fire- ready version to come out.
B0050DZ8J0|3|honestly, i don't use this much. but it does what it's supposed to, log in, look at what you need to, update what you want and so on.  crashes on occasion but most apps do that from time to time.  If you are a linkedin user that wants regular access, this is for you.
0385484518|5|I must admit I would have never read this book if it wasn't mandatory for my sociology class. <BR>I really enjoyed this book it made me step back and take a look at my own life and re-think a few things. Morrie's outlook on life would give anyone meaning to the things they take for granted. <BR>Their is life after death, we just choose not to deal with it.
B0007PLLQ0|4|A fairy tale in the land of pollen, but what every one who sees it will remember is Darkness. The hooved and horned giant of evil makes the this movie something remarkable.

B00N45U1MK|5|Great Idea for a movie! I love Groundhog day type of movies where people relive the same day over and over. Emily Blunt and Tom work great together.
B00004ZB9D|4|For most great artists, it is absolutely essential to hear their hit singles in the context of its original album.  This is because the albums themselves stand up as individual works of art.  <br />Lenny Kravitz, however, is not one of those artists.  Throughout his career, he's been criticized for aping his heroes of the past (Hendrix, Marvin Gaye, etc).  And for the most part, his critics are right.  Even his last release, &quot;5&quot;, which sounded deceptively modern, followed the same formula. If you took away the loops and electronic flourishes, it's still the same old 70's hard rock.  (It's embarassingly revealing that his remake of the hit 70's song &quot;American Woman&quot; doesn't sound much different from many of his other hit songs) But despite his short comings, he is quite talented at recreating classic rock.  And he has managed to record several catchy hit singles as well.<br />All of this makes Lenny Kravitz the perfect candidate for a Greatist Hits Compilation.  You wouldn't want to spend loads of cash on his individual albums since most of them are rather uneven.  Chances are, you just want to hear his hit singles anyway.  Thankfully, they are all here.  Unfortunately, the songs are not in chronological order.  However, that doesn't cause much trouble since it's all the same retro classic rock anyways.  There is also a new song included, &quot;Again&quot; , which is quite a catchy number.  On the down side, the second half of the album can be somewhat tedious.  (It seems Lenny didn't have enough hits to fill an entire album)  &quot;Mr. Cab Driver&quot; in particular is awful.  <br />This is a fantastic album for any music fan who just wants Lenny's hit singles and doesn't want to waste money on his individual albums.  In short, this is the only Lenny Kravitz album you need to purchase.
B00QW8TYWO|5|It's. Fun to play get it...
B0084BMUFA|4|Was fun to read over the holiday
B00SH00N3Y|4|Pretty good.
B009GIPDQS|5|Depend on Grisham for a good story and good characters!  The plot line turns and twists but comes out all right.
0312330537|5|Though the author's writing is a bit meh at times (for example, when I read about Karla's green eyes matching her outfit and her eyes, her eyes, her eyes...), the story is quite captivating. I had been planning a trip to India and this story made me so much more eager to go! Once in India, I felt like the stories in this book and the author's assessment of the people he met along his journey helped me to delve deeper with my experiences there.
B000BW7QWW|5|This is not only one of the best sci-fi movies in recent years, it is one of the best all round movies I have ever seen.  What makes this movie so good is everyone will like it.  Girlfriend, family, roommates, the movie has something for everyone.  Please do yourself a favor and buy it, and hopefully the series will continue to fly.
B0000636UN|4|After a long wait we finally get the fourth Sheryl Crow album and what's more it's probably her best to date.  Obviously influenced by 70's country-rock this sees Crow in a whole variety of moods - fun, contemplative and even sad.  What's more it even feels like a day's progression in an odd sort of way.  Starting off her album with light, hip and fun tracks 'Steve McQueen' (a personal favourite) and the bubbly 'Soak Up The Sun' Crow is more playful than she's ever been.  Middle of the album comes 'C'mon, C'mon' and the superb 'Diamond Road' are perfect dusty afternoon tracks whilst 'Weather Channel' and 'Missing' draw the evening to a close.  It's very bizarre to have an album that feels like this and it works perfectly, even if it wasn't intentional.<br />This is an incredibly consistent album with plenty of fantastic songs that stand up there with old hits 'A Change Would Do You Good' and 'Everyday Is A Winding Road' they are the perfect accompaniment to a road trip, and that isn't meant as an insult.  In particular 'Steve McQueen' is exceptional and tracks such as 'Diamond Road' are very insightful whilst 'C'mon, C'mon' is beautifully honest.  This is a sunny summer album that everyone can sing along to.  Sheryl Crow has come out on top again.
B00992CF6W|5|I begged dad 4ever to get this 4 me. I love it!
B00005B4GU|4|Amnesiac was recorded in the same sessions as Kid A, which is considered by most fans and critics to be the superior album. I agree that it's more cohesive and flows better as a united work, but I don't think the music itself is really noticeably better. They're both pretty good alternative albums with heavy electronic elements. Kid A has more truly standout tracks, but there's plenty to like about Amnesiac. There's a lot of catchy parts and great moments, and of course plenty of weirdness. A lot of the songs on Amnesiac are actually more like actual songs than on Kid A, with more palatable structures and more traditional instruments. I don't think what Radiohead's become is as interesting as what they used to be in the mid-90's, but their work since the turn of the millennium is still pretty good.    \\"Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box\\" starts things off with a nice mellow sound and pleasant beeps and bloops. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" has odd computerized vocals and minimal but compelling instrumentation. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" has a good guitar riff going for it, although it does get a bit repetitive. It's followed by another less artificial song, \\"Knives Out\\". The next song is \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\", another version of a track that originally appeared on Kid A. It's different enough to be interesting although it doesn't branch too far from the original. \\"Dollars & Cents\\" is easily the creepiest and most unnerving song on the album. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is unique sounding with the reversed effect and has a cool atmosphere. \\"Life in a Glass House\\" ends the record with a departure for the band, as hard as that is. It has a heavy jazz influence but doesn't seem too out of place. Radiohead is able to maintain an identity as an artist despite the fact that most of their albums can sound quite different.
B00004W50Z|5|the Band got to love it
B001M5UDGS|5|In this 40 minute musical you will come to feel bad and sorry for a known villain. You also will want to buy the album afterwards too. This movie is chock-full of comedy, love, and evil in a twist all new to the genre of a musical.
B00992CF6W|5|The 0.7.0 update is amazing. Finally spawn eggs and buckets! I'm gonna build a nether reactor and fight zombie big man, and get gold bigots! GO MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION!
B00H3GZMIE|5|I listen to this CD everyday!!! so glad I bought it
B008JFUS8M|5|This movie is great.  Although the first one is still my favorite, the second one is fun to watch as well.
B00BMVTS1S|2|I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I have been a fan of Lord of the Rings for forty years, however, this movie's sound quality is poor. I tried it with my speakers,which will blow you out of the room on other movies and music, and could still barely hear the lines. I tried headphones and my computer speakers were up at 100%. Since there is no refund on Amazon instant video purchases I can only warn others not to buy this instant video. Buy the DVD, at least you can return that.

B007FG9LIE|5|I actually forgot what I read when the ad from Amazon popped up on my Kindle a short while ago, but it was interesting enough to order it.  I ordered 2 other books at the same time, and I have finally finished both of those, as well as the one I was in the middle of at the time.  However, I have been in a kind of drought lately, not finding a book quite good enough to keep me absorbed for more than a few pages each night.  Nothing has really been a page-turner for me in a while.  Until 'The Pines'.  I started it this morning with my first cup of coffee, and even though I had two appointments today, was anxious to get back to it when I returned home.  I finished it early this evening.  I wouldn't normally choose this type of book, though not sure what genre to put it under, sci-fi, fantasy?  I did have to quickly work through a few ghoulish scenes, but the story was so engaging, I couldn't avoid being curious about what happened next!  So I kept going, page turning.  I enjoyed this writer's way of telling a story.  It all worked to make this a great novel and I plan to read the other two books in the series.  I recommend this ...thriller!  Yes, it's a thriller!  Worth your time.  Even those creepy scenes!
B00BATG18K|5|I loved the book.  It was fascinating how it all came together in the end.  Three generations of women facing the trauma of their times.  At first I thought of the harsh Chinese conservatism and then I realized life for women in America was awful too.  Men could keep the children and women were considered property and rarely did women have a life outside the home.  And divorce was a taboo.  How far have we come here and there?  Thank you Amy Tan for a great book on many levels and titilating too!

0802130208|4|I think this is a well written book with the potential for greatness, but falls just shy. Unfortunately Toole died so young. He could have gone on to write flawless work.    The main character is one you will think about at random times, at unexpected moments. He's a caricature , true, but unfortunately one so true to life that you'll find yourself chuckling to yourself while visiting your local bar or market. There goes another \\"Ignatius\\", doing something so foolish, so self-absorbed, so irresponsible. Pick this one up. You'll thank yourself later.

B00DL48BM6|5|Wonderfully written and portrayed account of one of a group of 32 'monument men', whose task was to protect and return stolen art work during WWII. An almost forgotten mission taken on by architects, museum curators, art restorers, art teachers, etc. The depth of character development, historical accuracy, totally engaging plot, with an all star cast makes this movie for everyone, not just history buffs.
B0039TD7PY|5|This is a really good CD of two of my favorite artists singing together. There are tunes that I have on several other albums, but I don't have any of them singing together. And since I couldn't see them live, I really like to play this on my lazy/cozy days. It's very laid back, and a good pick to add to my collection. Plus, of course, the DVD is cool, too. Sometimes I'm just in the mood to watch.

0143145150|2|Steinbeck wrote some good novels, some that are even almost great (East of Eden comes to mind); this, however, is not one of them.  The Grapes of Wrath is little more than bad communist propaganda.<br /><br />It isn't that the kinds of things he describes didn't happen, but the way he presents them---without looking for the deeper cause (rather than pulling out the tired old scarecrow of \\"greed\\", an abused and vague term anyway) or offering a real solution but rather simply pushing for a (dubious at best) political program---is not only unrealistic, it isn't artistic either.  About the only time it approaches the level of genuine literary expression is when Casy goes on about how his idea of holy is for every man to be harnessed, not even to every other man, but to Mankind as a whole.  That's a horrible thought, but at least it's a somewhat deeper one.<br /><br />Even Tom Joad's famous \\"Whenever you seen a cop beatin' a guy...\\" speech is all about the insignificance of the individual, and as if to prove his point, Steinbeck continues the story for quite a while after that but Tom (despite having been the main character up to that point) does not reappear.<br /><br />And stylistically, this is one of Steinbeck's worst...it could be described as faux-Hemingway---lots of awkward sentences, unnecessary repetitions of words rather than using pronouns, etc.  But it actually reads more like Socialist realism than anything else.  It has a lot in common with some stuff put out by the Union of Soviet Writers under Stalin around that time.  East of Eden is much better written, though Steinbeck is still using some techniques he seems to have learned from writers like Kataev.<br /><br />I did a bit of research after finishing this, and it looks like Steinbeck actually joined and had further involvement with the League of American Writers, which was set up by the Communist Party USA in 1935 in sympathy with the Union of Soviet Writers putting its policy of controlling and censoring the output of authors into effect the year before. Anyway, enough was known here about what was going on under the Soviet system by the time he wrote The Grapes of Wrath that he couldn't have had any honest excuse for glorifying it like that.<br /><br />I suspect that the only reason The Grapes of Wrath is considered such a great classic is that it was heavily pushed by the press which was highly sympathetic to communism in this country at the time of its release, and because of the movie version with Henry Fonda.  People like to pretend that Steinbeck wrote books like this for \\"the common man\\", but the truth is it's incredibly patronizing and condescending; he really wrote it for wealthy intellectuals like himself to feel better about themselves.  As someone who's in the working class himself (but doesn't intend to stay there his whole life), I think if I ever met Steinbeck I would have slapped his face, because The Grapes of Wrath is basically a slap in mine.ng the output of authors into effect the year before.

B000MNP2KI|3|For once James Bond appears to be modern. A character who has spent most of his existence with a wooden, Ken doll personality finally, in the hands of Daniel Craig, has joined the rest of us in the year 2007. Of course Bond can never be as edgy as say, XXXX, Craig's character from \\"Layer Cake\\" the film that won him this most prestigious role. This is, after all, a franchise built upon a foundation of bling so anything the least bit offensive most be removed. And yet still they found a way to flesh this Bond out with humor and bravado. \\"Shaken not stirred\\" may have won them over many moons ago, but today our audiences demand more, they demand sexual innuendo with their ostentatious action set pieces. And Craig delivers, creating a Bond we can believe in, even when he is stealing cars and fornicating other people's girlfriends on the floor.<br /><br />At the center of this good, but not great, film is a poker game in Montenegro. We are back at the beginning of Bond's career (although the setting is modern day) and he is one of those shameless self-promoters who is looking to move up the ladder as quickly as possible. After an awe inspiring opening chase scene Bond is sent into the high stakes poker game (because he is the best, duh) with hopes of shutting down La Chiffre, a known terrorist. If he loses he has to live with himself knowing that he helped finance terrorism to the hefty tune of $10 million. Now poker isn't really my game so there is a chance that some of the nuisances of the game itself were lost on me. Stopping short of having an ESPN announce team in the house, Bond's co-conspirator Vesper works as the Greek Chorus filling in the poker simpletons (such as myself) and letting them know what is transpiring. \\"Rounders\\" made poker actually look exciting, but this film has no such trick up its sleeve. More than anything the central game works best as a way to slow down the pace of the film and in the process keeps it afloat.<br /><br />To watch this film back to back with the one that preceded it, \\"Die Another Day\\", would be to not believe that the came from the same genre much less the same series. Pierce Brosnan looked the park, especially when driving cars and acting cool, but I'm pretty sure I could beat him up. Daniel Craig would wipe the floor with me and that represents a major upgrade in that department. \\"Casino Royale\\" has its feet planted firmly on the ground and is helped along greatly by director Martin Campbell who can actually direct action sequences. \\"Die Another Day\\", with its embarrassment of a climax, was nothing more than special effects and fantasy lands, where somehow Bond ends up driving this uncrashable car through an ice palace. Oh, it is so bad. The old complaints about Bond refuse to go away however: plots are predictable, it doesn't have a thought in its head, and it represents commercialism above all. And still, for once, I am going to recommend a Bond film. It didn't give me whiplash and I am secure in the notion that Bond can once again clean my clock. What else does a man need? ***1/4back to back with the one that preceded it, \\"Die Another Day\\", would be to not believe that the came from the same genre much less the same series.

B000127LW2|3|I have been waiting for Voyager to come out on DVD since Paramount started packaging up the NextGen seasons.<br />Finally, the day has arrived, and I hold my Voyager Season 1 DVD set in my hands.  The packaging is nice and colorful, the DVD's are poorly labelled, and the menus are vague at best.<br />I popped the first DVD in, and managed to navigate my way through the menus.  I found the audio submenu and set it to Dolby 5.1, since that's what my receiver plays, and played The Caretaker.<br />The episode was much sharper than I remember - I don't remember Kes with that awful wig, or Tom Paris wearing that much makeup - that goes to show you just how clear the image is.<br />However, when the theme played, I barely heard it. no bass anywhere.  Ok, maybe my setup is wrong - I changed it to the other vague &quot;Dolby&quot; option in the audio submenu.  no change.  Ok, maybe it's my receiver settings - I popped in my Charlie's Angels CD - BOOM, instant bass (too loud, since I played with the subwoofer to try and get so much as a peep out of my Voyager DVD set).<br />I played another DVD from the series - same lackluster audio.  What happened?  Come to find out, at the end of the theme song when Voyager jumps to warp, the subwoofer drizzled out the slightest amount of bass.<br />I was heartbroken - I'm the kind of guy who will pop in a DVD to play the THX logo to show off my moderately impressive sound system.  I expected the drum beat to give me a foot massage. I expected the lower horn notes to resonate deeper than your average sub-molecular scans.<br />Right now I pray that either I haven't set some obscure setting, or that I've got a bad DVD (neither of which are likely options, but well within the realms of possibility).<br />If anyone else has seen this and knows what's wrong, then please let me know. Thanx

B0091I7FEQ|4|I am an experienced C++ programmer, accustomed to using classes, operator definitions and templates. I am reading this book as a more formal introduction to the new C++ 11 standard after watching a video of Stroustrup presenting an overview of some of the new features introduced by this version of the standard.<br /><br />So far I am only up to section 3.2 of this book. The content is excellent, detailed, and precise in its descriptions.<br /><br />I have not given it a 5 star rating because for some reason this book, and only this book, locks up my Kindle Touch for about 2 to 3 minutes when I start reading the book from somewhere else.  After freezing my Kindle Touch for this period of time, everything seems to go back to normal responsiveness when reading this book, until I leave it, read another book for a while, and come back to reading this one, whereupon it temporarily freezes again.

It is not the original animated short you remember but in fact is a 94 remake. This is more accurately,  &quot;Dustin Hoffman reads Horton&quot;.

B00169N0BK|1|This product has been out for a number of years and several issues apparently have been fixed, e.g. you can have multiple activations, the driver on CD is the same version as the one found at x-rite's website, and the customer phone support was friendly. What has not been fixed unfortunately is the software creating unusable profiles.<br /><br />According to the support technician you are supposed to set your monitor to factory defaults and then just run the ColorMunki software. Unfortunately my monitor is very warm in its default setting and the profile created by ColorMunki resulted in having strong purple shadows. So I started over with a more neutral color temperature, had ColorMunki take an ambient measurement and set a manual target luminance. That results in a profile with excessive contrast and crushed blacks. After a couple more attempts I finally ended up with a profile that was almost as good as the one I had manually created using a combination of HCFR, ColorEyes, and a Spyder2.<br /><br />Moving on to printer profiling I wanted to calibrate a Dell color laser printer. The ColorMunki created a profile which softproofed way lighter than the actual print. There's an option to refine the ColorMunki printer profile for a specific image. Sometimes that option works, other times it just aborts with a generic error message. Either way, the refined profile did not change anything. The generic profile that's provided by the printer manufacturer was a much better match than the custom one created for this printer-paper combination by ColorMunki.<br /><br />After 3 days of fiddling with the settings I gave up and returned the item. Overall it's a great product idea but unfortunately it does not work.

1619695006|1|Disappointing.  Depressing. Disgusting.<br />I pre-ordered this audio book so we could enjoy Rowlings newest effort on our road trip. We had loved listening to the amazing Harry Potter series and expected this novel to be even more wonderful.  Wrong.<br />Characters are despicable. Plot is absent. Raw language is icky. It's a boring \\"small fish in a small pond\\" waste of anyone's valuable time. Life is too short.  The characters' lives in this novel were too long.

0553382179|5|Well, I wouldn't have a clue wether those two would go together, because I'm not a christian. I also don't like people preaching at me about their god. But I've been on the flylady mailing list since May and my home is improving (slowly, because I sometimes still don't get my but into gear). I don't mind her Godbrezes, in fact I just read over the &quot;g-word&quot; and enjoy what she writes. She doesn't talk about god much actually and I would have noticed if she did (I really dislike people talking about god instead of telling me what I need to know). <BR>What I really love about flylady is that she's always encouraging us. She doesn't say &quot;you can do better than that&quot; or &quot;have you still not done this?!&quot; she can't look into our homes, but sometimes it really fells like she is standing right there telling me &quot;wow, just look at that shiny sink!&quot; and then I spread out the shining because it makes me happy! She encourages by praise and it works, unlike trying to encourage by putting people down for &quot;not having done enough&quot;. Shine your sink, even if you don't do anything else for the day it's okay. Just do one thing everyday to spready the shining and in a weeks time you'll see the difference. Even just one of her hot spot fire drills will make a difference (hot spot=an area where you put thing &quot;for later&quot; and later never comes, so you have one pile of STUFF that makes the whole room look trashed &lt;- mine is my desk :-( But I'm working on it a little at a time. Thank you Fly Lady)<BR>Well, I'm not perfect and I probably won't ever be that but I'm making progress! Thanks to Flylady who's always &quot;standing there your out of my sight&quot; cheering me on when I do something right and telling me &quot;baby steps!&quot; when I feel like I didn't do enough.<br />Flylady there's 5 gold Stars for you.

0812589041|5|I was introduced with this book by my elemtary school (where I work) librarian.  She recommended me this book if I was a science fiction reader.  In just several pages, I was captured by Ender's story, and was surrounded  with the anticipation of the story that was to unfold.  I thought that the  book was written very recently.  The concept and the way the story was  going was so briliant and amazing, I was so surprised to find out that it  was written in 1970's.  Because the story did not fall behind any short  from those of Star Treks or other recent science fictions.  This book  captured me the moment I opened it, and I do not believe there will be any  other!

B000002OZY|4|<br />...but only OK as an album. <br /> <br />This one is interesting in that it ranks high in all other categories except listenability.  I like many of the songs, but listening to them all straight through is exhausting.  Most are very catchy and singable, which is both a blessing and a curse.  After I heard them a few times, I got tired of them, yet they stayed in my head for weeks.   <br /> <br />If you're new to The Who, or to classic rock, it's required listening.  It's a big part of history and the evolution of rock.  It was ahead of its time, not just in terms of the music, but also the format and the subject matter.  Townshend, at his peak, was one of the most creative songwriters and best rhythm guitarists.  This album showcases his talents. <br /> <br />Many of the songs have been played to death on the radio.  But imagine hearing this album when it first came out in '69.  It's important to keep this in mind when listening. <br /> <br />Songwriting: 10/10  <br />Musicianship: 10/10  <br />Sound Quality: 10/10  <br />Originality: 10/10 <br />Listenability: 7/10

0316098337|5|Of all the books that I have ever reviewed, I think that this one is the toughest to do without any spoilers. I was very tempted to plaster a warning on my write-up and go for it, quotes and all, but have decided in the end for a quick, unrevealing version. Due to its celebrity, this was a novel which I approached with some caution. When a book is over-hyped, I tend to walk away disappointed because it didn't live up to my expectations. This was certainly not the best novel I ever read, but it stands out in several respects by virtue of sheer originality. Room is, in brief, the story of a nineteen year old woman who is abducted and held captive in an eleven by eleven foot square modified shed, where she spends seven years in captivity and bears a son, Jack. We see their minuscule world through the eyes of Jack, at the age of five. Jack as narrator was an amazing device for author Emma Donoghue to use and one she pulls off with astonishing aplomb. As I read her stream of conscience type prose, I could hear the voice of a young child in my head. Some reviewers have had difficulty adjusting to the style, but to me it was flawless and perfect for setting the tone of the book, especially in the second half. The second thing that really stood out for me was Ms. Donoghue's amazing attention to the smallest details. She thought of things that never would have even occurred to me, and as a result, the narrative was completely believable throughout. These two factors, the choice and deft handling of the narrator, and her incredible consideration of every possible element of setting and characterization, earn this novel five stars.

B00AIQP9DE|5|its a very good game to play. You need to play. It's really fun to play. It has very good graphic.
B001UHOWXI|5|Very fast shipping, and as advertised.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I loved the story...didn't love the way the chapter set ups. The dates written in the beginning or middle of chapters...would have preferred and would have been easier to track if would have said, for example, \\"3 days earlier\\" \\"1 month later\\"
B0086700CM|5|I love this game and it works as well as the apple products I have been waiting forever for this to be on the kindle and it works awesomely and it is a little slow but that's it.!!!!!!!!!!!

B000I9VOO4|5|Great classic movie!
B000B5IPLK|4|I have enjoyed this cd. I wasn't able to watch the actual show on MTV, but I felt as if I were right there in the audience. It has all of my favorites songs from her album all in one.
1603425381|5|This book is filled to the brim with beautiful border patterns that (gasp!) I can actually see myself using!  In fact, I've already used #30 on a birthday blanket I made for my mom - The pattern for the blanket itself was great, but the border was just several rows of single crochet - bo-ring!  This book allowed me to make the blanket even more special by putting my own personal touch on it.    There's a large, clear picture for every border in the book, the pattern directions are clear, and (for me) even better, there is a stitch diagram for each border as well.    If you crochet or knit blankets, placemats, scarves, shawls, sweaters, hats or anything with an edge that can be fancied up, you need this book!
B000P2A3WI|3|This book was enjoyable. I was eager to finish and invested in the characters throughout the book. I enjoyed it's setting being in London. It was quirky and made me laugh several times.
B00005RZV4|5|It doesn't get any better than this. FINALLY a LIVE NIN CD. I bought this one a little late cuz I didn't have any money for quite some time, so sadly I missed out on purchasing the Deluxe Edition, including the bonus &quot;Still&quot; disc, which I suppose I'll just have to order or something...but yes, this cd is, as always, nothing short of amazing. It almost doesn't even sound live, as if Trent went in and totally re-did the songs. Half of the cd is off of The Fragile and the rest are some of the best off of TDS, PHM, and Broken. I don't need to bother to go into detail how awesome this is, you should already understand. The only possible letdown is if this whole concert isn't two cd's long. It would have been cool to hear something like &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; or even &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; on here, or even &quot;Reptile&quot; which is actually a hidden feature on the DVD, and definitely be sure to pick that one up too, it's just breathtaking. You are not a NIN fan if you don't own this, bottom line.
B005USZYDU|5|When I got this book, I didn't realize I had already read it. I enjoyed rereading it. I will probably reread it again. I really enjoy that Theodore is obsessed with the law. I also think that it's really cool that he knows someone who could turn the whole case upside down. T he only thing I don't like is the ending. I have always hated cliff hanger endings. I think he could have wrapped up the story a little bit better.
B001RCD2DW|4|Do you have a dedicated headphone amp?<br /><br />- Of course: you don't need to read my review. Carry on.<br /><br />- No, why?: These headphones do not cost what you see on the price tag. They cost that much, plus about once again that much for a decent quality headphone amplifier. Try the &#34;Asgard 2&#34; from Schiit, it's what I'm using. If you're OK with that price tag, great! They're a 4-star headphone for that price, which is nothing to sneeze at. If you're not, that's OK too! But buy some *other* nice headphones, OK? You'll be much happier. Look on places like head-fi (google it) for recommendations.<br /><br />Three big claims to fame of these two models (this and the K701): Openness (you can still hear the world around you, your ears don't sweat as much), neutral response (not a lot of bass, a bit too much treble for some people, will probably sound close to what the engineer mixing the track heard), and 3d positioning accuracy stemming from its crazy wide &#34;soundstage&#34;. I won't go into the details of the latter, BUT. If you're looking for a set of headphones for FPS gaming, these are supposedly IT. Just, you know. Don't forget what I said above about that amp, or they'll sound like utter garbage for anything else.<br /><br />To underscore the above:<br />The impedance specs on these headphones don't sound all that extreme, and some motherboards, for instance, advertise themselves as being able to drive headphones up to 600 Ohm impedance directly. Mine is one such beast, and while turning on the option made the headphones sound &#34;acceptable&#34;, or at least better than just the normal rear output jack had (now if you want &#34;garbage&#34;, you should have heard that) it still failed to make any significant bass come out of these babies. For them to sound &#34;good&#34;, you need. that. amp. Sorry about that.<br /><br />With the above said, Great headphones! Comfortable around the ears (some people don't like the bumpy band), self-adjusting, not too heavy, sound lovely! Four stars.
0679720200|5|The Stranger starts out with the main character, Monsiuer Meursault finding out that his mother had died.  Meursault was a low income hard worker who could not support his mother at home, so he sent her to an old peoples home in the country.  This was the first of his so-called sins used against him later.  At first it would seem as though Meursault wasn't sorrowful of his mothers passing, but Meursaults main foible was that of his taciturn nature and unwillingness to show emotion.  Later in the story he commits murder in a vehement moment of rage.  All of a sudden he is thrown in to a trial with a magistrate.  All of Meursaults little mistakes are brought to the attention of the jury, including the fact of his unresponsiveness to a priest and religion as a whole.<br />        This author did a great job writing this  book and showing how society can tear a person apart using small insignificant mistakes.  The author throughout the book shows exactly what Meursault is thinking plus his views on certain matters.  The author also points out the flaws of religion and how God is not for everyone and should not be pushed upon by someone.  I picked up this book not knowing what it was and enjoyed how Camus could fit all this into a book that is less than 140 pages.  It was a quick easy to read story.  It was insightfully written and give credit to Matthew Ward for translating it into English so well.
B005LAIGYQ|5|This movie was timely and well done, and it gave more meaning to what actually happened.  We citizens never really get a feel for what our troups go through defending our country in wars.  This movie made it real and gave me a greater appreciation for our soldiers who give themselves and sometimes their life to protect and defend each of us/

B0071MV540|5|hubby said that this was pretty good
B0011UJMK2|4|I liked this book.  The plot is pretty straight forward.  In the famine ravaged Soviet Union, the government decries that there is no such thing as serial killers.  The problem is that there is.  The old war hero is tapped to investigate the death of a child much to his dismay.  Unfortunately this death is the work of a horrible serial killer.  The rest of the story is for you to figure out.  This is very reminiscent of real like serial killer Andre Chikitilo.  I am not sure if he is the basis for this work but it parallels his life rather closely.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Movie was want I wanted all these years from reading the Avengers!  This is one movie I will see again and again.
B00003CXI1|5|...this is a very special DVD. The fabulous movie aside, this has to be one of the most accomplished DVD's ever....everything from the guided tour of Hogwarts, to trips to Diagon Alley, to the time it takes to finally get the Philosophers Stone (which you have to find in order to reveal the deleted scenes)....everything is done so superbly & presented impeccably.....<br />...Overall? Fabulous!!!
B004H2ZFPW|5|It took about two weeks for her album to grow on me. At first I gave it 4/5 stars now I'm at 4.5/5 stars. There are few songs I think could have been better, than they are. Goodbye Lullaby is defiantly better than her last album The Best Damn Thing. Under My Skin is her best damn album! By the way I spent $23 on Goodbye Lullaby, I got the Deluxe Version with hardcover case, and a guitar pick. I only spend this kind of money on artists I love, and she is like 1 of 20 of them. She has inspired me a lot through out the years, I love you Avril.<br /><br />Goodbye Lullaby is the true, and real follow up album after Under My Skin ( 2004 I've had 3 copies since this album was released, I currently have 2 copies, including the dual disc version, that cost around $15. )<br /><br />I personally didn't like her last album The Best Dam Thing ( 2007 I rate this album 3/5 stars, I bought this album the day it came out. )<br /><br />Let Go was the first album I bought of Avril's back on January 31st 2004, I was 12, going on 13, at the time, and this album has inspired me to write songs about boys through out my teenage years. I think this is her 3rd best album to date. ( I've bought 2 of Let Go, because my first cracked, that's how much I used the CD! )<br /><br />After listening to Goodbye Lullaby for about a month, the album has grown on me more. I find myself singing some of the songs on this album. Avril has got me addicted to Goodbye Lullaby is a good way. Avril is one of my favorite singer songwriters. I hope she is around for many years to come. I really like Avril's lyrics, and some of her songs I really connect with, especially Nobody's Home. It's been a long time waiting for this album, and I'm glad she's back where she wants to be musically. Goodbye Lullaby doesn't get boring. I prefer the softer side to Avril, but I do enjoy the mix she did on Under My Skin. I think Under My Skin was her most perfect, and greatest album to date. She came really close on Goodbye Lullaby on being great, but the record company likes to screw things up, and have it their way. Avril deserves to do music her way. Avril is the greatest when she is herself.<br /><br />My favorite songs on Goodbye Lullaby are ( In order ):<br /><br />1. Goodbye<br /><br />2. Alice<br /><br />3. Push<br /><br />4. Darlin<br /><br />5. 4 Real<br /><br />6. Wish You Were Here ( Acoustic )<br /><br />7. Everybody Hurts<br /><br />8. Not Enough<br /><br />9. Remember When<br /><br />10. Wish You Were Here<br /><br />11. I Love You<br /><br />12. Push ( Acoustic )d company likes to screw things up, and have it their way. Avril deserves to do music her way.

B0045HCJKS|2|Somebody running away from something scary in a gimmicky setting with twists and turns; that's Westworld. One-dimensional characters, inane dialogue, cheesy costumes, predictable machine goes berzerk \\"story\\", and generic sets are the essentials that provide the thrills in this over-long movie. Like a majority of scary movies and the stories from which they are derived, the premise is to pile very contrived problems onto the harried protagonist trapped in a \\"Bloodybones is on the first step-Bloodybones is on the second step-Bloodybones is on the third step...\\" dilemma (Michael Crichton and Stephen King are the masters of the genre}. There's nothing new under the sun and there's nothing new in Westworld.
B00E4ZOQR0|4|Does this even need a review? Seriously, if you are a fan of Lego and Back To The Future movies, then this is a must have. Built this with my son and it now sits proudly in my classroom.

B00A9X9ORI|5|Visual storytelling is an art form in the digital age. Interesting to see Joseph Gordon Levitt 'do' Bruce Willis with digital age tools to help the characterization. Plot has a problem or too, but is too interesting in basic concept, visual portrayals and tension for me to care about director (or screenwriter) missing that little loophole.

B00006G8K0|5|I have been a Christopher Lee fan for about 45 years, and this is the movie that did it.  I was 12 years old when I went to see it and, once he made his first appearance with blood, fangs, etc., I spent much of the rest of the film with my eyes covered.  Then, when it ended, I went back to the ticket window and purchased another ticket.  This time, forewarned, I watched the whole thing.  I had never seen a horror film like it and, as far as I'm concerned, it set the standard for all horror-genre films to come after it.  From the realism of the make-up to the lavishness of the sets, Hammer was in a category of its own.  I have owned the VHS for many years, and have waited and waited for the DVD.  Like the header to this review says, \\"IT'S ABOUT TIME!\\"
B00DDZM0GQ|4|Good time waster.
B00CBKLO52|5|While some may consider this a game, I see it more as a flight training tool. As a private pilot, I learned to fly Cessnas back in the 70's before flight simulators on computers. Trying to fly my first radio controlled plane, I was astonished at how difficult it was to maneuver and land without crashing. The problem was not my lack of flight knowledge. It was a change of perspective to the aircraft. I was used to seeing the forward perspective through a cokpit window.<br /><br />Any man who's ever looked into a mirror to shave can do it without thinking. But try doing it while looking into a live TV monitor where right and left are reversed from what you see in the mirror. It's really hard. Or try writing a sentence with your left hand if you are right handed (or visa versa). Your brain can not interpret the visuals without taking extra time to translate the new perspective. That extra thinking time flying an RC plane is enough to allow a crash. Of course, with enough practice, you can overcome this. But your brain needs to retrain itself to the new perspective. And that's where this simple little program comes to the rescue.<br /><br />First, setting up the program is simple. There is an easy menu that is self explanatory. You can select one of three craft for free; a plane, a helicopter or a boat. Other planes and vehicles cost extra, but for training purposes, you won't need them. You can tailor the control sticks to allocate throttle, elevator, rudder and ailerons between the right and left sticks. Naturally, those with some level of flight experience will understand what each control does. Non fliers will be challenged at first.<br /><br />Flying a remotely operated craft from a fixed location is quite a different perspective from flying with a forward looking view from inside the aircraft. I think it's more difficult flying something remotely. At first, it was quite difficult to maneuver the helicopter, even though I completely understood the flight controls. I would get it in the air, and after a few control inputs, it would begin to spin wildly. After about twenty minutes of practicing with the helicopter in four different aspects (flying toward me, flying away from me, or flying it from the right or left side) I was able to keep the copter flying. When I wanted to yaw right, I had to manually think about it first if the copter was headed toward me, because in that position, right control turns left, and left control turns right. And that's the crux of the problem flying any remote aircraft. The perspective is constantly changing depending upon the orientation of the aircraft. The beauty of this program is that you can crash to your hearts content until you get it right, and no aircraft is damaged.<br /><br />Naturally, each flier will adapt to the new flight perspectives at different rates. I believe younger fliers will adapt faster than old guys like me. But after a few days of using this little simulator, it became much easier to fly a remote controlled helicopter without crashing it. And there's a few hundred bucks saved just by learning on this free program. This program should be included with every RC device.I would get it in the air, and after a few control inputs, it would begin to spin wildly.

B000QRIGLC|5|It was a most intense reading that I've done in awhile... I can't believe one human being went thru what he did and survived.. It was very hard to read how those men died.. I think I cried thru half the book... I'm so sorry that life is what it is and good men have to give of themselves to keep the rest of us free... I cherish every day that God gives me and pray every night for the men who made it possible for me to do that... He does give a good account of what goes on that people just don't know about or want to hear... thank you for having the courage to express it... And to know there are people out there that will give more, like the ones that came forward for his family... God Bless them for what they all did... Good reading , but heavy ...

B00000IAU3|5|With beautifully written music and lyrics, Dido shows nothing but pure talent. Having been compared to the likes of Sarah McLachlan and Sinead O' Connor, Dido's own unique style shines through brightly in her debut album, &quot;No Angel&quot;. <br />I first heard Dido's &quot;Here With Me&quot; in Melbourne last year, when I watched &quot;Roswell&quot; on tv one night. The mysterious and melancholic tune greatly caught my attention...such a fantastic track! I wanted to know who the singer was but thought it would be just another one-off artist. I later saw the video to &quot;Here With Me&quot; through cable music channel and it just took off from there. <br />Dido's current hit, &quot;Thank You&quot; can be very infectious as you'll find yourself humming to it at every opportunity. I think many would agree. Many would also say that their first introduction to this track was through Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; and although &quot;Thank You&quot; has been featured in two motion picture soundtracks, &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; and more recently, &quot;Bounce&quot;, it really only received massive airplay after her collaboration with Eminem. <br />I must say &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;All You Want&quot; are other great tracks that should be released as Dido's next singles. It has good tempo, and I love how Dido's songs are different in a way where a suspicious intro is accompanied by intelligent mixes of background music and a surprising chorus that diverges from the first few lines, yet preserving the melody of the song. <br />The one over minute intro to &quot;Honestly OK&quot; kept me curious and eagerly waiting for the singing to begin. I really liked the slow, soothing feel to it while the sorrowful first few lines in &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; really set the mood for me as I was reading Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;. It came across like a sad, traditional Irish poetic tune at the beginning, &quot;...returns no more, I will not watchthe ocean. My lover's gone. No earthly ships will ever bring him home again. Bring him home again&quot;, but the beat caught up around the second verse, so it didn't turn out as a depressing track, but more of a moving love song. <br />All the tracks on &quot;No Angel&quot; share a distinct touch - Dido's style, which might be a bore to some but her beautiful haunting voice most certainly makes for easy listening, especially if you're a fan of the Lilith Fair.
B001V5CIHQ|4|It is fun to remember being a kid again... where one's imagination knew no limits. A family favorite tale told in a fun way to be enjoyed by a wide audience.

There is no HDCD and it sounds as none of the recent improvement in remastering has been used. Yellow submarine sounds much better on the Yellow submarine CD than on this one for example. Other titles sound harsh and bass shy.

This book goes into detail with all situations that mother would expect from the baby and tips to solve the problems.  <br />Some of recommandation within the book is somehow differnt than the lactations that we consult in the U.S. which I was a bit confused with the tips and information that given from the book. Therefore I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 for it. <br />However, I'm stillhighly recommanded it for all the expecting mothers!

B00003CXPJ|5|Zoolander is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. when i went to see it with my freind, you could bareley hear the movie because evreyone was laughing so hard.  <br />... What [the] reviews say is basically the people who reviewed them think the movie is stupid.  Allright, i have to agree with them on that. But what i dont agree with is that they think stupid is a bad thing.  This funny part about this movie is how stupid it is.  Also, this movie is meant for younger people.  THIS IS NOT A MOVIE THAT IS GOOD FOR OLDER PEOPLE.  what i mean by that is that one of the key parts of being able to enjoy this movie is being young.  Overall i would say that this movie is one of the best movies ever and it is very funny so it deserves a 5.

0517591812|5|As the song goes &quot;Maybe It's Because I'm a Londoner that I think of Her Whereever I go&quot; that Edward Rutherford's book is so dear to me...I borrowed it from the library and now I have to buy it....what a wonderful  resource!  I lived on Regency Street right of Vauxhall Bridge Road as a  child and NEVER knew about the gardens that gave it it's name.  It reminded  me of when I left London, my grandfather took me to visit the Tower of  London just in case I never returned from America...we had lived in  Westminster all my life and took London for granted....Edward Rutherford,  thank you for a wonderful gift...of my hometown!!!
B000002GVO|4|Hotel California is one of the greatest albums of all time, and everybody all ready knows that so Im going to tell you why this is one of the greatest albums of all time, well in my openion anyways.<br />The title track, 'Hotel California' is one of the best songs of all time, and it has one of the top 10 guitar solos of all time as well. Hotel also has one of the greatest lyrics of all time, &quot;You may check out, but you can never leave!&quot; I mean how awesome is that!?!? 'New Kid In Town' is one of my favorite Eagles songs, so that also helps the album be one of the best. 'Life In The Fast lane' was the first Eagles song I ever heard and I sill think it has one of the est guitar riffs I have ever heard in my life! 'Wasted Time' is alright, its the only song Im not extremly fond of. 'Victim Of Love' is my favorite song off of Hotel California I just love the feel to it and the whole sound and tone of it. 'Pretty Little Maids All In A Row' and 'Try And Love Again' are both great ballads. 'The Last Resort' is a really good song and the perfect one to finish off the album.<br />Hotel California would be a five star album if it were not for 'Wasted time' being such a bad song. But you may like it and that may only be my openion but who knows. All I don know is this is a great album and if you dont have it buy now you need to get it.
1435248244|5|Uglies by Scott Westerfeld is a breath-taking science fiction novel that demonstrates a theme of friendship and adventure.<br /><br />Tally Youngblood lives in a futuristic world, where at sixteen years old, all citizens become extremely beautiful, party all night and live amazing lives. All of the society is convinced that before turning sixteen, everyone is ugly. Tally is an extremely mischievous \\"ugly\\" and can't wait until the day she becomes pretty. Until one night, when she meets a life-changing friend, Shay, who tells Tally secrets about their world, and introduces her to a whole new life, one that will change Tally forever....<br /><br />When reading this book, I would try to finish reading, but I could never put the book down. Although Tally lives in a completely different world, it is easy to relate to her. One thing I really liked about this book was how much adventure is in it. Tally goes on intense adventures, struggling through living in the wild by herself. She meets both frightening and friendly people who make huge impacts on her life.<br />I loved this book so much that I've read it over and over again and it still keeps me excited and entertained. This book provides loads of surprises and adventures that will keep you reading for hours.
B004APVI1G|5|So...I didn't really know this movie existed until I did some Blu-ray 3D research recently. It kept coming up as very highly rated on a bunch of sites. I found it cheaper somewhere else (rare), so I didn't buy it here - but I buy almost everything here, so I figured I'd review it here. :) Just watched this with my 7 1/2 year old son and we thought it was awesome. The story is well-written, the characters are adorable, and the 3D looks awesome. I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. I just purchased the prequel Guardians of Ga’Hoole book (2013) and the first book (2003) in the series by Kathryn Lasky - can't wait to read them! Did I mention this was awesome??? ;P
B0052OSTOS|5|I recommend it to others!<br />Very relaxing and I am at peace and my body and mind are stable. Try it and you love it.
B00CATSONE|5|I loved every page of this book from beginning to end. I think it is an inspirational story about the power of the human spirit. I will be having my 2 teenage sons read this as I never want to hear the words \\"I can't\\" again!
1439102724|3|Like so many other reviewers, I'm a big fan of Jodi Picoult's books.  But not this one.  I still think she's a good writer and I enjoy the way she unfolds the story, but there were many things about Sing You Home that left me less than enthusiastic.  It's got too many researched topics floating around for one thing, and Jodi is so intent on getting the details of her research in that the story suffers.  At times, I skimmed whole sections.  I couldn't relate to any of the characters either (and in a good novel with well developed characters I can relate to even horrible characters).  The story is preachy, and the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" aren't nuanced, more like caricatures than real people.  I was still thinking I'd give the book four stars until I reached the end.  It was a cheap, easy out, unbelievable and, (hope this isn't a spoiler)how the heck to people in a school system know nothing about a troubled student's family?  I was so angry at that one I wanted to throw the book.
B004ADH1RI|5|One of the best movies of all time.  &#34;Gonnies never say Die&#34;  Love it!

B0051ANPZQ|3|I really loved this book and I would tell you'd something about but I just don't want to ruin it. Also if anyone can answer this for me it would really help. Why when Justin is talking all the words are lower-cased? I mean isn't he supposed to be the smart kid like all the other smart kids at the so call &#34;nerds&#34; table that (Via's words, not mine!)? Well I just want to know why, it got me really upset. Well other than that, this book was great. I really loved it and it has a great theme of kindness.
B00005JNQA|4|Director Sydney Pollack creates a well-crafted thriller in his film, The Interpreter. Tapping into the global paranoia of a post 9/11 world, the story acts as both a standard political thriller and a rallying call for peace through better communication. The screenplay was written by Charles Randolph, Scott Frank, and Steven Zaillian.    When Silvia Broome, an interpreter for the United Nations, overhears a conversation concerning a plot to kill a controversial political leader from Africa, she is thrust into a dangerous world of international intrigue. When she reports what she's heard, no one believes her. When a government agent named Tobin Keller is assigned to uncover the validity of the potential threat, he at first disbelieves Silvia's story... until she herself becomes a target. Then Tobin, who recently lost his wife in an automobile accident, begins to bond with Silvia, who herself has a tragic past and is very familiar with loss. As it becomes clear that there really is a plot, Tobin and Silvia must rely on one another in order to find out who is behind the conspiracy. But the more that Tobin learns of Silvia's past the more apparent it becomes that it was no coincidence that she overheard the conversation to begin with. Is Silvia involved in the plot or was she targeted from the start? And can Tobin protect her from the many dangers that they now face?    The film stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as Tobin Keller. The supporting cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, and Curits l'Cook. Director Pollack also has an uncredited role as Chief Jay Pettigrew. The entire cast gives great performances, and Kidman, in particular, gives a powerful sense of loss and moral confusion.  While the film may not be Pollack's most impressive directorial effort, it is a remarkable written and acted film with some surprising twists. Unlike most thrillers of this kind, the two main characters never consummate their relationship in a sexual manner. Instead the screenplay allows Kidman and Penn to give subtle performances with nuance and believability. What makes The Interpreter so suspenseful is that we, as an audience, are given time to become emotionally invested in the characters as they are tested emotionally, physically, and morally.  Also adding to the believability of the film is the fact that many scenes were actually shot at the United Nations, which had never before allowed a commercial film to shoot within their walls. So in a way, Sydney Pollack has made movie history by earning permission to film there.    The DVD includes an alternate ending, deleted scenes, Sydney Pollack at Work: From Concept to Cutting Room featurette, Interpreting Pan & Scan vs. Widescreen featurette, The Ultimate Movie Set: The United Nations featurette, and an insightful audio commentary by Pollack.

B007PYEY9M|5|Awesome movie for the whole family, great way to show just how proud your parents can be.  Great movie all year round.
B001NLKT60|4|So glad I picked up this trilogy. My Cardiologist recommended this read to me. The first book caught my eye and it was no stopping from there on.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson has moved up my reading writers list for sure. So much suspense along with twist and turns that one has to continue reading.
B00942Y6WI|5|I laughed and cried.  Loved these characters and stories. Actors were superb.  A real story that opens my eyes about how 30 something whites treated people of color who they employed.  The horror of the lack of humanity between whites and blacks caught in this film which is not even the worst blacks have endured, reminded me of what we have done to cause such division. On the other hand, I am of a different generation and I do not nor have I ever espoused such differences between races. So when I see movies like this one, I am forced to see the truth in how we have treated one another due to white superiority complex.  We need more movies like these!  Bravo!

B000KKPN5C|5|I purchased this small flash five (5) years ago from my local camera shop.  At the time, I wasn't ready to make a huge purchase on a big speedlight and I found the SB-400 worked perfectly with my D40.  I used this flash exclusively for about two years until I purchased my big flash, the SB-600.  Since then, I've mainly used my SB-600 about 75% of the time and my SB-400 about 25%.  Personally, there were times when I needed a small amount of lighting and this small flash did a great job.<br /><br />I've recently found a great use for my SB-400.  I now use it on my D7000 when I have my 40mm micro lens attached.  This Spring, I've taken a lot of close up floral shots.  Using the SB-400 flash (along with my StoFen diffuser) enhances and brightens up the flowers considerably. The colors seem to pop out.<br /><br />I've been using two Sanyo Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries with this flash. BTW, great batteries to use in any flash!<br /><br />The SB-400 is a wonderful compact flash to use.  It's not a fancy flash and very simple to use.  It's light and portable when I don't feel like carrying around my heavy flash.<br /><br />I've used this flash both indoors and outdoors.  It works great as a fill-in flash to brighten dark areas or shadows.  I've been happy with the results.<br /><br />I guess the one thing that amazes me, it's not a harsh flash considering there are no buttons or settings to tweak.<br /><br />The price is so affordable I believe everyone should have this flash in their camera bag.<br /><br />**  Update 05/17/12  **<br /><br />I've uploaded three pictures (bumble bee, peony, and yellow azalea) in the gallery.  This shows how well this compact flash works with the 40mm micro lens.<br /><br />**  Update 05/27/12  **<br /><br />I recently purchased the Nikon Coolpix P7100.  I tried it out with my SB-400 flash and the end results were beautiful.  I've uploaded two pictures (blue hydrangea and white stewartia flower) to show the results of this winning combination.  I'm amazed how well this combination feels in my hand.
B004QXJZXA|5|Being an owner through the years of 3 previously available versions (Beta; LaserDisc; DVD) of this film, the primary question whenever a Blu-ray edition is announced of a catalog title produced 40 years ago, is whether the upgrade is worth investing in one more time.  All too often has been the case during the early adoption phase of any new format, the answer at best, is maybe.  Improved but due to the source materials and/or mastering methods used, perhaps not fully utilizing the capabilities available with the new technology during any expected learning curve.<br /><br />While my media center isn't what one would consider esoteric, it is for most purposes a capable and representative home theater environment for many featuring a 65\\" Panasonic plasma display (custom settings but not fully calibrated), Pioneer Elite A/V receiver outputting to a matched JBL 7.1 speaker system about a year technologically obsolete this date.<br /><br />Being a long time Porsche automotive enthusiast, a fan of both Steve McQueen and the 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race, I have certainly enjoyed multiple viewings of this film through the years and quite familiar with it both visually and sonically from beginning to end.  There are multiple reviews available on different websites so with rare exception, the comments I express here will be limited to my personal opinions of CBS/Paramount's effort with this new offering.<br /><br />Right on schedule, my new Blu-ray copies of Le Mans and Grand Prix arrived in the mail together as these two films were once again, \\"connected at the hip\\" as they have been through the decades.  For the less than $18 you can acquire this Blu-ray from Amazon during its initial release period, my title for this post says it all:  \\"Don't hesitate, it's Magnifique!\\"<br /><br />One expects an improved image on Blu-ray but I was stunned at how cinematically the final image was.  There is almost a perfect level of visual grain from beginning to end that creates what isso missing in many of today's CGI based motion pictures.  The look of film!  Special effects were all done in camera and look absolutely real in 1080P high definition.  The colors are rich and vibrant even considering the conditions the 1 million original feet of film was shot using now, 4 decade old techniques.  Flesh tones are spot on with Blacks deep and rich though there is occasional clipping during some of the night time scenes.  The Gulf Blue on the Porsches are dead accurate having seen the actual 917's at their namesake's museum in Zuffenhausen.<br /><br />The clarity in some shots are truly amazing in the level of detail shown and even exposing close ups (06:23) that were originally shot with the camera's zoom lens I suspect, unintentionally mis-set at its starting rack focus point.  What some have described as \\"soft.\\"  As many times as I have seen this film, the greatly enhanced picture (at times, video bandwidth indicating 30-33 mbs+ output) allowed me to see unexpectedly, background detail that had escaped notice during my many previous viewings such as the Black paint flaking off the right windshield pillar in Delaney's Porsche (24:21) or the exposed rivets/screws in same location on the Ferrari 512's (23:23).  Racecars are typically well worn devices and seeing detailing such as this adds greatly to the realism the film is attempting to create.<br /><br />I also noticed for the very first time, B&W portraits of both Michael Delaney (McQueen at 59.28) and his main rival driving for Ferrari in the story, Erich Stahler (Siegfried Rauch at 1:00:24) hanging on the walls (Michael to the right of the sliding entry door; Erich's to the left of where Michael sits with Lisa) of the cafeteria where McQueen has about as much dialog as there is in any one section of the entire film. If CBS/Paramount used compression, it was very slight and one never sees any halo edge effects.  They allowed the transfer to breathe and the visuals certain confirm that.<br /><br />As impressive as the visual transfer is short of a full frame by frame restoration which means there were occasional scratches in the final print though few and far between, the new lossless 7.1 audio mix is its equal.  The panning from one side of the room to the other (as well as rear to front) matching the cars going right to left on the screen was truly immersive during the driving sequences.  While I wasn't expecting my subwoofer to be exercised anywhere close to Tron:  Legacy, very pleasantly surprised whenever LFE was used.  For someone that used to clean out record grooves with liquids and brushes before playing to minimize background noise (ticks, pops) while maximizing available dynamic range, two sections of the film truly validates the life like audio free from recording hiss offered here even when sourced from older analog masters.  The first takes place at the start of the race from 25:54 when Michael closes the rear window in his 917 and one hears the rhythm of a beating heart increasing in rate until the flag is dropped to start the race (28:00).  The second is a repeat of this same sonic theme after the Ferrari 512 crashes off the race course with the driver attempting to escape the pending explosion (1:08:10-1:08:47).  With the noise floor so low, listen for the very subtle atmospherics throughout these and many other scenes which in a 7.1 system absolutely helps to create a sound field that has great width and depth completely enveloping the viewer. Consider it 3D for your ears and extremely effective.  Overall, for the era this film came from, CBS/Paramount did an excellent and highly effective remix.<br /><br />In the end, what most amazed me during my nearly two hours watching Le Mans again, was how completely and unexpectedly I had been pulled back into this racing spectacle during my viewing.  The clarity of an updated Blu-ray worthy transfer, a new 7.1 lossless soundtrack, the perceived shortcomings from a lack of any dialog beyond the PA announcer in the background all contributed to producing for me, Steve McQueen's vision for his film:  The physical and emotional experience of actually participating as a driver in the 24 Hours of Le Mans from the comfort of one's own neighborhood (home?) theater.  Isn't that ultimately, the intended purpose of every motion picture.
B00004SCX6|1|....The beat to the songs on \\"Oops! I Did It Again\\" are dreadfully identical to those on her first album &#8212; perhaps because she can only perform one dance and needs the same beat for her videos. There is so much technical audio, no one knows what Spears' voice truly sounds like. And what makes me the sickest is the \\"verbal\\" interruption she adds to her songs that are so fakely outrageous it is just disgusting!
B006PHD0RW|4|Good game.  Easy at first,  but gets very challenging as the levels get higher.  Plus there are different ways to play so you don't get too bored.
B00E1HIX02|5|good entertainment for a cheap price
B00092ZMDY|5|To be honest, I wasn't looking to buy this.  I've never been a huge Eagles fan.  In fact, the reason I own Hell Freezes Over is because when I bought my DVD player it was one of the few high quality concert DVDs available.  It was impressive, both in sound and performance, and definitely gave me a new appreciation for the band. <br /> <br />But, as I said, I still wasn't looking to buy this DVD.  I just happened upon it at Wal-Mart, and it was just too good of a buy to pass up (under 10 bucks), WITH a bonus CD!  So I bit.  I was a bit skeptical, because let's face it, those vocal parts are pretty high and those voices are now pushing 60 years of age. I've heard many ageing rockers that just can't get up there anymore. <br /> <br />All in all, this is a wonderful concert.  It's 2 1/2 hours long, it's well recorded, both sound and picture wise, and the 5.1 surround is actually utilized much better than Hell Freezes Over was.   <br /> <br />Does this mean that this concert DVD is better than HFO?  In a word, no.  First, I think the excitement of the '94 reunion rubbed off on both the audience and the performers.  Secondly, I think the sound is warmer on HFO, as that was recorded under almost studio like conditions.  And even though Felder's replacement is a pro, and no doubt a more versatile and accomplished guitarist than Felder, I still miss his presence.  He was a full-fledged band member, and a sideman, no matter how talented, is still a sideman.  Also, even though the vocals on this DVD were still OK, I think that they've all lost a bit of their vocal power and range, with the possible exception of Joe Walsh.  They can still hit the notes, but not with the power and quality that they displayed on Hell Freezes Over.  Also, at least three of the backing musicians sing along with almost all the backing vocal parts.  On HFO, it was all Eagles and nothing BUT Eagles singing. <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong here.  I am not criticizing this release.  It's top-notch,and I think it's admirable that they do as well as they do, considering their age and the fact that most singers of their vintage could not pull it off with the panache that they do.  It's just that they ARE showing their age, particularly with the vocals.  It's subtle, but when you listen to the songs that are common to both the HFO and Farewell Concert 1 back to back, it is noticable. <br /> <br />So enjoy 'em while you can, I say.  These guys are consumate professionals, and I'm sure that when they can't cut it anymore, they will not comprimise their show or their name, even for boatloads of money.  This is a great concert by a great band.

B00G6HO3OA|5|We watched the DVD Special Edition version many times which continues without interruption to the end of the disk.  The blue ray copy shows the credits between each original TV episode while the DVD shows the story without credits or breaks.  The breaks are annoying, not sure why this was done.  Also this version has about 5 previews of other movies on each disk.  This was another unfortunate decision.    Still a beautiful story.  The images are clear and the sound very good.    You should purchase the Pride and Prejudice Special Edition version which is now available in blue ray.  Stay away from the Keepsake Edition

B000OIZUW6|5|Follett never disappoints! As always, the characters are totally believable and engaging.  Some you will like, others you will appropriately, dislike. Follett can bring you back into the WWII years and make you feel as if you were there. In the book, the Jackdaws were brave and amazing women who were assigned an almost impossible task directly connected with D-Day success. There is suspense, intrigue, horror, honor, and love as the story unfolds. As always with a Follett book, I hated to come to the end of the story and bid the Jackdaws farewell. The only cure for this is  to order another Follett book.....which I did, immediately!

0385353308|5|Jeevan is watching a performance of King Lear at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto when the lead actor, Arthur Leander, collapses on stage. While Arthur's untimely departure is not directly related to the Georgia Flu that will soon spread across the globe and leave devastation in its wake, it does symbolise the beginning of a global collapse.<br /><br />Not to mention that the characters the reader becomes acquainted with in the decades that follow are in a way connected to Arthur. There is Jeevan, the man who tries to revive Arthur when he collapses and knows the actor through his previous jobs as a paparazzo and entertainment journalist; a young actress by the name of Kirsten, who was on stage during the King Lear performance; Arthur's ex-wife Miranda, who is stuck half-way across the globe when disaster strikes; and the mysterious prophet.<br /><br />I am not entirely sure where to start with my review, because this book was all sorts of amazing and I fear that anything I say will result in gibberish gushing rather than doing the novel justice and convey just how good it was. It was a thrilling and surprisingly enchanting story, which pulled me in so intensely that I simultaneously couldn't stop reading and didn't want to finish it, as anything I would read after would just pale in comparison.<br /><br />As with many post-apocalyptic stories there was the disturbing message of what the world is diminished to when the majority of the population is wiped out in the blink of an eye; leaving those that remain with a form of liberation that is no longer hampered by the status quo. While humanity showed its most horrifying side in the initial aftermath, eventually the need to return to some form of civilisation emerged as an elementary part of survival. That doesn't mean that everyone has the greater good in mind though, which became particular evident when the sinister prophet made an appearance.<br /><br />While this was certainly not the first novel entailing the aftermath of a pandemic and the devastating affects on civilisation, to me Station Eleven felt refreshing because of the clever and almost magical way author Emily St. John Mandel connected the years before and after the collapse as well as her very different main characters. And with fascinating concepts such as The Traveling Symphony and The Museum of Civilization, we could almost have been transported to a fantastical world, rather than twenty years down the line from where we are now.<br /><br />What also made this such a unique novel was the way the Shakespearean works run like a thread throughout. From the very first chapter where the reader enters the world of Station Eleven during a performance of King Lear, to the Traveling Symphony bringing the Bard's legendary words to the small gatherings of people scattered across their route in the decades that follow. The theatrically added an almost otherworldly quality to the already beautiful and almost poetic language used within the novel.<br /><br />Both highly imaginative and achingly realistic, I was drawn into the world of Station Eleven from the very first page. The novel was completely enthralling and unputdownable, making it without a doubt the best book I've read this year.

B001ANSS5K|3|It was a classic John Green novel, teenage turmoil and coming of age type story. Not to my particular fancy however.
B000UX6THK|5|I was a little late to catch Twin Peaks on TV, I remembering seeing a couple of episodes and not understanding what was going one.  It's not just age; in a series such as this you can't just drop in halfway and expect to understand it all.    The series begins with the building of the characters and establishment of the town.  I had watched a second hand copy of my old college roommate's on video, so I had watched the show all the way through.  What I didn't get to appreciate is the beautiful Cinematography and complex yet patterned Sound Design that this show boasts.  This show is a film that was made into a series, meaning that David Lynch and the other creators of the show brought in Film standards when making this show, they got good actors, established dialog, shot on film and most importantly shot on location.  It makes all the difference.  Since I now live in Seattle, not too far from the actual location this show was shot at. And this show is able to capture that northwest feel, that's unique to the mountains and valleys of the area.  Something that so many shows would have ignored as they shot in a studio (ie; Grey's Anatomy).    The restoration of the film negative brought to the DVD it beautiful, the remixing to digital audio does the show justice, the first couple of episodes I was wondering why I was hearing a faint whistle blow of a factory every 5 mins.  Listen for it; it becomes a constant and comforting audio motif as you get sucked into this bizarre town.    I definitely recommend this show and the set to anyone who wants a challenging, insightful and thoughtful murder/mystery that far exceeds the drivel on TV today.  It's a rare triumph of a film director that wanted to try his skill in a different medium.  Though let's just hope Michael Bay doesn't make a cop show or we're in trouble.

It truly sparked an interest in philosophy (which is a subject I was forced to put aside many years ago now).

0393061310|3|His contention that geography is a major determinant in human societies is quite interesting and relevant, but on the other hand I think he overstates his case.  He also repeats his arguments, and repeats them, and repeats them again.  So much so that I could not finish it because it had gotten so boring.  I think he could've shortened the book to roughly 1/3 its current length (where were the editors??)  There are many arguments that could considerably water down Diamond's, many of which are contained in the online reviews.  I will add a few more.  For instance, his case that most of the easily domesticable grains are contained in the fertile crescent.  Is this because the wild versions are truly more edible, or because they have been hybridized with the domestic varieties?  He doesn't elaborate enough on the genetics research for one to make a judgement.  He also states that there are no large domesticable animals in N. America.  What about caribou?  A very closely related species, the reindeer, (Wikipedia claims that they are the same) has been domesticated in Europe.  It is also quite probable that the bison could also have been domesticated, and they were probably well on their way to being so when the white man showed up.  Personally, I think that the white race IS different, and not necessarily in a good way.  He doesn't mention anything about what has been lost in the bargain.  When I first heard about the Dreaming, I knew exactly what it was and what it meant.  I also realize, that as a modern, white Westerner, I no longer have access to this state of mind.  To quote Neil Young: \\"They give you this, but you pay for that...\\"  Perhaps some cultures refused to \\"progress\\" because they knew what they would have to give up in return.
B006ISG9XA|5|I really appreciate all of the footnotes. They are very helpful and informative! A library copy was not as helpful, so I appreciate my Kindle purchase of it.
B004MC8CA2|5|This bible app is the best available for all ages! It includes every version available with audio feedback (on most sections, some includes all sections with audio). Great plans for anyone. Recent updates aren't my cup o' tea with advertisements and plans made by third parties but it's overall an excellent choice!
B000AJIF4E|4|Great sound quality and a great price...just wished it blocked out external sound better.
B0012NO4WO|5|Sandra Bullock makes you believe that she is really driving that bus and Reeves makes the detective come alive. I love those two together.
B007IXWL2C|4|But this is one of the most talked-about books of the twenty-first century! This was the one that really hooked me, more so than the others in the series (although I did buy them, too!)<br /><br />Like crack...you just can't stop!
B00CATSONE|5|Really informative and enjoyable quick read about an amazing man. This is not an in depth biography but a nice surface look into a fascinating man and life. Worthwhile.
B009RI4FRU|5|Excellent, quirky film with a lot of heart.
B00BU1DH1M|4|Enjoyable read as always from Rankin. He continues to allow Rebus to be the cantankerous, old-school cop at odds with the new PC (pun intended) policing. However, Rebus wins out at the end. Great imagery of Edinburgh, taking me back to days spent there.<br />Seasoned Rebus readers know what to expect - and won't be disappointed.
B00L7DMHBY|5|Love it
B003XF1XOQ|5|As with the previous two, I had to force myself to stop reading in order to eat, etc. I was taken by surprise the twists that I never saw coming. I also know that I will reread them because I was in too much of a hurry to find out what happened next.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see the film adaptations. As with the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies, liberties will be taken in order for the movie to produce the same reaction while one watches it, as the books do while reading them.
B0002DB52M|5|Very rarely do I see a film that I really feel challenged by, but \\"Dogville\\" just blew me away. I just can't get it out of my head. There's nothing trite or easily digestable in this disturbing, provocative, brilliant and powerful film. I'll admit: this isn't an easy film to watch. It's very long, it's shot like theatre without realistic sets, and it's not a feel-good film. When you can see yourself in the horrible, repugnant citizens of Dogville, then you know you've fallen right into the director's trap. Is it a critique of America? Possibly. But I just saw it as the biggest indictment on human nature I've ever seen on film.
B00FATEJYE|4|Pros:<br />- Good graphic.<br />- Fun and simple to play.<br />- Loads of characters.<br />- Character's unique passives are interesting.<br />- Grinding is OK, pretty free to play.<br />- Super moves (especially 3-meter) are flashy as hell, and required different mechanics (swipe, taps, aims,...)<br />- Nice and rewarding challenges.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Energy required for later battles is pretty high.<br />- Some fighters/team comps are super broken.<br />- Bronze and Silver characters are not useful late game at all, so if you're a Flash or Lantern fan... sorry.<br />- The fighting system is somewhat shallow, you only have Attack, Strong Attack, Block and Meters.

B00R3DOCJM|5|Great ending to the Hobbit trilogy series. !
B00BWYFTNG|5|Ever since I started collecting The Walking Dead figures, I've been kicking myself for not grabbing Daryl when he was first released. Like seriously, he was everywhere I turned and I just wasn't that interested. Then I started picking up Series 2 of the TV show and was like \\"man, I wish I had a Daryl figure.\\" Well if you're like me, then you're in luck with this two-pack. It's literally the same figure. All the same accessories and all that. Plus you get a variant version of Merle (the paint job on the original Merle from Series 3 is better, in my opinion. But this one isn't bad either). If you just have to have a Daryl figure then grab this ASAP. Don't spend $200+ on the Series 1 figure, unless you're a die-hard fan and just have to have it mint in box, but this one will do just fine.<br /><br />On to the figures themselves: Their range of motion is limited, while the figures started getting better in Series 3, they're still not great. You can get them into some cool action poses, but not many. Daryl is sort of built just to hold the crossbow, no that you'll want to pose him any other way. As I mentioned above, Merle's paint job isn't as great as his first figure, but still comes across looking like the character. Daryl's is not as a spot on in likeness, but still a good job. You can look at him and tell who it's supposed to be. McFarlane has certainly stepped up their game these last couple years.<br /><br />Accessory wise, Daryl wins. He comes with his crossbow, knife, axe, pick-axe and new to the figure: prison keys. Merle just comes with the standard handgun, knife and AK-rifle.<br /><br />These two a certainly a must have for TWD fans!<br /><br />Side note: A new Daryl figure is coming out as well in March 2014 based off his Season 3 attire and includes his bike. Just food for thought.
B002PJN59M|5|Great adaptation of the king Arthur story. Good actors and a little Merlin action too. Saw this quite a while ago and was really happy to see it available. Recommend.
B00005JMJG|5|Seriously one of the best movies ever.<br />Concept is mind blowing, Jim Carrey nails it, and you don't expect him to be remotely funny. He is lost in this character who id desperate and you can feel his heart, his sorrow, and his desire... and have we all not felt so hopeless with a fall out of love?<br />So relatable. Overall amazing. Great acting. Great concept. Great imagery.
B0032UYFA6|5|We REALLY love the show!! We didn't watch any of it 'live', but waited until we had a couple of seasons on DVD and binge watched every weekend.<br />The writing is terrific and the acting is even better. We have S5 V2 left to watch and we are going through withdrawals!
B00881VLCE|4|I really enjoy this app. Removes a lot of the frustration and space of regular puzzles and no lost pieces. Wish it loaded more quickly and that navigation from a completed puzzle to one's next choices was smother.

B00AF6MF9I|4|This is a fun game and is kinda like a military Sims but much better. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but is fun once you learn how to play and how the game works.
B00006AW2J|5|This is an amazing cd and one of the best ever made.  Of course we are talking about the beginning of the Stones' golden period here.  Beggars, its follow-up Let it Be, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main St. are all five-star albums and easily some of the best rock n' roll ever made.  Beggars is second only to Exile, which in my opinion is the greatest rock album ever made, hands down.  It's also my favorite cd.  Beggars comes close though.  Kickin' off with Sympathy for the Devil, which has a stinging guitar solo from Keith Richards and really isn't that sacriligious (as most people claim).  It's actually a good example of Mick Jagger's intelligence, something which he hid quite well.  It goes into one of the prettiest songs they ever cut, No Expectations.  I love the slide guitar on it.  Some other good songs off this cd are the seminal Street Fighting Man and Stray Cat Blues (which foreshadows the route into sleaze the Stones would take later).  Prodigal Son is a great blues cover (one of the many they did) and Factory Girl is just amazing.  \\"Appalachian\\" with an African drum beat.  Then it ends with one of the greatest closing songs ever, Salt of the Earth (it ranks only behind You Can't Always Get What You Want in the Stones catalogue).  Beggars is a sort of bridge between their earlier and later material.  Excellent cd...
0871137380|5|The investigator journalist Mark Bowden has wrote the one of the most realistic books that I have ever read. All the details of the rangers that fought defending the so called D-boys(Delta Force or Team) to capture Lt. of the warlord. The operation went wrong at some point. If I were you, I would order this book right now. You wont regret it, honestly.<BR>The book does not only talk about the fight, it talks about the background of the soldiers and the people that were there.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Just started playing this game, but it seems pretty cool. I haven't had any problems with it so which is good.
0385341008|5|I loved reading this novel and could hardly put it down.  It seems so real that if I did not know better, I would think that it was an actual, true story.  The story is interesting and rather poignant for those of us who still remember World War II.  Moreover, it is well written, fast moving, and with some exciting and surprising moments.
B000JML7EC|5|Good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good great not bid or bad
0062059971|4|really good and fun book.  Definitely worth the read and oh so fun.  I was amazed at how interested I was in this story.  It was all about love, but had some pretty interesting twists and turns.  I thought the story was over by the first book, but after reading all three was thoroughly impressed at how she weaved a tale...very fun and light reading.  The ending (of the whole series) was great.

B000LAZDQA|4|Shortbus (2006) written/directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) is truly not for the easily offended. It is the film like nothing I've seen before and I've seen many films. It should be named Real Sex and the City or Every Thing You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask had not the latter title been taken already by Woody Allen. Actually you don't have to ask anything - you will get more information and graphic answers that you ever would hope for. This is the film where the graphical sex scenes are in abundance, they are extremely explicit. John Cameron Mitchell means business, and he gets down to it. By his own words,<br /><br />\\"In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like Hitchcock had metaphors for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you a lot about who they are. Some people ask me, \\"couldn't you have told the same story without the explicitness?\\" They don't ask whether I could've done Hedwig without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the paint box?\\" John Cameron Mitchell<br /><br />But after the initial shock, you realize that there are ideas, feelings, the attempt to understand the important things - what do we want? What is sex for us? How to understand ourselves first of all, how to communicate your desires, how to fulfill them? Shortbus is totally honest; it does care about its characters, and tells their stories of struggling with all sorts of existential difficulties, sexual or not, without condescending, with the equal dozes of sweetness, wit, and understanding. The film was made by a talented filmmaker. The beginning scenes would certainly grab your attention while introducing a viewer to few New Yorkers whose lives will be intertwined later. The music score and the songs are nice and set a melancholic mood, they provide a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus. The cast that consists mainly of non-professional first time performers, did a convincing job. It is not porn, it is an independent dramedy that uses sex scenes to answer many questions about life.<br /><br />The DVD includes the documentary Gifted and Challenged: The Making of 'Shortbus'. I found the Making... quite interesting and a lot of fun.<br /><br />3.5-4/5a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus.

B00BM1AJIO|5|This is a great game with beautiful graphics. I enjoyed it and there is a lot of game time. You go to several different sites and accomplish goals to solve this point and click game. I would recommend to anyone that enjoys these types of play. There are ho but it's part of the solving. It's been a while since I've played it but I did enjoy it. Good luck and happy gaming.
B006MW3UZW|5|Very good series
B00N35P5MW|5|Recommended ...
B004ZMWUCU|5|well developed characters that you cannot help but really care about! I loved this book, the story was sweet with some heartbreaking early history.I was travelling thru ireland as I read it, and the whole book really resonated with truth,<br />lovely!
B0058VW36U|5|this is the cutest thing ever! I can't stop raving! Om Non stole my heart from the first level. I love it!!!!!
B00BOA9MVI|5|Brilliant account of two airmen from different backgrounds, whose lives cross in one great but terrifying moment in the later stages of the Second World War
B0013D8LCW|2|sometimes just the fact, that is a gay movie, I dont know why , people deciode to rated too good to be truth, this is a low budget, and low imagination, if You wanto to see it , rented it.
B00FB13Y74|4|I'm sure that you would like this one. It's a great deal of fun. I love the fun interactions with the game. But remember this. Upgrade your car's. Then fly by the rest of your competitors. Lol
B005M5OSBK|5|Classic and perfect for my first Pink Martini purchase. Was referred to them from a friend. P.S. See them live - incredible!
B0050PYNN0|5|Funny
B00005JLEU|5|This is another favorite of mine of the Miyazaki films. It's a 'growing up' sort of story where a somewhat bratty girl learns about hard work, fear, loyalty, and love. I really liked all the different characters and the overall story in this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3|I chose this rating because I don't think it is right to hurt other people for pleasure. I was hoping to find out what caused his eating disorder and if she would have the courage to walk away.
1616550414|5|great book
B003DZX3SA|5|one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to tickle me as I watch it again and again
B000HA4WTI|5|This movie was Great!  The Drifting was GREAT.  I like this over the 2 fast 2 furious but i would say fast and the furious 3 and the fast and the furious was a good movie I would buy them both again..A+++++++
B009XIXVU6|5|A patchwork quilt of humanity each with their own private trial and trouble.  Beautifully told and poignantly written - you will not want each leg of the story to end, but find new sorrow and joy in the next story.  A story of being lost and found and a story about family.  I recommend this story highly.
B00992CF6W|5|I LUV IT!! the only prob is that idk how to blow up tnt... other than that its super funnn!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5|The beautiful and dramatic portrayal of life in the early 20th century England is both fascinating and compelling.  This season focuses a considerable amount on World War I, so it has a stark sense both in the characters experiences and, oftentimes setting.  Even Downton Abbey the home adapts; its character and those inside its walls have been altered.  The final episode in its final minutes takes place outside the home, snow falls, blanketing the surroundings in a clean white canopy.  The symbolism and enduring sense of hope and love in the final scene make the show and its characters my favorite of all the Downton Abbey season episodes.
B0031RDUX8|3|A lot of action and cool story, but the writing wasn't good enough for more than 3 stars
B00FKF0F3C|5|I really enjoyed all of the books in The Century Trilogy. I was alive for most of the events in this book. My only criticism of the book is even with the frank way JFK's adultery is addressed the author is overly harsh on  Republican politicians. That is absolutely his right but to take Bush 1 and Reagon to task with no mention of Carter's incompetence and to end with a glowing tribute to the promise of the Obama presidency, which had to be written far enough into his first term to know how ineffective he is, seems very one sided. Still a very good read and a reminder of why you shouldn't read historical fiction counting on the facts.
1400052181|5|A textbook used by my son at school.<br />A very historic and needed tale for growing and grown citizens to read and be aware of.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Great reading great story line and mystery.This could very well be a true story.unfortunately  this is what happened in American and is apart of our history. It shows how some people became rich at the expense of others. It saddens my heart to think of the suffering the African-Americans endured.
B00PTB7B34|5|An awesome game to sit and play while I lay in bed
0762451319|3|Bought it as a Christmas gift for a friend who is a fan of the book series. The contents were sort of tacky, and lacking in quality. Felt like I paid too much for such cheap stuff

B0067LXQAW|5|awsume music and thank you the disc was in perfect shape no scatches thank you very muck and the price was good too
B00008LOS1|5|Wow, I have heard some negative reviews of this 2 disc release.<BR>No one is holding a gun to your head to buy it.<BR>Even though i own the remastered one disc version of Who's Next,i decided i had to have this Deluxe Version.<BR>One of the timeless great albums of the 70's. How could anyone not give Who's next anything less then a five star review. If your mad because you have to buy this version of Who's next then don't give your opinion of a review. Let us review the music on these discs and not silly soapbox complaining. This release is for serious Who fans who need great stuff like this on cd.<BR>The whole second disc makes it hard to pass up on the Deluxe Version of Who's Next. Even the first Cd is a little different then the 1 Disc version of Who's Next. This is a beautiful collection of Who songs. If band's made music like this nowadays i wouldn't be looking into buying music from the 70's. Today there is so much junk musak and pop that listening to the Who is a breathe of fresh air and a joy. Look past complaining about the Deluxe Version and just pick it up and listen to it. It's great music and i think some fans have lost site of that. One of the classic albums of the early 70's and it sounds better then ever.
B000065U1N|5|In one word, this movie is Stunning. It doesn't glamorize war or portray it in anyway to be anything but terrifying, bad and horrible. I do reccomend that you read the book as well though as it gives you alot of background information about the situation and individuals. The acting is great, the camera work is terrific the sound is crystal clear and the picture is very sharp. This movie is very well made and deserves all the praise it gets. You shouldn't think of this movie as an action movie to which you say \\"Cool!\\" to when watching it because that's not the kind of movie it was made to be. It shows how heroic every single one of those soldiers who fought on October 3rd and 4th, 1993 were. Soldiers like Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon who were willing to die trying to save Mike Durant and his crew must not be forgotten.
B009VB9VKY|1|this movie was more hype than action, very slow in some parts and lacked story line. it was gambling on showing some male parts to desperate women willing to pay for it
B00AKKTDJY|1|Never had problems until recently. Once I purchased the whole game, when playing it freezes in mid play and when trying to launch game it says &amp;#34;unfortunately the game had stopped. I've reinstalled and still the same thing. Now what???????
B00J2PRBNS|5|So good!!<br />Amy Adams is AMazing!!!!<br />Everyone is really, but She just stood out.<br />The costumes are great as well.
B00AQMSJI2|5|My son LOVES this game. It is very simple in nature and great for those moments when they need to be detracted for a few moments but can quit at any time, I use this at the Dr all the time.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|It is a fun game to play and to look at. Sweet characters, challenging levels as you progress.<br />Recommend it for all ages
B000V6BE6C|5|I love this band and all there songs!
B0000CEB4V|5|A moving, spiritual event honoring the memory of George Harrison, featuring friends and musicians who worked with George throughout his career.  Also, the first onstage appearance of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr together since the breakup of the Beatles.  &quot;*****&quot;  <br />By the way, Sam Brown is the woman singing lead on &quot;Horse to Water&quot;
B004KPX4W2|4|I missed this film when it came out. Didn't even know it existed. It has a stellar cast and they all great job. I just saw that RED 2 is out. I won't miss that one.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Epic! Brandon you brilliant bastard. Love the complexity and slow reveal. It is grandly entertaining to be able to see characters grow and develop. Thank you.
B009IJJ5B4|5|Elementary review  Excellent acting and good story line. Johnny lee miller is my favorite sherlock. Lucy very good also. Will there be romance between the two?
B002VPE1WK|5|Fantistic value!  Outperforms much more expensive bags.  Have had many compliments from other phtotogs who are packing much more expensive stuff!
B0029LHW4U|2|This is much more like AIC's later stuff than their first 2 CD's.  Too bad, because the writing could have been a lot better.  It's not the absence of Layne Staley that makes this a disappointment, but rather the poor to average quality of the songs.
B006IYG5HE|1|I bought this book after reading a newspaper review that stated Harry Hole was similar to Harry Bosch.  Apparently this reviewer has never read a Michael Connelly book.  The story did not flow easily and I finally abandoned the book, chalking up the experience as another poor decision to try a reviewer's recommendation.  I will stick to my favorite tried-and-true writers.
B00BD99JMW|3|Not a fun read..  Wish I would have stopped at Insurgent.  Be prepared for a sad ending.  I thought it might happen, but hoped it wouldn't.  Left me feeling like I just watched a documentary on children with cancer.
B003Y3ZTGA|5|This album is really great! Katy Perry is a talented song writer. This album has great songs to dance to and songs to inspire and songs for break ups. I truly enjoyed the whole album
B00EEDJHXA|5|Game is amazing! There are a ton of levels that will keep you playing for a long time. Very easy to understand how to play.
B007GNMJYE|5|Excellent quality.
B00BD99JMW|5|LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY DID TRIS HAVE TO DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But seriously great book and I can't wait to see what Veronica comes up with next
B002KDUDG6|5|I really love Michael Buble's music. He is so creative in this CD especially.  There is jazz, very upbeat easy listening music, and tons of enjoyable music.  All I want to say is WOW- what a fantastic and enjoyable CD.
B002KSPKRS|4|This is my first set of wireless cans for the Xbox. The simulated surround works really well, they do a great job on positioning and are comfortable for multiple hours of use. The wireless has yet to present any issues with my Xbox's wifi and the chat function worked flawlessly.    Setup was easy, less than 15 seconds honestly. The headphones have a nice and simple set of controls built on them and battery life has been good so far, 2 AAAs and Ive put at least 8-9 hours on them so far.

B00005JKED|5|At first glance this movie can be cast aside as another decent Washington flick, but if one chooses to take the time to think about this movie, it becomes the best motion picture of the year.<br />This story takes place of the course of one day, and during this day we see the plateaus the police must reach and depths that the police must sink to in order to keep our streets safe. It is a brilliant movie portraying the king of the undercover world falling from his throne.<br />As for the acting, Denzel Washington was very strong. His intensity was believable and he radiated enough for all others to work off of. Eathan Hawke, although not his best performance, still was very strong and was key to the movie. He and Denzel worked well together and no other actors could have performed as well as they have.<br />The reality of the flick is unparalleled. It is filmed on location and the extras are from the areas; one could not ask for more.<br />Overall, this movie was excellent. It shows a fall from grace and the tough decision a rookie must make. No other movie has done it before and it wouold be an unsurmountable challenge to out-do this one.
0679805273|5|I have a new baby girl coming in September and a new grandson born 6 weeks ago.  My son brought the baby into my room to spend some time with me and I read him this book (I bought it to read to my little girl when she arrives).  My grandson absolutely loved it.  He's very alert for his age and he was looking at the pictures and smiling while I read aloud to him.  Every child born into this family will read and be read this book, it is wonderfully written and FUN to read to babies.  When they start reading I'm sure this will be one of their first.<br /><br />I also have bought [[ASIN:0679885722 Oh, Baby, the Places You'll Go! (Life Favors(TM))]]--it is equally wonderful and is written to be read to a baby in the womb.  I grew up on Dr. Suess and my children will treasure his works just as I have and still do.

B008XX6J4C|5|I bought a cd for our family and two as gifts for this holiday season.  My 10 year old (cello player) listens to it all the time in the truck on the way to school and I love the twist on these already great songs.  Amazing cd. Thanks piano guys!!

B000KQGP2G|2|I've reviewed three other Pain of Salvation albums here. All rather highly rated. All turned out to be obnoxiously long reviews because I couldn't stop myself from writing until I had every little detail that made those albums so great down on paper. One has been dubbed my favorite album of all time. I generally hold Pain of Salvation in the absolute highest tier of not just great progressive metal, but godly music in general. I view Daniel Gildenlow as one of the most talented and powerful individuals in the business. I even managed to enjoy the musical ambiguity and lyrical labyrinth that was BE. In short, I pretty much unconditionally love this band like a typical naive fanboy.    That being said, Pain of Salvation have managed to release an album that I completely despise with every fiber of my being. I didn't just get this album yesterday, either. I've had it for around two years, which is generally more than enough time for me to \\"understand\\" an album that I dislike at first - assuming there's anything in it worth understanding to begin with. No such luck here.    This band has always been very good at a few critical things - taking an idea or a concept, building a tangible framework around that concept, crafting a world to house that framework, and then developing an intricate and empathic musical journey through that world wherein both the lyrics *and* the music express the nuances of the original concept. One is incomplete without the other. As such, their music has never really been a vessel for the instrumental masturbation that you typically find in progressive metal. Rather, they utilize their instruments as a medium for the listener to lose themselves in the world that has been presented. This approach has produced a number of stellar albums, and some albums that were pretty strange but, at the end of the day, still captivating. One in particular seems overly relevant -     Since Scarsick is the direct followup to The Perfect Element I, I feel that I should mention a few things about that album. The Perfect Element I is basically about a boy (He) and a girl (She) living in a fictional place known as Idioglossia. As the characters grow up together, they each have vital things missing in their lives which leave empty spaces in their wake, and the characters consequently choose to fill these empty spaces in rather depraved and jarring ways while trying to survive in the dreary backside of society. The album encompasses a large number of complex and interrelated themes, including childhood, adolescence, violence, sexuality, tragedy, loss, the human mind and soul, the individual and the society in which he exists, emotional extremes, and more. The album eventually comes to a conclusion with a focus on the male counterpart, He, as his society shuns him, burns the spark of life out of him, and drains all will out of his soul. The lyricism on The Perfect Element I is incredibly dark and distraught, but also very poetic and intelligent. The way the lyrics are delivered gives the listener insight into what the characters are feeling and the trials which they are being pushed through. The music behind the words admirably enhances the vocal delivery. Overall, the album is incredibly moving and largely convincing.    Fast forward to Scarsick. The album is a continuation of the story introduced on The Perfect Element I, but the focus has shifted entirely to He after his destructive falling out with society. Now, remember what I said about Pain of Salvation being really good at taking a concept and developing an encompassing lyrical and musical framework around it? Apparently, the male protagonist from TPE is now very bitter and completely pissed off at everything, and Pain of Salvation *really* want you to know that. No longer do we have the wide range of themes that were found on TPE. Here, there's pretty much one theme - \\"I'M ANGRY AND CYNICAL AND I HATE EVERYTHING.\\" Now, from a conceptual perspective I can completely understand the basic approach that the band has taken. We have this utterly wrecked character who has been gradually transformed into a sardonic prick, and as usual the lyrics and the music are going to as closely as possible reflect the things that this character is feeling. The only problem this time around is that the things that this character is feeling apparently translate into really horrible music and embarrassingly pathetic lyrics. A great concept is a great concept and a great story is a great story, but if your delivery is unlistenable, then you have an issue.    The other problem is that while the themes and ideas on TPE were genuinely interesting and abstract, the stuff on Scarsick comes way too close to being a vessel for Daniel's personal views on Western civilization. It's not exactly a big secret that Daniel doesn't like the United States government very much. At one point he even refused to go on a tour in the US because he didn't want to submit to the US government's finger printing requirements for foreign visitors. So here we have the song \\"America\\". Not only is the music itself beyond irritating with its bouncy rhythms and poppy melodies (for an example of how to do this in a slightly less retarded fashion, look back to the Entropia album and the song \\"Stress\\"), but the lyrics are typical anti-war, anti-government, anti-capitalism stuff - and they're more banal than interesting.    To further exacerbate the lyrical tragedy, you have songs like \\"Cribcaged\\" where Daniel includes the f-bomb in something like 16 or 17 consecutive vocal lines, denouncing everything from home designers and strip poles to million dollar kitchens and Al Pacino posters. F this. F that. And that. Oh, and that too. And those dozen things over there also. Come on. Seriously? I mean, to be honest, I can probably agree with some of the ideas that he's trying to get across there - although some of the subjects he targets are laughable - but the way he does it is completely juvenile. I'd understand if the song was a joke, but I'm pretty sure he's being completely serious. Sad. Furthermore, with songs like this and \\"America\\", it can be difficult to tell if the thoughts are those of the male character from TPE or those of Daniel himself. This, at least for me, interferes with the mood and immersion that made TPE such an incredible album and is one of the major reasons why this album is a disappointment to me as The Perfect Element part 2.    There are some other gems. On \\"Spitfall\\", Daniel seemingly found it necessary to formulate an ironically rapped song that cuts down the mainstream rap artists that are dominating the American airwaves. I found the lyrics fairly amusing, but not so much in a \\"Hey, this is really good\\" way. More in a \\"Wow, is Daniel really singing this?\\" sort of way. Musically, this song - as well as the preceding title track - is somewhat reminiscent of Candiria, with the exception that Candiria is actually good at making this sort of music, while Pain of Salvation completely suck at it.    \\"Disco Queen\\" is just bad. I'm sorry, but mixing straight disco and metal isn't new or exciting. Other bands have done this kind of thing, and it's dumb. That is probably the reason why this appears to be new and exciting - nobody does it anymore because of how utterly dumb it is. The closing track, \\"Enter Rain\\", is pathetic as a closing track. Ten minutes of boredom. Coming from a closing a track as awesome as \\"The Perfect Element\\", \\"Enter Rain\\" doesn't even qualify as a proper climax. Some of the other tracks are okay. \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\" has some cool rhythms and is a decent song all around. \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is pretty good musically, but has more of that trite lyricism about how everything in America is for sale. Meh.    All in all, I just can't find much to like on this album. It's missing the flow, the conviction, the power, and the pure pathos of everything that this band has put out prior. Much like the fictional character that Scarsick is meant to represent, you could say that this album is a burning wreck. I guess, in some way, I can give credit to the band for making that thematic connection (if that was even their intent), but it came at a severe cost. I doubt I would ever recommend this album to anybody who has not heard Pain of Salvation before, because the very things that have defined Pain of Salvation as a standout band over the last decade are grossly understated here. Or altogether missing.    Hopefully this was a one-off.
B002BWP49C|5|My son loves it
B005OK725M|5|LOVE IT. LOVED IT. LOVED IT.  Sometimes there's nothing like a good old fashioned kick-a$$ movie. New Year's Eve qualifies for one of those times.  We've been trying to rent ColombianA from Blockbuster since it hit the rental racks a few weeks ago. Checking daily, it was never available. Finally rented from DIRECTV. Well worth the wait and the additional cost.   Zoe Saldana's character was agile and witty with the right amount of stone cold-blooded female bad-a$$ness. Five stars. The story held my interest and while the plot was predictable the action kept momentum building.   Four favorite scenes: (1) The little girl running thru the streets of Columbia. Lots of fun with a clever escape. (2) Adult Katalaya fighting with two tooth brushes. Hahaha. Loved it. (3) Byplay between her boyfriend's BBF and his sister-in-law. \\"He's going to thank me later.\\" HAHAHAHA. \\"What's she doing at my computer?\\" LOL. (4) The bomb she planted under the detective's chair. She told him not to get up before the microwave timer went off, but he hopped up a few seconds before in case the bomb blew he wouldn't lose his butt. HAHAHA. Good one.  Two least favorite scenes: (1) The uncle shooting innocent people in front of the school just to show little Katalaya he could teach her to kill. Outlandish and callas for a character I wanted to like. (2) Killer Katalaya is smart, but not smart enough to protect her family (uncle & surrogate mother). Her lack of forethought and concern for their welfare tainted my ability to fully pull for her especially after her uncle pointed out her blind spot.   While the story had a few holes I didn't care. ColombianA wasn't about crossing every T or dotting every I. Can't wait for the sequel. Just like the Transporter franchise, the character and Ms. Saldana can only get more intriguing.

B000AADYYO|5|OK - I've read what everyone said. I am not going to compare any tracks to previous tracks. This is a very well done album. I originally started with Blackwater and worked my way back, eagerly anticipated Deliverance and Damnation (which I think everyone knows were originally going to be combined as a double album) so comparing is almost worthless - almost. If you have experience to go on, you will immediately notice the intricacies that we all remember from Still Life - but this is more mature (not necessarily better!).  <br /> <br />The added boardist gave me mixed feelings at first... but if there is only one thing you can say about this CD, it is that the first two songs are in the top 10 that the band has ever done - not only that, but aside from the fact that the 3rd track (sorry) beginning sounds like some disappointing DIO, even it comes through. The entire album seems like it may fight Still Life for the best thought-out album of theirs.  <br /> <br />You may also hear that the single is repetitive in its main riff - but that is because folks are so used to the crazy changes. It is solid, and like the track \\"Deliverance,\\" takes a few listens to get used to... <br /> <br />These guys are like leather furniture... reliable, comfortable, and high class.  <br /> <br />If you like anything they've done, you probably already own this album. If not, get after it.
