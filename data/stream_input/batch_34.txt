B00QN94ZV2|5|Works great, perfect oem fit.  Do not buy others I did and they all fit weird and are cheaply made.  This particular one works and fits great!
B00WSAJU2O|1|DISAPPOINTED! So small it's useless!
B007WMGDDC|5|Came with the metal part too. Which is hard to find. Fit my 2003 Jetta perfectly
B00CH6T18C|5|Great product.  Really re-moisturized my leather recliner that gets a lot of sun.<br />Prompt delivery and great follow-up.
B00JIDTHN6|5|Beautiful!
B000C9DH22|5|meet my expectations!!
B00S2IF0TS|5|Replaced the broken one in my camper.  Perfect fit.  Doing it myself was a LOT cheaper than having the repair done at an RV store.
B00651BYGM|4|Looks great. Wish my radio worked then I'd be able to say whether the reception is good. However, I live at 11K feet and don't get radio anyways. LOL The best part about this antenna is that it doesn't fling around on the trail when I brush up against things. I'd recommend it.
B00E9W2PPS|1|Works well for car AC; but not any better than a two dollar torch bottle.<br /><br />Torch bottle probably safer as you can smell leaks.
B0009H528E|5|GOOD
B000CHGIOS|1|After having this replacement fule cap on my 05 Tahoe for a few months it now doesn't seal my tank..I know have a check engine light and a trouble code for gas cap not sealing properly.
B00JRE38EA|3|8 out of 10 worked, and yes I know how to they are polarity sensitive. If they all worked they would rate 5 stars, great light on the ones that work.
B00YIA2VH8|5|it was a little small for my F250 but I still loved it
B005FHWS30|1|Has no smell what so ever. Waste of money.
B0036U02WW|1|These did not fit my 2012 Teryx 4. This despite checking the year & model on the figment chart that is promoted when ordering. These ONLY fit a Tertx 2 seater. Very disappointed that there is not a correct model for the Teryx4
B009LJUKSI|4|I wish it was a tad taller and a tad wider, but it does the job.
B00K7HEJ62|5|Thank you!!
B00BPDCSPG|4|Super fast delivery.  Very nice quality for the price.  Unfortunately did not fit my application and I had to return.  The Nekid Cow was super in processing my return and I would definitely buy from them again.
B000JZF614|5|Mechanic who installed these for me said they were of excellent quality and were made perfectly to specifications. He couldn't believe the price!
B00W939XOA|1|Had no effect what so ever
B007KTINWQ|5|This stuff is great.  Easy to apply and really puts a protective shine to your car in no time.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Put them on my 2003 Mazda Miata LIC plate. They match the colour of my HID. Much better then stock and even better the the last LEDs I had in. They seem well built and should last for years.
B007JPJGRW|5|Fits Perfect on my 08 GMC Sierra.
B00308NXKS|5|Like it. nice used it for a golf cart works perfect
B00ML7IELC|1|I don't know how good they work. One of the lights didn't work. It is broken and has to be returned
B005FKS28C|4|Bought these for my 2008 Toyota Tacoma. I have had them on for close to a month so far and have been happy with the results. Easy to install (if you are mechanically savvy with a wrench) and they have a straight forward break-in procedure. Definitely a good product package for the price!
B001KSCF0Y|5|Fiys great
B00523AMBC|5|Great filter.
B00GQC3T9K|5|This was. Birthday present to our son. He says it is a great helmet.
B013AGP500|5|These towels are beyond amazing and definitely get the job done. I used them to dry my car after a good car wash. I was beyond shocked at how well these towels absorb water. I was prepared to use both, but one was sufficient to dry my Dodge Durango. It did not leave any fibers behind as do other towels I have tried. Having a dark color vehicle, it is difficult to find towels that do not leave fibers behind as they are extremely noticeable. If you've had this issue, these towels are for YOU!  and did not require me to wring the towel until the end. The quality of these towels is great, they feel soft and are sewn well at the edges.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B003YKTNOM|5|excellent looking and easy install
B007WWROJO|3|This is not a JEGS branded grease gun. this is nothing different than something you could buy at the local parts store. But it does do the job. The title is very Misleading.
B00C7DLVV0|5|After 3 direct drive rebuilds, I decided to give this unit a try. First of all, the price was equal to it's brother, no problem there. Installation & fit went perfectly. Operation sounds a little different, but starts the engine quickly. Don't know about the build quality as I didn't open it up as I usually do ..... only time will tell. Hopefully it'll give many years service life as it's size, feel, looks and overall personage made me smile. Thanks LActrical !
B00632VHH4|5|A nice quality brush.  It works to make my seats in my '14 SHO look like new.  I just wish it was a prime item to save on shipping.
B00EBQFC5C|4|Nice looking frame, but..the back edges of it are very sharp. It scraped the paint right off my brand new car's bumper all the way around the edges of the frame after just a few weeks. I am going to the plastic carbon fiber look frame with smooth edges that my husband put on his car. Safer - no damage.
B00CHS6TGM|5|Nice product  im not using this exxxterior use but its a nice product
B00JRFK22A|4|They work great.
B000C7S4EA|5|Took much longer than expected as no inventory on hand<br />Great product
B00EOIQ6H0|5|Awesome deep sound. Looks exactly like the picture.
B000COXGTQ|2|I have not yet broken the seal on the product.  However, I was disappointed that no where on the bucket did it reference the word &#34;Dupont&#34;  or the &#34;7&#34;, as advertised.
B00PMXQFE0|5|Great looking lights in corner markers with clear lenses.
B0132F43E8|1|These look like the real thing on a webpage but once I tried to install them, From the front of the bucket to the trim ring they are too thick so the trim ring have a huge gap between the ring and the bucket, And the lens is marred with micro scratches and the lens is not seated level inside the aluminum body is part of the problem. The real Harley Davidson (DayMaker) spot lights cost 400 bucks a pair but will fit correctly. I'm gonna send them back and buy the Harley brand.UPDATE UPDATE. I decided to keep them and what a mistake that was, After I washed my bike I noticed water inside the lens on both side and it never gone away and the lens material they use is way too soft it scratches too easy and I use microfiber cloths to clean my bike the lens is trash, LOOK AT THE LATEST PIC I UPLOADED.Amazon should drop this product.
B004U8JH84|5|like new
B000C57VQE|5|Moog is tops ! .... Moog always resolves any issue I encounter. Thanks
B00HL5AHDM|2|They are great if they fit.  I have six cargo trailers and they only fit one.
B00SH1SN6C|5|great packaging. like the case and accessories havent had to jump any vehicle yet but im ready if i do!
B008RVNYIY|2|I have my doubts this will last very long. It's made of the same cheap plastic used for toy model airplanes. The paint rubbed off when I tried to clean it before installation, so I decided to give it a few coats of clear gloss to avoid having it fade too quickly. The worst part is that the base is curved too much so it doesn't sit flush on the roof, with the tape attaching only at the tip and the back, leaving a noticeable space where it arches up in the middle that you can see through if you look closely at it from the side. On the positive side, it does look nice (from a distance) and is so cheap you can afford to buy a new one if it doesn't last. I recommend you buy extra double sided tape to fasten it more securely and double or triple tape the middle to get a better fit.
B00FFMX5NW|3|Runs small!
B004AR13AA|4|I'd give these guys a 5 star rating but of the two manifolds I bought, only one of them came with the required studs. Other than that, absolutely great!.
B00XNZSAWY|5|Looks clean. Very happy :)
B00PYQQ4WI|5|Shipping was fast and price was great
B004BTJG9M|5|This product fit perfect on my 1996 Honda Civic EX sedan. started right up
B00HU6N3LK|5|Impressive bottle of cleaner!<br /><br />This little bottle is concentrated and should be mixed with water before applying unless you just really have a tough area to clean. I would still try it diluted first because we have been surprised at what it has been able to clean.<br /><br />Everything from ground in dirt to sweat bands have been lifted with this product. The scent is really nice and the feel of the product is rich.<br /><br />The results are more than we were expecting. Scuff marks removed from my leather pumps, hand bags were made to look almost new and a hat that is worn when working..well was really stained with a sweat band and even that looks so much better.<br /><br />Items are left soft and clean..with no residual product.<br /><br />If you have leather products that could use a sprucing up, I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.
B0007Z1P34|5|Good product shipping good and on time.
B000MIITVW|5|Great trash bag for the car and it is actually tan to match the interior.
B00CG8WK5W|5|it takes about one hour to mount it to the saddle bags. I really enjoys it. works perfectly.
B00A740VQM|4|Besides  the fact that I had to go to the post office after three weeks of waiting, excellent product!
B00A1AX1VE|1|About six months after was installed it turned green and reception is bad
B004UM93HU|4|Fun, bright and righteous
B001G8AIMU|3|it works
B000GVFHJ2|5|👍
B002HXUEKE|2|did not fit my Ford Edge, easy return and refund
B002N5W8Q4|1|I threw out packaging or I would have returned this.  It is very cheaply made and is not worth the money spent on it. The fan is really thin cheap plastic and I hardly feel the air coming out at all.  Dont get me started with this junk.
B00EZ7NYW0|5|Working great. They bulge a little in weird places, but my truck is far from straight, so I'm sure that's a big part of it. These really make the truck look good though
B00BITKV5G|5|They work good thanks.
B009DK76FK|5|Went right on,  it was already greased for me, and stays closed
B007KTINX0|5|I like this stuff ... Does as advertised ... not greasy or overly shinny ...
B00B3ZEBB0|5|fit great and i have had on the vehicle now for 15k miles . no leaks . worth every penny
B000GU293U|1|Very poor product. I put on brand new 2 weeks ago. I went on my fishing trip and the light was burnt out. The &#34;sealed&#34; capsule inside was full of water. The bulb was badly coroded already. Agsin this was only 1 week olf. I am replacing this in the off season with an led of a different brand.
B000TTO1ZC|5|Solid belt, good quality, gives your hood a nice color as well. I changed my belts whilst installing the lightweight crank pulley, so if you are considering such a thing buy these instead of the OEM's or such
B001PNC5CW|4|works<br />better then a wrench
B00G08Y5W0|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2003 BMW M3 Convertible (E46). Took all of 15 seconds to install. Car looks good as new again.
B009NX5DFC|5|Awesome exactly what I needed.
B00YLLAM66|5|Works great
B00FALVU8A|5|I love this wax!!!! I have a white KIA and sometimes it gets so dirty it looks like it's lost it's color and the paints texture feels like sand paper (even after a wash) and when I wax it with this bad boy it gives a wet, shiny look to it. And then the paint feels super smooth. No more sandy feel. Looks like it got detailed by a professional. I'm just a guy who loves clean cars and this makes me a happy guy.
B00062YVT8|5|Works as described. Easy to read and install.
B000PWUX14|5|I bought this sensor to correct a P0430 on my 2006 Toyota Sienna.  It was an exact replacement for the upstream sensor (the one before the front or Bank 2 Catalytic Converter).  The connector fit and the cable clip fit perfectly.  It took me about 15 minutes to replace the sensor.  Most of that time was getting the old cable retainer clip out and removing the rusted screws from the heat shield.  I chose to remove the air cleaner feed tube (2 screws) just to give me more access to the sensor connector.  The sensor comes with anti-seize grease should I ever need to remove it in the future.  Not sure it will fix my P0430 but it is worth a try given the cost of a new Catalytic Converter.  The Sienna &#34;seems&#34; to run a bit smoother but that could be my imagination.
B00XZ70V5O|4|Installed on a 2015 Ford F-150 Super Crew 2WD. The units fit into the wheel wells. On the drivers side two of the four holes did not line up. On the passenger side one of the four holes did not line up. This was easily corrected by drilling from the Ford side into the liners. Overall the liners were easy to install and the quality is outstanding. One star off for holes not lining up. I would recommend to a friend.
B00UMIJ4M0|5|This sticker was spot on with pic shown, good quality and easy to apply.  With any decals the surface always need to be cleaned and take your time.  ProSticker did an awesome job and I will definitely be using them again for future decals.
B0125VZNKS|1|small
B009IF1I2C|5|part came in on time and installed quite easily
B012EG28AC|5|I absolutely love them!
B00WGX2TFS|5|My son is using this on his bike.
B00YUZDKLM|5|Since this worthy product had no feedback to date, I decided to write my first Amazon review!<br /><br />This key/remote arrived quickly (two days, I believe) and appears as per the ad photograph.<br /><br />Ace Hardware would not cut this key because it couldn't fit their machine; they also doubted, in any case, that the chip could be programmed in order for it to start the truck.  I took it to Home Depot where the guy was also concerned that it wouldn't work.  But as it could fit into their machine, I gave him every assurance that, since it only cost me 20 dollars, I was prepared to roll the dice without holding him responsible.  He needn't have worried.<br /><br />The cut key unlocked the door (manually) of my 2009 F150 without any trouble and was able to turn the ignition... to a point.  (The barrel turned but the engine did not start.)  From here, you need two already-working keys in order to programme the chip of a new key.  The provided instructions were very clear and the process worked first time for me and the new key could then start the engine.<br /><br />Next, to programme the remote functionality.  Again, the provided instructions detailed the necessary (easy) steps to take and, again, the outcome was successful first time.<br /><br />This key/remote is the only key I've carried for my truck since I got it; it has been used multiple times per day for the last week.  The buttons are positive and the key flip mechanism feels solid - not at all cheap.  I imagine this key/remote could outlast the flimsy OEM offering from Ford.<br /><br />The range on the remote is better than I had with my OEM remote.  It suits me to have a combined unit in my pocket.  Satisfied customer.<br /><br />For information, the notes I have seen suggest that vehicles sharing this key/remote system may have up to 4 paired remotes and 8 paired keys.  The last I saw, should you resort to replacing a new key at a Ford dealership, it will cost over 200 dollars.  This process cost a tiny fraction of that... but requires that both original keys have not yet been lost.  It is a really smart thing to get a third key BEFORE losing one of the original two!<br /><br />And finally... Home Depot did not make a charge for cutting the key.
B00OFEBF56|1|Yep shouldve listend to the other reviews it was junk and didn't lay down at all like it shouldve
B000GU0BS0|4|Shipping took a little longer than expected but still, a great product!
B004A130X4|5|Great looking rack. Install was a little confusing but not terribly difficult
B00BXROXFM|5|My mom loved it!
B00N48BLO4|5|All parts in the kit fit fine. 1999 Civic LX.
B00075XCV2|5|This receiver seems well built and has a good finish on it.  Fairly easy to install on my 97 Cherokee.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is definitely worth getting a 12 x 1.75 tap to clean out the weld nuts.<br /><br />One other thing worth mentioning is that my muffler hanger had a stud going into the weld nut strip in the frame which made the install slightly different than videos I had seen. Install time was a little over an hour including cleaning out the weld nuts with a tap.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It is everything you promised it would be and more!!  I love it and am so happy to have it on my trip out West to Arizona.<br />You guys are the best,<br />Thank you,<br />Bill
B00XZ70V5O|4|All holes did not line up.  Had to drill one hole to place 4th screw.  But once in place.  LOOKS GREAT!
B000PA00XM|5|Perfect fit for 2004 E46 M3
B00CZAJJ50|2|I paid WAY more than the ones sold at auto parts stores and Walmart.<br />Mistakenly thinking it would last WAY longer.<br />Holes are beginning to wear through.<br />Oh well. Off to Walmart to buy seat covers for my seat covers.
B000XY6ZHA|5|item as described.
B004O844DS|5|Fits Great On My Trailblazer
B00K7938O4|3|These are not very sturdy. I ordered two pair and one arrived with a little crack, but became a big crack when I installed it. I returned one pair and the replacement arrived a few weeks later. Amazon's return policy is great. I keep clear covers on my license plates and they usually last 3-4 years. These are so thin and light that I doubt this pair will hold up that long, but they were the cheapest.
B00IABALBO|5|Perfect fit, the plastic is a little thin.
B000E7WLJW|3|did not use and plan to return.  I ordered to use for vacation but did not.  Will return upon return home.
B001ENN1QW|5|Perfect fit, quality BMW Plate
B00E5DPO4U|4|It Works very well
B002I03ZIE|5|Fit perfectly on my 2007 Chevy Silverado classic
B00BSIZCME|1|My letters peeled off in less than 2 weeks. Wow
B00K7938O4|3|basic stuff, very thin and inexpensive
B000C9Y0PU|5|perfect!! 100% original
B00C4Y81FQ|5|Amazing product. Bought for my boyfriend he loves it!
B000BYGEDC|5|Bosch is quality, popped right in and immediately noticed an improvement when I started my engine.
B01125QL1I|5|Excellent quality, easy to install, look great, do not ride or wrinkle, I have received soooo many compliments on them!
B00404WDUC|5|Nice product. The hose fitting should make it easier to check pressure on a motorcycle. It did on my Yamaha with two giant brake discs to work around.
B000C9DIM6|5|Great price,very well constructed
B001QIUGVI|5|Great item
B000W7F2GI|5|Works great with Power Bleeder
B000C9D24K|5|This part was desperately needed to solve many of my car's problems:<br />1. intermittent AC,<br />2. off and on theft deterrent system problems (engine not starting) eventually turned into not starting, at all.<br />Other than the hassle of getting the GM dealer to reprogram the new control module ($100+) it was all worth it in the end.
B0007Z9V4O|5|My Honda mower runs like new again **Honda 21'' 3-in-1 Push Gas Lawn Mower w/ Auto Choke - HRR216PKA** , I inadvertently soaked the old filter with gas and could not figure out why the mower would run rough and eventually turn off. After a little research I decided to replace the filter and it now runs better than ever. This the least expensive maintenance that you can do to keep your mower running great as well as prolong it's life. Fast shipping and very fair price.
B00VGL5SVI|5|Built really well. Strong
B00B0J6ATU|5|Perfect fit! I was happy to pay to replace for an authentic product. This wheel is much stronger than the older version that so easily cracked. It made my mower usable again which is what I needed!
B0097EKD16|4|Great pads, besides the firm where your feet rest. Fabric started to become loose after a full days use. Besides that I think it's a great purchase
B004J0RM7Q|5|Awesome
B00VF2IC9I|3|It does not perform as well as other reviews state. It will charge iPad air no more than once (most of the time to 50-60%). I followed the instructions, had charged AC and DC - same. Replaced - performance did not increase. Will not even charge an iphone to 100%. Either I am having bad luck the product or other reviews are misleading. I only purchased this after reading other reviews. Looks nice and comes with many accessories that are useful. I did not try jump starting a vehicle with it  (my camper has solar power), but I doubt it abilities.
B00E63TI32|5|This is a Beast of a vessel! If you have a thirst this is for you, it well keep you hydrated for along time with ice cold beverage of choice. The hydro flask flip top and hydro flask flip lid with straw works great on this also.
B004AIDMGM|1|did'nt come with all parts had to return
B00CMX20H4|1|Just what I needed in place of my wimpy &#34;meep meep&#34; stock horn. UPDATE / BEWARE NO WARRANTY AFTER 30 DAYS Horn has lost most of the frequency only emits a high pitched beep now.  IT is very poorly made. YOU WILL NOT GET A WARRANY REPLACEMENT Purchased July 11, 2015 return window closed on Aug 13, 2015.
B0045V3Q2O|4|Okay
B00XN1DAP0|5|Works good
B005BWID1K|5|Fit perfectly!
B001P2JC9W|5|Seeing the customer reviews I was skeptical. But I took a chance. I now understand what happened to those customers who bought this and did not receive both parts of the item. They received items that had been returned by customers who had &#34;kept the part that holds the oil bottles inverted. When an item is returned to amazon, the people receiving the return do not know that what they are receiving is &#34;missing &#34; parts. The one I received was in a sealed plastic bag and had a label from the company &#34;Wirth Co&#34; and made in USA.  This is a simple device and worth it especially if you use synthetic oil. ou need to save every drop of synthetic oil to use in other equipment. I would order another if I need to but this is black plastic and seems to be well made. It is a common practice when an item is returned that people &#34;keep&#34; part of the item and then it is &#34;shipped&#34; out to the next customer in line = who finds out he or she is receiving only part of what they have ordered.
B000C9XZ0G|5|received in timely manner and worked well
B006GJYKWI|5|Best boat cleaner there is!
B004HGXNCA|5|Couldnt be happier. I have a 2008 Lexus ES350 and they work like a charm. Didnt like hte price or the color of the stock ones. These are right on the money. Thanks !
B000H6P55W|5|Fits great, product just as listed, and it held up to the winds while traveling.  Great product.
B00A14QM52|5|Snapped the old ones out popes the new ones in and lit up perfect at night
B001B3GCSE|5|great repair manual. must have.
B00XHB6LG6|5|I have had these installed for about 2 months now and they have drastically improved the night time visibility for my Ford Fiesta ST. I will note, however, that the cooling strips take up a lot of space behind the bulbs, so make sure to check your headlight assembly to accommodate for that.<br />The strips are very flexible though, so as long as you finagle them you shouldn't have a problem.<br />Great product!
B005NLQAHS|5|The best $25 (including the Torque app) that I ever spent. What can I say, this thing just works, especially when coupled the the Torque app. You can read and clear engine codes from your vehicle on your own. Which will save you time and money, especially the latter. Where I am from mechanics charge about $40-50 USD just to scan your car. No more, I'll do it myself and the great thing about using this with a phone means that you can lookup the error codes instantly and decide if it's an urgent problem or if your oil just needed changing (as was the case with my Wrangler)<br /><br />One can also use it to monitor water temps, volts, air/fuel ratios, boost etc. Indispensable tool, love it.
B00LLZFIJ6|5|I am glad to have this on my keychain. I hope to NEVER have to use it, but I'd rather have it and never use it than not have it and need it.
B004PW8OVQ|5|Bought these for a Chevy Sonic!  I thought it appropriate to put Sonic the Hedgehog on the vehice!
B003BZD08U|5|Keep that pressure regulated.  Be sure to take it off when filling your water tank though...tends to take a while with it on!
B007ITNG2K|4|Good Price
B0054TR4PG|5|Works well, like the treat mark on it marked as manufacture's self confidence!
B008G24IWA|5|Product shipped quickly, and looks good.
B002MQCYO0|5|I have been using this stuff for my boats windshield for over 15 years...  Cleans very well and leaves a nice protective coating.  Best stuff in my opinion.
B0009JKI86|5|Love these
B0051XBNDY|5|THIS WORKED PERFECT IN MY 2014 JEEP WRANGLER.
B004JO7OZ2|5|Very nice sign
B000GUYSBQ|5|absolutely love this thing
B0007WTE08|4|I bought this along with the Dynamat tape in a combination order from the Amazon seller. Then I misplaced it and went searching all through the garage and house. Finally, I decided that I would just go ahead, install the Dynamat and devise another solution for pressing the mat down. I came up with an old tennis ball and it worked BEAUTIFULLY! For getting the material into smaller spaces, the round of a screwdriver worked very well. After I had done the floors and above the headliner, I found the roller.<br /><br />So, I'm giving this tool four stars because I wanted mat material on the inside of my doors and this tool is very good for reaching up inside the door and getting beyond where my fingers can reach. However, if I had not chosen to put mat in those hard to reach areas, this tool would have been completely unnecessary.<br /><br />The tool is quite small and it is very well made. So those YouTube videos that show guys using cheaper versions from the Dollar store or Harbor Freight are using lighter duty rollers that are larger in size and may not fit up into the inside of the doors. You'll have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that, if you are a professional and do a lot of Dynamat applications for customers, this tool will be invaluable, it's tough strong and will last for years. However, if you are a Do-it-yourselfer like I am, no so much.
B009FIC4W0|5|Love these!!
B00U21P890|5|Easy to put on.  Looks awesome on my 2008 Pathfinder.
B00F7GZDRC|5|Great color. Needed to replace the old one, it was faded, but also fourteen years old.
B008819L0I|5|Installed  on a 2012 tundra  long bed double  cab. Wireing  could have  been 3 foot longer  from rear  to front  box had to go next  to rear seat. But otherwise  works  good. Also bought  the extension.
B000JZF5ZQ|5|Mechanic who installed these for me said they were of excellent quality and were made perfectly to specifications. He couldn't believe the price!
B00OB8E1ES|5|Awsome accessorie.
B0033S2FIG|1|Gave exact vehicle information and they sent wrong size. I made it work anyway. Lucky for me I work with metal and have torches or it would of never worked. Only good thing that the chrome was nice.
B009P7694K|5|Exactly what I expected what I needed for my saddle and bridles thanks!
B0016133RY|5|This my second Access Lorado Cover. In my opinion the best roll up cover out there. I previously had a Truxedo Lo Pro that fell apart.  Access covers hold up much better than the Truxedo covers.
B00BQS6UA4|5|Correct part, matched oem, and a fraction of the price the dealer wanted. Very happy!
B000C560RA|5|fit great
B004JY6AVQ|5|Worked like a champ, not very difficult with YouTube video.
B00219PXK0|2|It isn't has sturdy & stable as we had hoped it would be. Wouldn't buy again
B000EQR7XS|4|Check engine light went away and hasn't come back on since. Thank you.
B008IO23FK|1|The one I got didn't work. The led lights never light up even though they were wired in properly. The assembly was cracked where the blower motor meets the circuit board. Very bad experience and they charged almost 200 bucks for something that didn't work. Buyer beware they will not issue a refund. I expected something reputable because they were selling through Amazon. I'm very displeased with what I got. It Arrived dirty and cracked. Better off buying a new genuine one that will work.
B00DQO6IIA|4|Worked well, but required some modification to install.  Istallation is difficult and the connectors would not fit in the available space. I cut some of the wires, installed the connectors and then spliced the wires back together.
B005RR5D12|5|They are bright as hell
B00FQ0Q8U0|4|Replacement is just a bit bigger then OEM.  And the sprayer is just a narrow stream not a wider spray like original. So have to use more windshield fluid.  Original was out and needed to be replaced.  Brake light Works great.
B00A66GYDA|5|Don't drop hundreds of dollars when you can buy this.  The manual provides all of the code translations.  A great &#34;saver&#34; to use before taking the car to the shop for repairs.  You will know the codes in advance.
B00S1ESWVQ|5|Good filter for the unbeatable price!
B00C4O8LWY|5|On time delivery and works and fit perfect
B000C16XLC|5|Bought it for 2001 Dakota quad cab. Arrived on time as promised, sealed in plastic bag and sealed box with instructions. Easy bolt on replacement, perfect fit, window works like it used to. Don't buy from any other seller just to save a few dollars. I went that rout first and ended up with a dud. This is the one you wanna get. Great product.
B00JW1VX0O|5|Good
B007IOOITK|5|Perfect
B00K5VT1KO|5|LOVE IT!!!!
B007PJ5GKS|5|Excellent
B00IWHHITO|5|Purchased item locally at Rural King store. Item is well made with plenty of pockets, has mesh back interior which helps keep cool on hot days. Heavy weight denim with good stitching and buttons. Concealed weapon pocket is on the inside left of vest and has elastic straps for both the gun and a clip but have not tested it as do not plan to carry.
B00MO9T9SE|5|Perfect fit fo my 2014 Silverado.
B004HE6UL8|5|Nice pads good price point
B00496OI3Q|5|What is there to say about an air filter? It works and it fits my Chevy Equinox LTZ 2012 exactly right.
B00XZNKLEE|4|It's as beautiful as it looks in the image.  Since this shell includes the loop at the top, you can't take the physical key out of the intelligent key without taking the shell off of the fob, but since you don't use the physical key much, that shouldn't be a problem. It's gorgeous!
B00BRHM8FA|5|After regearing and a tire change it recalibrated my speedometer to be accurate within 1mph. I also updated it with the performance tune and it works flawlessly. I definitely recommend it.
B00HR26X6O|5|looks great 2011 tahoe
B0006IX850|3|Used once and it pushed off my inside hose spilling water everywhere. Carful use.
B00GHTDGAO|5|It was unbelievable that I found this rare part on amazon.com. Dorman thank you. I have a 2004 Honda Odyssey and I just recently had the power steering pressure hose replaced due to leaky hose and my mechanic informed to me that the pressure switch connector is missing. So I was like what. So I was feverishly looking for this part at auto junkyards in Fitchburg, MA and was unsuccessful in finding this part until I did a search and found a company that made the part (Dorman) and I was able to order it on amazon. I received the part, installed it and it work. This small part fixed my idling and acceleration problem. Excellent. Kudos Dorman and Amazon!
B000JFNAJE|4|works good
B00KY0MPH2|5|Easy to install, truck now starts.
B00PQZMB10|2|Really thin and easy to tear. Headrests and top of seats don't close. I will admit it serves the purpose of covering the seat with color.
B00533Y5FA|5|easy to install and look great!
B001RBCU90|5|&#60;3
B00192JGY4|5|I've dealt with propane losses for a long time.  Now I can check the system after I move the trailer
B004NOPEN2|5|Ready for winter! Great for gripping the brush.
B006X8AEUY|5|Easy to install perfect fit .
B00FBKSDDA|5|Great
B003UT1V38|4|I've recently fallen in love with a variety of Sonax products. Their products are straightforward, simple to use and above all; they work! The Tire Gloss Gel is no different. It definitely lasts WEEKS and not DAYS. I used a curved tire dressing applicator and it's a breeze to apply. Makes your tires look new and doesn't sling (as with all products like this, make sure to let it dry before driving).<br /><br />As others have said, it doesn't really give that gaudy, shiny, wet look; which in my opinion is a good thing.
B004Q864Q6|5|Works great in my F150 crew cab (2014).  A lot more space available for storage now that i put these in place and i don't have things coming out from under the seat like before (i used to put plastic tubes under the seats.)
B00HD50BEK|5|LED lights are very good quality 2x better than stock lights
B007LQHIV0|5|Work perfect
B00ZYS9NWY|4|so happy with it, now I have AC in my car.
B00GQFR1TQ|5|I started out with the mirror in the back seat but this blows them away.  It's great to be able to see my baby without having to look in the rear view mirror.  This mounts on your windshield like a GPS would.  I had an issue with a broken cord after I first bought this. I called up Yada customer service and they were awesome.  They shipped me a new one out at no cost.  I highly recommend this product.
B000NTG83G|5|Great product and very fast delivery.
B00E83T1H8|5|Great emblem.
B005LGTRGQ|4|After reading reviews on the Mercedes forum and was recommended to use the Mercedes OEM part instead. I had no issues with this flex disc. However, I purchased the Mercedes OEM part and installed it at the more critical front of driveshaft and the Dorman at the less critical rear of driveshaft. Both Mercedes and Dorman were nearly identical. WARNING: Make sure you make alignment marks (spray paint) on the tranny yoke / driveshaft and driveshaft / diff yoke prior to removing the old flex disc. It is extremely critically important that the alignment of those assemblies remain the same alignment for they were dynamically balanced at the factory. If you are off by one bolt location, you will get vibration like others got and a damaged flex disc a month later. I learned this lesson on another car in the past. It is not Dorman's fault if you did not match the original alignment correctly, like the other reviews. I reused the old Mercedes bolts instead of the new Dorman bolts.  I have driven the car for a week on the freeway and no driveshaft vibration issues.  UPDATE: It has been a month and still no vibration issues. Still working great!
B00839K4Y2|4|Can't go wrong looks like an upgrade makes it looks like it's luxurious and beautiful..
B000UD0CTQ|2|Good if the head of the filter is flat, it will slip if it has a dome shaped at bottom like on a lot of large Diesel engine, I would recomend a good strap wrench instead.
B002SDHQ9U|5|Fit exactly as it shoud.
B00JMCCGDQ|5|Great stuff, will buy again.
B003BGYRPO|5|Spraying went on smooth and dried fast. Very good coverage. Cans completely emptied all contents every time
B000EBKG5E|1|This product is a JOKE and Do NOT recommend for anyone!
B00GGZSE4C|5|PEW PEW PEW
B002JOVUO0|5|Too many &#34;doesn't hold&#34; reviews. 3m recommends to use the 3m adhesion promoter. When done as directed it has super holding strength! !
B00495UQT2|5|After dealing with a constant plague of tail-gaters on my daily, I finally had enough.  I bought this setup and mounted the spray nozzles on my rear bumper.  Now any time someone follows so close behind me (at highway speeds) that I can't see their headlights, I give them a blast of washer fluid that has been colored deep green with food coloring.  One or two squirts and they never fail to back way off!
B000YOX568|4|Decent. A much better buy than Snapon, but the swivel head makes the torque value inaccurate. When the head swivels you are getting a torque value based on the hypotenuse.
B0002Z9M02|3|product not that strong strap broke right after we got it put on truck and it is not that easy to install but it serves the purpose
B00VA84D2M|4|Much better than what's available in the retail stores. If you're looking for lots of cushion, this isn't it.
B0040ZJ2W8|5|All items work well , do as should , I'm pleased
B00HQQ3RZG|4|Replaced the factory bulbs and these look great, they are truly white, and pretty bright. The pictures shown are a bit of a more subtle light, these are just straight up blinding bright. Had a little trouble with the light covers, they're plastic and easy to break, but other than that you can't install them incorrectly.<br />Only complaints would be that they leave this little glow (even though they're off) for like 40 minutes+. They're not on, it's just the LED picking up electrical signals that the OEM lights wouldn't, won't drain the battery but it just is kind of annoying because it looks like they're not ALL the way off. Also it didn't come with a trunk light, would of been really nice if it did instead of a license plate bulb.
B00T5G53ZM|5|If bought from Foseal, these work great. There are quite a few manufacturers selling apparently the same Item, but don't be fooled. I work in the automotive industry and have the opportunity to try this on a wide selection of vehicles both models/years/make. I have had to send back multiple other manufacturers product because they would link to my phone and that is it. I found the electronics to be different. I have dissected a few and came to one conclusion. The scan tools with a SOLDERED on bluetooth board all seem to have the same PC board. These ones function. The ones that dont work have similar internals, but the one difference is the bluetooth board is INTEGRATED. These have an extremely high DOA rate. I searched through seller pictures and found one (sold by and branded &#34; foseal&#34;) that I could see the bluetooth board soldered on.  I purchased 2. Both function perfect even with my scan program set to fastest communication. I have tried these on a 2003 Hyundai Elantra, a 2005 Toyota Tundra, a 2000 BMW 328i, a 1999 Mazda Protege', a 2005 Chevrolet Suburban, a 2009 Cadillac DTS, a 1998 Honda Civic and a 2010 Toyota Tundra. All had perfect communication and read the VIN# on all vehicles. This was a wide enough range of vehicles to deem this scan tool functional on all vehicles. Thanks for a great product and please click helpful if this was informative!
B00J3DF04G|2|To be honest, it's lame. It does not fit properly, and the velcro comes in pieces, so it's only secured in several spots. Going to take it down and not use it. Shame.
B000OUUG8M|5|very good
B00KGEF8YI|3|Haven't used it (fortunately).  Seems OK.  I paid premium over big box stores thinking it is a safety item and not be cheap.  It doesn't appear to be much different quality than big box versions.  Mounting system is very nice and flexible.
B000H01NFY|5|KLR250. Would run hot anytime driving less than 25 mph. Drained 50/50, flushed system, installed engine ice. Never overheated again. Worth every penny.
B00A7VPIEK|5|Garage batteries can be expensive. We went to Amazon after pricing them locally, couldn't beat the price or service. Was shipped immediately and I feel confident if the power goes out, I'll be able to acess my garage with no problem.
B000BQSIWK|5|Worked great to top off the charge on my optima red top. I have driven Nissans for many years, and none of them seem to keep this type of battery fully charged.  Over the course of a few months they slowly die. The windows and seats begin to creep and drag when operated with the engine off. Then one day they won't start.<br />I plan to hook this up every couple of months to keep the battery from running low.<br />I like the lightweight design. Works just as well as the heavy old iron core transformer models although I doubt it will last as long. I put a small fan in front of it while it works to prolong the life of the electronics.
B00192JF9U|5|Worked great on my new 2015 Casita 17' Spirit Deluxe
B00HFRQ7OO|5|JT sprockets are awesome so I figured I'd try their chain. I only have 1 ride on it so far but I'm impressed by the quality for the price.
B00NRBP4IM|5|Excellent- fast shipping!
B001GCMA4A|1|Poor quality, did not last a week
B001GMXA2G|5|Complete wiring. easy instructions. Fit perfect!
B008LG8T7Q|5|looks great, but short....
B000HAXF1E|3|I bought this to assist in rebuilding all of the front steering components on my GMC 2500HD.  It was actually too small (narrow) to fit on most of the joints, and when I tried to use it to remove the steering stabilizer, it actually spread apart.  I would not buy again.
B004O8EG90|5|Works great, albeit a little pricey. I used one spray bottle on my Yamaha Grizzly with a little left to use on my Popo 850XP Touring. I finished my Touring with Simple Green diluted.mit basically does the same thing and is a little cheaper.
B000C542LG|1|This part does not fit a 1993, Isuzu Trooper.  I had to send it back.
B000C94D5W|5|Perfect fit for my 92 Jeep cherokee laredo.
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Awesome
B009XIV02W|5|Fit right into the air filter slot on my 2013 Kawasaki Ninja ZX14R. Had no trouble with the install, looks well built, and will be cheaper than stock filters over the life of the bike.
B001AY2WLU|5|My husband loves this and wears it with him to work.  It comes in very handy when he doesn't want to go down to his office to get the tool he needs.
B00ADH6FYA|3|I'm a bit disappointed for as much as I spent...basically $13 plus $5 in shipping. It seems cheaply made. The cover seems very flimsy and you can bend it easily. Also, the &#34;chrome&#34; accents were scratched up a bit upon arrival. Overall, it looks good otherwise and my boyfriend was pretty happy about it.
B0015U6VLQ|4|A great product for the price.
B00ARJQSLE|1|Save your money and just buy a real MAF for your car.  My car &#34;ran&#34; with this maf, but still threw codes, and when I had I had a shop look at it they said it was physically broken.  There was maybe 100mi on this MAF total.  I ended up just buying an OEM so this just basically tacked on another $50 to the cost of the OEM.
B00303JQOU|5|Thanks , it was exactly how it was described and perfect fit
B00II3SE40|4|these bulbs came promptly and packaged well. However two of the bulbs had some of the leds not working, they still put out much more light than the originals. I will order more.
B000BOKML2|5|works great
B007Y8XZ58|1|Pros:  - Music while riding,<br />  - Hands free phone.<br />Cons:  - Miserable audio quality<br />  - Impossible to understand other riders at above 40 mph speeds.<br />  - getting it to connect and do a conference call, aka just talking to other scala rider headsets is blind luck.<br />  - since it sticks out to the side of the helmet, at highway speeds the amount of wind noise it produces is insane.<br /><br />My personal review after a few months.<br />After i bought it, i immediately proceeded to install it and take it out on a trip with the expectations to actually talk to other riders.<br />Yea right. First off, getting it to connect to anything is either pure luck, or random, after following the instructions 20 times and having it not work i gave up, went for a ride with my friend, halfway through the ride without trying or asking it to it connected.<br />Second thing is, the audio is just not good, if you expected clear quality audio forget about it, what's worse is, since it sticks out to the side of the helmet, the wind noise it makes is incredibly loud. After using it for a for a month, the left speaker on one of the sets gave out, it randomly works when it wants to but that's it.<br />Voice recognition is, well spotty at best, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, depends mostly on what speed you are going. And here's the biggest kicker, at highway speeds, there's no way you can talk to anybody, the sound  is impossible to decipher, the highest speed i've been able to have decent enough audio quality to understand someone else with this headset was about 40 mph.<br /><br />If you want a headset to talk to friends while riding around town its awesome, if you expect to do long trips and want to talk to other riders while traveling down the highway or at a decent speed, or if you live in a busy town with lots of noise, don't bother, its an over expensive, overpriced headset that barely does what it should.
B008G3KCQU|5|Arrived early, easy to install and work great!
B005CDNCQO|3|It fits and it does it's job TEMPORARILY. But I do not believe this is authentic. Within a month, my car was losing gas again.
B000LE6AXG|5|makes a long ride in an uncomfortable car so much more bearable!!!
B00RE6KV48|5|Amazing product. It really works and I conditioned 2 sofas, one chair and an ottoman using 1/3 of the bottle. My 20 year old leather furniture looks amazing!  I'm so glad I tried it. I would definitely buy it again and I paid full price-no discounts for a review. I loved it !!
B004HOC9NG|5|Just i need it.
B00T4O0BMK|5|I got this for my dad. he told me he needs it and now he uses it all the time.
B000EDOT8C|5|Very nice heavy duty stays put
B000COCS1S|5|Very straightforward and easy to install on a 1994 F250.
B000GVD0VE|5|This baby is bad ass. I fit groceries paperwork and my laptop in here. Great product for a great price.
B009S5GH14|5|A+
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Too small for my large purse to fit inside the actual pouch, but the product itself is good quality and still keeps my purse from falling into the back seat as well as keeps anything else I want handy. I have a 2015 Nissan Pathfinder, and the Purse Pouch fits between my seats perfectly. I'm really glad I bought it!
B00JBICS7U|5|Awsomeee!!!
B000L9T0EC|5|I have had a 1999 Ford Conversion Van and I have needed some good looking floor mats!  These look great and are great!  Fit Perfectly even though as I was a bit skeptical. Fit perfectly where the dog house is!
B001N2O3PM|5|Impressive construction, solid feel. Had on my Camry for over 2 years with not a single spot of oxidation. Took it off of my 2007 Camry after selling it and put on my 1999 Accord. It's amazing what a simple upgrade like a chrome license plate cover does to your cars appearance.
B0076CXWVY|5|This is the cutest bumper sticker I've ever found
B00KWQRC4O|3|PROS:<br />Does provide me with an area to stick my trash in the car. It's kept my car relatively clean of odd receipts and garbage etc. Holds a decent amount and is easy to empty<br /><br />CONS:<br />The strap holding the bag to the seat is a little adjustable, but it still hangs way too low even when at its shortest. Sitting in the rear seat, it hits the passenger's knees<br />Tissue box keeps sliding out since nothing is holding it in<br />Build quality/material feels a bit cheap. The tissue slit is just cut out of the single-layer of fabric and a single thread is sewn around the slit to prevent it from tearing. It just feels a bit cheap for what you pay for.
B00OW0UAJA|5|Exactly what I was looking for to keep keys organized and easily be able to separate out my car key. The mechanism for removing the rings is very smooth and easy to operate. Overall quality of the leather and metal seems very high.
B000CF8VSQ|5|Loved it.
B00HB9MODY|5|im happy<br />very good services 5 start
B0046I3I8I|1|worst thing i ever ordered returned not tire cover
B002UC2SFQ|4|Good quality.
B00700F5T4|4|Good product
B00FDQPCR2|5|I think I got this during a Gold Box deal.  I was suspect because I have had solar security lights in the past that just died immediately.  Easy to mount and install.  Works great - even better than I expected it to even if I had never had a negative experience in the past.  Uncertain how it will hold up over time but it is great now and does exactly what I need it to do.
B004HCOE8Q|5|Best product to use on your car
B002M496PC|5|These headlights are great makes my car look brand new. I did a road test at night to check out the head light pattern on the road and they are real good very very close to factory. I would recommend these head light you will be happy.The only thing I didn't do is check them in the rain for leaking or condensation. They did ok in car washing but where I live it rains very little. GOOD PRODUCT!!
B00HIVHFKW|3|These rotors  do not fit a 2011 grand Cherokee with the standard brakes. They DO fit if you have the &#34;heavy duty brake option&#34;. That option has rotors that are 10mm greater in diameter, as are these rotors. There is a work around which I chose. For about $25 each you can order two caliper mounting brackets from mopar that are for the heavy duty brake option. The calipers and pads are the same for both the standard and heavy duty option. Therefor these pads are correct.
B008CRHQ4Q|5|Great discs, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS, the difference in Left and Right for the rear axles is arbitrary, so you can do whatever you want in left/right symmetry, these brakes are 'single' layer metal, so the venting doesn't matter. Keep in mind, that the wear on the pads will be slightly higher than before (eg more dust)
B006RQ44BM|5|I purchased the same Max Energy for my 2007 Nissan Frontier, and when I traded that truck, for a 2007 Jeep Commander, I HAD to have the Max Energy Programmer again.<br /><br />For the 4.7L V8 the dyno charts suggest a gain of +39HP and +42TQ, and I could definitely feel it, especially when she gets over 3500rpms. The shifting is also much smoother and firmer, and going from Overdrive back into drive is quick, and gives plenty of power.<br /><br />I put that truck on the highway at 70mph for a couple hours and it got nearly 20mpg, when it's factory rated for 14-18.<br /><br />I didn't change anything about the shift-points, or anything special. I just chose the default settings with regular gas, and drive with 87 octane fuel.
B008N1YY7I|4|It gets attention.
B00BMH600Y|5|Excellent product. Exact match.
B0041CDPQO|5|perfect for what i needed
B00GOQFAZ4|5|Incredible look and product for the price ... look great on the bike, easy to put on and use ... Love em
B00EEQIASA|2|Cheap, poor form factor, and not really useful if you plan to install electronics. I use this as a mechanical key.
B00KFSSRTS|4|Great sound and good product. Just beware that on the cat from the car the studs are welded to the cat and on our age of vehicle theyll be rusted to uselessness. Also getting the rear section to fit up and over the rear frame requires alittle bending of the floor panel where the spare tire is. I would suggest professional installation.
B00IXZQGKM|1|nothing but the 2 front mats fit my 84 cj7.....at what I was charged for the set $215.00 I feel totally ripped off...would not use the box it came in to slide down a hill ! don't waist your money or your time
B00OVBC3JU|4|I have a 2011. Had to pray it apart a little to fit. Also had to elongate the holes to match holes in fender. But you only need to do this once to install it. Works great and even recommended it to a friend and he bought it...well I bought it from my amazon account for him.
B004EK0E5S|5|Dash was perfect. Install not so much, had to remove entire dash to install, a bitch, not for the meek. John
B010OTK6TG|4|So far it's worked out great...easy to install. As long as it last then it's perfect
B00KHB28NO|5|Great price to get both driver and passenger side actuators.  As another reviewer said, mine didn't come with pre-threaded holes, so I had to force thread them at install.  It wasn't difficult, just took some elbow grease.  For anyone else doing this, it helps to keep the window all the way up and remove the bottom nut from the window regulator arm closest to the actuator.  You can then push the window regulator back to make room for removing the old actuator and installing the new one.  be careful to re-attach all connections.<br /><br />All in all, pretty easy DIY and with these parts  much cheaper!!
B00EBTC5UE|3|Shipped quick. Product looks good but the Choke sticks on inside throat. I fixed it rather than send it back by filing a little off the butterfly valve. Other than that bolted it up and it started on the second pull.
B00GHT635Y|5|just right
B006X6MXT6|4|strong grill but would definite get a professional to install but overall pretty satisfied
B0082365AQ|4|Good for the price strap needs improved did not hold up as expected
B00FW1JXGO|4|A few of the bulbs did not fit perfectly, had to work at getting them in place due to the pointed ends of them not being designed as the ones they replaced.  Love the brighter light they put out.
B0081O9BEI|2|These decals are much smaller and puffier than expected.  Since they are thick I didn't expect them to adhere to a curved surface.  Returned - and since I knew I would be returning them I did not open the package and cannot comment on general quality.
B000P17NXQ|5|Easy install and setup!  Very nice brake controller!
B00HJEGQQ2|5|They are nice lights a little bit brighter than the stock bulbs just a little bit but they are OK
B0079ND3DC|5|Its great but did not fit... returning it.
B004AIIVUO|5|it is working as expected
B003CN30X6|5|these are gorgeous as expected from kuryakyn
B00F92YCXA|1|Just not a very good product.  I would not buy again.  Flimsy, weak, etc.  Probably better for brushing my hair.
B00514BAR2|5|smaller than expected
B0030DKDY2|5|perfect
B002GTKAHQ|5|Works perfectly in my FZ-07. I put a spacer in on the throttle side to prevent it from locking up but otherwise perfect.
B006P86TG0|4|Does a good job  as a patch on my jeans. What can you say it is what it says it is. Good thick embroidery should last a lifetime.
B00HU6N3LK|5|Does the job.
B00267APNM|5|easy to install and easy to adjust
B006CR74ZE|2|Product didn't have backing paper on it and the adhesive wasn't on it properly. I did however make it work otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars
B00SH1UJ3C|5|Pump arrived with no issues, works as advertised.  It comes pre-filled with hydraulic oil and has easy instructions on how to operate the pump.  Titanium Professional Hydraulics (TPH) provided technical support with determining pump flow parameters and other questions.
B0012PQWYA|5|Just as described.
B002P8EMK4|1|The mirror glass vibrates from wind buffeting, causing the image to blur. A second replacement by Amazon did the same thing. Very disappointing.
B000CNIMSC|5|I used these on my Hummer H3 shocks and they look great. These slide over the piston part of the shock to protect it from rock dings, mud and dirt. I've been using them for more than a year and they are holding up great. I take my H3 off road too. I slid one down to look at the rod and it is almost like new. I put them on all of my shocks. Great quality, good price.
B000CNLHI4|3|This would have been better if it actually fit my vehicle. It called for this filter for Santa FE built after Nov. 2003, but was wrong for mine built in Mar. 2004. Mine takes the CA9441.
B009EU5ZNO|3|The problem lies in mixing the two components. Although the dual syringe is supposed to release equal amounts of the two components, the plunger often gets a bit stuck, or the nozzles at the front are unequally clogged, and you get uneven amounts. The first time I just used what was dispensed and mixed it, and the result was a final result with the consistency and flexibility of dried silicone sealer, and not at all the expected hard material that could even be sanded. The second time I tried to just discard the excess material and the result was a little better, but still not quite right. It seems you have to get mixing ratio right to better than 5% or it will not work. That's alright if you have functioning dispenser, but otherwise it's frustrating guesswork.
B00496GUC8|4|Nice to have rubber on the wiper blade.
B0041MCLW8|5|just what i needed
B007H2RR78|5|Great product
B004XWUNPI|5|Excellent product and most importantly excellent sound and gives your ride a deep bassy Subie rumble. I own a 2005 sti which had a poorly built custom downpipe and a Xforce catback. I paired the installation with Invidia HS05SW1DPN Divorced Wastegate Down Pipe and omg the change in sound is A-mazing. The looks of the tip is also amazing.<br /><br />I did not chose the N1 racing model due to the comments I have read, I thought it will be unbearable for daily driving so I chose this model and I am really happy with both the sound level and the deep and bassy rumble of it.<br /><br />My recomendation will be installing this catback with the aftermarket polyurethane hangers, they are rock solid than the really soft rubber hangers.
B00IZNEYGU|5|The truck likes great.  Thank you so much.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Wonderful!<br /><br />I live in CA's HOT Central Valley.<br />Such a difference in interior temps now!<br /><br />My pet LOVES hopping in our leather upholstery vehicles now!<br /><br />My husband normally doesn't care for anything in/on his car. He noticed the difference today while driving to the coast.<br /><br />ShadeSox may be a Walking Billboard. I've been asked about them at the gas station and retail parking lots.<br /><br />Great as stocking stuffers. So light - great for mailing small, practical gifts to friends and family!
B00V523CGQ|5|Great product works fine.
B004TCZ7HQ|5|I had a different integrated light for my other bike. It cost $30 and was a piece of crap. It wasn't bright at all. And you get what you pay for. This one is much more expensive, but much worth your while!<br /><br />Amazingly bright! Works really well and fits great on my 2008 FZ6 except for one tiny thing. There's two screws that secure this light to the bike. I had a really hard time getting these screws all the way in. In fact, I'm riding around without them all the way in. They refuse to be tightened any further and to fix it I would have had to take the whole back end off all over again, so just be sure that you can tighten the screws all the way in. The screws are the screws from the original taillight.<br /><br />Furthermore, the ballast was kind of big and had to be tucked away under the plastics, but it wasn't too bad. For and integrated headlight though, it is so bright and noticeable! The people I ride with noticed right away. That was my biggest concern and honestly it should be yours too. Never compromise your safety for a little savings. Some people will say that its not very bright if you are looking at it from a high enough height. However, If the tallest vehicle were behind you (a semi), they would have to be less than 10 feet behind you to not see the light at full power. And how often will a semi get that close to you? NEVER. They know how to drive properly.
B0094JHNK8|5|Got it by the time I needed it thank you
B000CSZ5R8|1|Only had two of the correct thread bolts but those were to long..Three bolts needed to replace my 03 Buick century pulley. Had to find and use three other correct length bolts. I bought it thinking it included the long center bolt for install of new pulley. It did not had to make that also so you don't need to hammer new pulley on (not recommended)
B00096S214|5|It's nice
B000E5GJDS|3|ok, burnt out quicker than I expected.
B002INLAXI|5|Perfect replace ent on my 99 rockwood pup up. Easy install
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Just what we wanted
B000C9I8PS|5|Yery happy with the product. Thank you.
B00YWERD46|5|My boyfriend loves it
B0068MVD28|5|so much better to replace yourself than to pam MB $300.00 for a service.
B001A0F8VA|5|worth the money
B000LV7XR6|5|These wiper blades are exact replacement units for those on my 2012 Ford Explorer.  I pulled off an old blade and in very small letters somewhere on the rubber was the name Valeo.  The Explorer has a unique snap on attachment system and I'm sure you could get one of the common adapters sent with new blades to work but these are direct drop in replacements. Very glad I figured this out.  Blades were competitively priced and excellent quality.
B00DIRZDFY|1|i just got a 2 pair in the mail today and the seams aren't even at all the goggles are crooked
B00BTHNEDI|3|I don't really know how it works. I am in the process of returning them as they are not similar enough to a 921 bulb for them to work in my application (a 2009 Sonata). They are too big in multiple dimensions. Only the plug is the right size. It DOES fit in the socket. But the bulb won't fit in it enclosure.
B0068FUPH4|5|This thing works great! Fairly easy to install.
B003182XG2|5|excellent
B00W2OSK7C|5|New Jeep Renegade made in Italy,,,,,,,great fitting mats and just what I needed for backroading in Colorado/Uhta. Keeps the dirt and mud in the trays. Fast service at an affordable price.
B00MQAEN8C|4|Great price and awesome product!
B00S8ET146|4|Overall pretty happy. Fit just right onto my 2004.5 Dodge Cummins. And painted easily as well
B00V4049K2|5|So far i'm pleased as my car keeps it's fresh smell.
B002PUTC0M|5|works great at less than half the price the tool guys get for the same thing.
B004092XCK|1|Unlike what the title says, this is not a Flat Mirror. It has a convex shape.
B008M1WB7E|5|They fit perfectly and look great
B00FQ0ROZS|1|Only 2 worked and sent messages and no replays
B001656XEU|2|The lights on this bar are worthless and broken. Had to take the whole thing apart and buy numerous other parts to fix just that problem. Wiring harness plus was also broken. The molex connector was garbage and had to completely take that apart to also fix. The directions are in black and white and impossible to decipher and see what is going on in the pictures.
B00KFICISE|5|I likeeeeeee nice red. Compared my stock to my new
B00029J3AM|5|Put this muffler on my 2014 corolla love the sound nice and quite
B00666HTB0|5|Exactly what I needed at a great price.
B001KSCEZA|5|Perfect!
B0050ITM24|4|I gave it 4 stars because I'm getting some trouble with my bike shortly after installing this, but I'm pretty sure the filter isn't the problem. like 90% sure.
B007KPWU8I|4|Looks great. It is big and sticks out further than a stock HD horn cover. Only downside I see is it is thin metal. As such it gives a bit at the mounting point when my leg hits it.
B005R66BG4|5|Take your time. It took me about 4 hours. Use the cross stitch pattern. Use the clamps that the other reviewers mention. I didn't drill holes. Just push the needle thru and it'll be fine. Make sure to line it up exactly where you want it before starting to stitch. When you come to a spoke, approximate the leather to where it'll be when tight, then slide it backwards or forwards to get it to lay flat against the spoke before stitching. When you tie the knot in the end, leave a little bit of &#34;tail&#34; to the string, so you have something to tuck back into and under the stitches. I didn't do that, so I have a little frizzy bit sticking out that I need to trim back.
B00DK8Y92O|3|They are a great replacement for your standard stem caps, but they aren't too noticeable especially with my 20&#34; rims. Pretty pricey for something barely noticeable. &#34;Extra long&#34;, kind of, they're just barely longer than my stock caps, maybe by 1/4 of an inch, barely worth the price
B00LCAFP1G|5|Worked really well.
B0019I87PC|5|Perfect fit on my Walker replacement muffler and tailpipe.
B00SLTKIQ8|5|Stainless Steel Flush mount D-Rings for the new dock.  They look good and work well.  What more can you say.
B00YQEZIWQ|5|Good quality and it looks good
B00B3UYNY0|5|Very nice finish. Hope it holds up
B00YTYMBQE|5|My granddaughter loves the watch and that it us pink
B008C7RR4A|5|great
B00RGQ1KFU|4|great bag, wish it was a little bit larger, kept all my camping gear dry
B00QMZE4RW|5|Very bright! They work great!!!
B0002KKTT0|4|The product works great for its intended purpose.  I use it for my interchangeable knitting needles to keep the needles from backing off the cables.<br /><br />I wish the applicator wasn't so sloppy but it works.
B001GJ3E5C|5|great
B00WMPERJQ|5|Works great came on time and was well packaged
B000C5CESO|5|Worked really well till i lost it and had to buy another one haha
B00COWIVLM|4|I tried this oil.  Great product and value.  Oil lasted beyond the 7K recommended drain interval.  I went 9K miles and oil hardly darkened.  Very good product. I change oil every 10K miles with this product.
B007552HLI|5|Clutch Sticker. Went on my truck. Looks good.
B003XWEO8Q|5|such a noticable difference from stock 97 honda shadow ace grips! hand hardly goes numb any more!
B00A6GHI30|5|works great
B0022YCYL0|1|Nothing wrong with the set up. My problem with these handle bars is the description says that they'll fit on a 06 cbr1000rr... They do however after turning the handlebars my clutches we and front brake lever hit the front wind deflector and also the side fairings(mispelled)
B00AZ4TUNO|5|Fit like a glove. Arrived very well packed with instructions (not that I needed them, peel and stick). Looks great. Thanks.
B00Y1HUPWQ|4|Awesome.. Easily programed by the dealer
B00KTHUDCY|5|Wanted an add'l FOB & this was much cheaper than dealer's cost.  Be advised that with certain vehicles (like mine) there was an add'l expense of $50 for a competent locksmith to program this spare & my original, but still well below dealership pricing.
B009Z15OJM|5|Great product
B004W974KY|2|Did not fit well
B001N2O3PM|5|absolutely great I need to oder another pair!
B00LTX840A|1|Item failed after 34 days.  It is no longer eligible for return after 30 days via Amazon.  DO NOT BUY, your risk.
B00BN43ROS|5|A quality keychain to be sure!  The leather matches the fob, engraving is well done.  If you are a Dodge fan this is a great elegantly simple keychain.  Fits well and does not poke you when in your pocket it is well designed.
B000VU56Z8|1|It is an excellent fit for F150 (2014). It was delivered as expected
B00FPVJZEQ|1|I installed this and was smelling propane when the bottle is open.  I put some soapy water around the fitting at the bottle and it's blowing out propane where the hose fits through the fitting.  I've tried to reinstall and tighten, but to no avail.<br /><br />This might be a simple manufacturing flaw, but their QA needs some improvement.
B00CFPIYUG|5|Super fantastic! Bought two of them. Fits in my door cupholder perfectly!
B00PYCXMYK|5|I have used this now, and was very impressed by the results.  I used this in combination with Meguiars professional line of wax and glazes.<br /><br />Always make sure to use a claybar to go over the car first, as you do not want to cause scratches, when you are trying to make your car look better.  It takes time to do it right, but this parred with the Meguiars Orbital DA polisher, it makes the job so much easier.
B000EDOSKG|1|Leaks!!
B00FY80T3G|5|Great product!
B00COYNVPQ|5|It's great. Love it !! But shipping was disappointed. I got a free next day delivered but it turned out 3 days delivered. Just some excuses from the UPS driver.
B00030BFN8|2|retuned it
B010N7RW2S|5|I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest<br /><br />First off, this product comes in a zippered case that is very hard/sturdy. On one end it will come with a yellow strap which will make it easy to carry on hang up. Upon opening the case, you will find the jumper cable, a wall charger, a car charger, and a micro USB cable held inside by an elastic netting. The other side of the case will hold the battery pack secured by a sold foam. The kit will also include a 6-step guide on how to use this to jump start your car.<br /><br />On hot summer days, I like to roll my windows down if I am parked outside and I would often forget to turn off my car afterwards (it's a push-to-start vehicle). To no one's surprise, I've did it to myself earlier this week but this time I wasn't upset that the battery died, because I had a portable jump starter. Despite my excitement to test the jump starter, I quickly review the guide they gave, even though the step are simple enough, and I was able to get my car up and running again in a only few minutes. The best part about it was that I didn't have to pull up another car on my small driveway and rely on it to aid the jump start.<br /><br />This kit would definitely be a good one to carry to supply your power needs when traveling. It is capable of charging two devices simultaneously, jump start a car if you are stranded, and it of course has a flashlight attached to it with different flashing (SOS) modes.<br /><br />Compared to other external batteries, this one boasts strength and durability. With 15,000 mAh, this battery is capable of charging a device many times before it would need to be recharged. The device is a big and difficult to carry around, but that is where its strength and high capacity comes from. The LCD screen with the exact battery percentage is a cool feature that many other brands do not have. I've have bought and tested many external batteries before and most are satisfactory at their best. Some will start to lose their battery capacity quickly after some use or their 3-4 bar battery indicator isn't accurate enough. I also find that most external batteries I've bought only came with a micro USB cable to charge the battery pack and so I was surprised to find that this kit included a wall adapter charger and also a car charger.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great product
B00EQBAJSC|5|Excellent way to add that Harley sound. Deep and low. The slip-ons installed easily and sound great. Most reasonable pricing.
B0065MEZVW|5|Excellent  product  has all the right stuff to make you vehicle  glistening
B0031QEML8|3|Nice bright lights, but be careful of backing into snow banks.  It also makes installing and removing a hitch difficult as it blocks the hitch pin.
B00OMDAZT2|4|It's a good product and looks good on my car. I give four stars because I thought it was going to screw into the top of my car. My car has placed to screw one of these down but it still works
B00JB69438|4|It works fine, only problem is, the way they want you to wire it causes you to be able to turn it on any time, even with the car off, potentially allowing you to leave something on when you get out of the car and end up with a dead battery.  I solved this by cutting the power wire out of the light switch and hooking it to a ignition power wire that was only hot with key on, but to do this you have to change the harness, not a big deal, but works.
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect for in our older RV sink.
B003U95R6K|4|good quality, easy to install. came with all clamps and instructions. The only dislike was the sound is a low mellow sound coming from my 5.4,L F150.
B00590U9ZM|5|The new one i bought fit better then the original.
B0002RNSJ6|1|The converter is already not working after 2 uses. Would like to have a new one shipped to me that works! What a pain and waste of time this was!
B002DZJQ0A|5|Exactly what I wanted!!
B00HLW18T2|5|These lights are great for the price. I just installed them on my ranch truck, and have not used them enough to give a full review, but so far so good. I mounted two on the front on one switch, one on the headache rack to light up my bed on another switch and one up under the back bumper for a backup light on another switch. The lights seem well built, and I will be using them a lot this hunting season on my deer lease. We will see how well the hold up in the field.
B0081SR4AW|5|They do exactly what they're supposed to.
B002VJGZ66|5|Great shocks, glad i did myself it was easy<br />Cut the tab to keep brake line closed<br />Install on a rear of 2000 corolla, 2000 miles since install feels like a new ride
B000CL7KL4|5|Works great and fast shipping.
B00CA5PJ5O|5|I was very pleased that I was able to find a cheaper replacement for my remote without the $200 dealer price tag! After having them program it for me, I saved $200 for a perfectly good remote! The back broke off on mine (I have young kids who dropped my keys multiple times) but the seller sent me a replacement back at no cost! Super helpful and I am one satisfied customer!
B00EA0ZB7I|5|I LOVE IT SO MUCH this is my headlight now my old headlight just exploded lol
B00LU5JKJQ|3|The nose piece makes you look like you have a beak when you wear it--according to my teen.  Everything else is cool.
B0023W8LWC|5|Work great.
B000BVRZ74|5|I put 2 coats on the windshield after a carwash. so awesome how the rain just slides off .
B000CPI5Z0|5|I used SEAFOAM, TECHRON and now RED LINE and RED LINE is the only one that worked for me. Saw an immediate improvement in fuel economy, throttle response and restored power. Only one I will use from now on.
B000B66UUW|5|worked great
B00KC39BE6|5|My purchase arrived several days earlier than expected and fully charged. It was a perfect fit for my Jazz Portable Power 300 C. It also was much cheaper than offered from other dealers.
B003EOZH9S|5|i love these, they match my bumper, good quality
B00J14K0HO|5|LOVE IT!
B003FFTFBW|1|interstate battery in the worst battery ever. And the company will take advantage of their customers from the bottom to the top people. Avoid interstate battery
B000OV4ST4|5|I purchased this product and the first time I used it was last week.  It broke so I'm very unhappy because they have a 30 day return policy and I used it the first time in about 90 days. I purchased another power pack only to discover that I had burned up the brushes in the motor. The power packs work fine. I would recommend them to a friend.
B000KOVJK6|2|Mine was different model  but very close to this as it has same scale and the same vendor.<br />I am Giving it a two because it looked nice.  Accuracy was below expectations greater than +/- 5%.  It lasted about two years before it failed.<br />The good..... Nice looking meter, mine was blue indicator with light matching my F150 dash.<br />The bad....... Poor accuracy more than 5% low<br />  10 Volts on low side not enough to see voltage drop when engine is starting since meter reads low<br />  No  accessible adjustment for inaccuracy such as in the cheaper meters like Sunpro<br />  No magnetic shielding air core movements should be shielded for stray magnetic fields can affect accuracy.<br />A note on accuracy, These gauges are not instrument quality and are not expected to perform as such, but I think +/- 5% is reasonable for this application. analog gauges are meant to be glanced and not thought about so absolute accuracy is not a big concern but in this case the function of watching the starting voltage could not be achieved. The failure of the gauge was due to vibration as one of the coil wires was broken off the binding post.<br />I took Photos but it would not let me post them too large.
B000CAVOUI|5|excellent!!
B00M9LUVOS|5|Great chain everything was in the box included pre<br />ss link put it this way I've gave this chain hell
B00QJWTQOE|5|Very good lights bulbs for buy again
B0066QW6Y0|5|So far - 5 stars. Way cheaper, exact match for everything. Slightly different electric connector (that you plug into connector in black box) from OEM but still snap tight into it's spot.
B0014DIKFO|5|Couldn't remove my filter despite variety of wrenches. This one took it off easily
B00GSAUHB8|5|Arrived on time and is as advertised.  Well made sun protector is perfect - in fact, after checking a lot of similar items, we know this is the best available.  Great price for a great product!
B00JBIRBK4|5|Little difficult to install because the way my car is  but hundred percent worth it.
B005I60VZK|5|Great Thank you.
B00CH4C0I2|4|Arrived on time bought it for my wife she loves it😄
B00V3U6UE6|5|WONDERFUL people to work with!!!  Seat covers are perfect!!!  Shipping was super fast - THANK YOU
B000IYPS78|5|Fan came on time, no instructions but was an easy install. Worked as it should.
B008JB48WI|5|Works great. Almost a must have if you have two vehicles.
B00U6QFQAM|4|fit well and worked without an issue...nice to install without tools
B001GDEAP6|5|my car is office, this works perfectly.
B00U7FV5HU|5|These did not fit into my turn signal hole as they are larger in diameter than the stock bulb. Return process was very easy and quick.
B00T74X2GY|5|Strong
B000C94E4M|3|the muffler did not live up to it's name &#34;QUIET&#34;
B000LS7JH8|5|Trusted my life to these chains while swapping the springs in my car. Still here.
B003Y7TEFI|5|Great!!
B006THWK06|5|Great size. Big enough for two helmets.
B00MVHGKSQ|5|Nice license plate. Doesn't cover important information on plate.
B00UJL98EE|5|Excellent cord does what it's supposed to do but if your trying to find out pin set colors you can't open the cord to find colors  easily the ends are in a wax type mold it's tedious and time consuming find an open end obdii cord amazon sells them
B000GTUYDS|5|works great
B00OZ1HOAO|4|Pros:Love the sound & how light it is! Can't bet the price!, stainless steel Cons: No installation instructions,  Does not fit perfectly had to customize mount bracket, It does stick out so had to add a spacer on my 06 Dyna's foot brake pedal(mid controls) to keep it from hitting exhaust & it appears forward controls will not fit with this exhaust. Overall, I made it work on my bike and happy so far with look and function. This would be 5 stars if it was a better fit even if it was more expensive.
B001LHVOVK|5|Easy to use, great price point. Would recommend to anyone who believes knowledge is power. SES Light was on, ordered gas cap to replace 11 year old one, ordered this to read the code and clear it. Issue resolved for less than $40. Happy camper!
B00H94FJ1U|5|Best car fragrance
B00IWO4K8O|4|This did not work in our Pontiac, the clip wasn't the right fit, but it worked fine in our Ford.
B002QCT4AC|5|Worked great.
B0082365AQ|5|I got it to carry a big heavy windsurfing board for teaching and it's perfect for that purpose. Very light and compact, make it easy to put in your car.
B006N94BWU|5|Fit perfect, like oem
B00NVVGNR4|3|1&#34; too short for my V45 Magna
B003YMX0WG|5|Good heavy duty on time shipping
B000EDOSNI|5|Work fine
B001C04B0W|5|Son loves it!
B0036UI1OI|5|best chair yet. getter done.
B00WIZG9EG|5|Fits perfect .
B0009U7Y2I|5|This stuff is cheap and works very well for routine washes. Zero complaints.
B00WNGV0WG|5|Great Product, Fits my kids car seat perfectly. Made the road trip 1000% better as they could play without dropping everything on the ground.
B0000BVELA|5|Great
B000EDUUIA|5|Put this in my garage under the back drivers side tire. Works perfectly every time I back my car in & since it's so small, I don't trip over it! I used to have one of the standard cement parking stoppers, I nearly broke my foot & almost lost my balance too many times from tripping over it. So I had a neighbor remove it from my garage (it comes with the apartment that I live in) & management took it out of my garage, thank God! Then when I saw this small little bumper & read such great reviews, I decided to try it. And boy am I so glad that I did, I highly recommend it!
B000VUEDVQ|4|Just as described works great
B00D1CQVIY|5|Worked as described. Easy to install.
B00TKGHUYE|5|It's stood up to my husband weekly riding so far.
B00092893E|5|Good product to clean out your fuel system once a year.  Competitive prices!
B00BYP95DS|5|Great replacement really suggest getting this product if your old light is messed up
B0000AXRH5|5|Perfect funnel for a gas tank
B0002Q81WG|4|allowed me to position my trailer socket for the most convienant acsess
B00G49NYKY|5|Excellent tire glaze. Works a heck of a lot better than Armor All 78107 Detailer's Advantage Tire Foam... which is pretty good too.
B001H9GQR4|1|Both busted in the mud after the tire spun around 1-3 times. Total junk for any off road.
B009IKAARQ|5|My old car didn't have a cup holder.  These slip onto the door.
B003BZQ7H6|5|Good quality
B002YAF842|5|I was born and bred a Metalhead \m/
B000JWMHGE|4|Better than the nasty stock Rancho shocks
B001O7PNNM|5|I used this with my black and Decker buffer, looks great, did the wax too. Looks to be lasting a long time
B010VUZ99U|5|Super cute !especially for the price I wasn't expecting anything this nice ! Only thing is it didn't come with screws to install
B000GUUWWA|5|Belt was just what I needed the payment process was kind of a mess do to the fact that it was on my account then pulled then 3 days later back on it again
B010LE59KU|5|Worked as normal.  Note: it is a different shape as the original, but bolts in and operates the same.
B009MATM3U|5|Fits exactly for my Camry...
B00MLP30HW|5|Best cover I've ever seen.  No kidding!
B000B90MIU|5|It work good on my truck thanks.
B00MVHCUA8|5|So far, so good! Struts came packaged very well. Shipping took forever but the items themselves are just as good as any name brand strut right out the box. Will they hold up, who knows? But for the price, they are definitely worth it so far.
B001KW42ME|5|Bueno
B001CF5EIU|4|Great product. Exactly what it says it is. I took 1 star away because I have 1.5 in. tubing so it was too big. Not the products fault, but I wish they had a smaller option.
B009XPJVJY|5|this item is designed very well and installed pretty easy
B00ELQ2N22|5|Quality product
B001O03QT2|2|This pump does not fit a 2009 Dodge Ram 1500, even though it says it does.  The wiring harness does not fit.
B00HJXXIT6|5|Great product.  Love it.
B002ESEMXC|5|Replaced the old ones on my Jeep Wrangler.  They fit easily and secure.
B00RQNX0JC|4|Fit like a glove. A little lighter plastic than the original.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|It's a great product.
B00TP0XJHM|3|It helps with wind,but not with the noise. If you want to muff the sound then find something else
B00062YVLG|5|Worked great and the correct item.
B006N9H0HS|1|Don't but this crap
B00GRHRTEU|4|Good mirrors. Easy to get on and off, but you need to adjust them every time. Right mirror isn't convex, so it has limited view compared to regular mirror. They stick out farther than I anticipated, which made them harder to get used to.
B0023VKWXO|5|Fit perfect and easy to install
B00GK6Y64E|5|I really like it so far. It's my bottle opener and my soso just in case I need help or emergency when I go hiking or camping.
B008402YXE|5|Good quality, good price.<br />A nice upgrade that you can perform is to put a dial gauge on it, but it's not necessary.
B00F926L5W|5|Love it
B000YS5MHO|5|These boots are awesome. I love the inside ankle zippers, first off. So you don't have to do all those laces and the cover strap every time. Inside, my foot barely noticed they were enclosed in very sturdy boots, they were so comfortable to wear (while scootering, and short walking, not so comfortable to walk all day in, but that's not what I bought them for! :)<br /><br />Most importantly, THEY WORK. I dumped my scooter on wet train tracks a few days ago. The street slide almost frayed one of the laces in two, but the boots themselves just have a scuff. And my feet and ankles came out with only a small red mark on the top of each foot. The bruise on my left knee and left thigh is impressive, I think I'd have broken my foot if not for these fabulous boots!<br /><br />Now, where can I find replacement laces? ;). 'cuz the boots are FINE.  Buy them! :D
B00EVPLRXY|5|I put a tube of grease in and pumped grease.  If you have every fought with a grease gun before you know that's a big deal.  I might get the bigger version.

B003L9K9HQ|5|BEST lubricant and rust remover on the market ... barr NONE.  I tumble stones at work and the tumblers need oilo from time to time ... used to use a machine oil but it didn't last ... the Tri-Flow works for TWO WEEKS without adding.  I used to carry it at my motorcycle shop and loved it then but thought SOMEONE would come out with something better but NO ... Tri-Flow is STILL the best ...
B00HE6GQ6A|5|It has not kept the solicitors away (its too high on the door), but at least I can point to the sign when needed.  The static cling holds well.
B00FDW57VC|4|look good and fast deliver. good buss. thank you
B0093XZF6Y|5|Good product!awesome item.....
B00PKGYZ1O|1|Not good quality no way to adjust bass out. To much bass sounds bad!
B00HHVLU68|5|Just what i wanted and needed
B011NSX27A|5|Works really well & much easier than I expected. Many APP are available on the Google Play market. I used &#34;OBD Car Doctor free&#34; APP. I was able to read the Check Engine code and clear it from the APP instantly. This is just too cool. Well, all other stats of engine and fuel operations are abundant which I hadn't have time to play with. Definitely worth a buy on this product. The procedure is a bit like this if you are curious:<br /><br />- Find the ODBII port on your car (key is not inserted into ignition)<br />- Plug in this reader<br />- There is a green LED & a red LED (green LED flashes once and red LED stays on). This is different than most other instructions I found but it works.<br />- On your phone, turn on Bluetooth and &#34;Scan&#34;, give it a few seconds and you'll see &#34;OBDII&#34; device shows up<br />- Hit pair with this device, it asks for PIN, type in &#34;1234&#34; and pair<br />- Now, install and open the app on your phone and hit &#34;Connect&#34; and select the new bluetooth device you just added<br />- DONE... just have fun with the APP

B00067BX9E|4|Contrary to the other reviewers, these DO, in fact, fit all 520 series lights. The fact that nobody else could figure out how to make the covers fit is astonishing to me. You must remove the metal ring which surrounds the lens/reflector in order for the cover to fit. This is annoying to say the least, but technically these DO fit the lights.  I took off 1 star because it seems like they should fit without needing to remove the ring - I'm not a fan of having to choose between one or the other; seems like poor design to me. It also seems like the rings add additional weatherproofing.  ***UPDATE: I contacted PIAA in regards to my concerns about the ring adding weatherproofing. PIAA stated that the ring is ONLY designed to accommodate the plastic grille and serves no other functional purpose. I'm still leaving off 1 star, however; why design it in such a way where part of the light must be removed in order to make these fit?
B0037N33SS|5|My son loves these for his bike. He wore out the green grips he had on his bike before.
B00J52R3AE|5|ok
B008P16Y4W|3|Just installed this a few hours ago. Sounds amazing & my turbo is loving the extra air flow... BUT i must say I'm a lil disappointed that the mounting bracket after the cat didn't match up with the stock mounting point on my car. Its a few inches too short.. Other than that its good for the price. This is the cheapest downpipe out there for Subaru's other than CNT's but i guess its true what everyone says.. You get what you pay for.
B000VTULM2|4|Very good
B000AS3D42|4|works wonderfully keeps my oil filtered in my 2003 Ford Focus
B00HWI39OC|4|Worked as expected but do wish the instruction for the wiring were in English. Had to do some work to figure out which wire does what.
B00OQTC9OQ|5|It takes a little effort to install these covers, but the time you spend will be rewarded with the best looking covers I have ever seen.  The instructions are not very detailed, but if you simply sit down and look at how they are made, it will become obvious how to put them in.  My vehicle  is a 2001<br />Toyota Tacoma.  When I first bought it, I installed some nylon covers to protect the original seats. They lasted for 12 years, but looked awful from day one.  A couple years ago I replaced them with a new set that also looked crappy.  Not only that, they started to fall apart about 2 months after they were installed.  I installed these covers today and they fit perfectly and look great.  Time will tell how durable they are, but my original seats are well protected and the inside of my truck looks clean and neat.
B000JFL7RG|5|Great product that's works just as good as my Matco hydrometer. Also made the USA!
B00E1L72RS|3|Item blocks sun very well, kinda small for my SUV. Item did not come in proper packaging and did NOT come with sucktion cups

B00WNE24A0|5|Awesome product
B003LT3UOU|5|I replaced all the brake lines on my98 Ford Windstar van using this. This tool was exactly what was needed. I routed all the new lines exactly as the original factory ones, using the old lines as guides for placing the bends in the new line. I started with 5 foot straight poly coated lines with fittings on them, that I got from the local parts stores. I cut off all the fittings because my van used metric ones and they were not available. I considered using coiled line from the auto parts store but when I was done I was glad I went with the straight sections as I didn't have to fight uncoiling the line and working with straight pieces was a lot easier to work around. Bending was the easiest part of the process, although the most time consuming, up to an hour or more spent forming each line, making sure to match the angles, rotations and bends of the old line. I purchased this tool and the Eastwood Brake Line Forming Pliers [[ASIN:B002RCGVDO Eastwood Brake Line Forming Tool Pliers - Bender]] I used the pliers only a couple of times where I had to tweak a bend manually when I was past the area I had been working on. You work from one end of the line and move continually towards the other end. I was glad to have the pliers in these situations. Between these two tools, there was not one bend I was not able to create. Like I said, all factory replication of the routing of lines. The price is good at $32 and yet they work like a $100 tool. I used a small amount of oil on the rollers when forming. I was well pleased and I highly recommend. All the bends of the originals were able to be replicated.
B00D01V5KA|4|Really like it. Only issue that I encountered was that the screws that were supplied were too small for my car. So I had to switch them with larger screws that I had on hand. I looks great now.
B000Q6PYWC|5|Weathertech has top-quality merchandise that fits well the first time!
B00V95AQZ4|1|Rubber broke when properly installed. Junk
B000ARTZPO|5|IT WORKS!!!<br />I could go on for some time about this stuff, but people don't have the time. UNDERSTANDABLE.<br />I know it's kind of spendy $13, but... IT WORKS!!!<br />I had a three foot oil spot on the drive-way due to transmission leakage. &#34;Seals are going&#34;, a friend told me. Another friend said to buy &#34;Lucas tranny fix.&#34;, Now get this, because it leaked so badly, I'd been hauling around, about a quart and a half of transmission fluid, DONE!!!  I am so done with that!!  When I'd get to the bottom of the one jug I'd buy another and start in on the second jug. It's Stupid...<br />Month after month of this non-sense. And no I don't have the $1600 for a transmission rebuild. Fluid is cheaper... @ about $4 a qt for the good stuff...<br />Wait a minute, in about 6 months the LUCAS will have paid for it-self.<br />If it does not work for you, I'd say the money was still not wasted. You now, KNOW that you have a very serious tranny problem. ENOUGH SAID. Happy Motoring!!!
B00K65PKX6|5|Performance chip works beautifully. Seem to be burning less fuel and throttling a lot better! Definitely recommend!

B00RDMKW1K|5|Used this to convert my acrostic drums to electronic
B00F9LPIAC|5|Half the weight and more power its a no brainer. I put this in my zuma and it works better than anticipated
B00U5UBQE4|4|Works great and easy to install.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Works great! Follow the directions step by step, and you won't have any problems.
B009J3L4RM|2|Bot bright at all. Good value for the money
B00NBMV2M4|1|After handling this and touching my face skin has been severely ireatated and face got puffy I think there's some kind of chemical on It (ware gloves)
B001DKPXU8|5|AWESOME STUFF
B0082BIU8S|2|The description for this product is misleading. These covers do not have the ability to product the seats from anything other than wear from friction.<br /><br />The holes in the mesh are too large, allowing for crumbs and any other particle to either get stuck between the seat cover layers, or make it to the seat.<br /><br />Also, these do not repel or prevent any liquid from reaching the seats.... These do not help protect the seat..<br /><br />The quality of the stitch looks good though... That's about it. I had to return these for a different cover.
B010HDR11A|5|Exactly as described
B00KTIUG5C|5|works great
B00JA3BMDW|4|Bought to make soap, tested some food temp was right on
B00TP2VTY0|1|Useless
B006N8LUDE|1|The harness they sent me was wired incorrectly. The pins on the radio that were positive and ground were on the left and on the harness they were on the right side. So I had to cut off the plastic guide channels on the harness and flip it 18&#34; degrees for it to work.<br /><br />If you look closely the 12v and ground pins are larger than the rest. Compare that to your harness. Mine was flipped. No problem for me because I know how to wire these things. But for a first timer, be careful.
B00VXQOYS4|5|This was a great kit, everything that was needed was included and it came with a bunch of other little goodies.  I installed this on my 99 Blazer 4door 4wd TrailBlazer edition.  Gave me about 2&#34; of lift in the rear and I was able to crank the Torsion Bars to level it.
B000NCOKZQ|5|works
B00WTJ5C44|1|Light was white but didn't light up much. Better off with the oem
B000TGNVGK|5|I've had these pliers for 7 years now.  I got them in Japan.  They are definitely an integral part of my tool kit.  Not one of those tools you buy and use once but I mean use frequently.  They've developed a bit of surface rust but still cut clean and pivot totally smoothly.  I use them to grip and twist things as well as side cut things like wires or tie wraps.<br /><br />5 stars!  A great tool!
B00BMH5XGQ|5|Excellent product. Exact match.
B0040D2QVE|1|neither clips nor fastens as it should.. however looks like oem, have no idea what is wrong with them.. door panel keeps goin off.. old original ones however still hold well. will have to buy mopar which are too much expensive (((
B000C2UGZK|5|item was a perfect fit with a great price for this item. good buy
B00JH3EU6G|5|Excellent
B00ATC9UZK|4|I really like this scent but it only last a few days in my car. I even used the spray on the trees but it was also very faint.
B00RZ4YTCO|5|DID what its made for
B00I250MIU|5|This is a genius product, something you would see the Sharks go crazy over on Shark Tank.  Heat em up a little with a hair dryer to get them more flexible and put them on.  Take them off now and then to clean around them and put them back on.  They look good and work well.  This will be the first new car I've had that won't have scratches behind the door handles from my wedding ring.  Hooray
B00E3W7RWA|5|Great touch Its a small interior upgrade but you will be surpriseed at how many people will notice it especially with the stickers for the cup holder
B00F47Z2J8|2|The lights work half the time
B000T7HE7Q|2|After two seansons of being used half of the LEDs on one of the lights are so dim they are basically not functioning. Similar in appearance to what you see on older LED-based trafic lights: some bulbs are bright and clear, some are dim and dark.
B000EDQR50|5|Needed one, so now I have a spare.

THEY ARE ALL AFFORDABLE.  Buy now!!! You will love them.
B001DIECCK|5|Best plugs on the planet. Gentle reamer that doesn't grind at the broken cords. Only plug I know of that comes with lube for those really tiny holes or those very, very strong tires (you can also use it on the reamer, just be sure you don't create a 2nd hole in the tire liner or the plug won't work).<br />I only use the lube when needed, and that's only on 16 steel ply tires. Those are insane to get a plug into. Any plug.<br /><br />I plugged tires for 5 years as a kid with these things and we rarely had comebacks and those were almost always due to installation issues.<br />As a test, I plugged a tire on my Mustang in a tread block so it would have pavement contact and cut it flush and immediately tested it. It took 7 hard launches with copious wheelspin to pull the plug out. I then replugged it, ran the tire 500 miles, and retested - now that the plug had worn in and had time to vulcanize, it took nearly 20 hard launches (wheelspin is fun!) to pull it out. Not recommended for tread block installation on cars that get used hard (track time for example -  but in the grooves is usually OK).<br /><br />Not supported by the manufacturer, but I've run as many as 4 at a time in a single hole to limp home in LT and car tires and motorcycle tires.<br /><br />Otherwise, I've never pulled one out. I use them on my cars, trucks (4x4 rock crawling, etc.), and motorcycle tires.<br /><br />This kit stays in my Jeep. I only wish it came with sidecutters for pulling out the foreign objects.
B00EECM5FI|5|Price was the best I could find for replacement bulbs on my '08 VW GTI.<br /><br />Installation was a colossal pain, but that isn't their fault (thanks, VW.) You either have to disassemble a bunch of the car and take the whole assembly out or work blind in a 5&#34; hole. I elected to work blind and it took around a half hour to get it swapped. Much of that was me not knowing what I was doing, though.<br /><br />Given the difficulty of install, I only replaced one. They recommend changing both because of differences in color of the light. I see a little difference (the light changes as the bulbs age, and my other bulb is original) but it's good enough.<br /><br />I miss the days when you didn't have to comparison shop to find headlights under $100.
B00EC0Z53G|5|I panicked when I heard the shattering glass of my mirror after jousting with a fast food drive-in restaurant menu board. I saw dollar signs in my head. Fortunately, the only damage was the glass itself popping out of the housing, which sustained a barely perceptible scuff mark. It was a longshot, but I checked out Amazon and found this among my choices. It fit perfectly and was easy for me to install (I'm no mechanic) in a matter of minutes. It looks like the original, and has lasted from the time of install in late January 2015 until present (late August 2015) with no sliding, falling, chipping, or any other flaws.
B006WZOVHA|5|Seems to work great so far. Pins and shank are flexible, but still small and sturdy enough to backprobe some rather annoying connectors for an ABS control module. Having used pins (like for sewing... not the best) and alligator clips before, this is a far better and safer solution. Would highly recommend!
B001KO6QD0|5|Great Thank you.
B00280BFZY|5|Perfect fit on my Camry
B000CB3ZOU|5|good product
B00F1UCLB0|5|ok great but wrong one returned
B00HFQKB6U|4|These clips aren't the highest quality, but they get the job done - especially for only a couple bucks. I expect to lose a few clips whenever I get the oil changed, so these clips make up for that.
B002I9OKOS|5|fit great onto the grille.
B0058NY4L0|4|I had a slight irritation, on my inner thighs, (where the seam edge did not cover the seat completely) after several (5/6) hours of riding.  Hold down strap did not work with a GW seat.
B003CKFKI2|5|Fine fit, well made, just what the doctor ordered.
B00KTHXYO8|4|Great product just what I was looking for.
B001QIYAQ0|3|This pulled the SRS service airbag code for a 2007 Chevy Tahoe ltz 4x4.  That paid for the scanner in diagnostic fees and I have a new toy for the garage.  Just make sure you Google the code to find out the culprit.  The scanner gives vague info on what the code means, but a quick search and found what I needed to fix.  No more service airbag light...
B000IZ0THQ|5|I installed this in my 2006 Hummer H3. The old one was seized in pretty good, but this one came with some antiseize already on the threads. No more CEL and it's been almost one year since the install. Good product and good price.
B0083G3AXC|5|Just what I needed.
B00C7I4PL8|5|Using on 10 x 10 canopy to hold light string. Working well and makes for easy set up and take down.
B004BFW0EO|5|I purchased a new truck and it was killing me that there were water spots on all the chrome, windows, and mirrors. This product worked great to remove the water spots on all the surfaces. I highly recommend.
B000BZTIG6|5|Great kit, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS caliper. They look different than the OEM parts, but nevertheless work seamlessly. I used them when installing the StopTech 126.33098 SR/L Brake Rotor, as one has to remove the caliper for this and while you could use the old bot, this gives you the peace of mind.
B003FO2O1G|5|Great low profile design and extremely effective!
B00GBSE83K|5|Awesome product for painters. Saves so much time when you are on a ladder and don't want to have to keep running up & down to grab your tools. Crucial to the trade!
B009DK1OQ2|5|For the price you cant beat it.. Worked nicely on my '02 Altima.  Be warned there are NO instructions.. but if you download the instructions for the K&N typhoon intake they will work just fine for this Intake.  For less than $60 I got a great intake system and the Air filter is very good quality.
B0011FIN34|5|Great condition easy to assemble

B00L81T466|1|this top is awful! it unhooks very easily and I have had a surplus of rain and bugs get through!!. every time it rains the inside of my doors get soaked. it doesn't stay on strong at all!
B00480J4PU|1|Just buy regular bulb replacements. These do not increase the usefulness of your regular headlights and burn out within a year. Save your money and buy the &#34;lower&#34; grade
B00G1YF068|1|Got them neither one worked both bulbs open.
B002G2YAVU|1|I bought one of these for my ridgeline and worked great for 1 week til the ac clutch failed!  I just ordered another one and have to return the bad one so I will update this review if I have better luck with the next one.  There goes my Saturday.
B00C5MYYSA|1|the fan is IR not RF controlled. I purchased this fan so I could control form the bed room but it will only work if the remote can see the fan. Called Boat and Rv  Accessories and explained that the product is not as advertised and ask to return the upgrade kit and replace my original control box ($40) because the control that I originally had on the fan could not be reinstalled because I had to cut the wire at the base of the unit. Leah at Boat and Rv said she I could return the unit but she would not replace the original control even though they had the wrong information posted for the upgrade kit so I guess the customer fault they had the wrong spec posted. Fan-Tastic fan are great fans but will never buy from Boat and Rv again.
B004RZU3Q0|1|My boat/trailer gets dunked in the Pacific every weekend, both are washed thoroughly with fresh water after use. I started experiencing problems with these lights after 4 weeks and they were completely useless 6 dunks in salt water.  Do not buy if you regularly launch in the ocean.

B00G6IUUV4|5|I bought this to color the leather on a replacement arm rest for my 1995 Cadillac.  The color I needed for that car was evidently only used for a year or 2, and no one makes it these days.  I used the Jaguar Phantom White after finding a color chart out there in cyber-world which showed that the color was a reasonably close facsimilie of my car's interior.  About 10 very light layers of spray applied over the course of a week turned a medium brown arm rest white.  Victory for the Cadillac!  I set up a clean space in my basement workshop where I could just leave the arm rest on newspaper and spray without worry that the overspray would dirty everything else, and light coats gave me a nice looking and feeling finish.  I'd buy this spray again if I needed to touch up or color leather in another application.
B0002NYDRG|5|Works great, had to youtube a bit to know how to work it but it (along with my powered impact drill) did the job on these crazy torx screws.
B00MXWSI4S|1|Don't waste ur money they are no good don't fit trust me I have pictures to prove what I'm saying and some the clips don't fit also have pics
B004M8LAEQ|5|This works well in a motorhome cabinet. Replicates how the original manufacturer did 110VAC installation. I used it for placing a dedicated inverter socket.
B0050SFVO2|5|I used this to trouble shoot my van.  Now the van is running.
B00LQHR9GE|1|If I could do 0 stars I would have not waterproof.. 3 leds were not working strait out the box ... but it's what you get for being cheap
B000FW4MJ8|5|A mechanic told me I need to change my brake fluid in the brake reservoir because it was dirty.  He wanted one hundred dollars to do the job. Yikes! I assumed he was lying since most mechanics try to get you to do more repairs on your vehicle. My vehicle is 15 years old and has never had the brake fluid changed before. I did some research on when and why you change brake fluid and I checked on youtube on how to change the fluid. Seemed pretty easy (and I'm a girl) so my friend and I did it ourselves (2 person job). I purchased 9 bottles of this 12 ounce bottle of brake fluid here on Amazon.  I wanted to do my other vehicle (Bronco II) too, which is almost 30 years old and has never had the brake fluid changed either. My bad!  I ended up purchasing 6 more bottles of this 12 ounce brake fluid 7 days later.  Why?  Because they were only 2 dollars for each bottle here on Amazon. Each vehicle used up between 3 and 4 bottles and we're going to do 2 more vehicles. That's a savings of four hundred dollars. There was a definite change in the feel of the brake pedal after changing the fluid.  Especially in the 30 year old Bronco II. Glad I changed the fluid.  The fluid color went from a darkish green color to clear.  WOOT, WOOT!!
B006TYVB40|5|Looks great on my car
B00XN6LS9K|4|Not the highest quality but decent for the price. Very easy to install, took less than half of an hour.
B0092KVYGI|5|work great
B00OO2ITLW|5|Close to perfect.  He-v6 logo didnt snap in quite the same as before but otherwise very nice compared to OEM.  Includes screws but not subaru logo
B00FEQTTTS|5|good product.
B00IFMOVE6|2|This seat cover was shorter in length than a previous seat cover bought last year.<br />Did not cover entire seat as shown on this sample. It barely covered the top portion of the car seat.
B000I4JPZE|1|would not lift good tire enough to remove flat. if your rv is more thank10k not for you!

B00SZK26T0|3|Ok.but not nearly brought enough for projector fog lamps
B004A6PLU4|3|Does not fit the 2010 Hyundai Elantra Touring GLS like it says it will. Way too big.
B0068MRJEO|5|Matches Mercedes OEM part. Worked perfectly and fixed my hot start issue
B004QEKG8C|2|It's cheap and lightweight, but you get what you pay for. The expanded aluminum mesh sagged under the weight of water jugs, and the whole carrier assembly now sags to one side after just one trip. If you carry only light stuff on it and stay on smooth, paved roads it's probably okay. It comes with no reflectors and I'd recommend adding one at each side for safety. The load rating makes the carrier sound sturdy. It's not.
B00BITHBOU|1|3rd one . First broke installing, 2nd arrived broke. Got the 3rd one in and 2days later fell off. Same issue every time , top tabs break !
B0082K00WS|4|A good belt for the price, rode every weekend since the purchase and can't fault it.
B000BOLETQ|4|Easy to install.  All you need to install is an alcohol wet-wipe to clean the surface prior to install, and they are provided.  Would have given 5 stars, but the front ventshades on both sides had the clear protective wrap removed, and had signs of prior use.  Maybe was a previous return....?  Fit my 2004 4Runner 4WD 4.7L V8 Limited just fine.  We'll see how long they last...
B00C7I4JXC|4|Not bad  for the price ... the seams are raw ... so they will frey out eventually ...
B007BKG9IY|4|great part was the exact fit for my car will buy from seller again.
B00449RC3G|5|Awesome cheap fixed me right up
B008SEM724|5|The fog light can fast and fit right in and worked. I would order more from this vender
B004I0TH0W|4|Color doesn't quite match the original unit, but fits fine and does the job. Easy to do if you know cars a little.
B003Z6B4O2|3|Full size eight ball as advertised, but did not fit the slap shifter in my boyfriend's Mustang.  I got it for him as a gift, wondering if I can return it.
B001AVU3U0|5|Quality sprocket, looks great and will order again in the future.
B00MTHPLUQ|4|These arrived a few days early and right in time for my boyfriend's birthday. They fit perfectly on his 2014 Honda Civic Si. The key chain is kinda stupid as you can hand tighten them down yourself. He gets compliments on them when he goes to the car meets by other car owners. The only downside is that they don't lock and would be nice if they locked. I'm a bit worried that someone will come and steal them off his car. Overall though, they are great and the batman symbol is clear and clean. He loves them and was so excited about them.
B00L2X2KYI|5|Shipping was fast! Product was excellent, and looks so good. Installation took me 30min, but it was well worth the modification. I'd definitely buy they product again...great job guys.....
B007TY06JA|5|works and installs like OMC parts
B000CQ466G|5|Broke chain trying to pull a truck out of a ditch. Called company and they immediately sent me replacement links. Amazing customer service a+++ and great quality chains. Was my own doing spinning a hole through asphalt that broke the crosslinks
B009VOQ05U|4|Very good design and fit. Versatile design. Freight is a killer!
B000BVRZ74|4|This does work but it is too much work to apply and buff off. I will just keep using car wax.
B00CVVUQ50|5|Hubcaps fit perfectly on my MSR HD signature rims love it!!
B00CGTVCIC|1|When arrived, it smelled awful.  It was a mistake to put on the steering right away as the strong smell lasted for more than a week.  The smell is that of a bad chemical and it is very strong.    I suggest you leave it out in the sun for 5-7 days before installing.  I give it one star, not zero, because it looks good but I am skeptical that wheel cover will last because it is not made up of real leather. Disappointed in Amazon for allowing products with false claims/description.
B00CGILCME|3|To expensive
B00OMYK83O|4|Easy assembly - switched from white to black and looks great on my RV
B000VKXBY6|5|Fits great!
B00551DZ3S|4|This works pretty well.  It does scratch up the bikes though, so I just cut up a pool noodle to cushion.  I can tell that the steel is pretty mild and seems like it is rusting pretty quick.  I'd advise putting a good layer of car wax on it and a dab of grease on the bolt threads for protection.
B00XPSK8PQ|5|Bought this to replace a damaged axle on my 5'x10' utility trailer. I verified the dimensions before I ordered and it fit perfectly. It's a Lippert brand axle and the quality looks great. I opted for the standard free shipping and it took less than a week. Would definitely buy again.
B006RHY0D8|3|I'm not that pleased with this product.  I find it difficult to apply and don't feel that it really covered any scratches.  I was hoping more for a paint brush tip as that would have been easier to apply, but the pen design is difficult to paint to flow properly considering most scratches are on a vertical surface rather than horizontal.  I wouldn't buy again.
B000MWGW0S|4|Can't be installed with nerf bars (unless you cut the bars down). Otherwise a good product.
B003KKF9LW|5|excelente producto
B003YNAUNC|5|Usual good quality of a Mann filter
B007LICJ0S|4|The top teeth cover the state on the plate. Not sure if that's an issue for cops, but otherwise, It is so awesome.
B004Z2PBHG|5|Perfect!
B000C545JA|2|I ordered replacement sway bar links for both sides of my vehicle. Part K903041 was great and as expected. This part was clearly used and repackaged. It was not sealed in a bag as the other one was. The zerk fittings that were put on the part were not the ones that typically come on a Moog sway bar link. The part had some scratching on it, as if a pliers were gripping it to hold in place for installation. The one that I was replacing was literally broken into 2 separate pieces, so I used the one I received. Given an alternative though, I would have much rather returned it for a new part (as I paid for). The part itself seems to be constructed well and I would recommend it to those interested, as long as you trust Amazon quality department to make sure the part they are shipping is actually new.
B00KVY73J6|5|Outstanding!
B00DBEO4WC|5|Asesome product, easy to install and looks great.
B000WKATCM|5|Works great, as expected. With a grunge brush, you can make your chain look like new.
B008CRHQM8|5|Great discs, assembled on a 2010 VW EOS, the difference in Left and Right for the rear axles is arbitrary, so you can do whatever you want in left/right symmetry, these brakes are 'single' layer metal, so the venting doesn't matter. Keep in mind, that the wear on the pads will be slightly higher than before (eg more dust)
B00KTJ9V16|1|Did not work...the dealership said it was a bad remote. I had to pay $46 for them to try and program this one. And they want to charges me $168 for entirely new one.
B000P7O5DG|4|Haven't used it a lot, yet. It is working, so far!
B0002JMDCW|5|Works great!!
B001GRMWJS|5|great product!
B000C9M1G0|1|Poor quality assurance. Thread issues caused install challenges and took extra work to fix.
B010154MKW|5|Delivered on time and as described.
B00062YM1K|5|AS EXPECTED
B000KZ2CBA|5|Was easy to re program  and didn't cost me $200 like the dealership quoted me
B0068C6CAQ|1|Terrible paint job, paint drips and runs everywhere and too few coats. Better off painting it myself and saving the difference. Plastic is what you'd expect for the price. Just hte paint that is very disappointing.
B00JK322MW|5|The construction on these jumper cables is very solid and sturdy. The alligator clips are easy to open and they stay on the battery terminals well. They also come in a nice storage case.
B008032L1U|5|Great part easy to install
B00G06HYLG|4|it works as expected
B00JBICWEO|2|They look good but when I got them I noticed one had a small crack in the lens. I already had the car torn apart so I put them in anyway. I had no choice I should have returned them but I needed to drive my car to work. Needless to say the one with a crack has condensation inside of the lens. Looks like crap .
B003E1W41K|5|Love it!! Looks great on my black Z
B004Q3KE12|3|little to small
B0009IQXCC|5|Works well and smells even better.
B000TYVU1U|5|thank you ford love spending my money but the doorman is the best choice for the repair of the spark plug blowing out of its hole the tool worked perfect i wouldnt buy anything else unless you cant work on cars and want to be out there all day number 3 and 6  plugs have came out on my sons 94 f-150 doorman has fixed the problem twice and only spent about 1 hour for the fix to be complete thank you again ford love working on your trucks
B00EQ1IOS4|5|Haven't needed to use it yet. However, form the looks of it, will do the job when called in to duty.
B00LA9B4R8|4|Nice piece of equiptment. saved me from having to buy a new barell.
B000E7SY16|5|Came in handy during my recent move
B004WG5KVC|5|awesome product recommend it for sure
B001V8U12M|5|Lost my first one. Once you compare manual to power cranking stabilizers up/down on a trailer they become indispensable.
B00MAQMZSW|2|Product seems like it will do the job.  Gave it 2 stars because one of the fenders had a slice in it upon arrival and will not hold air.  Tried multiple times to seal the slice but have been unsuccessful.  So instead of 2 useful fenders, I only have 1.  Other than that I have no complaints.
B00UU00Y6U|5|Love it! It was just what I was looking for! It would be so awesome if you guys had the sally head that I like! :)
B00I5BAUCE|5|Great rack for 2 bikes. Works great on my Forester. Loading the bikes is now a breeze.
B00SGN54G8|2|The nose protection was loose and kept comming undone. All in all okay goggles but definatley not worth the price. Hard to explain other than to say I could have bought better and cheeper goggles at walmart.
B005C914RM|3|well its not like the stock mirror that came with the car, its looks pretty cheap looking for the actual price and it being made of plastic. I just saw the same mirror by a different brand for $10 less. honestly I hate the way it looks when im driving it reminds me of the mirrors in a fun house. I needed it urgently so its the reason why I made the purchase.
B00GJMDTH4|5|worked perfectly and is in daily use now. But had to modify installation where there was good access room. Well made.
B00XZ9NP32|3|These key are exactly like the factory keys except for the FORD logo on the back. I was able to get them up and running, but no thanks to the instructions provided anywhere by anyone. In general, the internet instructions and the car owner's manual are wrong. In specific, the instructions that came with the key were wrong as well. The 8 repetition series for the REMOTE programming is for the Econoline not the Escape. The Escape uses 4 in 6 seconds and is confirmed by a chime not by the door locks. When you program a new key using the two admin keys, the owner's manual has you &#34;remove the key from the ignition&#34; at the end. That's wrong. After the 6 second wait you must start the car or the key is not finalized.<br /><br />So here are the facts from my experience with a 2013 Ford Escape SEL:<br />1) Only ONE key came with the car and you need TWO &#34;Administrative&#34; keys to make more keys yourself. Any good locksmith has a scanner and can program an additional key from the ONE key you have. Ford Dealer = $200 versus Locksmith was $65 broken down into $30 to Laser grind the new key and $35 to &#34;scan&#34; it into your car.<br />2) As soon as you have TWO administrative keys, you can get additional keys ground for $30 and then you can &#34;scan&#34; them into the car yourself. (or - at least I did)<br />3) The &#34;My Key&#34; program is NOT a neat way to add keys. It doesn't work that way at all. It take a perfectly good Administrative key and turns it into a &#34;limited use&#34; key that you will want to return to Administrative status as quickly as possible. Yes, it is possible. I did it. No, I can't remember the steps I took to do it.<br />4) The locksmith may hand you back a key that will start your car, but the REMOTE is a separate issue and may not work until it is programmed separately (see the &#34;4 repetitions&#34; above). You can do this yourself, but you have to do ALL of them because it clears out all of them and starts over.<br />5) The Downloaded &#34;Owner's Manuals&#34; (all 4 or 5 versions) were all wrong at the end (for me) when they say to &#34;remove the new key from the ignition.&#34; This never gave me a single working key. I remembered doing a different car and that you had to &#34;start the car&#34; with it to actually activate it. That produced the only additional working key I ever made for the Escape.wnloaded &#34;Owner's Manuals&#34; (all 4 or 5 versions) were all wrong at the end (for me) when they say to &#34;remove the new key from the ignition.&#34; This never gave me a single working key.

B005SZISDI|5|Worked great fit my OE remote for 03 Buick perfectly Key chain loop had broke off old one.
B009DJWOZI|5|Fit perfectly. Highly recommend
B00UQJPQ7W|5|cool looking
B00SBRTX0W|5|Works great and was easy to install
B000CO8ZQU|5|Nice and heavy duty
B00E1SL574|5|WORKS GREAT
B001KQ43SS|5|Ordered two, came with jumpers, worked fine
B00JQQSFCO|5|Fit perfect and works fine. Just wished it was all chrome like the original.
B007P74AP2|5|Works  great !!!
B004ULN610|3|only for CB not amateur radio, not in description.
B003AN1UA8|5|This unit is awesome............. Already had it shut down motorhome due to low amperage for air conditioner. Nice to have the readout that shows how many amps are being used. VERY TIGHT TO GET WIRING INTO TERMINALS would be ok to have the box bigger to make it easier to wire. That being said this is a great product so you do not have to worry about plugging one in at camp ground and someone stealing it. IT DOES HAVE A HUM BUT I INSTALLED WITH RUBBER SPACERS and it is not to bad. I run a fan at night anyway but if you do not it could be annoying if it is in the bedroom drawer space as mine is.
B008G22G1A|5|gr4eat  product for this price, fit my car perfect, looks good
B00KTIAREM|5|This was a great option versus buying from the dealership (where the price was a great deal more). We've had this for over a year and it's worked perfectly. I would definitely recommend.
B001TI5IIQ|5|I just finished shining my headlight that was getting foggy. The process was very simple. When I used the lens cleaner, I had to rub the surface of the lens, and within about 5 minutes and I began to see clarity. My headlight looks brand new! A mechanic told me that I should get rid of these headlights and replace them with LED lights because one of them looks so foggy. Hell no! These look just fine now. 5 stars!
B001GMZRQ8|5|Glad
B000FGEF9G|4|Works good with a little fiddling around on the initial install.
B00C9FIC4K|5|Absolutely the best V Strom 2012+ cover, fits perfectly, in the front it matches up with the mirrors, on the back there's loads of room for covering a top box & side boxes. Even has a strap to hold it down in the wind. Has a few places for locks. Overall great product, not made from cheap plastic. Fits in its bag pretty easily.
B000EPX8VO|4|Seems fine
B0065N3Y6S|5|Works
B002WHABFS|5|Only 2 months of use so not really enough time to review, but after 2 months of use, ball joint is tight, bushings are firm, paint is starting to fail.<br />So if keeping the underside pretty is important to you, then add a few extra coats of paint to them before installation.<br />These include the ear so you can install the heavier sway bar they offer and greatly improve your ride, a recommended upgrade for the 04 and 05 GP that they thought using small hollow bar with thin links to struts was a wise idea. you can use a lower cost strut with that upgrade as well.
B000WK4EC8|5|Great product..!!
B00332GPRO|2|Product delivered and fit my 2004 Toyota 4-Runner pretty well. There were no instructions whatsoever included. But there were videos on YouTube that were easy enough to find and follow. I had no problems with my windows not going all the way up like some people complain about with in-channel wind-deflectors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has messed up my tinting. After keeping my windows up for the first 72hr after installation, I began to use my windows normally. Within 24 hr I had a bible form in my tinting. The tinting is not new and was professionally done so this shouldn't not happen. The bubble is now over 18&#34; long. See the included picture.  It's very disappointing because now I've cost myself more money than having the wind professionally installed.
B001BFO5S6|5|worked perfectly in my 1999 328 is e36. great product
B00VXZROHI|4|I Gave it 4 not 5 because the Gasket isn't thick enough to be water tight, so I had to by some clear silicone to keep it Dust/Water Clear. Other then that it was Plug and play and looks great.
B00BUCVXD0|5|Much nicer than the dealer frame
B00IX4CMM4|5|Perfect fit for IS250 COOLEST THING EVER
B00DTU95Y0|5|The fuse holders are pretty solid and have four mounting holes. Installation was simple and straightforward.<br /><br />I installed two of these in my '01 Suburban two weeks ago. Everything is working as it should. I actually think my amps are both hitting a little harder......maybe the fuse holders I replaced were not making good contact ? Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the product.<br /><br />These fuse holders are larger than both types I've used before.......so pay attention to the measurements, especially if you have minimal space available for the fuse holders.
B00E4CQH02|4|Very nice sunglasses I use for riding on the back of a motorcycle. The only thing I dislike is on the bridge piece the sunglasses stick out almost into a beak shape that isn't shown very well in the pictures provided.
B000CFHCNQ|5|Only buy new, not worth the few dollars savings to go with rebuilt.<br />They installed with ease, came with new nut, and vibrations are gone.<br />If control arm has your sway bar connected to it buy a new set of sway bar links in case you damage your old ones, they are fairly cheap and save you a trip to parts store, the Moog are inexpensive here at Amazon. Also if you are not replacing ball joint and don't wish to tear your boot with a pickle fork, smack side of knuckle with large hammer a few times and it will pop free, check time to time with bar as it doesn't actually pop free so that you notice...
B00ABYVT64|1|Sprayers work well but bottles are small.
B0129DLELE|4|I replaced the factory turn signal lights with these and my only complaint so far is that my turn signals flash faster (like a bulb is out) but I guess that could be expected with LED, maybe?
B004VRMJN4|1|The smell lasted two days maybe.
B00838JBPG|5|Shipping was fast and they look great!
B000FW4MJ8|4|fast shipping, item was as described
B00132CG4M|5|Takes all the work out of closing the lift gate. No more back strain. Took two tries to locate the lift cable correctly. Locate too high on gate and it will not stay down to load atv/golf cart. One inch makes a difference in the spring tension. Suggest clamping cable to side of gate until correct location is found. Plan on ordering another one for my other trailer.
B008HSRDKW|5|Exact fit
B00XD7L6VE|5|Love it thanks
B001GJ3E2K|5|Love it save me from bending and trying to get every nook and cranny by hand with a wash rag.
B000GVGJA8|5|This is a great pipe for the money!! I put it on my 1980 Suzuki gn400. I was running the bike for the last few weeks with chopped exhaust. I believe in loud bikes. I want people to know I'm coming. But my bike was just too loud! It was literally ear shattering. I bought this pipe because of the bad reviews saying it was too loud. It's not! It's perfect. It has enough baffles to cut the high pitch pinging sound and ear braking back fire. Now it has a nice low beafy sound. Still loud when you open it up.  I couldn't be more satisfied!<br /><br />Ps<br /><br />My pipe is 1 1/2&#34;. I don't need to use the spacers that were included. One layer of pipe wrap was the perfect amount to seal the gap. As you can see from the picture, the end that connects to your exhaust looks different than the advertising picture.
B0006FKFMC|5|Was a bit sceptical at first. Bought it to remove hail dings. Having autobody experience, I know that small ding can be difficult to remove, at times. I have to say after trying it, was quite surprised on how well it worked.
B004ISLNRE|5|Very fine teeth allow it to spin bolts out past finger tight. It's very tiny as well which is nice. For being as small as it is it has some weight to it so it doesn't feel cheap at all. I definitely recommend it.
B00OZUKPNS|4|Plush and exactly as advertised. Fit perfectly.
B00MPE82BS|5|Perfect for keeping debree out of the tent.
B001CEG90I|5|Everything as expected!
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Buy a roof bag.. end of story. My bag happened to have a stitching malfunction in the corner of the bag after my first time using it, I fixed it with my sewing machine since it wasnt to big of a issue. After hearing of this they offered to send a replacement (that was perfect I would like to add)  and let me keep the original bag since I had already fixed it. Their customer service is awesome. Very hard to come by good customer service these days. GREAT PRODUCT + GREAT SERVICE= VERY HAPPY CUSTOMERS :)
B00WGX5LFS|2|Don't buy you can't adjust them to the right height the blinkers are good and cool but headlights are worthless
B000F4EP52|5|Works just fine on the 2002 Subaru Forester. Took a picture when received.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Works well, good for holding trash bag and cleaning wipes I'm the car.
B000BRGAJ2|1|This stuff destroyed the aluminum radiator in my motorcycle.  The company website says that this product can be used with straight water as long as you don't use distilled water.  Against my better judgement, I followed their instructions exactly and used bottled drinking water and this stuff.  After about 2 weeks my radiator started leaking from one of the tubes.  When I removed the radiator it was full of corrosion.  Keep in mind the bike is about 14 months old and the cooling system was immaculate when I took out the original coolant to put this stuff in.  Also, the bike was no cooler than if I had just run straight water.  I am usually a fan of RP products, but this stuff is garbage
B00J5BFTGK|4|Haven't had a chance to install it as of yet, Construction seems to be mediocre at best.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Excellent shade that is EASY to use and fits my SUV perfectly. Very pleased with the quickness of delivery, quality of shade, protective packaging for shipping, my free gift (!), and especially the price. Seems to be a conscientious seller with great customer service. Overall great experience.&#34;
B0087Q3E5M|5|Just right
B000P72GCI|5|this is the one you want, fit on top of drain pans evenly none of those ribbed sides the dont sit square.
B002WQLS1K|5|perfect fit ,looks good, great  price,
B000HTAH70|5|flawless operation, helps me drill the center every time.
B000CLKMI2|5|I installed this a few months ago on my 2000 Ford Focus SE Wagon and it has not leaked yet. I am pleased so far
B002SSKD1I|4|Great replacement but certainly on the speedy side.
B00LND67PA|5|Another quality product from K&N that fits like a glove.
B0013935FY|5|Excellent fit and finish door sill protector that helps prevent paint wear on this highly vulnerable area associated with ingressing and egressing the vehicle. Easily installed with supplied/pre-mounted 3M double sided tape. And/or you can add some black #10x1 trim head screws as I did and further augment the bond to the vehicle. Plastic gauge thickness is about 1/8&#34; so these will last. And since they are plastic they won't dent or corrode. They also dress up that overlooked area of the vehicle and adds a &#34;finished&#34; look to what would otherwise look empty and lacking. Highly recommend!!!!
B00COYNZJ8|1|It's so floppy and not sturdy. Defeats the purpose of a shade
B006G2MJZU|5|Fit perfect in my 2004 Suburban. Arrived on time.
B00AH8F0XW|4|These covers are great for summer, but they are stiff in winter.  I purchased to be able to make fast trips out to barn in a hurry.  I would buy more in the future.
B002HXSCSK|4|This fit my 2003 Nissan Frontier very well. Installation was very easy. Read the other comments.<br />I've noted that it hasn't done very well to deflect bugs, etc. I would surmise that it is better than not having one.<br />Cleaning behind it is very easy and requires no special considerations. I think it looks very good.
B002MQAWOY|3|A bit on the thin side and it didn't fully cover my head so it didn't cover my neck at all. It may fit others perfectly fine.
B00690ALFE|5|Love it!
B00L84EKI0|5|This tool worked great on my 2014 Tundra. The flutes and slots combine to give a much better grip without rounding off the flutes.
B001GIE4JS|5|this is a quality carrier
B001FANSC6|5|Good quality...easy to install.
B00AB2PBU6|5|These fit beautifully over my 2015 Honda Accord Sport. It adds a greater quality of sportiness to the already sporty exterior and interior. The quality is good and the installation was quite easy with the video instructions located in the manual.
B0090149R0|5|Great
B0058PN7WU|4|I bought this for my 2015 Tacoma. Good product and it fit perfectly. Just gotta be careful when applying it on the sill. It's like putting your screen protector on your phone (bubbles ).
B00YOC99HU|4|I'm so excited I got this!! I was picked to try this out as a promotional product, and after giving it a try I would've bought this anyway!! I have a 2yr old and when the sun gets in his eyes in the car he is very unhappy. This sunshade is making car rides for my family a much better experience!! Thank you
B00DWVN08I|5|Fit perfectly and makes the back look more complete.
B007UHPREU|5|Works like a charm in our van!
B00J65IQSS|5|My car has been running hot for months. I've flushed it with a garden hose and distilled water several times and it wasn't helping. I ran this for 15 minutes in my driveway and left it sit overnight. I also drove 40 miles with it. I got a ton of nasty crud out after I drained it and my car is back to normal. One problem with any flush is that you may uncover leaks in the system. The crud in mine was blocking a pea size hole in a steel tube. I wrestled the tube out and was able to easily weld it, but not everyone will have the same luck. I'm impressed with how well this worked.
B008Y5A0IA|3|Great harness, but ended up returning them because I felt the 3&#34; harness was too big and not comfortable.
B00FC22Q4O|5|Awesome company and even better lights. High quality and highly recommended. And customer service is the best of the best
B000NXYKU0|5|I love the material it's made of, very good quality and so worth the investment.
B009LQG64S|5|VERY bright, easily installed. Amazon found it for 1/3 the mfgrs. list price!!
B0009TCRB2|5|worked well
B00NBN1C78|4|Our boat trailer didn’t come with a spare tire but it does have a place to put one so one of the first things my Husband did was to get a spare. I never really thought about the trailer having it’s own jack until I saw this Jack in a Box. It’s made to attach right onto the trailer tongue.<br /><br />The construction is solid and very well made. It’s box made out of material just like a trailer tongue. It has a rubber cap on the end just like a hitch has. Inside the box is your jack, wrench, and crank handles. When you receive it before installation, all your hardware for installation inside the box as well.<br /><br />It mounts securely and simply. No welding or anything. It uses U-bolts and and bolt nuts. It fits trailers with tongues 4” or 5” so it comes with U-bolts for both sizes.<br /><br />It literally installs in minutes and you’re ready to go.<br /><br />The rubber cap on the end keeps the jack contents secure and also safe from weather. There is a bar that slides across the rubber cap. The bar has an opening where you can place a lock which we did and highly recommend. But yes, technically, someone could unbolt the whole thing off and take it.
B00KGICYAA|1|Was advertised as countinuos duty but it is not<br />It starts to get hot in fa few minutes then when you try to use it after it cools down it doesnt<br />Work . Pulled it apart and found coil melted<br />Used it forfward and reverse relay for gas golfcart.
B001CQWM8E|5|This is a great mirror,  easy to install and eliminates the need for side mirrors that are always getting knocked around on the trail, no distorting vibration just a nice big rear view that enables you to keep trac of whats behind you also lets you back up with confidence. This was installed on my 2014 Teryx LE, love it.
B00VGL7I0W|5|Well made and worth the price
B000NVW1LM|5|Put this in a 1965 mustang that had a front transmission seal and after one trip driving around for 20 minutes and parking car the leak stopped completely.Did not affect operation of transmission at all NO MORE LEAK
B004K6UR9E|5|Very handy item
B007Y86938|5|I put this in a old 1976 bronco that has the 302 and auto trans. works grate and spins the motor over faster then ever before and it even came with the jumper wire and instructions for using it in a older vehicle!
B00784W3CE|5|This part was for my Nissan rogue.  The part came on time and my mechanic put the part on with no difficulty.
B00H36XX6C|5|LED flash light, 250 lumens x4 hours at fifty percent 125 lumens for 8 hours strobe 250 lumens 120 hours. 5v usb outlet. in the box is 40inch usb cable. water proof and takes some damage too built tough. small enough to fit in the hand and works really well. can charge from your smart phone too.
B001F79API|5|Good
B001GJ9K8C|5|This stuff works great! We own a 2013 camaro and this shines it right up!@!
B001AWLTX4|5|Breathable and stylish
B009384JNY|5|great
B008KYY1IK|5|Nice lock. Standing here holding it in my hand, it is bigger than what I imagined. As a padlock, it's too big to fit through a lot of chains or hasps out there and as a mini u-lock it's almost useless. But it works well with the OnGuard 8018L 7 FOOT x 12MM chain, I purchased the lock and chain at the same time. I'm satisfied that it will be time consuming and noisy for any crooks to get past the security that my new lock & chain will provide in my garage. I also have a microphone in the garage and a speaker next to my bed so I can be alerted to any noise out there at night. This is no complaint, but this shackle is fat. I had to lightly force it through the link of the 8018L chain. I measured the shackle with a vernier cailiper. The shackle measured about .760&#34; or about 3/4&#34;+ inch. Moving the rubber shackle sleeve back and taking a second measurement, the naked shackle itself measures about .660&#34; or about 5/8&#34;+&#34; inch, still very fat. The only bad thing's I can see about removing the shackle sleeve altogether to accommodate a smaller chain is that it might allow dust and dirt to get into the lock body and you might get a little shackle flop or play. This lock requires a quarter turn to lock and unlock. Also, the key is held captive in the lock body keyway while it's bolts are retracted. This lock was also quite easy to operate. I did notice while looking down into the lock body after removing the shackle, there are 4 steel, hardened ?, horizontal sliding bolts, two per side in opposing pairs. These bolts lock the shackle into place after turning the key. These sliding bolts also ride in a pair of cast plastic blocks, one block per side. Presumably plastic was used because people rarely lube their locks and the sliding steel bolts shouldn't seize in the &#34;nylon&#34; blocks like they might in metal blocks. I didn't try to pull this lock apart but I think it should pass all but the most extreme pull test's, even if the plastic blocks were removed, the bolts really have no where to go. So the lock will remain locked until you retract the bolts using the key. Also, I did buy a second, (used, like new),8046 boxer lock for $24.50 from Amazon's Warehouse Deal's dept. so I could make a noose chain out of the OnGuard chain and it worked well so I'm very satisfied.the bolts really have no where to go.

B00L84D3I8|4|Only downside was no instructions. Had to go online for instilation instructions.
B000B5ZM6Q|5|Works as advertised!
B001GJ3FIS|1|I have gone through 2 of these in 4 months.  I use the nozzle regularly on my garden, car wash, etc.  It works well at first, but then something gives and half the  water sprays out through the nozzle and the other half sprays to the ground (bad seal) making it useless.  The same situation happened twice with this  nozzle so I will be shopping for another brand.  Good luck.
B0000AYD4H|5|Quality carpet.
B00BVB5C1O|5|Is as described. worked just fine.
B00P1NLF1O|5|Good price, still performing
B0033WDG58|4|I found I did not need to use this controller as there was nothing wrong with minethatis identical to this one. I had a broken wier onmy trailer but the Curt controllers seem to work just fine to me.Curt break control.
B00NGSIPFK|1|Only fits a child waist. (I'm 175lbs 6' 34&#34; waist). Had to return
B00L9CU2C4|5|Just what I ordered, but discovered I already had a spare on board my boat so I have returned it
B0016KBT2G|4|works great
B007BL4WPA|5|Perfect fit. No issues.
B002VPLB32|5|Worked perfectly well.  :D
B00H4XQ9JM|5|Works great.
B00DYVC60E|5|As others have mentioned, you will need to make some minor modifications to fit this into an older motorhome. I used nothing more than a file. This unit is built very well and the design is much more reliable than the earlier. The lock on the outside works well and the locking knob on the inside is easy to use
B00042KG3A|5|Quality tool every truck owner needs, cause those stock jacks just don't cut it when you got some massive wheels on. Got me out of more than a couple hairy situations where only a winch would have been better. Steel is strong and paint hasn't flaked off, definitely reccent for anyone who goes wheeling.
B004SEVS96|5|works perfect, installed in ten minutes
B0006MTRJ2|5|Thick heavy material keeps control of  from blow outs tight crimps on male and female connections. I weather protect them my self of out in Hot Sun and Cold freezing  Weather,will last years you can use Draino or Diluted bleach to clean out the Build up from Hard water and keep from cracking.
B008QR1ANA|5|good product! would buy from again!
B0096J90KW|5|Great Bulbs
B00XNN1UK0|5|good product
B00QK79PWQ|5|Works great!
B00NLN4MXE|5|Excellent experience Thanks and ride safe.
B00CKXIAHK|5|Improved my ride quality and handling immensely compared to my old struts with 160K miles on them. Was easy to put on the car just took a bit of time. Took it to a mechanic for an alignment and I asked for the report, everything was perfectly within OEM specifications.<br /><br />There is much less body roll, the car feels much more like it should. It also no longer bottoms out on every bump in the road, and it doesnt bounce on the highway. If I ever buy a car over 100K miles again, replacing the struts will always be in the plans. It is completely worth it!<br /><br />KYB makes the OEM struts for toyota, so these are pretty close. If I had to guess though these are closer to the Corolla S struts than the Corolla LE struts. But that will matter little to most people, they are just a tiny bit stiffer than the OEM LE/CE/VE struts.
B00126IDDC|5|Great product!
B000EVYGZA|5|Been using this multimeter for a little over 2 years now.<br />Still working great so far!<br /><br />All settings seem to measure with precision and have a fast update rate.<br />Haven't even had to change the batteries yet.<br /><br />Build quality is solid, built like a brick!<br /><br />My only gripe is the included probes.<br />One of them stopped working after a year, so I picked up some new banana jack probes for super cheap and all was well.<br /><br />Otherwise, fantastic unit.<br />Would suggest for anyone interested in troubleshooting/fixing/installing things, no need to be an electrical engineer!
B00BD52R02|5|Fit seats like expected. Arrived a day early. They looked exactly like pictured. Steering wheel cover was too small. Easy to place on seats
B004GCS5BE|5|Fit great on my 1998 ford mustang gt. I had to find the hardware  no biggie
B00JRE38EA|5|Very good will be buying again!
B00062YZZS|4|Great price!!
B00BFE5U5K|3|this is for the 3.5 liter engine....no where does the description state that. Even Nissan Part USA will come up with this part if not careful. Use the VIN number on the Nissan Part site in order to find the right part number
B003SBAA0S|5|All good
B007Z7PHLS|4|as described
B00UM9X87Q|5|Works great... Looks just like a 60s original. Would have preferred white illumination instead of green. Otherwise no complaints.
B005ZZH7U6|5|Perfect fit.
B00BERZZTY|1|I need a return sticker so I can send it back
B007PMT63I|5|Excellent product....
B000CP86ZE|1|Did not fit my 2014 Cruze.
B00XANTGGI|1|Noticed no difference in HP or Fuel Efficiency.  The only thing I did notice was that my exhaust like ammonia when when the product was used.  I guess that means it's doing something, but can justify the price of this stuff if it doesn't do what it was advertised to do. 2014 5.7 Hemi Grand Cherokee.
B00L2G95F2|5|good stuff
B00EJPOQRU|5|Works as I thought it would
B00BUS3AKS|4|good product, Got it for $100 less on Amazon then what the Bandit Dealer wanted.
B00480J4PU|5|The bulbs were bright and work great.
B00GSVFK3M|5|Still holding up!
B007MUY8U4|5|Fit as the originals and work perfectly !
B000JFHNTM|5|Does the job! the dye gives a bright color under the light! Our shop has been using this for last 2 years! No problems!
B00K72C1T4|5|It does what they say it does, measured the performance, all good.
B000IZ1JHU|5|ACDelco is a great brand.  I only buy ceramic brake pads for all of my vehicles and I never had any problems with them, plus they are always quiet.
B0009JB7GI|1|Didn't even last a month, a waste of money
B01118EVRC|5|Perfect as a gag and any reason gift...
B00WTPMTPS|5|Works great in my '09 Tacoma.
B00A36Q9TW|5|Love these!! :)
B000CPI6VI|5|great deal
B0013CRFD4|5|Fits and works perfectly
B001O074JU|5|Power difference!
B000C9WLBA|1|Yesterday a routine oil change with a wick oil filter was a nightmare. Five quarts of oil spewed out because the WICK oil filter would not circulate. This saturated everything beneath my pristine hood with oil. This caused my engine to run without oil. The damage is yet to be determined. The tightness of the filter was checked as properly installed. Another Wick Filter was installed with another five quarts of oil and it did circulate. However, the oil pressure gauge is registering higher than it ever has in 70,000 miles. Under no circumstance should a Wick filter be used until the factory has identified the defective filters and made a recall. The day I posted this review I was contacted by a WIX representative. He wanted information on my complaint. I gave him the name of the mechanic, his business address, phone number. I also gave the parts store name, address, and phone number. All the evidence needed to prove under any rule of evidence that my review was honest and accurate beyond question. I got absolutely no response for my diligence and effort. I have had it with slave labor products and their representatives.
B00LJ3BYRK|5|Excellent in all aspects.
B008CE06ZA|5|Good purchase, thanks!
B00CHD951I|5|Haven't done the installation yet but product seems the same as the one been replaced just is all plastic and don't know how is going to look when I install the FOG light
B009IFIIM0|5|Easy to install and work perfectly
B000RHZO7U|5|Good wrench.
B00Y1Y79Q4|5|So soft! Worried it would run small, but the xl was a perfect fit! I'm 5'9&#34; athletic build and normally victoria secret clothing always runs small. Sleeves are plenty long!
B00SRF68QU|2|Well built and adjustable to three positions. However, if you're taller than about 5' it will have your knee at your chest.  The furthest from the driver setting is still even with the brake pedal, so too cramped to be useful.
B00R59RCL4|5|great
B000COCU0M|1|I had added one to replace the OEM valve.  It leaked within a few months, so bought two more.  One was OK, other I could suck through in both directions.  I took it apart and there was waxy material inside, maybe to lubricate the sealing rubber patch, but had dried and become little rocks.  Let's hope the &#34;good&#34; one lasts longer.  A one out of three record and (maybe) very old stock results in a poor review.
B008RIEQXY|5|so far so good easy install is what it claims to be great price now i just have to see how long they will last. but so far so good.
B002AQ42MO|1|Went riding today. Got this chain about a month and a half ago. As i was accelerating in 3rd gear to pop a wheelie chain snapped. Not even at the master. Very disappointed.
B000BQQMY6|1|The wevsite stated that this would fit my Dodge Journey. It fits... But it also sits right next to the exhaust. I put it on my hitch then packed my tent, cooler, a storage box full of camping gear, some folding chairs and loaded up 5 kids on a 4 day camping trip to the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately this product ruined our whole trip. After 8 hours of driving we arrived and i attempted to unpack and set up my tent, however MY TENT AND MY CHAIR WAS MELTED!!!!!! This is not compatable with a DODGE JOURNEY. It sits right at the end of the exhaust so the right side can not be used at all!!!!!! I had to pack up the kids and drive all the way back home. AND now i have to replace a $300 tent!!
B001NYE25Q|5|Instructions easy to read. Was what I needed.  Thanks
B0002V9IFU|5|Works exactly like it says at a price that is much cheaper than stores.
B004QQ721Y|5|Good brake fluid!
B008JUFJMW|5|Worked perfectly at a fraction of the cost of factory parts. All six new coil packs were less than one from the stealer. This ones a winner!
B00CEK88DU|5|Fits perfectly
B00GAC5TB2|5|more plastic but it works well
B0007XVWW0|5|Fixed leaking water heater
B0027XEKQ8|3|China made vent.
B00C5W4246|4|This is a well made product, and priced appropriately for what you get. It looks amazing on my 2010 A4, and by amazing it looks exactly like the factory HID lights, which is the look I was going for. That being said, the product description is woefully lacking, and there are several things not mentioned that you absolutely have to know before buying.<br /><br />This product is the headlight assembly ONLY, as defined by the Audi parts guide. You will need several other parts for this to work, one of which is only available aftermarket (Assuming you are upgrading a B8 model A4 from stock halogen to HID). They are as follows:<br /><br />1. Xenon Headlight Adapter Cable Harness  &#62;&#62; This is an aftermarket only part, and will run you between $50 -$60 for a set of two. You need this to hook your existing cable into this headlight<br />2. Headlight HID Ballast part # 8K0 941 597  &#62;&#62; This is an OEM part, but not technically a piece of the headlight &#34;assembly&#34;. You'll need one for each headlight, and used on ebay I paid $80 each. New they're around $250. There are no aftermarket options.<br />3. Headlight Control module part # 8K0 907 472 &#62;&#62; This is also an OEM part that isn't technically part of the assembly. Again, you'll need one for each headlight, and used on ebay I paid $90 each. New they're about $250 also, and no aftermarket options.<br /><br />Also remember that this does NOT come with the HID bulb ($100 for a pair of good ones, $50 for cheap ones), but does have all the other bulbs.<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you decided to buy these lights and are hooked by the seemingly low price that they're advertised for, be aware that you'll be spending about $250 extra (for each light) to actually get them to work. You'll basically end up spending about $1,000 to replace both lights.<br /><br />Anyway, once you have all these parts, installation is pretty simple, and I didn't throw any codes, so that was nice.
B00G9W9O3C|5|Excellent tank bag!<br />Used this on my KLR650 for a trip through Colorado on the COBDR route.<br />The tank bag did great and held up under a variety of weather. also took several crashes well with no failures on the tank bag.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B000K022N8|4|Just like OEM.
B001B7DSUU|5|direct fit for my 2005 Tahoe. Replace this and blower resistor together - guaranteed, one failed in conjunction with the malfunction/coming failure of the other.
B00NCCWD62|5|ok
B00SQX3KDC|1|A day after installing them two strips blew
B0013REXO8|3|These are for looks only. I can't see them providing ant real protection when hitting the trails. Sure do look good when installed.super easy to install, just try not to move your tail light. Lining up the holes is a pain in the A##.
B000W7K588|5|Worked great! I used it to bleed my brakes and clutch without any issues. The only issue is the hose is too short but that's easy to fix. I'm hoping the magnet won't come off. It did start developing little play so I'm not sure if it will get worse over time.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this instead of the more expensive ones which require an air compressor (which I have).
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These things are awesome, bright, and easy to install! Will buy again!
B00AESXOVK|5|Thank you very much. Just what I wanted
B000C7S0NU|4|Installed nicely, had a little shipping wear and tear, the first one I had to ship back because of damage, but I must say Amazon was super in getting this resolved. Looks just like the radiator I took out which I know was an after market. Hope it last longer, but if I get the same out of this one I can't complain.
B00DHO84WW|1|solenoid would engage but no continuity between posts, doesn't work get what you pay for.
B005NLQAHS|4|I purchased this item to use with my wife's acadia. I was wanting to check trans temp because of some issues we were having with it. Couldn't get it to connect with torque app in acadia.  Had to put it in my toyota tacoma to get it to connect with my phone.  Put it back in acadia then it read the vehicle. Still unable to get trans temp though. Haven't had time to sit and figure out how to get what I want. Even though I didn't have any codes it will scan for them. Overall I would say this reader if nothing else is something cool just to play with along with the torque app or others that will connect to it
B00J112HBY|1|For the amount of money I paid, this product is absolutely poorly made. The materials used are cheap and the straps don't securely fasten them down. Initially I was given a hard time about returning them. Then, once I did return them, my refund was denied, even a partial refund. So, I also lost over $50 in shipping charges in addition to the purchase. They are a rip off, and I will make sure to never purchase one of their products again.
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Great LED switch!! Has connections for 2 seperate lights. Easy, quick setup.
B00SCXCQV8|5|Very bright and rugged
B003IS3HV0|3|Get ready for sticky mess
B00M0CQIWU|5|Nice to find one that screws on instead of using sticky tape. Fits and looks great. Great product.
B00D6J8ENM|5|Clean rims real well until they shine or you are going to just make mud when you apply grease or WD-40 To get these caps on!!! The rim has to be slippery so the hub cap ring band slides over the rim!!! If you think your going to skip this lubricant step you will break these caps!!! These caps fit snug!!!  &#34;Put them on my goddaughters whip with barbwire pinstripe and got'a say for under $50.00 bucks total it really dressed the ride!!!
B000KZUTCY|3|Still way too expensive for what you actually get.
B00XMZI8MM|5|Just bought a car and noticed the idle was horrible. In park it high and low idled, ugly. Then I found FULLAUTOPARTS and got a great deal on a New Idle Air Control Valve. Sounds great now.
B000HCKO0C|5|Fit my 2004 Jeep Liberty perfectly and were easy to install. Great value for the price.
B000UTQUAK|3|Bought this to install right into the stud mount I have installed on my truck. The materials are high quality. The quick-release is not bad, the spring holds very tight. However, the post fitment has a little bit of play - if you jiggle the antenna around it's enough to cause noise when I'm on the highway at higher speeds; this is the main reason why I only gave it 3 stars.
B001UGJPXQ|5|Perfect for my small offroad expo trailer.  Ordered 2 for front and back leveling at camp.
B004960VVE|5|Working great in '02 9-5 Aero
B00M9L51O8|5|Perfect fit.
B001GMDRKG|5|Five stars are only half a Justice  for this nerf bars.<br />Best quality money can buy.
B004SSAER4|5|Fits perfect and it's doing the job I needed it for - protection from birds and trees.
B0079OPFLY|4|as described
B004RFKBEO|5|Needed a rack easily accessible for my families mountain bikes.  The kids still ride smaller more bulky framed bikes and getting them on a trunk bike rack was difficult because they were heavy and did not fit the secure positions.  They fit great on this rack and loading is easy and fast. Need to purchase more industrial Velcro straps as these are very thin and in my opinion will not last long.  Item was easy to assemble and easy to load but you do need two people.  Bought the anti wobble mechanism and glad I did.  Recommend these items.  Very happy!
B004RCXK3Q|5|Fit great. I just slid my door panel in it and easily hooked it up.
B00BQYCKE8|5|Good stuff
B0022ZXO40|5|Amazing, The bungee part is great!  It's much easier to put things in without worry.<br />I love the small net spaces (2&#34; X 2&#34;), plastic hooks seem sturdy. This is a nice piece of kit.
B00GEBYS20|5|Great fit. Excellent fit and work great.
B003ZUJA62|5|VERY STRIGHT FORWARD INSTALL, VERY GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT, UPDTATED THE LOOK
B008468IEW|5|Excellent product.  Exceeded expectations.
B00JM208IG|5|Be sure to put the clip on the right way.
B00KGIDZ80|5|Exact replacement of the original part. Able to install and worked on the first start.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|Delivered on time.... item as expected!
B004GAWMCY|4|If pan area repair is just belly area, it is great.
B0016VYVU2|5|Awesome product, its comfortable enough to sleep on.
B00761KHOA|4|Look on You tube, you'll see result. It works that good, I keep a case on hand at all times.
B007QBRE5A|5|Works Great!  Solved my electrical problem..... I had a short in the old one that was draining the battery.
B001BER07U|5|Love these mats.  They look very well made.
B000HA9PR2|3|Purchased this actually to top off my tiny coolant reservoir tank on my motorcycle that is tucked away behind some trim panels.  Works fine for that, probably overkill as this filler can hold a large amount of liquid.<br /><br />The problem I see, as other reviewers have noted, is that is does leak when pointed down.  For coolant, this isn't a big deal, but for battery acid it is.  I would not use this for handling battery acid, or even brake fluid for that matter.
B000VBAAOE|5|Perfect fit.
B00G6Q5KNY|4|Helmet is great. Goggles not so great. But I purchased for the helmet and not the goggles.
B000KL72DC|5|Perfect fit
B012YMDPHG|5|Got this in a few days ago, and I couldn't really leave a good review, as I didn't have a car throwing a code yet.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to use it as a diagnostic tool for a friend's car.  It's easy to use, works well, and identified the problem in under a minute.  I recall having to pay a shop  a lot of money when I was younger to have them plug in an OBD scanner...but not anymore!  Affordable and effective.
B009TA59W6|5|These work perfectly! I am so glad I chose these over Weather Tech. They look nice and they aren't slippery or plastic feeling.
B00RJ3PNC6|5|Excellent item, great service, super price!
B0060BELNA|5|The real deal. Worked great to touch up a scratch on my van and matches perfectly. Also very easy to use allowing just the right amount of paint to come out for small spots.
B009G30UAM|5|I get comments all the time on my hello kitty sticker! Had it over a year and it still looks awesome!!!!
B00GSAUHB8|5|A little big for a Nissan Versa but it is adjustable. One great item.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Bought this sunshade for my 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser which has a somewhat large windshield. The sunshade works greats, and the excess fabric at the corners is especially helpful as I have a couple of things like a OBDII gauge attached to the windshield. Took me a minute to figure out how to refold the sunshade but eventually got it. I would have preferred a little sheet with pictograms showing how to refold, but its not insurmountable.  Having a good sunshade is invaluable especially in the high UV environment like Colorado where I live.
B00ADPHC12|5|Great product for Ford 6.0 diesel with injector problems with warm up and skips.
B00UDK59F8|1|In add title, you can see it says &#34;BOXOF4&#34; along with plug number, received only one and returned immediately. I would never pay $22 for a single spark plug.
B006SRGI5K|5|Looks great. Just use a little silicone
B0009IQZFM|5|Dries car well
B00RM8XOQK|5|Exceeded my expectations in every way thanks!
B00S6KGMM6|3|Purchased for spouse.  Didn't work initially for what he needed it for, but gonna try again.  Still a good purchase for the price.
B000C9QIB4|2|Not as shown in picture.  The edges are so flimsy.
B001DKT0DO|1|Get the maxiview
B009DJV9D6|4|Good fit for my 2005 Ford Explorer.
B006GJP48M|5|Just what I was looking for and what a difference in the ride!
B00WA1U7MS|5|Excellent product. No more squinting my eyes to read the lbs/sq. in figure as on my previous gauges. H. recommended.
B010VUZL0M|5|Perfect
B0009TAOC6|4|No issues. Great price.
B001FC98X2|5|As expected
B00BXQ6BUS|5|Perfect fit on mule 610. Priced a lot less than Kawasaki part.
B00Y5EAKJS|5|Just as advertised.
B00HCYTPEY|5|Looks great on my car!
B00EB8X96E|5|I set this up in a 1990 bronco when my ignition cylinders kept going out. Had to cut the dash out to mount it, but this product look good and runs great. I love how I can turn off all the power to my truck so when I'm gone I have no battery drain whatsoever. The carbon fiber look really adds to it as well
B000CQHUMI|5|Nice gasket. No problems with install.
B003CMZ468|5|Great awesome
B00G6KGPFM|5|Needed it for trailer repairs.  Works geat
B009EVOVFQ|4|I must say - this cover was a pain to put on at first, but once its on there it has the look and better feel for the $60.00 spent. If it rains a lot - the cover (not flat, but has a few dips due to the way the 2013 jeep is) may result in some puddling and may overflow into the trunk of your jeep, depending how much rain you get just an FYI. Other than that it make the jeep look great and is pretty sturdy. id say I've been happy with it.
B00PKR9IBU|5|Got them for my 2003 Volvo 770 very happy with the product.
B000WJLR6U|5|Easy to put on and worth the money.
B000VB66VK|4|Good quality, however electrical plug did not fit my vehicle and required modification to install.
B00UME07P2|5|Great
B00SBRTX0W|5|Easy to install, much superior to the original equipment that came with my 17 year old GMC Sonoma pickup.  This was my 4th handle, the other three were purchased from the dealer and had plastic parts that broke if you didn't open the door just so.  It was also less expensive than dealer supplied junk. This one looks like it will last as the stress points are metal, not plastic.
B00I0O7JW0|5|Got this kit and installed it on my 2006 Honda Foreman 500. Had an oil control ring break while installing. After close inspection, there was a chip out of the ring. I contacted the seller and they sent out a new set of rings at no cost. I've had this piston in for about a month now. It ran pretty warm during the break in period and used a little oil until the rings fully seated. Now it runs flawlessly. Noticeable power increase over the stock bore. Just took it out this past weekend and ran it hard for two days with no problems at all. I would recommend Namura pistons. Excellent product.
B001DCN24U|5|Excellent Product and Price
B001KQSBOA|5|This worked great and stopped the rattling on my car!
B002PN33TK|5|Great product. Thanks
B00JGH0B16|3|Air lines were too short to replace OEM ones.  Had to use old air lines on selector switch
B006BZI6SG|4|Good
B00GBP9JSW|5|Todo fiat,es su install
B004I5EHO8|2|to put this system into use as described puts so much tension on the front end that you cant align your truck and your upper control arm sits on your frame rail.
B0083G3AXC|4|Handy just watch you dont set drink down in it before you sit down in chair or you will spill it
B0051D3MP6|4|In preparing to sell my old vehicle (getting updated paperwork, replacing certain parts, cleaning certain parts, preparing for smog checks, etc) , the old GMC kept draining the battery in 8-10 days when it wasn't driven. This Black and Decker device helped keep the battery charged until I found the culprit. I noticed that when I drove this vehicle, the battery was usually in a better charge than it was when I was driving the vehicle regularly.<br /><br />There are 3 connectors they give you. One plugs right into a DC port in your vehicle. Since my vehicle has a complicated setup for removing the battery, this was a safe way to keep the vehicle charged without me having to mess with that setup . I ended up running a medium duty external extension cable into the backseat area of the vehicle, and had this device sit underneath the rear of the driver;s seat, plugged into the rear center console. (I verified it had power when the GMC was off)
B00U2LHKMI|4|Looks nice on my car
B00GWFOJBI|5|I was a little concern when the boxes came for the front and rear liners. It said it fits Tacoma trucks up to 2014 and I have a 2015 model.  It fits like a glove. It has way more coverage than the all weather floor mats the truck came with. I am very happy because it's even cheaper than Weathertech and the quality of the product is very good.
B003V9Y48G|5|Does what I purchased it to do.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Works great on my GS500E
B00DUFC9QU|5|product was of high quality, very soft inside against paint.
B000ZN04B2|5|Works in my 2000 Buick Regal just fine.  I've had it in there for a few months and have had no problems.
B000AXSNVU|4|mounted it on the barn. looks nice there.........
B005FL0RUM|5|2009 Platinum ESV Cadillac - installation was easy for a seasoned tech. needs 18mm wrench to remove caliper bracket. Strongly recommend break in and caution if not use to driving with ceramic pads.
B008YJAMF2|5|It meets my expectation. It totally fits my 2011 Jetta 2.5L. like the original OEM part.
B00N675IZQ|2|They do what they are supposed to do and they look pretty good just wish they were not banged up at the start. The fit was fine just took a little time to line them up on the proper windows. They are holding secure so far. My product did come out of the packaging a little scratched up so I'm not sure what the deal was there. Overlooking scratches on the back they serve their purpose. I'll probably consider in channel next time.
B000ARPVOI|5|This stuff is an excellent product for your car, truck or any vehicle.  My car had just been tuned up and a week later it started running rough with a noticeable loss of power.  I went to a cart parts place and the man there told me to try this Lucas oil product.  He told that if it did not work to bring the bottle back and he would give my money back in full.  I put the recommended amount in my car's gas tank, drove about three miles and my car ran like it was new.  My car continued to run like new and I continued to put Lucas Oil gas tank product in both my cars year round.  It is also great in your car's gas tank in the winter, it takes care of any moisture in your gas tank and fuel lines, no need for &#34;dry gas&#34;.  I buy the gallon bottle.  Honestly, it really works much better than anything I have ever put in my car's gas tanks!
B0083UZ8CE|5|Very very comfortable. Be aware it will force you to seat a bit closer to the tank. Mine was wrinkled a bit so i called the manufacturer. They asked me to place it in full sun for a few hours. I did so and the wrinkles disappeared. :)
B007BZHU8M|5|Great helmet, no complaints and fits great. True to size.
B00RWA5W6S|4|great item.  I just to tall to use in the car.  the seat wont go back far enough to use
B0043AV4NK|5|This exhaust is DOPE! , I Recommend you buy it , it sounds awesome, I already turn heads as it is lol but with this bad boy?? WOO! Talking Bout Neck Braces 😂
B000UOGREO|5|Great product for a great price.
B000CITK8S|2|I bought 2 of these from the local battery store in Oct. 2013.  They both failed and when I called them, they ran me through a couple of tests and determined that the problems were within the units.  They also told me that the units were warrantied for 5 years from manufactured month/year.  Apparently I bought the new units 4 years into the warranty because they were manufactured in the 47th week of 2009 which left me 1 year's worth of warranty from the date of purchase.  You can find the manufacture date on the plug side of the device and it is stamped into the plastic. It goes by voltage - week - year. i.e. 12 47 09 on mine.  I was told to destroy the units because they were done.
B000VKTUE6|5|received fast, great product
B004A30UHG|5|Works great! Was having problems with lights flickering in the camper, replaced the inverter and no more flickering!
B009D3JQYG|5|nice product.
B000CSD6RE|5|Always an excellent product and prompt delivery via Amazon.
B002BELP3Y|5|Use this every morning there is some dew on my car. It really gets all the water off. I even use it clean the car sometimes!
B00512X1I0|5|Nice!
B006FD35S0|5|Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it.
B003CGDPVK|5|Put this on you Jeep Wrangler and see if you don't turn some heads!
B00063Y1F6|5|Good tool. Should last me forever.
B0087LMBFG|5|Nice quality and look for our AMG Mercedes.
B004UR34K2|5|They worked and installed perfectly! I am buying another set for my other truck!
B00062YALM|5|good
B005GL8EHY|1|This was a Pile of crap... it held up for a year... but dirt and stuff gets through easily and gets all over the car.  Additionally the draw string was cheap and broke so now I can't pull it tight... I had to use zip ties to secure it and put some stuff on top of the car cover to keep the wind from blowing it off since it fit loosely.  The wind blowing it along with the sun and wet from winter made the entire thing brittle and it has ripped in multiple spots and I just threw it away a few days ago! I only took it off and removed and put it on maybe three times...... I WOULDN&#34;T buy this for your car. Buy a nicer one.... or you are wasting your money.<br /><br />ALSO, my 240sx pop up headlights don't go down, and if they don't go down this will not fit nicely on the car... just something to note if your buying it for a 240.
B00A3WXU2A|5|I ordered this pipe and it got shipped  in record time, looks great and of good quality. I haven't installed it on my bike yet because I haven't had the time but I'm looking forward to it. I'll update this review after it gets installed. UPDATE: I finally got the pipe on my 2015 Honda CRF250L, the fit is absolutely FERFECT!, I had to loosen up the front heather and then the whole fitting was a lot easier! Looks great on the bike and it's much lighter than the stock. When I turned the engine on...WOW!!!! the sound was deep and rich, not too laud, not to quiet, just Perfect! I love how the looks of the bike goes along with the sound now, before it was too wimpy. Don't wait get it now!
B000C5CEKC|1|I do not like it!! It just does not works!
B006O74ULI|5|After brake in period a noticeable difference. No noise. Smooth
B002MF2FZE|5|Excellent fit and quality. Price was very reasonable and shipping on time.
B004IJBV20|5|Fits my Honda Insight just right. Much better price that at the dealership.
B006GCWOSC|5|Arrived quickly, exactly as described.  2nd purchase, both great experiences.
B0009IBJE4|3|I didn't like the fact that Amazon pulled a &#34;Prime Exclusive Pricing&#34; on this one. I got mine at the same &#34;exclusive' pricing from a popular automotive parts chain. Fan is a bit noisy but it works for its intended purpose and charging is fast in the 10Amp mode. The manual is skimpy but it states that the charger intelligently chooses the charging mode based on battery condition. It may do that behind the scenes but the mode indicator LED never changed from what I manually set it to over several charge cycles. At one time, it showed the battery as fully charged but it continued to deliver a 15v charge at which point I manually turned it off. Also it is plastic and made in China so build-quality is nothing to write home about.<br />If you need a cheap charger, this will fit the bill but do not recommend for long term trickle charging as many other reviewers have also reported negative experience with this.
B004QHGN2M|1|Pretty upset with this product the bearing was shot, I can't get the car inspected, faulty part. Not fun now I have to spend more. This is a junk bearing/hub don't buy it.
B00E1SLYPW|5|quick shipping. what i needed
B0058PN7WU|4|I love these, but like others have side on cold days if your foot just catches it just enough it will chip and break.
B00VB2OG9W|2|Be careful that you know what size cover to order. There are five different sizes.  If you order the wrong size (like I did), you will have to buy to ship in back and purchase another box to return it since the box it comes in will be unusable after you open the box.
B000E2D6PK|5|Good stuff, I use it in both of my Bikes.
B000ZMI596|4|only issue i had was they didn't make it to fit my plate thee bottom part covered my tags so i had to cut and grind it to make it legal
B00XAZVJ9S|5|I got exactly what I ordered and on time.  The product works fine with no problems.
