1452110581|4|Whether or not you're a cat lover, you will be able to appreciate the silly, succinct feline-ness (is that a word?) of \\"I Could Pee on This\\". Each poem is written from the perspective of a cat, interspersed with an assortment of cute cat photos in full color. Only a person who has been owned by a succession of cats could have written about their habits so thoroughly. The 112 page book is small, about 4\\"x6\\", and printed on heavy, glossy paper. Since it is written in first voice, as spoken by a cat, of course the language is simple. The simplicity is enhanced by the typewriter-style font. It is a quick read, and quite charming, though not really as hilarious as I had expected when reading the jacket. One of my favorites is on page 30:<br /><br />SERIOUSLY<br /><br />Seriously?<br />Seriously?!<br />SERIOUSLY?!<br />If I took YOU to the doctor<br />I would make damn sure<br />You came back with both of them<br />Down there<br />Now if you'll excuse me<br />I'm going to look forlornly out a window<br />For like eighteen years<br />Eighteen looooooooong years<br />Seriously?<br /><br />This book would make a cute gift for a cat lover, or someone considering adopting a cat.

B0025UHKNS|1|I have had the Garmin 405 since 2008.  I am done with this device and recommend to anyone considering it to purchase something else.<br /><br />First off, I was very impressed with the bezel operation.  However, with the least bit of moisture, it is worthless.  Furthermore, if the battery charge connections in the back (contacting your wrist) get wet, the device will lock up, beep, blank out, or combination thereof.<br /><br />Eventually my watch began losing gps signal during runs.  Over the last 3 years, this has happened enough for me to send the watch back to Garmin to receive a refurbished unit back.  This cost me ~$85 each time.  Total of 3 times.  enough so that I could have already purchased a better quality watch.<br /><br />If you want extremely detailed reviews of garmin products, check out [...]  This guy really puts these devices through their paces and provides extremely thorough reviews.<br /><br />From Ray Makers reviews, my next watch will either be Garmin's 310, 610, or 910.  Don't waste your money on this product.  There's a reason why Garmin is discontinuing the 405.
B0000AK7AA|5|This movie was great when I was a kid but even better as an adult watching it wiith your child and seeing how much thry enjoy it
B000TGJ8AS|5|I love NCIS.  This TV series is one of my very favorite.  I have series 1-7 and plan on getting the rest up to season 10.  I am not sure if I will purchase after that as I am not fond of the new character Ellie.  Yuk!
B00I8Q77Y0|4|I enjoyed the game. I especially like how colorfull it was. I can get a little frustrating but so did the other game too. I didn't think it was in best taste to add the poop that it drops through out the game. But overall i enjoyed the game Flappy wings. And would highly recommend it for people with a taste for games that require skill.
B0053O89KG|5|trying to make this season last a little longer in antisipation of season 5! Not having much luck with that!
1466401885|5|I would like to think that I would never fall in love with a boy like Travis, but then again I don't think Abby ever really had a choice in the matter. As another reviewer said... Read it. Devour it. Love it. I believe I have done so over 4 times already. Yes, its that good.
B00821OX98|5|I ordered both Season 1 and Season 2, because its just got everthing I need to keep my interest. At my age I need all of the excitement I can get and Falling Skies keeps my interest peaked with each episode.
B008JFUNKU|5|What? No Oscar nomination for the performance of the year? Plain ridiculous. Let the people elect him actor of the year. I'm sorry, but none of the other roles this year besides 12 Years a Slave can even be considered in the same league. Hanks is once again brilliant in a film that takes him out to sea. His portrayal of the true story of Richard Philips takes his career to new heights. The suffering and fear that brave man endured was terrible and Hanks was able to dig deep into the experience. The film was very well done without overdoing it with the senseless ignorant violence you saw in most other Hollywood films this year-- maybe because it's a true story. Maybe it's time Hollywood ought to start taking more nonfiction to task and forget the silly over the top thoughtless fiction. Captain Philips is right up there with Cast Away and Forest Gump as another great American film.
B00AEFXZEO|5|Had this on VHS - needed to purchase on DVD - and blue ray
B00JORDEJ4|5|This series takes you away from your hectic life - I have a hard time not watching it all at once- outstanding stories!
B001NYCU5U|5|An all time classic.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I dislike that there is not a remote option available beyond using a smart device.
B004G600A4|5|good condition even with a destroyed box enjoyed the movie
B0050DIWFC|5|My first read by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed. The story line itself is captivating, especially from a parents standpoint. Couple that with the Father's perspective as a prosecuting attorney and you have a fasinating book! I did not see the ending coming...
B00BMVTS1S|5|I liked this movie, it's just that the ending felt more like the beginning of the movie to me. It's still a fun watch, and I would highly recommend to fans of the series.
B000FTWB7G|2|\\"The Open Door\\" is one of those albums that you really try to like, but I obviously can't take it.  Amy Lee's vocals are deeply personal, but sometimes a little too personal.  It seems like this album mostly showcases her break-up.  Also, there aren't enough rocking tracks.  The only two I noticed are \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" (which I am getting sick to death of hearing on the radio), and \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\".  If you want an awesome female goth band, I definitely suggest Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, or Queenadreena.
B00DR0PDNE|3|We are pleased with our Google Chromecast with the exception that it is only compatible with a handful of applications - which I was not aware of prior to my purchase.  The only way to stream from your web browser is through Google Chrome along with the Chromecast extension.  This works great on PC's but there is not a Chromecast extension for Apple Products.<br /><br />The product is good, video quality is good, I just wish that it was compatible with more apps/Apple products.
B001OGWY1W|5|A very exciting storyline with great  acting and keeps the underlying sub-plots mysterious attention glued throughout the movie.Bought it. Buy it!
B00003CX5P|2|(Takes out guitar) Boring...Boring...Boring...Boring... Sigh. Is...there a point to this movie?  No!!!!! I mean, there's no plot-and if there was, it is really, really bad. I remember loyal fans of the epic triolgy were even sleeping outside movie theaters-all for this? Let me say, the acting (Expect that Anakin :0...) and directory was good-except for the story-which is the one that makes the movie come alive. Ah, you gotta hate it when legendary directors direct crappy movies-it's insulting. In other words...the polt sucked.
B0050DIWFC|4|A most enjoyable crime novel!
B007ZGO7EM|5|Great calculator. Simple and highly efficient. Thank you for this app.
B00I65ZGDC|5|Second best book of the series, great read!
B00881VLCE|5|Finally, a jigsaw app that isn't stuck on an ugly fake wood background... plus cooler free albums like Fractals.  Lots of cool non-free adds too.

B00004XPPC|5|This is a true story.....Tells how our American Boys, Husbands, fathers, family members were mistreated, tortured by the Japanese during WWII.  William Holden, Alec Guiness were superb.  This is a must for WWII History Buffs.
B0000E6XKF|5|There aren't many bonus features, and the audio isn't going to sound studio quality (which is good I think), but this DVD is everything you would want from a Chili Peppers concert.  There are nice menu graphics that give you an outdoor concert feel, the chapter cuts are timed well, the intro music is great, and the menu music uses \\"Venice Queen,\\" one of their best songs. <br /> <br />Some great things in this DVD are the matrix-like sweep cuts when Kiedis jumps; the clothing the band wears is individual and priceless (i'm thinking flea's skeleton suit), all easier on the eyes than strategically placed socks; and the transition from late afternoon light, to dusk, to darkness.  The crowd is enormous, and watching them bounce inflatables and sing adds to the experience.  The band is older, though they show no loss of energy, and play music mainly from their last two albums. <br /> <br />I've seen a couple of other concert dvds, and if you would like something like that to be on while you play cards, or if you just like watching concerts on tv, this is one of the best you can get.
B00FAPF5U0|5|A true classic

B00004Y6NW|5|\\"Dire Strait\\", the first album recorded by Dire straits in 1978, is among the 10 CDs that every humans should have in his collection !!! A MASTERPIECE which will go through the years without efforts. <BR>For the ones who know only the mega hit \\"sultans of swing\\", you must understand that EVERY song <BR>on this CD is as good as it !!! A MUST HAVE !!!
B007N85POS|5|Rio is amazing, but it already has amazing graphics on the (if they have one) free and .99 cent version. 4.99 is absouloutly RIDICULOUS!
B000002ARV|5|And it is one of my all time favorites!!!!!! <br />I got it when Wherehouse music was going out of business-all the cassettes were 1/2 off.  I got it just because I had \\"heard of\\" Johnny Winter.  So I drove home with about 7 tapes and listened to this one and then the next........  A week later I was thinking of the songs on it and have been a fan since.  Its got that vibe that great records have.  I was floored by the slide work.I love this album.  It is unlike his other albums as he is avid blues player.  But on this album and another he lets go and rocks with the best.  Give this one a chance and see what you think. <br />
B0091REZMW|5|Love love love this game.  Awesome graphics

B000SEGMAU|5|This book made me cry as only one other book ever did.  That was Flowers For Algernon.  I am a nursing student starting his second career and faced with death and illness everyday.  This story has touched me in ways that words fail to explain.  Mitch captured all the emotions and life lessons that Morrie had to teach.  I can only hope that my friends and family will understand the changes in me and my outlook in life that this book has inspired.
B004GHNIRK|5|This appeared free on my kindle, and I enjoyed it enormously.  The story is amazing and the whole book makes one think.
6303192459|5|A GREAT MOVIE; you could watch it over and over again and still be enchanted by its superb acting and emotional plot.  If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the best films ever created.

031623480X|5|As a healthcare provider, I have been sharing the key points of this book with all of my patients. I have only eaten bread once since starting this book, and that was a mistake! Otherwise, I feel much sharper mentally than I have in a long time. I've also effortlessly lost 12 pounds in three weeks and gained control over my appetite. If you don't believe the incredible ability of insulin to control your eating behavior, you can learn this once and for all by following the low-carb, gluten-free advice in this book for about a week, then expose yourself to a high-carb, bread-heavy meal and pay attention to what it does, not only to your appetite, but to your emotions in general. This happened with me, and it taught me once and for all that I don't want to allow carbs to literally control my behavior!<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter, having treated neurological diseases and disorders for years, tells of personal, professional stories of recovery that are simply amazing, all brought about by removing gluten from patients' diets. ADHD, Migraines, and Alzheimer's, are all known now by compelling research to be largely resultant from grain in the diet! Dr. Perlmutter points out that while you may not have obvious intestinal issues from having gluten in your diet, virtually ALL human beings have BRAIN sensitivity to gluten. Dr. Perlmutter talks about how the always-wrong advice of eating low-fat, high-carb meals robs your brain of much-needed cholesterol. He also talks about the link between statin drugs and Alzheimer's Disease. You'll also find information on other important weight- and appetite-regulating hormones, such as Ghrelin and Leptin.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter includes numerous recipes and a four-week plan to help you get off to a great start on a permanent life change by focusing on single things each of the first three weeks, and then bringing it all together in Week 4. Week 1 - Focus on food, Week 2 - Focus on exercise, Week 3 - Focus on sleep, and Week 4 - Putting it all together (which includes great coaching tips on how NOT to stumble in your new lifestyle).<br /><br />With virtually every page, I thought constantly of an 83-year-old lady that I'm close to that has Alzheimer's Disease, and how her life was filled with doing all of the things warned against in this book: low-fat, high-carb, taking statins (and every other kind of pill ever recommended by her doctor). Now, she costs her family and society a fortune every month, as well as exhausting and grieving her loved ones with her plight and their helplessness in the situation. I was impressed that Dr. Perlmutter gave many examples of how drugs were NOT the answer to many mental issues, and how often, in a very short time, a dietary difference can make all the difference!<br /><br />Tired of being foggy and fat? Read this book! It will change your life!
B0054JZC6E|5|I thought this game was...amazing because you are able bye more and more games, if you get more and more points.  because of that I recomend this game to every one that is cool and likes to have fun!!!
1573229725|5|As in Sarah Waters first two novels, \\"Fingersmith\\" once again gives us a close view of the seamier side of life in London during Victorian times ? this time we make the acquaintance of a den of thieves & pickpockets among the dregs of society and get a glimpse of the world of pornography & kinky inclinations for gentlemen.  This author is an expert at plot twists and surprises which really shock the reader, allow yourself uninterrupted time for this book, it is a real page turner, melodramatic, a love story, a murder/crime thriller and great historical fiction.<br />There are so many twist and turns to this story that I find it hard to say much about it without revealing crucial parts of the plot. The main characters are 2 orphans, Maud and Sue, that have grown up leading vastly different lives and are brought together in their late teens.  At the beginning we are introduced to Sue and the family of thieves she lives among at the house of Mrs. Sucksby.  Sue is presented with a mission by Mrs. Sucksby?s friend whom she calls ?Gentleman? ?  The plan, in brief,  is that Gentleman will  marry an orphaned, isolated heiress then have her locked up in an asylum, stealing her money, Sue will pose as the lady?s maid and assist Gentleman in making his wife appear insane.  And that is all I will say.<br />I look forward to rereading this one day to look out for all the little clues I missed the first time.
B000HCO83G|4|X-men is, in my opinion, the best Marvel franchise out there. This movie also, is the best out of the three. I was dissapointed that this DVD wasn't released in the way of the other two because i was expecting a grand DVD. I'm sure sometime this year there'll be another DVD released, but I'm not going to go and spend another $20 - $30 on the same movie for extra special features which should've been released the first time. I gotta say this DVD isn't the worst especially for the lucky ones who got 22 Deleted scenes (me). This is a great movie and a good DVD it's worth a watch.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is the best app ever. I love it so much. I am addicted. I can't stop playing it. It just reals you in. And doesn't let you go.

B00KZ73W30|5|The mono reissues are incredible!  Apple and Abbey Road have done it again!
B009ZQJ1G4|3|Decent futuristic look of control. Eliminates anything that impassioned man which of course creates revolution. Decent double cross but all gets avenged and enlightened.
B004FPE4DK|3|Successfully blends soul and R and B phrasing with folk music. A series of intimate, haunting songs that are written well and recorded with style and passion. A unique songwriter who shows tons of promise for the future!

B00IK590UI|4|Good action packed
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is the best game I've ever played and it's free
B00008OP0H|2|The first time I watched this series I borrowed copies from a friend who recorded it off of the tv. This version has been re-edited to shorten the length of each episode. I am GREATLY disappointed. Some of these parts were things that I was looking foreword to watching again. The pacing was changed in other parts that left a different impression on what happened. If I was watching it for the first time I may have enjoyed it, but knowing what I'm missing and just how much richer the story was before, I have to give it only one or two stars.
1475143389|5|I love this book.  I'm 58, in not bad shape and, by following this book, I'm getting in even better shape.  Mike lays it out without all the mythical garbage that you find with other books.  The method works!  I've worked out with weights in the past, following others' advice, but this is faster and in less time.  As Mike says, you don't get the big pump immediately after working out (so you don't deflate either!), but the gains are steady.  I'm on month 3 and I'm excited about what I'll look like in a year.  Also, I did have some questions and emailed Mike.  He wrote back right away and answered all questions.  Finally something that works and makes it easy if you are willing to do the work! I also have the \\"Shredded Chef,\\" \\"Eat Green Get Lean,\\" and \\"Cardio Sucks is on its way.  Thanks Mike for all the research citations.  I'm a logical thinker and like to know that I'm not wasting my time.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Nice to finally see Grey's take on things.  Reliving his reaction to her inner freak was a rollercoaster of employment ok tions. Great job
B003Y5H5AG|5|Go in with low expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised by this sweet, humorous, and mildly exciting movie.  It was a great relief to watch with my three year old as there was no bad language, sex, or otherwise inappropriate subliminal messages.  It has a well developed plot, easy for children to grasp and entertaining enough for parents to enjoy while strolling down memory lane...Saturday morning cartoons with a big bowl of Flintstones cereal...
B006LSZECO|5|great read  surprising plot twists & turns  make this an intriguing story<br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good fictional story
B000HBK3MM|5|It took me a year to finally discover what everyone has been raving about -- the new British discovery Corinne Bailey Rae.  I first saw her on the Grammy Awards televised show, but her segment that day really didn't spotlight her unique talents, and WHAT talents this young lady has !!   <br /> <br />When I first heard \\"Put Your Records On\\" on the radio, she immediately struck me as someone comparable to Norah Jones, but with repeated listens and the strong material on this CD, Ms. Rae actually shows more versatility and range than Norah Jones.  It's unfortunate \\"Corinne Bailey Rae\\" struck out at the Grammys.  Corinne lost in the major categories to the Dixie Chicks and I can't even remember who won \\"Best New Artist\\", but Corinne should have won that one. <br /> <br />\\"Put Your Records On\\" is a feel-good song reminiscent of the 1970's with its pop-funk-soul vibe, and Ms. Bailey's voice is like a ray of sunshine that permeates thru every track on this wonderful CD.  But just when you think her voice is all sugary and sweet, she'll let out a growl or grunt to make you think otherwise.  I just hope her follow-up CD will be just as good, but at the rate this CD is still dominating radio airplay here in Southern California, I'm sure it'll be a while before Corinne heads back into the studio for the follow up.   <br /> <br />In this day and age when marketing, hype and scandal plague young musical artists, it's nice to see a fresh, confident, and creative singer still making waves for the right reasons.  Get this CD -- it is sooooo good and worth every penny!  Your ears, heart, and mind will Thank You.
B000ZLFALI|5|This is a great movie for those who love musicals and the Beatles. Jim Sturgess is a star!
B009RI4FRU|5|Saw  this film when it was originally released. It is memorable. I bought a copy for my library. It is hard to imagine a film with more charm, more sweetness than this one. Anderson's films always transport the viewer to a funny, quirky universe. He is America's Fellini.
B005L18C4E|5|Great insight into the world of 15th century Europe and an excellent expose of the state of the Catholic church in a state of decadence.

B00B2V66VS|4|The only negative with this app is it wont open. it has worked in the past great until recently and it won't open. When I try to play it, it closes back down. Does anyone have any suggestions for this other than reinstalling? I have a lot of time invested in it. Other than that, I would give it a five instead of four. I think this problem is a fluke because I'm known to have bad luck with applications and technology in general.
B0002F7I9Y|5|Yes,his voice was ragged.He was terribly ill when he recorded this,but with his last breath,he put more feeling into a song than any of the so-called superstars of today,who think screaming is singing.His singing has always evoked a lot of emotion in me,whether joy or sadness,but I felt so lucky to be able to hear the voice of the Genius my whole life.The duets on this CD are good,but honestly,I bought it because I knew there would never be another new album.I cried like a child when he died,and I still get a lump in my throat when I hear him sing on any of the many CD's of his I own.This album was his last,and if you love him,you will accept the fact that he was a 73 year old man who was dying,but who gave his all to the recording of this last album.There will never,ever be another Ray Charles.
B007KZY1YY|2|Its all a bit repetitive and predictable. She disobeys him, he gives her a good seeing too, she's always very wet! Blah, Blah, Blah

B00BDSRKHO|5|OMD is back!<br />This is their best disc in years and is both musically respectful of their past work and finds some new sounds as well. Recommended for all fans of OMD and those who enjoy electronic/synth with a direction
B003XU02QG|2|Low quality movie. Weak story line. It covers ground that has already been much better done. This movie is not worth the time.
B004LH3AM8|5|I heard about this book on the radio one day and I was frightened by how harsh the mother sounded, in her interactions with her children. I couldn't believe that there was someone so mean who would push her children so far. I asked myself, is she for REAL? But then I thought of my own upbringing. I was born in an Eastern European country and came to America as a child. And in my own family I see differences between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" (Americans). So I wondered how this book would relate to my own family and that's why I read it. I listened to it on Audiobook first, and then picked up the hardcover to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br /><br />I want to break up my review into 2 parts:<br />1. Literary Review:  Engrossing, well written, witty, good use of English, I could really FEEL the emotion, frustration, anguish, and exhaustion. Provocative and interesting and funny at times. I finished the audiobook in 5 days!! VERY FAST.<br /><br />2. Subject Matter: Well, it certainly made me ask a lot of questions. Questions about Americana or \\"Westerners\\" as Amy calls us (to separate from the Chinese mothers, although she did note that many other cultures, like India, Pakistan, Korea, also have similar child-raising mentality). I found that my own family had a lot in common with Amy. My mother was also very strict, angry all the time, compares me to my older, better, smarter, more successful sister (as Amy would put it, I'm the \\"younger, more rebellious sibling\\"). And I also have a pretty strong personality. And as much as Amy recognized her personality in her girls (and therefore knew they would push back), she still thought she could win the arguments. But that was her mistake. I wish she's let up once in a while. I know how it feels to have an overbearing, controlling mother, and I hate it. My own mother is 75% of Amy, and if it was 100% Amy I would completely hate her. So I can totally relate.<br />But less about me....<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is, thereis definitely reason to consider her upbringing techniques. I think many American parents don't participate enough in their kids lives. they don't help them with homework, don't inspire them to take sports or do music, they don't take them on trips to other countries, or register them for contests and competitions. In that regard, I respect Amy very much. I do think kids need to be pushed once in a while, as well as helped. The amount of time and energy Amy spent rushing her kids to rehearsals, making millions of notes, and then checking her kids progress was just astounding. I respect that.<br /><br />However, unlike Amy, I also believe kids should have a choice. She never gave them a choice of what to do and that is why  the clashes, battles, and fights occurred. If she had just taken a moment of peace, quiet, and listened, she might have learned MORE and helped them MORE instead of just shoving the lessons down their throats.<br /><br />I do think American parents give up on their kids too quick (if you didn't win, then it's not for you), and I appreciate Amy's \\"Chinese\\" work ethic (if I didn't win, I just have to work harder next time). What I really disliked is that Amy pushed her kids JUST TO PUSH HER KIDS. It was almost like a terrible game of \\"Let's See How Far We Can Get\\". WHY??? WHAT FOR?? With what goal. At some point you have to stop and reevaluate and see if your children want to continue on the path they were on, and Amy did not. She was like a train barreling through everything, good or bad. And in that regard, she was a bad parent, Chinese or American.<br /><br />I think the book definitely explains a lot about why Chinese, Asians, and many immigrant families are the way they are and I'm happy to have that insight. She opened herself and her family to criticism and let us into her intimate life. That was very brave of her to do, so I respect that very much.<br /><br />I also agree about the \\"3 Generations of Success\\", I can see it happening in my own family. I agree about the \\"older, better daughter, and younger, rebellious daughter.\\" I do think she has a good point to make about parenting skills and I wish more people would listen.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to many people, including teachers, sociologists, psychologists, people who study demographics, but most importantly to NEW PARENTS and PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. I  especially recommend it to all those parents who think they raised a child that just won't listen. There is probably a reason why. And that reason is most likely YOU.
B00G722T22|5|Wonderful album! One of my favorites.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|Ehm guys i got it last month how ?  This game got a discount before but if the game does not work I recommend you to delete it and download it again dont worry once you bought and then delete it wont cost you money or coins.
B0054JZC6E|4|I'm going to be honest I only rated this for the free points. It's a decent game. Kinds boring though, but good enough to play when you're bored.
B00003CX95|5|This was the best film of the 90's. No other film captured so purely the emotion of this masterpiece. Action, Romance , Courage, Strength, and Scottish accents all wrapped up into one movie! Simply put, it's exceptional! For those who argue about the film's historical value. After  Wallace was eliminated, who do you think noted these events into the annuls  of history? Sorry but the common man was very much illiterate.  &quot;Historians from England will say that I am a liar, but history is  written by those who have hanged heroes.&quot;
B007ZXK08C|5|Great twist of a story.  A book I found hat to put down
B00910Y1OQ|4|Great focus and calming.  Really enjoy it
B007EECSFA|4|I have read all of Kate Morton's novels and enjoyed every one.  This is not her best, but well worth your time to read.
B008K6HN8I|1|Got this app for free but cannot find where to download the darn thing. would love to tell you what i think about it if only i could download it.
B00PTB7B34|4|Interesting rehash of clash of clans. I am having a good time playing this game. I'm a big fan of the call of duty franchise.
B0023SDPS6|2|seems he left self out of story. too many others in this book. maybe he was'nt needed for this particular one.
B001KDQ4KQ|5|This book made me realize I probably did not know my own children as well as I thought I did, and made me think about how I would have responded if this had happened in my family. A sad, heartbreaking story of friendship, love and loss. Jodi Picoult writes so the reader can feel the emotions of her characters!
0446569909|5|Ozzy is not a burn out after all, this book is funny, well written and out of all the rock star auto biographies I've read (6) this one is the best. I even read the one Rudy Sarzo (his original solo bass player) wrote and I just enjoed this one so much more. I read 150 pages the first day, couldn't put it down.
B00DA6YEKS|5|This series has become my favorite series of all time.  Most books (especially sequels) start off a bit slow.  That's ok-- I usually expect it, and they gradually get into more and more action as you get closer to the ending.  But Brandon has an amazing way of keeping you excited throughout the entire book, as if you were getting into those last few exciting chapters when you start reading the first few pages.  As I read this book, I actually found myself trying to slow down so I could make it last longer.  But I couldn't slow down.  Awesome, genius work.  I absolutely loved it.
B0052VUNHC|5|Loved this book. This was my follow up to Fifty Shades, which something good was sorely needed to move me on from that yumminess (so I could read it again..LOL)
B003Y3ZHUS|5|just got done watching and it was a dang good movie. the story is good, the kills are cool and creative, the graphics for back then are awesome. this bluray is a good one
B00005ASGG|5|good movie as I expected!
B00C7607BC|5|For me, this has always been one of the movies that reinvigorated the Disney line of movies after a number of years of ones that I always felt were not as good as ones previous. The combination of plot, characters and music were perfect and in the end you get a movie that is timeless and music that you cannot get out of your head (can you say 'Under the Sea...'). I have been waiting for this to come back out of the vault as it has been one that I did not have in my collection for blu-ray, so I was excited to see that it is coming out soon! This blu-ray was great, digitally remastered, the images just pop off the screen and the music comes through in even greater quality and clarity. I highly recommend this to all Disney fans, as this is one that will not last long and it goes on the market in a little more than a week.!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
0439023521|5|The Hunger Games Trilogy is the most riveting series I've ever read. There is a lot of brutality, violence and death but without it, the theme wouldn't have been so strong. Ms. Collins will have you holding your breath from page one all the way to the end. I consider myself a slow reader but I devoured all 3 books in less than a week.<br /><br />The protagonist, Katniss, is self-absored, and selfish and yet we find ourselves completely rooting for her because of her ultimate sacrifice of her life for her sisters. There are so many truths in this book. I love the way this author shows the horrors of war, yet also shows that there are some things worth fighting for. In today's society, we see many parallels to the world she created. I hope this fantastic story jolts some folks out of their comfort zones and has them considering the cost of war and of turning a blind eye to what we know is wrong.<br /><br />Kudos Ms. Collins. Highly recommend this series to teens and adults.
B00IEBE7GK|5|This game is worth the small price.  In fact, I suggest buying and playing the first one as well.  Buy both, but play the first one first.  For anyone who has no idea about this game, you are solving a series of 3D puzzles during the course of a story.  Some of the puzzles resemble doll house sized buildings where many pieces move and serve to help you solve other puzzles.  It is great.
B00992CF6W|5|My favourite Game has to be this one it's so cool I wish I had unlimited charch so I can keep playing
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game, enjoy it a lot. It's challenging which I love
B00RL9UZGW|5|I liked this movie because the focus [Denzel's] was about doing everything in his power to help someone who needed help.  I also liked that the 'action' part was as a last resort.  He gives the bad guys a chance to do what is right.  I also liked that one doesn't really find out 'who' Denzel is or was.  We get an idea but left to draw our own conclusion.  I hate to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the movie.
B008MG1E4A|5|He made you feel like you were with him every step of the way: from his childhood to the capture UBL.<br />The movie &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34;, did not even do the book justice.
B008Y2VTIS|5|Put together very well, great scenes and great acting. By the way Steve Buscemi sure looks a lot like Don Knotts.
B000006NPY|1|look, i love their first couple of albums, and am willing to grow with a band.for the first few years that they were around they were great, and very original.even &quot;pisces iscariot&quot;,a collection of outtakes was awesome(and my second favorite album they did).but when this came out,i wasted my money on a pile of over indulgent proto-prog nonsense.these guys have become so out of touch,as they are now big rock stars,and billy has nothing to write about,except boring,love songs, and stuff only a celebrity can relate to.and hey, i have no problem with an artist being self indulgent if its gonna create good art,but this is just billy corgan stroking his ego.as a fan of punk, this gets to my very core.and than they come out with &quot;machina/the machines of god&quot; garbage(that thankfully i did not buy.i heard it from a friend,and wanted the time spent listening to it back).im so glad they broke up.to bad they dident years ago,and save the world this headache.thank god rancid and propagandhi came out with their new albums.one thing you can count on with them and bands like them, they wont become huge sheltered rock stars and lose their edge and intensity and make boring pompous dung.
B0000DD7LC|2|Oh joy, another so called R&amp;B artist who over sings every other note. Some decent moments but the hints of hip hop really dash any semblance of credibility. Buy some Motown instead.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Every episode is fresh and the comedy is a nice touch. Lewis is my favorite character. Once you start you can't stop.
B00AQCMK32|3|When I first got the game I played it everyday for the 1st week.  But after that the game became repeative.  The same goals and same contracts.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game its a mix of taking care of a horse and having fun. I love this amazing game
B00992CF6W|5|This game is so cool either way survival or creative it the best game in survival you can fight zombies,skeletons,spiders,and other mods and in creative you can build what ever you want and you can fly you can do two player in this game I hope this help because this game is awesome!
B00IMYSCR4|3|i didn't expect much going in.  that's why i didn't bother watching it at the theatres.  when it won the most oscars last night, i decided to see what all the hype was about.  SPOILER:  the hype is the special effects.<br /><br />the story simply isn't there.  a woman is the sole survivor of a catestrophic accident in orbit and eventually makes it back to earth.  there is the silghtest attempt at humanizing this otherwise robot of a woman by allowing her admission that she once had a child who died tragically at age four.  beyond that, you could have put robots or androids in the starring role(s) (if you include george clooney's few minutes at the beginning) and the story wouldn't have suffered at all.<br /><br />then there's the implausibility of the entire thing.  THAT, and the fact that it takes place in orbit, as opposed to, say, on earth, make it science fiction, i suppose.  but basically you've got \\"castaway\\" in space, minus the volleyball and with about an hour shaved off of your viewing time and a few years shaved off the main character's time.<br /><br />except that it's more likely that tom hanks would have gotten off his island and back to memphis (or wherever) than that sandra bullock would have continually dodged space debris that destroyed several satellites, a space shuttle and not one, but two space stations.  not only was she miraculously spared getting hit by .... ANYTHING, not even the smallest pinhole-creating debris, but she survived floating off into space (remember that killed frank poole a mere 13 years ago), a fire inside a space station, and a 1960's apollo-style re-entry and crash landing.  and successfully managed to fly a spacecraft and complete various other technically complicated extra-vehicular maneuvers, with her self-professed lack of ability and failures in training.<br /><br />i want this woman's luck!  (unless, that is, the island at the end is deserted and she goes through all that trouble getting back to earth only to end up on a deserted island.  with no volleyball or ice skate.  (let's hope so!))<br /><br />don't watch this movie because it's a great movie.  watch it if you want to see how they can make an accident in space look real.  or watch it because you really dig sandra bullock or george clooney.  (but not so much george clooney.  his time in the movie is short-lived.  in all ways.)<br /><br />and i firmly believe that if this movie had been done with any actors other than a-list actors, it wouldn't have even been considered for an oscar.  without the special effects it wouldn't have even been on the radar.  and if a man had been cast as the main character, it wouldn't have gotten nearly the raves.  but strong women in main character roles is big right now.  and sandra bullock, for various and sundry reasons, is currently hollywood's darling.  and if someone filmed george clooney brushing his teeth, people would get in line to buy the dvd.<br /><br />TIP:  if you want a great science fiction movie with a somewhat similar plot that actually has a plausible story that you can also get involved in and a character you can actually care about, rent duncan jones' \\"moon\\".<br /><br />(p.s. if you really got the frank poole reference, i really dig you!)
B004QKNXIQ|5|This is the only animated movie that I saw recently that I actually loved. Characters are actually developed and have a bit of complexity to them. Jokes were not too obvious. It is as if some smart people spent some time to thing of new and original things instead of just re-hashing what worked elsewhere. I laughed till I cried. I also cried.
B00D7Z4GQY|2|I was disappointed in this book.  I should have realized from the sample that I didn't really get taken into the story, but I was looking for a good book and decided to give it a try.  I didn't even finish it, which is rare.  The plot was confusing, I kept having to look back to see which character was which, the various stories, which it jumped between did overlap with each other but I didn't find them interesting at all.
B000AGTPUK|5|i got this for a gift and it came in excellant condition and came very fast. i was very pleased!
B003G94BZC|5|This season's story lines appear more complex and have more twists, but still maintain a little of the Doctor's zany humor.  The Doctor is more introspective and is showing more of a complex personality.
B005COO1X6|5|Read this book in a matter of a couple of hours. Stephen King at his best, weaving a story and painting compelling pictures with words. As usual, the ending is different than you think it will be. I won't spoil it for those looking to read a great story. Thank you Mr. King...you have done it again.
B000002H48|5|Excellent edition of this concert. Hope to see soon also the video! Arrived in time in good condition.
B002M9WW30|4|I always loved these movies growing up. So since this is for all of them, including the latest Rocky Balboa..... plus its on bluray; You cant lose.
B00QQW1ZIW|3|Just okay
B004SGWYW4|5|Excellent anime, Warning very graphic and a bit chest bouncy, not for young viewers. Music is amazing, story surprisingly well written.
B00FRVH3V6|5|Best ending ever wish a second book would come out. I highly recommend this book. I have read it 3 times, still enjoy it.
B006BDHAX0|4|I really like the variety and the option to replay the games I  have already played in order to get a better score. I like playing against myself and I think I could play a long time without having to replay any of the games.
B00CWY76CC|4|So fun but it can get frustrating when you have done something before and then voila it works finally but over all I loved it.
B0060QM0AG|4|I didn't know a book about animals could be well-written. This is an interesting book and to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much.
B00BHNQ5XK|1|This movie was boring and predictable, so I won't recommended to watch it.
B005LJ6YK0|4|The other amazon reviews are all right on the money.  I love the consistently strong mid-60's strumming/jangling guitar work and even better the surprisingly retro drums.  It all works.  I dont think the band has quite found its stride yet though.  The vocal melodies are there but they arent perhaps as compelling as the band wants them to be. Some lyrics repeat too much.  There's a flatness to all of the tracks that may be more the fault of the producer rather than the band.  No matter -- I'll be very interested in their next CD.
B00CWY76CC|3|This really makes you think. Entertaining and addictive.  Our whole family enjoys playing this game together as a team. Like
B00A9X9ORI|2|There were some interesting concepts, and potential storyline, but none of them came to fruition.  A long movie without good plot or character development.  Disappointing.
B002SKZBQS|5|another great Stephen King story !!
B00AESN8XY|5|kinda like the comp version but can pick wich countries to infect easy to beat after u play on casual to unlock the genes
B00BVYNSLC|1|Hard to follow, only got 2 episodes in
B006GLLREU|4|Great show!
B0000AQS0F|5|I'm one of the many who didn't discover Firefly until long after it had left the air.<br /><br />However, after the 42nd person recommended it to me, well, I figured that there must be a reason that you can't stop the signal.<br /><br />So I watched it on Hulu. (they were having a free HuluPlus trial. I got it just for this show!) Boy, was I ever impressed! I couldn't believe there were only 13 episodes!<br /><br />You'll laugh at the high-larious jokes, cry whenever Kaylee's life is threatened, get incredibly angry at Yo-Saff-Bridge when she shows up to wreak her particular brand of terror, and feel a thrill of pride every time one of the main 9 characters grows as a human being.<br /><br />Once I had seen them all, I was thirsty for more!  I sought out the DVD set, and I was not disappointed. There's SO MUCH to explore on this DVD set.  Aside from rewatching--or watching for the first time!--the episodes themselves (which I've done so many times I'm surprised my DVDs aren't all worn out and scratched yet!), this set is also great for all the commentaries and behind-the-scenes features it contains.<br /><br />5/5 would definitely recommend! (I'd give it 10/5 stars if I could!)
044022425X|5|The excitement never ends!
B005ZOBNOI|4|Well written
B00004UOVT|5|Finally replacing all my old vinyl.  I'm not really in the mood to say more.  I liked this music way back when and I still do.
B003XF1XOQ|5|This book is very emotional and somewhat true, I recommend this book to you on the Kindle. It takes you through action adventures in a serious conflict with you and other readers
B00QW8TYWO|5|It's an awesome game
B00MIA0KGY|5|Beautiful voice as always.
034580404X|5|I was so happy that Amazon offered these books in a 3-volume boxed set. I could not put these books down. I didn't just read these I devoured them. The content was a little rough at times, but it was a beautiful love story. If you want to read a wonderful love story these are the books you should read. Can't wait for her next book to come out.
B00PJ5AUCO|5|got scared to death by foxy<br />WEAR THE MASK!!!
B009U9S6FI|5|Wow, what an amazingly revealing read of a persons' need for something to believe in beyond themselves. The journey through is not so much the brutality that occurred,  but rather a how and why of those who did survive. Frankl then explains how these same styles of thinking perpetuate today and a feeling of meaningless can be transformed into hopefulness.
B0070Y46UY|3|Martel wrote a compelling novel that clearly transcends the plot-driven narratives of our time. This is a novel about what it means to live as a member of the most destructive species in the history of the world.
0743277708|5|I remember like it was yesterday instead of thirty years ago the first time I read Watership Down. I couldn't put it down. I read it at night, and during odd free moments at work. I picked it up again as soon as I got home. For the week I read WD, I was a rabbit. I , too, admired the unexpected leadership of Hazel. I, too, worried about our nervous prophet Fiver. I, too, loved my world of Frith (the sun) and El-ahrairah (our mighty rabbit folk hero) and I, too, was terrified of Lendri (badger) and Pfeffa (cat) and I, too, was mystified about the white burning sticks.<br /><br />Happily, I decided to read this book again with my online 1001 Children's Books You Must Read group.<br /><br />And, happily, the book held up. Delightful.
B000089RVX|5|&quot;Evanescence&quot; means fading from sight, but that is something this band will not do. Contrary to popular belief, they have been making music together for many years, releasing independent albums of their sound. Unfortunately, not very many people were able to get their hands (or ears, if you prefer) on these indie EP's. My hope is now that they have been signed to a major label, all of those wonderful songs that were lost will get re-released. Their main first album was &quot;Origin,&quot; which does not differ too much from &quot;Fallen.&quot; If you are familiar with &quot;Origin,&quot; you will see repeated songs: &quot;My Immortal,&quot; &quot;Imaginary&quot; (though a slightly egdier version), and &quot;Whisper&quot; (also slightly a different version). The rest of the songs on &quot;Fallen&quot; hold up the expectations of &quot;Origin,&quot; following in the footsteps of its predecessor. If you loved Evanescence before they got big, you will love them even more now.<br />Individually, the songs each have a life of their own. This is not one of those CD's that you pick up and once you've heard one song, you've basically heard them all. Each song is crafted with its own unique feel and message. Some are heavier, some are softer; some feature the usual guitar/drum combo, some include Amy Lee's wonderful piano playing and orchestral instruments. But don't let the piano and chamber choir fool you--this is an edgy, powerful album. You can't help but be moved by it. It is a dark, gothic collection of pensive, brilliant songs that will not disappoint the real music lover.<br />Amy Lee is always great, and Ben Moody is her perfect complimentary element. Being signed to a major label has not altered their powerful lyrics or heart-stopping music. Evanescence surely has nothing but a bright future in store for them.<br />**Highlights of the Album: Track 1) Going Under, Track 2) Bring Me to Life, Track 4) My Immortal, Track 5) Haunted, Track 7) Imaginary, and Track 11) Whisper. Though, in all honesty, each of the tracks on this album is very likable and pleasing to the ears.ck 11) Whisper. Though, in all honesty, each of the tracks on this album is very likable and pleasing to the ears.
B000A78Z82|1|Este cd es espantosamente horrible...sobre todo las canciones en espanol..no tiene estilo propio.. De verdad no lo recomiendo.
B00006I53S|5|I've had this lens for a month or so now and I am extremely pleased with it. In all lighting situations it has performed excellent. The IS really does make a pretty noticable difference. It was well worth it.
B00AMBLXP8|1|This was stupid. And somewhat boring and predictable. Hard to believe Marky Mark would even bother with such a movie.
B003Y8YXGC|5|I like this when it was first released all those years ago.But time has made this better.John voice is timeless the songs are great from Mind Games to Meat City it all works.
B00M7URUUE|1|Couldn't even finish it
B00FHSQKZ4|4|Works well ! I love this app~ it let you know the time when whatever you are doing! Great job!
B00G3L6KQI|5|What can I say except love this trilogy!!!!!!!
B00IX9UPV4|4|I find that Google plus understands my voice commands better than Siri and provides better responses verbally to my questions.
B002XMGGJM|3|when you have a great movie such as this, and then add true blu ray quality to make it even better, you get a masterpiece that comes alive on your tv set. fantastic purchase, from the shipping and quality, to the end result which is a great story coming to life. very pleased indeed.
B000SEKO4K|2|I had to return this after a year when I noticed that one of Hamlet's lines was missing! An obvious typo. His name is printed in all caps, but the line is left out. It's in Act I, Scene 5. The scene with the GHOST. HAMLET says \\"Speak, I am bound to hear.\\" Except in this version Hamlet doesn't say it.<br /><br />I'm guessing the error must have happened in the conversion from print to digital. It's a very nice edition otherwise and I hope to re-acquire it someday after the error has been fixed. I like that it has Thomas Moore, which Shakespeare is believed to have partly written. The rep at Amazon couldn't have been nicer and said he'd pass on the error to the folks at Oxford.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This app is so amazing people should try it it is fun but chalenging
B00007KWHG|5|This CD was delivered promptly in excellent condition. This album is a great collection of Frankie Vallie and the Four Seasons songs. It covers so many of the hits you want to hear. Definitely a set of good car tunes.
B0012EM5D8|5|Bee Movie is one of those cute movies that has perfect animation. The storyline has a happy ending with plenty of tension in the middle, so it will leave you feeling satisfied. The movie explores the consequences to humans if the bees demanded all their honey back.There are plenty of puns, Seinfeld style. It gives you a look at the world from a bee's perspective and presented with fantastic computer animation. If you have children you will not be disappointed with the purchase. And your children will develop a respect for bees.
B000002ADT|5|Saying more about this album than has been said is simply gilding the lily.  This is an important jazz album.  It's not, however, the only jazz album nor necessarily the most important album that Miles made--you might also want to try &quot;'Round About Midnight&quot; and &quot;Milestones&quot; and see if you like them enough to move to the great quintet sides with Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Ron Carter, and Wayne Shorter. Start here if you will; having this disc in your collection is mandatory, particularly if you want to be perceived as hip.  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is a great album, but not an end all.  The greatness in the album is in part in the modal innovations introduced by pianist Bill Evans.  The Evans-Davis collaborations have been discussed at length.  Evans plays on &quot;So What?&quot; &quot;Blue in Green,&quot; &quot;All Blues,&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches.&quot;  This neither diminishes nor compromises the importance of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly.  Coltrane was developing his unique style; Adderly's connection to blues roots balanced the quartet--the personnel define the music, and the music was innovative.
B004EIZCPM|2|Meh movie.  World revolves around girl and the problems she creates for herself.  Watched because I was forced but even my girlfriend was not thrilled with her choice.
030758836X|5|I am a fan of true crime TV and murder mysteries and this book did not disappoint!I found this book very interesting, with some twists and turns that I expected and could see coming, but as it got closer to the end, I did not expect the twist and turns that came.<br />Book left me a little creeped out (especially since I am about to get married!)but it will stay with me and make me think, which is a quality I enjoy in a book.<br />This book was on par with her other books, Dark Places and Sharp Objects....I thoroughly enjoy this author and hopes she keeps writing more books!
160094048X|5|My son is allergic to eggs, dairy and soy and I am so thankful for Isa & Terry and all their wonderful books.  This is a staple in our kitchen and my kids love picking out delicious treats that we can all make together.  The authors are fun to read and the recipes are easy to follow with stellar results.  I haven't tried one recipe from the book that wasn't a hit.
B007V2UGPE|5|Samurai AND Zombies ?! What more can a girl wish for ?? Ninjas !! But I love the game !! I like how you gottah use strategy. It's like playing chess .. WITHOUT IT BEING BORING L O L ..
B00DJFIMW6|4|An excellent game. Has great characteristics and really incorporates both movies into the game. My only complaint is that it is very hard to get Gru coins without spending real money, so some costumes may never get purchased. UNLESS you find out the rewards, and can earn up to 50 Gru coins at a time! Oh, and collecting the bapples is cute! All in all love it!
B00DVKOYBM|4|Not bad but I could win a hell of a lot more on a real pool table!!!
B005DD7MH8|5|They now make drugs similar to this.  Some are for sale on amazon
B005MLP71Y|4|Exciting in the beginning. Somewhat boring in the end...
B007HACDLK|5|Always on target.  One of the best in this addictive series of powerful adventures.  Looking forward to  the next gem.
B008XG1X18|5|I have been using pinterest about a year ago,and I love it! It has actually changed my life! It has become a hobby for me. Try it! It's pretty cool. :)
B00QL0ST1K|4|I put 4 stars because the game itself puts You in the shoes of a player and simulatesa great feel of the game football<br /><br />.This is the only game that would be know for its great quality and fair controlled.<br /><br /> The graphics are amazing but they could be a bit better. Nice job
B00JJXTP64|3|I'm a huge fan of the Guild Hunter series, in fact, I would say it's my favorite urban fantasy series. Unfortunately, this book was just okay. There were certainly some enjoyable scenes, but for the most part Ash and Janvier didn't stand out that much to me. The other characters' scenes were much for interesting, like how Elena interacts with the Legion, and Naasir being Naasir. Despite Ash and Janvier being the main characters, there was so much going on with other characters that they ended up feeling like side characters. Maybe that's why I couldn't really get in to it. All in all this felt like a filler book, and it lacked the magnetism from previous book.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed in this installment was Naasir! He certainly stole the show for me. Also, can we get more Venom. I miss him. And Sorrow.<br /><br />Give me Venom or give me death! lol
B004SEUIWO|1|I had a copy of Chicago DVD.  I bought this one to get wide screen.  It said wide screen on the box, but the DVD was not wide screen it was full screen. Yuck!
B00004U45G|5|I saw this show in Camden, NJ. A friend of mine said he had some great tickets and man was he right. Kenny Wayne Sheppard, a much younger and rougher, was the opening act. Kenny wailed on some old standards as well as some of his early hits. Then on to the show. Remembering this is when The Crowes were blowin' up....I mean white hot! To see them pair with Jimmy Paige was a dream come true. I was too young to see anything but The Song Remains the Same from Led Zeppelin days. Man it would have been cool to take in a show, I would have stood in line for days. But this was the next best thing at the time.<br /><br />So this is from the Greek, not to sure of the dates of Camden but I'm sure the set list was a bit different. This does bring back my memories of the Camden show though. Great production with great artists, always appreciated! A must for any Zeppelin/Crowes fan.
B001G9LVGG|5|What a gorgeous collection of songs!  Choose a quiet spot and just sit, letting this music pour through your soul...enchanting.  My favorite is  \\"Noel Nouvelet!\\" sung in ancient French.  Loreena is a uniquely talented  artist, taking you away to another time and another place.  Exquisite, and not just for Christmas.
B004EPYZSU|5|Always have loved this film!

B000002VMD|5|been looking for this sound track for long time--so happy ya'll had one more copy---It is wonderful to have in my collection
B00AFROVQC|4|I am really enjoying Thor discovering the world aroung him. This is lighthearted filler enjoyment for me!<br />However Harry Potter it is not!
0385344228|5|This was one of the most &#34;I can't put this down&#34; books ever.  The author kept throwing me off base - he did it - he didn't do it.  Mom is right - Dad is right. Psych doctor is on to something - she' s weird.  Did not expect the ending. WOW!!!!
B00181MHQU|5|Of course I've seen it before, but it had been a number of years. I had forgotten how good this show is and was. Every song is so good-not a clunker in the bunch. This was great to watch with our kids and talk about afterwards. Yes, some of the language is dated to the 60s (cool, Daddio) but not so outdated that even my kids couldn't understand. This was a great family night movie.
B007EECSFA|5|Kate Morton writes an excellent tale right up to the very last sentence. This was my fourth book to read. Now I must wait months for the next one!!
B00NG4K8UO|5|Awesome keyboard.. Easy to use with tons of features and great auto correct.
1936891026|3|I don't really have much to say about this book. It's just alright. The writing style and formatting sort of bored me and the book seemed repetitive to me. I don't think Pressfield is gifted in the self-help genre.
B004VMUS9G|5|This app is the best! I would never wake up before but since I got the app I wake up every morning and I love the math method for the snooze. Highly recommended.
006202406X|1|I am not a person who needs a happy ending in a book, but this ending was terrible. Actually, the hole book is awful. Absolutely no logic in it.
B000BTJDGC|4|I'm not really into the horror movies with mindless gore and violence.  This movie however, was a lot more subtle with it's scariness.  It was very well paced and the acting was believable.  What makes it even creepier is that it was based on a true story.  If you are into psychological type horror movies I would recommend this.
B007VDN1PA|4|I got this to convert my 35mm slides to digital format.  It is easy to use and produces images of reasonable quality if you are looking for snapshot type images.  If you are looking to make professional-style, high resolution, large format images, you will probably be disappointed by this unit.  When coupled with an SD card, it is amazingly fast to convert a great number of slides.  While you can make some adjustments (exposure, brightness) using the small LCD screen, I found it more useful to make most adjustments using image editing software after transferring the files to my PC.
B004GHNIRK|5|Good I'll recommend it.
B0001XALTG|5|Overall, Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made, it's that simple.  What a trip this movie is.  The dialogue, setting, acting and soundtrack are exceptional.  It is at once incredibly disturbing, extremely suspensful, ridiculously funny and very much moving.  It's almost a character study.  We see what Rents goes through and whether we can relate to it or not(I hope not) doesn't matter because it's thoroughly engaging.  Robert Carlyle (Begbie) is insanely funny, and completely psychotic as well.  Spud is completely hopeless, yet we sympathize with him.  Sick Boy is troubled yet appears successful and happy on the outside.  Does Rents deserve what he gets(or takes) in the end?  You be the judge.  Just be prepared to go from being shocked, to sad, to frustrated, in stitches and finally to utterly pleased.  It doesn't get much better than this.
B0027MJU00|5|This is the second novel by Gillian Flynn that I've read. I finished in two days and found it hard to put my book down. This book was a fantastic, nail biting read and strongly recommend this book.
B0042TV4IW|5|Real life characters, in real life situations, played out of history! With each season the changing times for Lark Rise and Candleford  people also grew into the season 3 topper that any nation can look back in their own history of change and relate too. Very well presented, glad I watched all three seasons.
B0044RUSZM|5|holds my 14in asus pretty well (kind of small but works), nice quality and looks nice too
B004DLPXAO|5|Use it although I have a kindle...

B00846TRHY|5|I HAS A GREAT STORY LINE AND i WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THE MOVIE TO ANYONE,,,GRIPPING AND WARMS THE HEART LOL
B00GK65HWE|5|OMG I loved this movie it was even better than the first one it had so much action and Luke was so hot and Percy Jackson
0140067477|5|This book is a wonderfully written treatise on Taoism expressed in a manner that we can all easily understand. You don't need to be a Pooh fan or a Taoist expert to appreciate the book, but you'll probably become more interested in both after you read the book. I've read a lot around Taoism and it's easy to see that Hoff's summary in this book is not the most academic I've ever read. It's not necessarily the most practical either, but it does allow you to visualise certain of the more esoteric notions in a manner familiar to us all. Like most of the books that I really love, this one has been a popular gift item in my friends' stockings over the past few years. I hope you enjoy it.
B0084IG8TM|5|Good movie
B00SH00N3Y|3|The movie start out a bit slow. It did begin to pick up, lots of action. I was disappointed with the ending. If you like scifi give this one a try.

B0082XJGRK|4|The book is clear and the ideas of Marcus Aurelius and the stoics of which he was identified as a follower prove to be timeless wisdom and realistic.
B0000WN0ZK|4|Director Michelangelo Antonioni leads us on a bizarre and artsy journey between the real and the imagined through the psychedelic scene of 1960's London.  David Hemmings who nicely plays disillusioned photographer Thomas, is taking a break from his hectic schedule.  Strolling through a local park with camera in hand he is casually taking pictures of sights and scenes.  He espies a couple in amorous embrace and innocently takes a series of photographs of them.  The woman, Jane played by Vanessa Redgrave is visibly upset and demands that Hemmings give her the photos.  He blows her off and leaves the park.<br /><br />Hemmings returns to his flat and studio and who should turn up but Redgrave.  She tries to seduce him in an attempt to procure the film but Hemmings gives her a different roll of film instead.<br /><br />After Redgrave departs Hemmings heads to his darkroom to develope the film of the couple in the park.  One photograph in particular interests him and he begins blowing up different segments of the photo to discover a figure with a pistol hidden in the bushes.  A subsequent photo blown up shows an apparent body lying on the ground.  Has a murder been committed?<br /><br />Hemmings rushes back to the park where he discovers the corpse of the gent that he saw with Regrave.  Hemmings is at a loss as to what to do and meanders through a wild rock concert featuring music legends Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds and a subsequent pot party at his friends house, while attempting to reason things out.<br /><br />Hemmings awakens the next morning and rushes back to the park. He finds that the corpse is no longer there.  Did he actually witness a murder or were his mind and camera playing tricks on him?
145160713X|5|This book was purchased for my husband who has an interest in physics.  He is enjoying the information and discusses physics with a friend of his.
B00AAX68HG|5|I remember the first day I bought Cut The Rope. Then when I got this it's like I relived the entire experience haha. I can't wait for more levels to come out. Just like Cut The Rope, it starts off very simple then progresses as it introduced new types and abilities of the pudding monster. I love how the game looks as well, the pudding monsters are adorable, in my opinion.<br />If you love/d Cut The Rope, I absolutely recommend this game as well :D!
B00A9ET4MC|4|Great Read and thoroughly enjoyed this book.  well written and constructed, informational as well as educational.  I believe that this would be a great book club book and plan to recommend it for next book club meeting.

0385341067|5|Lloyd Jones's Mr. Pip imparts a hopeful message about the power that literature and storytelling have in constructing both a society's and an individual's identity.  The true heart of Jones's novel resides neither in the turmoil of the Papua New Guinean Civil War or in the ethnic differences between the two main characters, Matilda and \\"Pop Eye.\\"  Where Mr. Pip succeeds to capture the imagination of its audience most successfully is in its paralleled realization of the role a reader participates in when finding the relevance of a fictional story in order to craft a new consciousness.  The paralleled realization that takes place involves both Matilda as a newly enchanted reader and Mr. Pip's audience as the novel urges its participants to revisit the birthplace of their love for literature and storytelling.  Matilda's enthusiasm is partnered with an understanding of the world that becomes filtered through a desire to experience her chaotic world vicariously.  The literature she reads, and the stories that the villagers tell, give Matilda the strength to survive events that would be better left to a fictional world, but are all too much a veritable presence in the small, remote island of Bougainville.<br /><br />The Civil War, the fate of the characters in Mr. Pip, and the central difference of ethnicity between Matilda and \\"Pop Eye\\" are important, but what sets this novel apart from similar attempts to portray the violence and instability of these kinds of areas is its insistence on the necessity of literature and storytelling to provide the means for a community to persevere.  Mr. Pip does not fail to shock or to horrify with the severity of the events Matilda and the villagers face, but the tense and ominous atmosphere that Jones creates only serves as a backdrop to highlight the role a reader takes in not only understanding the narrative of his or her life, but in also becoming the author of his or her experience in the world.  This cannot be done alone, as the villagers stories prove, but it can be accomplished from the most unlikely sources.  Whether the author is Dickens or Jones, Matilda or the villagers, Mr. Pip serves as a reminder that the formation of a society's or individual's identity cannot be separated from each other, and it can only be enhanced through the reading of enthralling pieces of literature like this that continue to encourage our participation in the construction of our shared world.stories prove, but it can be accomplished from the most unlikely sources.

B00MB6IYHW|5|My favorite movie of 2014. Whiplash was a close second, but Guardians just pulled me in like a movie hadn't in awhile. I bought the sound track and have watched the movie twice since I got it on DVD. Humor, acting, and fun script made this a movie I am sure I will watch for years.
B0094BB4TW|2|I hate that my account gets hacked a lot.  Gotta love the goverment for that.  Thanks for the frustration of having friends disappear off my friends list, even after adding them back several times.  People think i'm a stalker now, they have no idea that Facebook has become a sham.  Not happy with it at all.
0553801473|4|(I am Hungarian, excuse my English)<br /><br />I checked some reviews down there and it appears that GRRM's latest dance with dragons has been received with mixed feelings. Well, my two cents go to GRRM, I say this book is great, as great as any of his works -- it's just slightly different. To my taste, these changes may even lift the book above the other sequels. I saw complaints about slow storytelling, uncharacteristic characters, and even, horribile dictu, boredom. I don't want to - since I can't - measure out justice in the case, fantasy is not an objectively measurable genre, nonetheless, I would remind readers about two points that might be worth considering while assessing this book.<br /><br />* The Ice and Fire saga moves a vast number of characters around the board. I imagine it is quite some challege for the author to balance between expectations of readers who yearn for action-packed, intricate stories and of those who wish to see characters grow, develop, process - or just simply react to - events. Work on details or move ahead, might GRRM ask himself day by day. I think he did a fairly good job. Lots of things are going on, and we see characters change. Thoroughly. Or die. Latter one a trade mark of GRRM.<br /><br />* (spoilers follow) What happened to Tyrion, a giant spirit in dwarf body, so that he lets fate drag him around, mostly against his will, to random places, or seemingly nowhere in particular? What hit the Kingslayer so that he often broods, pats people on the shoulder, saves ugly maidens, forgives insults and makes peace instead of war? I am telling you. They are subject to GRRMs world order. A prince is prince in his own realm, yes. And becomes a slave or game piece if extracted from his fortified settings. Looses vigour when aging, loosing his sword hand, or facing the fact that his paramour twin cheats him and makes efforts to ruin their whole lineage. It is a game of thrones, man, get over it. Would it be more amusing to follow the \\"traditional\\" pattern? Deus ex machina tricks and cheap shortcuts? I don't think so. Gods are dead in GRRM's realm. They don't rush out and save you with flaming swords and mirror-polished armors. One of the reasons I like GRRM's world is that wounds hurt, characters pay the price of their follies. No one plays the game of thrones in god mode.<br /><br />To sum it all up, I am desperately waiting for the next book and pray for good healt to GRRM so that we can enjoy his books in abundance for the foreseeable future.
B00G03LDSO|5|I have been listening to these guys since Satellite!  My very first CD I ever owned was of this band. Always number one on my list of favorite bands!
0765334798|1|Too ambitious and not carried out well. Even with better logic behind it it could have been summed up in a novella or short story - not a novel. It was too long.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Although I am retired from teaching I would like the opportunity to recommend this book to mature young readers. The subject of chronic and terminal illness in young people is approached and handily covered in a straightforward, realistic, yet heartfelt &#34;bedside&#34; manner. The characters try their best to live like other teens and their conversational banter reveals this desire yet the kids who are sick and have been for a long time in their short lives have a tentative grit to carry on for those who love them, and for themselves. I am glad I have it handy on my Kindle. I might read it again!
1476727651|4|I am a huge fan of this author and he still keeps me coming back for more!
B004APVI1G|5|The movie is visually stunning. The 3D Imax version left such an impression on my 10 yr. son that he is now \\"plowing\\" through the 15 books in this series. I couldn't be happier! Both my boys 8 and 10 felt that seeing this movie and its classic story was a special memory. I know they'll look back and remember this - like I did when I saw Star Wars! Enjoy!

B005HXGE9G|3|I own and have repurchased practically everything peter gabriel has ever released more than twice.  but...<br /><br />You really need to be in a particular mood to actually sit and truly listen to this album from start to finish as this can't, in my opinion, be listened to in any other way.  It's a more formal, more sophisticated listening experience.  I really can't put my finger on it as to why, but, the video of this is (at times) painful to watch.  Maybe the reality of his age ?... I don't know.  Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats.<br /><br />While there is no mistaking pg's registered trademark on this arrangement, I'm not usually that big on recycled versions or orchestrated arrangments.  It's typically dramatic, signature gabriel... I get it... but, the addition of Melanie Gabriel seemingly  because she's peter gabriel's daughter wreak's it for me.  Her voice is really kinda blah and doesn't fit.  Nonetheless, while  I do own both audio and video copies, I find that I almost have to force myself to listen to/watch it.<br /><br />Pete Townshend's &#34;Music From Lifehouse&#34; (DVD) is probably the best example for how previously released material should be orchestrated.
B00CSGYLQI|2|Cheaply made. Not worth the money it costs. My 4 year old daughter got it for Christmas of 2014 - it has held up but barely. The stairs fall apart the easiest.
B008861R7S|5|One word.  Dope
B00009ZYC0|4|First of all the movie shows the possible future of cities which are under a technological lockdown.<br /><br />However in the end, it is reduced to the human beings who were manipulating the technology for good or bad.<br /><br />It is worth seeing since advances in technological may be accompanied by certain down sides. Under the belly of it is the human being with its basic instincts and so technology cannot do a thing about that.<br /><br />In this movie people who were potential criminals were kept in animated suspension in bubble chambers. This as the safeguard society from their potential criminal acts but the controllers of the technology found ways to exhibit human nasty tendencies and so the whole idea of the technology protecting human society, fell apart, because the human remain as he is a basis survival organism.
B00QROJ94Q|5|So good!
B006LSZECO|5|This book was very good and interesting.  I had a hard time putting it down wanting to only find out what's going to happen next.  The characters were interesting.  I would recommend.
B00338QENI|1|This book was boring, pointless, and I didn't learn anything reading. There is far too much of the author inside the book. I don't care about Rebecca Skloot, I care about Henrietta Lacks, and after reading this I really don't know that much more about her.
B006LSZECO|4|This book certainly held my attention for the duration of the book.  The ending surprised me less than I had wanted it to and seemed a little abrupt, but it was an appropriate ending to the roller coaster ride that Flynn takes one on in this book.  The others in my book club ranked it a &#34;5&#34;, so obviously it is a book one wants to finish.  It is certainly well written and, at times, absolutely captivating.  It is a book worth reading.
B00FATEJYE|5|Had it on my iPhone.and love it even more on my Kindle Fire HDX! Graphics are off the chain and really crisp.
B00IN5ZQNA|4|The album is like every Edguy album. Only one song I did not care for. On a better note. The shipper was great. Got it to me quick, no problems.
B000GWJGMU|4|Subtle humor that is truly enjoyable.  Characters that are silly but endearing.  Good twists and turns and a happy ending as always with Austen.
B00BIK3FAI|4|Great fun<br /> My daughter loved it.
B00BMVTS1S|5|Enjoyed the scenery and following Bilbo on his journey. The scene with the in the caves with the gollum was the most impactful for me.
B00B2V66VS|5|Very fun I play it all the time love it.My hole family loves it. I like it more than temple run. This is the best.
B00005RY7X|5|A.W.K. just wrote the single best party album EVER.  'Nuff said.
B001JNND9W|5|my dad loves this movie and the blu-ray is actually much better quality then the dvd.  If you have a blu-ray player this is the way to go.
B00000DLVA|5|i've listened to them all and this one grabs me the most. the whole album is good. your favorite game got a little played out but is still cool. <br />erase and rewind is very nice.
B000WCDBKM|3|Very good.<br />Would watch again, Johnny Depp makes this movie shine like a gem. Not too predictable, pretty original. Go see
0486296954|5|Agatha Christie's sister once boasted to her that she had never read a mystery in which she didn't know right away who the killer was. Agatha answered her by writing her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It was quite a start to a brilliant literary career. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well plotted and the characters are great to read about. Hercule Poirot and Hastings are really hilarious together. Poirot has to be the greatest crime-solver in literature. The entire cast of characters in this novel is interesting. This probably isn't Christie's best work (my favorite is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) because her characteristic clean prose hadn't quite developed yet, but this is an extremely important work and is, like all of her books, entertaining. The literary critic Edmund Crispin summed Christie's work up best when he wrote: &quot;You know, relaxing with a Christie, that for an hour or two you can forget the authentic nastiness of life and submerge yourself in a world where, no matter how many murders take place, you are essentially in nevver-never land.&quot;
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is super cool
B0091P69CI|4|great movie
B00BLCHZC2|5|What an interesting look into the not very documented world of the vikings.

B00D8HNR2K|5|Soooo happy Trent came out with a new album. &#60;3 It's definitely different (People looking for original Reznor need not apply) but it's just so GREAT. &#60;3
B000FC1AGG|5|This is my favorite book - it's so funny and cute and once I started reading it, I couldn't stop!
B005ZOBNOI|3|This book came so highly recommended that it was a disappointment for me. Although I could emotionally connect with the main characters and felt for them,  the writing style itself was not for me.
B00BMNM4H6|5|Fascinating concept. Enjoyed the challenge. Still working on getting through the levels. Do a few every night to keep my mind active

That way I have something to<br />watch which I absolutely love, could watch these episodes over & over!
B009HQ9UHC|4|it is ok i guess but not really the best thing in the whole wide open world we live in.
B000005IZ8|5|Towering and anthemic, reflective and pondering, confused, outraged, humbled, empathetic, impressed.  This is some of the most intriguing music to come out of the modernist genre, let alone movie sountracks.  The movie is worth watching- it's as provocative as the music is evocative, but the film relies on the music much more so than the other way around.  Anyone could listen to this music, instantaly recognize it as foreign, strange, and still find something familiar and understandable in it.  This music is fairly well sampled, and I've heard it in movie trailers and on PBS.  National Public Radio's Ira Glass, host of &quot;This American Life, (who happens to be obliquely related to the composer) often uses cousin Phillip's music on his radio show, although I believe it is from the Soundtrack of Eroll Morris' masterpiece &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (That's a must-see film too, by the way, with a great Phillip glass score).  Definately check this CD out.
B00M7UTFW0|1|One of the worst films I have seen in a very, very, very long time.  Terrible script, poor acting (perhaps the one saving grace was Jennifer Connelly) and complete utter nonsense with talking rock creatures straight out of a Transformers film.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or time, it is 138 mins of your life that you will never get back.

0062059998|4|The second The One arrived on my doorstep, I tore right into it! I’ve been waiting for the conclusion to this story for so long because it is just so addicting (albeit frustrating at times). I’m happy to say that I really enjoyed this conclusion and think the series ended on a high note.<br /><br />One of my biggest complaints about The Elite was that America really got on my nerves. I was so happy to see her acting more like she did in The Selection. She proved to me that she has what it takes to be a leader, and regardless of how The Selection ended, it was clear that by the end of the story she had grown a lot and learned more about herself.<br /><br />As refreshing as it was to get back to the original America, one thing that irked me is that some of the characters seemed to do a 180—Celeste & Aspen for example start to act completely differently than they had in the other books and it always bugs me when characters start to act unlike themselves. It isn’t that Celeste & Aspen have grown up and become more mature. There is very little reason given for the changes in their personality, and if it was well founded, that didn’t come across in the novel.<br /><br />I was hoping we would get a lot more information about the Dystopian world Cass created, and while we do see more of it, it still just feels like a backdrop. The Selection really is a story about pretty girls in pretty dresses trying to marry a Prince. The setting is cool and intriguing, but this isn’t a book I’d really recommend to dystopian fans. It’s more a long the lines of The Luxe.<br /><br />Even though The One was not a perfect novel, it was a fast, fun, and thoroughly engaging read. Cass is just an amazing story teller and I am so looking forward to reading whatever she writes next, but I am going to miss The Selection series so much.
B00AKKS278|4|This is an easy read and a very simple straightforward strategy for success.  Highly recommended for all ages and all walks of life.
B00LLMFAAG|5|Just fantastic.
6304994540|5|Don't worry about the plot of this movie too much when you first see it.  You'll miss some of the best dialogue and subtly sublime humor in any movie, ever.<br />The minor characters truly add to this movie- Bunny's first  scene had me searching for an ATM and Jesus warrants at least two rewinds  himself- but the bread and butter is The Dude, played beautifully by Jeff  Bridges.  The Dude is a 60s-esque stoner/slacker whose most brilliant  dialogue happens when he is most confused.  His response to a nasty threat  from Jesus:  &quot;Well that's, like... your opinion, man.&quot;  Or when  confronted with a glimpse of an older man's tears:   &quot;Bummer.&quot;<br />This is an offbeat movie with as much comic depth as  any movie I've seen.  If you enjoy films like Fargo, Pulp Fiction, or  Reservoir Dogs, this is one to own!
0545123291|4|It's been more than a year since I've read Shiver, and I wasn't really planning on reading its sequel or the third book in the trilogy when they came out. But during the summer I won a copy of Forever, the third book, and decide to just buy a copy of Linger and read them. I didn't hate or even dislike Shiver. Actually, I'm not even sure why I didn't automatically buy Linger.<br /><br />Unfortunately I started out this book almost unbearably confused. I read the first book so long ago and read so many book after, that I forgot a lot of the major plot happenings. I had to do a bit of research to get everything straightened out in my mind, though this wasn't the book's fault of course. What was the book's fault was that NOTHING happened until the end. It was all just a whole bunch of build up for something that we all knew was going to happen anyway. So, I was often bored because books need plot right?<br /><br />I understand that a lot of the book focused on character development and suspense building and all that jazz. But the suspense was ruined because readers are smart. The character development was okay, but it accounted for too much of the book. The only thing that it did was make my emotions a bit higher when very bad or very good things happened to them. Adding a new character to the mix was a great idea, because without his and Isabelle's side plot, I don't know if I could have made it. Every chapter about Sam and Grace felt the same as the one before it. Cole's and Isabelle's brought continuing excitement.<br /><br />The ending was nice and makes me really want to read Forever, which I guess is good for a book that isn't a standalone to do. Because when things WERE happening? I really liked this book. I was caught off guard by the boring-ness of the second book in a trilogy. Unless Forever is jam packed with action, I don't know why there need to be three books.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book but wasn't excited about the lack of action. The first book was so mysterious and sweet, but Linger just laid it all out. Maybe if I would have read it closer to reading Shiver, I would have cared more about the characters.<br /><br />[...]Linger just laid it all out. Maybe if I would have read it closer to reading Shiver, I would have cared more about the characters.    [...]
B0018O4YSQ|5|That this film is not better known and rated more highly is a crime!<br />The movie manages to combine the style of 1950s science fiction and film noir in one package. It then sets this in an atmosphere of the 1940s, while making use of up to date special effects.<br />Rufus Sewell and even more William Hurt play their role to perfection, while Jennifer Connelly, as always, is a sight for sore eyes.  The visual artistry of the movie is stunning, the story gripping, and the music score right on target.<br />I really like everything about this movie, and to top it all the director's cut blu-ray has not one but three commentary tracks as well as a number of documentaries. This is a must buy, especially if you like science fiction.

0805062971|5|If you think this book isn't about business or can't inform just about any business in America, then you're sorely mistaken. <br />This book has everything to do with business that Sun Tzu's The Art of War does.  While there are many instruction manuals in the world that teach the strong how to be strong and the great minds to compete in the business world, this is the only book that delves into the minds of the 21st century male. <br />We are a nation of men who have been told violence is never okay. That it is never permissible to hit another person. That the only permissible course of action in any conflict is to call for authority and await the outcome. <br />Fight Club teaches us how the male has been emasculated and all about the simmering violence that lies just beneath that can be exploited or-worse-ignored at great peril. <br />The book speaks loudly about marketing and merchandise but really the book is about conflict and how competition has really become a bad word in modern day America. <br />Think this isn't true? Look at how businesses compete today? Most operations would rather coexist peacefully with their competitors. Most managers would rather play it safe. Most executives foster images of humility. <br />Fight Club teaches us about the absolute necessity of competition in order to channel the violence and aggression into constructive and important aims. Left to fester, violence boils like an infection just beneath the skin and will, ultimately, find release in some fashion. The Greeks knew this; they called it Katharsis. <br />This book will teach you why you have to fight. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM

B00003CXAW|5|OK, first off, this dvd is very well done. the picture is grainy is a few areas, but overall the picture quality is excellent, by far the best I've seen. All the restored scenes, mostly of natives and others meeting violent ends, and fay ray getting \\"peeled\\" like a banana are back and great. BUT the lost spider sequence IS NOT reinserted into the film. It is there in the supplemental materials, and is quite interesting, as is the featurette about how peter jackson and his crew made it.  I am not complaining, just letting you know what you are getting.  <br /> <br /> The commentaries are great, but at certain points the comments from Merian C. Cooper, which are snippets of interviews, sound like they are coming from a speaker phone and are hard to hear. The rest of the commentary is great. <br /> <br />also, the sound is not the greatest, but what can you expect from a 70 year old film. You have to keep the volume way up to hear the dialog, and when music kicks in at the high volume it gets a little distorted, as does the dialog at times. <br /> <br />I still give it 5 stars, the negatives are very minor and everything else about the fim is great- there are enough supplemental materials here to keep anyone happy.

B001EXE2ZG|5|I am a big movie buff, and Sunset Boulevard is my all time favorite movie. Every scene, every line spoken, every costume worn, every musical note is 100% perfect. Had 'Sunset Boulevard' and 'All About Eve' not been nominated at the Academy Awards in the same year they never would have canceled each other out. Both pictures would have gone home with a boatload of awards instead of the few each got. To say Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is one of the all time greatest female roles goes without saying, but I just said it. So buy this movie, now! No movie collection is complete without it.
006091307X|4|I don't normally advocate criminal behavior, but if you're going to read this book, I might suggest you smoke something a bit stronger than tobacco if you're into that kind of thing.  It might help to bring this book into focus.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the author was in a similar state when he wrote it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much I can tell you about the plot.  We start off with Oedipa Maas, a young suburban California housewife, who finds out that she's been named executor of her ex-boyfriend's estate.  While diligently attending to the estate (not to mention attending to her co-executor), she stumbles upon a symbol scrawled on a bathroom wall with a reference to something called \\"WASTE\\".  Oedipa develops an obsession with the symbol which seems to pop up with increasing frequency the more she pursues its meaning.  Her adventures lead her from person to person, each character more bizarre than the last, and from unbelievable situation to impossible event.<br /><br />This book is maddeningly impossible to get your head around.  Nothing ever quite makes sense, but there's always something tantalizing just around the bend.  Maybe if you read a few more pages it will start to make sense.  But the further you go on, the less sense it makes, but yet the more we feel we might just get rewarded if we read a little further.<br /><br />We follow Oedipa's descent into conspiracy madness through a long-winded description of a five-act Jacobean revenge play, an encounter with a truly mad scientist, an all-night ramble through the seamy side of San Francisco, the intricacies of stamp collecting, and epic accounts of the obscurest points of the history of mail delivery (although, how much, if at all, that \\"history\\" resembles reality is more than I can say).<br /><br />At one point in her obsession, Oedipa looks at the possibilities.  Either she's stumbled into one of the most elaborate conspiracies in the history of the world, or she's been set up by her late ex-boyfriend in some sort of elaborate hoax, or else she's mentally ill.  We sense all along that the author is playing with Oedipa, poking fun at her and her frail human ability to grasp and comprehend.  But then we realize that he's poking fun at us too.  And at life itself and all of our grand and serious searching for The Meaning of Life.<br /><br />The characters are mostly quite unsympathetic and unengaging.  Mostly that's because they don't stick around long enough for us to get to know them.  But even the main character, Miz Maas, doesn't arouse our sympathy.  That's because none of the characters are actual human beings; they are mere symbols in Pynchon's game of life.  Our clue is in their corny, punny names:  \\"Mucho\\" Maas, Genghis Cohen, you get the picture.<br /><br />The book is not meant to be taken as a literal story any more than \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" is.  Both are satires.  But unlike \\"Gulliver's Travels\\", it is unclear who or what is being satirized in \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\".  Some things are obvious, like America's post-war cookie-cutter suburban blight and the empty lives that accompany such blight.  But it's more than that, though what the \\"more\\" is, is always just out of reach.<br /><br />Although this is a very slim volume, it's not easy reading.  Pynchon's wordy prose can at times go on for pages without completing a single paragraph.  It is almost always difficult to follow exactly what's happening and to keep the characters straight.  Nonetheless, I recommend this book as an introduction to Thomas Pynchon largely because it is so short.  Judging by the reviews, Pynchon has a devoted following and a number of critics.  This book is perfect for discovering which you are.  For myself, I'm not quite sure yet.  I ended up liking the book in spite of myself, but I don't really think it will stick with me.  Some ambiguous books leave me puzzling over them for weeks or months to come, but I don't think this will be one of them.aborate hoax, or else she's mentally ill.

B004J4XGN6|3|The problem with modern business books now these days is that they have a great idea they want to explain but instead of putting it an article, they have to write a 200-300 paged book. This is the case with Eric Ries’ The Lean Startup. I highly agree with his message of smartly navigating a new product in the hi-tech market. Many companies launch excellent products but fall flat on their faces because of misguided management. Even more absurd is that management doesn’t even listen to their customers nor do they act probably when their customers show discontent.  This book is an overly explained cook book for managers or team leaders on how to launch a new product from a startup or from an established company. With an emphasis on listening to your customer and changing direction to accommodate them, each step Eric recommends makes sense and should be executed. He even believes a product should be launched earlier amongst a controlled environment in order to learn from them and make the proper adjustments so not to waste money launching an end product no one would be interested in. The examples he uses are more focused on software applications and SaaS (Software as a Service).<br /><br />I did not agree with two points in his book. First, for such a long winded book, he barely talks about the threat of competition. If a company launches a service or product very early into the market, the competition can jump on it and totally take advantage. He claims that the company would have a head start but I do not agree. Once you expose your product, you can not predict what the competition will do.  I think he should have taken the competition more into consideration. Second, I think his theory is weak when applying to hardware products. Hardware does not have that kind of quick fix flexibility and he does not mention this obstacle.<br /><br />Even though I gave it three stars, I do believe this book should be read. The messages are good. I recommend that a company assigns one individual to read the book and then summarize it in a PowerPoint presentation of no more than an hour (1.5 at max).  This book will not last the test of time. There is no universal brilliance in it like in Geoffrey Moore’s Crossing the Chasm. It will become obsolete very soon so you might as well read it now.e individual to read the book and then summarize it in a PowerPoint presentation of no more than an hour (1.5 at max).

B00000G3PA|1|Special effects aside, this is an example of Hollywood at its worst. I'm not sure, but I think the writers of this film were purposely writing the corniest lines in the history of movies.

B000VBIGD6|5|this movie was one of yhe best ever and it should have gooten a better rating. my family really like it
0743454537|4|\\"My Sister's Keeper,\\" (2005), by New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult, her eleventh novel, was a monster hit upon its publication.  It followed upon the heels of [[ASIN:1416583866 Second Glance: A Novel]], which is sorta kinda where I come in, as my mystery book club read, and I here reviewed  SECOND GLANCE.  However, whatever that book was, it wasn't much of a mystery, and I must admit I come to MY SISTER'S KEEPER only now, years after the rest of the world.  Which is a pity, as it's one powerful book; although they do say better late than never.<br /><br />SISTER'S KEEPER tells the story of the New England-based Fitzgeralds.  Brian, Dad, is a Providence, Rhode Island fire chief.  Mom Sara is a formerly practicing lawyer, now a full-time mother.  Kate, their eldest daughter, has a particularly virulent case of leukemia, cancer of the blood. Jesse, their son, who is always ignored due to Kate's never-ending medical drama, is getting himself into a lot of trouble.  And Anna, their youngest daughter, is a designer test-tube baby, created for the express purpose of supplying spare parts for her constantly medically yo-yoing sister.  The demand for parts has escalated, from stem cells at her birth, to bone marrow transplants( painful!), to, now, at thirteen, the `need' for her to donate one of her kidneys to her sister.  In fact, Anna has been in and out of the hospital almost as much as Kate and she has had enough.  She decides to sue her parents for medical emancipation, and sends shock waves round the world in so doing.  She hires a lawyer, Campbell Alexander to represent her; her Mom Sara represents the family's interests, and Judge De Salvo appoints Julia Romano as guardian ad litem to Anna, charging her with investigating the case and the family, and recommending what she thinks best for the child plaintiff's interests.<br /><br />No doubt this book can be called chick lit, as it is located within the female world of family.  But the book, as, SECOND GLANCE, and, I expect many of Picoult's works, shows her extraordinary ability to humanize and personalize the great relevant ethics issues of the day.  If you have a pulse, I don't see how you can help but be riveted by the medico/ethical/legal problems of the Fitzgerald family; and I will speak only for myself when I say I have no idea of the \\"correct\\" answer to the complex questions the book raises.<br /><br />The book was made into a substantial film of the same name in 2009,[[ASIN:B002ORTD46 My Sister's Keeper (2009)]].  It starred Cameron Diaz as Sara Fitzgerald, Abigail Breslin as Anna, and Alec Baldwin as the lawyer Campbell Alexander.  The movie was written for the screen and directed by Nick Cassavetes.<br /><br />Picoult was born in Nesconset, New York, a village so far out on Long Island, ordinarily considered a suburb of New York City's, that many people reckon it to be more New England-like than New York-like.  The author's family moved to New England when she was thirteen, and she seems to have largely stayed around there ever since: she took a master's degree at Harvard University, in Massachusetts.  This book, like SECOND GLANCE before it, is set in New England: I expect many of her books are.  She was the recipient of the 2003 New England Book Award for her entire body of work.<br /><br />The author, when queried about this novel, said, \\"I came about the idea for this novel through the back door of a previous one, Second Glance. While researching eugenics for that book, I learned that the American Eugenics Society -- the one whose funding dried up in the 1930s when the Nazis began to explore racial hygiene too -- used to be housed in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Guess who occupies the same space, today? The Human Genome Project... which many consider `today's eugenics.' This was just too much of a coincidence for me, and I started to consider the way this massive, cutting edge science we're on the brink of exploding into was similar... and different from... the eugenics programs and sterilization laws in America in the 1930s. Once again, you've got science that is only as ethical as the people who are researching and implementing it -- and once again, in the wake of such intense scientific advancement, what's falling by the wayside are the emotions involved in the case by case scenarios. I heard about a couple in America that successfully conceived a sibling that was a bone marrow match for his older sister, a girl suffering from a rare form of leukemia. His cord blood cells were given to the sister, who is still (several years later) in remission. But I started to wonder... what if she ever, sadly, goes out of remission? Will the boy feel responsible? Will he wonder if the only reason he was born was because his sister was sick?\\"<br /><br />The reader may be interested to know that between 1929 and 1974, an estimated 7,600 people were sterilized by choice, force, or coercion under the North Carolina Eugenics Board. The program was not abolished until 1977; the legislature and governor of the state are even now discussing how much to award the victims of the program who still survive. It's still very much an issue in this state; the subject matter of SECOND GLANCE may well be even more relevant than Picoult realized. Bless her, she does have the ability to personalize the problems of the day.. the eugenics programs and sterilization laws in America in the 1930s.

B00B3MN65K|5|I mean, it'd be worth listening to just for his voice, even if the songs were awful.  But in fact, &#34;Brave&#34;, &#34;False Alarms&#34; and &#34;Happy in My Heartache&#34; are each worth the price of the album.
B0027MJU00|5|I enjoyed this book. I would have never guessed this ending! I love how the story is told in past and present day sequence, it makes the story go faster.
B009UQC7NS|5|Very entertaining! Kept me on the edge of my seat. Very action packed and it developed the characters further. I was thrilled again to not have commercials, I can't get over that fact. I'm very happy with the quality of the video provided by Amazon.
B000059ZLH|5|I have to agree with other reviewers that 2.0 channel sound only is disapointing.   But the sound is very clear, and definitely showcases the amazing musicians which are Dream Theater.  Is it just me or are the sound levels low on the DVD?  I had to put it about 30-40% higher to get the same levels as other CD's. The concert is amazing.  You really get the feeling that you're watching something special, not just a standard concert.  THe extra singers and the psychiatrist on the stage really add to the atmosphere.  There's about 2 1/2 hours of live music here.   As well, there's tons of extras, interviews with Kevin Shirley, many fans, a nice photo section, and a running commentary featuring the band.  I haven't heard the commentary yet, and I've already invested about 3 1/2 hours on this DVD!  If you're a Dream Theater fan, this one's a no-brainer.
B00BLCHYKU|3|Looked like it was going to be okay, but video froze 15 minutes into show and couldn't get it going again.  Who knows?  Same thing happened to me with &#34;Rome&#34; . . . issues with Amazon Prime Video, I suppose.

B008AT71WI|4|Amazing musical movie, perfect sound quality, great alternative ending (a must-see).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the contrast was tuned up so much (to make it look all renewed and cool), that many details in the blacks are simply cropped off.<br /><br />5 stars for the movie, but -1 for the image quality.
087033039X|5|Bought this at a Tandy store many years ago and had to replace it recently (made the \\"mistake\\" of loaning it out). I bought this instead of Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding. by Bruce Grant. While the other book may be good, the price tag made me balk and not being able to actually flip through it first made me wonder about if it was worth the money.<br /><br />This was well worth it. I was able to take the techniques and use them to make a flail using both suede lace and plastic lace. The instructions are clear and concise. Instructions are given for many different projects.<br /><br />If you do leatherwork, this is a good addition to your collection!
B006OB3K56|5|Overall, Shame is a great film, one which assumes an intelligent audience, and one worthy of pantheon level greatness, in all aspects, from the writing to the technical to the acting- the whole damned package, and an equal or better film than Ingmar Bergman's great film, with which it shares a title, and was even more wildly misinterpreted than this one. Even more so, let me pay its creator the ultimate compliment: if I could get films of my novels made I'd want McQueen to direct them. Shame is great art, and hopefully it will do for the NC-17 rating what Midnight Cowboy did for its predecessor X rating- earn some major Oscar nominations and damn the puerile American film ratings system for good. Another plus it bears is, given that the whole cast, save for Marianne, is white, and set in America, that this film reaches such heights, directed by a black Brit, making it all the more remarkable, and a good herald for a time when, hopefully, in a few decades, critics like me won't even have to mention such things, for, Steve McQueen shares far less in common with hack filmmakers of all backgrounds, especially black hacks like Spike Lee, and for that little bit of heaven I can only end this review as I started it.
0385336691|4|This is an excellent addition to the Reacher series.  Reacher is relying more on guile than violence these days, and this outing requires his inflicting only some broken bones and I believe four fatalities.  The plot is nicely convoluted, although a clever reader will early on suspect that all is not as it seems.  The characters are well developed, and the major locales -- New York and rural England -- are evoked more than adequately.  Lee Child's work is definitely a cut or two above the field in all respects, with the writing quality more than high enough not to present distractions from the story.
B00IRMQADY|1|If Brad Pitt was not associated with this movie it would have filtered thru the ashes of movie viewing hell and settled at the bottom of Target's bargain bin. Terrible editing and oddly assembled to mine academy award ore. No character development and even less exploration of the era to  which some of this country would like to return. You may talk about the brutality afterwards but that's all. A scary thought since we live in a country where a conservative base is actually asking &#34;who's next?&#34;. Maybe all of us. Mr. Pitt, make a movie that asks that question and leave out the zombies. Want to see true greatness? Watch &#34;Frances Ha&#34;, &#34;Blue is the Warmest Color&#34;, or &#34;The Act of Killing&#34; !!!

0817439390|5|I was ready to move from auto mode to manual and was looking for the \\"right\\" book. I found it!!! This book will teach you how to properly use exposure, aperture, shutter speed and ISO. This book is amazing and easy to read. Plus next to each picture you will see the technical description (aperture, shutter speed and ISO). I highly recommend this book!
B00DPM7RJW|3|I really dislike Sydney (the main character) in this book. She literally cries over every single thing that's happened to her in the story. I think she has cried over 15 times in this 385 pages!<br /><br />And this whole book spent 70% of the time (I know because I was constantly looking at that indicator on my kindle) telling us about how the 2 people were fighting their feelings and trying so hard to not get together. 70% of angst! I read the book because it was supposed to tell a story of 2 people getting together, not how they felt guilt and sadness and guilt and guilt and guilt and guilt and tears. Pretty annoyed with the story. The part when they separated momentarily was too dramatic - they were parting, not dying.<br /><br />Characters were likeable apart from the female protagonist. Warren, Briggette, Brennan and Maggie were all wonderful 3-dimensional people. This story also opened my eyes to the deaf community, and Ridge's attitude towards his disability was refreshing and beautiful. The soundtrack accompanying the novel also makes the read more exciting.<br /><br />I read the reviews and I was expecting this one to be good. Oh well! :/ I guess this book is not for everyone. There are people out there who rated this 5 stars, so don't just take my words for it!
B0046B8GEQ|5|Great product Fast Shipping!!
B006UKC566|5|Nice and fast.
0760335540|5|This book is one of the best Porsche related purchases that I have made.  I bought this book for my husband. This handy do-it-yourself manual has saved us a ton of money which in turn leaves more money in the budget for my stuff :-)<br /><br />In all seriousness, this how to book is very easy to understand.  The step by step instructions are easy to follow (not many cuss words coming from the garage).  The photos seem very helpful as well.
B007K3JFUQ|5|Good movie, better story line and a little more together than the first movie. More action than in the Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories but good none the less.
B0000TB050|5|U2 has been a personal favorite of mine for many years.  This is the first time I've seen a performance in/from Ireland.  U2 was clearly enjoying the night with the fans that have loved them since the beginning.  A Time magazine writer once wrote that a U2 concert was part rock show and part religeous experience.  This DVD captures that feeling much like the Red Rocks video did.  However, unlike Red Rocks which was dominated by U2's humanist, often angry perspective, Slane Castle captures U2's uplifting, contemporary blend of humanism, humor, & political activism.  Life is challenging these days, and this DVD provides a brief respite while subtly reminding the viewer of the scope of humanity.  Only U2 could do both!  My only criticism is that the DVD is only 2 hours long, not 2 days!
B00GYQYL7W|5|Loved this Movie!

0307276902|5|I simply cannot believe that Mr. Frey lied to the reading public. This book, which (3 months ago) I found candid, is now a craftly written novel that dispells readers into thinking it is some most holy memoir. James Frey was a spoiled brat who decided that he was going to ruin his body then make a profit to spite the buyers! I have found respect in the picks of the Oprah Book Club (not the reason I purchased the book) but she should withdraw her badge or at least announce the change to a novel pick. I rate this book five stars because James Frey is a con artist in the worst way and should be an outcast in the world of respectable literature let alone have all of his books remaindered off the shelves and sold at garage sales for the next fifty years. But yourself a drink on me, Mr. Frey, you stole my money
B000F4RHB6|4|I gave it four stars! Reason is that the music and lyics are unbelieveable. No matter how old this song(s) are, it still sound great. It brings back some good times. I would recommend this CD to anyone.

B0001KZM3O|1|Lets get something straight from the beginning:  this is NOT a Pink Floyd album. The last true Pink Floyd album was Animals because by the time of the Wall in 1979 Roger Waters had taken over the band, kicked out keyboardist Richard Wright and wrote almost all of the music.  On the Final Cut the \\"band\\" had futher devolved from being a group to being Water's solo project with guest players.  Dave Gilmour made some contributions but only sang on one song and fought with Waters constantly. Rick Wright was kicked out of the band during the Wall sessions and so doesn't appear and Nick Mason made only minor contributions to this sad dried blob of parrot droppings. Mason rightly decided that it wasn't worth it to continue in this charade of a band.<br /><br />Pink Floyds time had run out long ago but the corpse kept twitching long enough to create this their worst album. The Final Cut is an exemplar of everything bad about concept albums and Roger Waters' pretentions in particular. The music is horrible overly theatrical self-confessional and indulgent gloop that is both tremendously grating and cloying. For the most part it consists of overwrought piano ballads with sound effects that sound NOTHING like Pink Floyd.  Not surprisingly since most of the Floyd isn't on it.  In fact much of this record sounds like gloomy show tunes! The lyrics are maudlin and overly theatrical and have a similar facile theme to the Wall, ie war, what is it good for?  Absolutely nothing.  Unfortunately TFC, like the Wall before it, is ALL about the lyrics and the slight storyline. There's not an ounce of bloody good music here. Overwrought, depressing, sentimentality combined with boring music is a crime for which there is no forgiveness. Especially when it was released under the name of what was one of the best and most far sighted bands of the sixties and 70s. This is the bird poop on top of the tombstone that was the Wall and is the worst, most tedious, and pretentious Pink Floyd album. If you are a Pink Floyd fan whose first album was the Wall you may like this turd, otherwise avoid it as you would a rabid cat.a Pink Floyd fan whose first album was the Wall you may like this turd, otherwise avoid it as you would a rabid cat.
0062315005|5|This book is freakin fantastic. It pretty much sums up everything about life and/or the pursuit of it. I started and finished it yesterday. I have re-read certain passages already and decided I would re-read the whole book again. Worth every dime!
B000XUBFE2|5|We saw the movie during the Thanksgiving holidays, and I immediately ordered the book.  We could really relate to Liesel (the main character) as my mother-in-law, now deceased, grew up in a small village in eastern Germany and was the same age as Liesel during the war.  The story is definitely true to the times and very emotionally moving.  WWII set the stage and controlled the action, but every day on the home front has to be lived, too.
630516603X|5|To keep it short and simple this is an extremely entertaining video packed not only with group dance but with solo dance, beautiful song, and lively instrumental music.  The stunning performers in lighter sequences are as  graceful if not more than ballet dancers. Yet, the faster sequences are are  full of foot stomping, heart thumping, breath taking performances. One to  purchase and have on hand.
B008A1B5Z0|3|It works as described but my phone acts up once I use it. I end up needing to reboot my phone.

B000TZUSOY|5|A beautifully relaxing disc that I have avoided for too long.  Don't make my mistake  Pick this one up post haste.
B000VZYPB4|5|Very well written comedy.  Love the interaction between the characters and the situations they find themselves in.  I have been a fan since the beginning and still am.
B005GFPZYK|4|I decided many years ago that since I did not serve in the military I at the very least had a responsibility to educate myself about the real world of warfare into which my fellow Americans and I send servicemen and servicewomen to fight on our behalf every day.  As I read, I realized very quickly that Navy Seals and other elite forces do things that 99.99% of us can’t do.  They absorb serious injuries and continue fighting in the nonchalant way we finish out the day at the office after snagging our shirt or dropping a morsel of burrito on our slacks.  They postpone sleep indefinitely while executing life-and-death missions with unheard of precision.  They exact an unimaginable toll on the enemy and then disappear.  Were it not for men like Kyle and the thousands of other men and women in the armed forces making sacrifices every day, we would not enjoy the freedom and safety we have here at home.<br /><br />Chris Kyle’s story, told with the assistance of Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, reminded me of that famous quote attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt: “The Marines I have seen around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, the highest morale, and the lowest morals of any group of animals I have ever seen. Thank God for the United States Marine Corps!”  The Navy Seals drink a lot, get into bar fights, choke each other into unconsciousness and occasionally depart from military guidelines.  In spite of the rush to market indicated in the Prologue (or perhaps because of it), Chris Kyle’s voice shines through this book with a startling degree of colloquial candor and self-awareness.  He is a politically-incorrect, self-professed Texan redneck whose genuine, self-deprecating and insightful story should be read by Americans of all political persuasions, not just the ones who usually read “this type of book.”
B00280LYIM|5|great series
B00E5Q1HJS|5|A great addition to the Star Trek movie franchise.  Very well done - story, production, graphics, everything.

B00G5G7EXY|5|With 4 small children, I have seen the vast majority of popular kids movies over and over again. I actually don't mind that this movie gets played on repeat in our house. I love the music and it has women in power who aren't dependent on men. I am little embarrassed to say that I found myself guffawing at some of olaf's parts. I would definitely recommend this movie for parents (and the kids will like it too).
B00LO0K9SS|5|Once again, Threshold delivers a stellar album of quality material.  It's such a shame that the mainstream audience is missing out on such great music from overseas.  I often wonder what would happen if I asked WMMR in Philly to play a tune from this album.  I think I might get, &#34;Never heard of them&#34; and then get a dial tone.  Too bad for them on what they're missing out on.  From the opener 'Watchtower on the Moon' to the closer 'Siren Sky' this album just kills.  I firmly believe that Damian Wilson since his return on their last album 'March of Progress' has indeed gotten better vocally.  I thought 'March of Progress' was a standout album (and difficult to do with the passing of Mac) in its own right, but the band comes back in 2 years instead of five and delivers another standout album.  While this album is much shorter in length, only 49 minutes (without the bonus track) compared to 69 minutes (without the bonus track) of 'March of Progress' this is still an album to buy.  My favorite track so far would have to be the opener 'Watchtower on the Moon'.  While I still love what Mac did with Threshold and love his vocals more so than Damian's there is nothing here on this album for no one not to like if you're a fan of Threshold.  The European release includes the bonus track 'I Wish I Could', a cover from Johanne James band Kyrbgrinder.  As always, a killer album from the guys.
B000W93CHC|5|This is a book that I couldn't put down, so many people performing different pieces to make the story really great.

0307389839|5|I have never read Haruki Murakami's book. Somehow reading the summary, it seems they are not for me. I am going to read 1Q84 to see if my intuition is correct or I like him. I was drawn to this reading book and currently reading it, almost 75% completed. I should admit I like his style and is very impressive. His life experiences, running tips, and frank opinions are very refreshing. I am enjoying his memoir which is completely non fiction.
B0079R8KXG|4|I was one of the first people to order the Kindle Fire last year. At the same time I ordered a case for it also made by Marware, called the MacroShell Folio. See it at the link below:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HSG3TC/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00<br /><br />It was the lightest in weight at the time, and was offered in a charcoal gray color. The case looks great, and I've liked it, as it hasn't added to the weight and has kept my Fire protected. I don't have a scratch on it and don't have a film over the screen. This one is light too, just slightly heavier than the MacroShell Folio, but the material looks like vinyl, whereas the MacroShell-Folio has a nice sleek look, that never buckles. It looks great. They both hold the Fire in place with the brackets provided and both have a strap.<br /><br />The biggest advantage in this \\"Vibe\\" version over the MacroShell-Folio is the stand feature. This one stays in place so well. The original one I got, (the MS-Folio) stand is supported only by a groove in which the flap fits to support the stand. It often times slips out of that groove. This Vibe just folds into place and stays put. If you're reading in bed like I do, this is a good feature. You can set it on a pillow in front of you, and it's quite sturdy and handy. All you have to do is tap the right side to turn the page.  The M-Shell Folio needs a flat surface like a table to keep it from moving so it will stay in the groove that supports the stand. If I'm reading in bed I can't put it on my lap or pillow.  I have to hold it in my hand like a book.  If I nod off, which is pretty likely, I read so late at night, I could drop it.  This model is better for reading in bed, or anywhere you need for it to stay in the upright position.<br /><br />So, these are the positives for this one:<br /><br />1) The Stand<br />2) Color: this one is red and easy to spot in a bag or car.<br />3) The price is good on either one. As of this writing they are similarly priced.<br /><br />The negative is that it looks like vinyl, not like real leather. The red is a bit bright too, I would prefer a darker red. My thanks to Amazon's Vine Program for the opportunity to preview this case. I think I will end up using this one more. I haven't taken it off since I got it a few weeks ago.<br /><br />PS: I also love, love, my Fire. I use it more than my iPad.br /><br />The negative is that it looks like vinyl, not like real leather. The red is a bit bright too, I would prefer a darker red.

B00KWVZ750|5|you fight and save freinds so get it this is helpfull
B00COGZ8FU|3|As opposed to Tom Cruise drives race cars, Tom Cruise serves drinks, Tom Cruise flies fighter jets... etc.  etc.  Same character... and if you like that character, maybe this film is for you.  But it isn't a coincidence that the Academy hasn't given Tom a nod yet.  Even The Color of Money and Jerry MacGuire- the top of what Tom has to offer- didn't pull an earth shaker out of him... so adding a few guns and some whoopass sure ain't gonna do it.
B009IJJB8G|5|It is good to see shows made every so offten that makes you wonder what twist there gonna throw you and not foreshadow it from the get go, it has been good arks so far but I would like to see some more main story develepment.
B00EOGZ42U|5|I played this game on pc. I loved it. I jumped at the chance to get it as the faod, fist few lvls are a little slow with the tutorial but it is a fun game if you like strategy.  The later board get involved so not the greatest for killing time in a grocery line, but I love to play it.
B00LPP6TWW|2|Game play was choppy, this game is better for kids
B0041KKYEM|4|I really like all that was portrayed and how &#34;crazy&#34; Natalie Portman got in the character. I really like how dark and beautiful this movie it. I'd definitely purchase this movie again if I lost it!

B00L9B7IKE|4|This book started out slow and I almost stopped reading it. I'm so glad I didn't. About one third of the way into the book it became very suspenseful and exciting until the end.  I ended up loving the book and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it.

B008X9Z37A|5|Love this cover. No need to zip or unzip, just open. Fits perfectly. Perfect for the price. A great value.

B000PDYVVG|5|As I have been going thru some tough times, this book could not have come to me at a better time. I would recommend this book to anyone who may be feeling down in the dumps and don't know where to turn.  REALLY opened my mind and really put things into prospective for me!!! 5 STAR, MUST READ!!

0316776963|5|One day I happened to walk into an overcrowded bookstore where some unknown-to-me author was doing a signing.  &quot;What's all the fuss,&quot; I asked my daughter and with my interest aroused I listened to this quirky little man doing some readings.  Soon I was screaming with laughter along with the crowd and my now favorite author had been discovered.  His outlook on life and stories about friends and family (especially zany sister Amy - one of David Letterman's best continuously returning guests) just holds the readers' interest until forced to put down the book.  I was recently in an airport and noticed a lady reading &quot;Me Talk...&quot;, and everytime she laughed I did also trying to picture where she might be.  The only problem with David is: he hasn't written enough material.  I can't wait for the next release.
B00003CXSP|4|It has been obvious that the best sequels do not strive to copy the original to perfection but stand alone as seperate, original bodies of work. So, do not watch &quot;Hannibal&quot; expecting an exact equal to the classic &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs.&quot; Like the novel, the movie is another PART of the trilogy started by the novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and Michael Mann film &quot;Manhunter.&quot; &quot;Hannibal&quot; is more of an art film, a dark romance that depends on the atmosphere and dialogue. Director Ridley Scott presents a stylish piece of film that is beautifully photographed in rich textures (the photography is by John Mathieson, who was nominated for an Oscar for &quot;Gladiator&quot;) in shadows. There are sequences that look like gothic paintings. There is a dreamy quality here. Much is due to the great team working on this movie. There is Scott, who directed &quot;Gladiator,&quot; the editor is Pietro Scalia who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's &quot;JFK&quot; and was also nominated for &quot;Gladiator,&quot; and the hauntingly romantic music is by Hans Zimmer, composer of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; score as well. This movie is for people who like perverse horror mingled with artistic taste. &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; was more about the psychological, gritty aspects of the story, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is about the theatrics. Anthony Hopkins is great as in the first movie, he is charming and engaging. We don't miss Jodie Foster at all and Julianne Moore perfectly captures the character which is a tougher, rougher Clarice Starling made hard as a rock by 10 years of FBI work. The writers of the screenplay, David Mamet (The Edge) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), do a neat job of capturing the atmosphere of the book. &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a dark romance, a more perverse version of Beauty &amp; The Beast. I am disappointed that the ending of the book was left out, nope, Clarice and Hannibal do not run off together. I loved the novel'sending because the author, Thomas Harris, went for broke. What is true horror but the unexpected and unthinkable? I don't understand how Ridley Scott is willing to film the top of a man's head cut off, revealing a red brain underneath, bowels spewing onto the floor, but left out the original ending. I suspect it's because there is a sequel in order. Still, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a gothic, atmospheric movie. It is not the classic that &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot; is, but it is an original, artistic thriller. A certain, unique taste is needed to enjoy this one. You probably have to read the book to really get it, but it is fine filmmaking.
B004W1GCNC|5|Very entertaining!  Great story line set in pre-WW2 era.
B00EOARZ4G|5|I have read all the true Tom Clancy novels and this one is a good conclusion to the long 'Jack Ryan' series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This is one of the best books I've read in a while. True and believable characters. Great depth to the plot and true feelings show through the entire book. I couldn't put this one down. You won't be sorry if you get it...just be ready to read it straight through!
B0086700CM|5|This is a fun game that is very easy to play. The replay factor is good. Runs great on the Kindle Fire.
B003Y5H5HO|1|Well, I went and saw this at the movies with my daughter-in-law. Silly me. I was so mortified with the close up rape and sex scenes throughout this movie. I had no idea it would get this bad. We couldn't even make eye contact and at parts I didn't even look at the screen, lest somebody might think me a pervert for watching a young woman get raped . Had I been alone I would have left the theater!!!  I won't bother watching the rest of the series when it hits the big screen.<br />Sadly, the story gets kind of lost between the sheets. Normally I enjoy a good creepy thriller like 'Seven' with Brad Pitt or 'Texas Killing Fields' with Sam Worthington but this was too much for me. Should have been X rated!
B004SCN2F6|5|It's amazing how much time I've spent on this game - it's got great depth, and the difficulty levels are wonderfully well varied. I can't remember the name of the Palm game that it reminds me of, but I'm impressed that this game is even better.
B000002J2D|5|And then there were three continues to be my favorite Genesis album without Peter Gaberial. This is really were the band started to take off, and even though it contains the popular Follow You, Follow me, that might be the worst track on here. The rest of the album hits a nerve as it is very emotional. This is a slow album and lack a lot of the acid type rock found on the earlier Genesis albums, yet there is something about it, even if it a little slow, that just Rocks..Even if you arent a Genesis fan, you should have this in you collection just because it is a great effort..ENJOY
B007W8S2MG|5|I have been playing Persona game first when Persona 4 was released on ps2. I immediately got hook on it. Then I started completing all the series, Persona 3, FES and all. When I heard that this game was released on vita, originally I thought that this is only a remake of the ps2 version without anything special. Turn out I was wrong. When I first bought the vita, this was the first game that I bought and the game was really awesome. The improvement on the game system, the additional character, and everything. I definitely didn't regret my decision buying this game. Even if you had played it on the ps2 system...I really recommend you guys buy it and play it all over again. There is so much you can do in this game and It is very addicting.
B00026ZG10|5|The DVD arrived on the date that was promised. I recommend this to anyone who likes action-packed, adventure  movies, with a touch of comedy.
B00BUCW54Q|1|Produced by Cruise, staring Cruise, not surprised.  The disappointment is this movie is hardly true to Jack Reacher. Jack is six two and weighs 250 pounds. When he intimidates he does so by his physicality. Tom Cruise is 5-7 and a lightweight. Jack might well survive a fight with five ruffians who attack him. Tom Cruise would not except in this movie each bad guy waits his turn to go a mano with Tom while Tom telegraphs each blow so badly that the bad guys should have been able to get out of the way. Much of the rest of the movie is just &#34;drive by&#34; as Tom's performance, other than grimacing, doesn't match up to the artistry he has shown before. There is a truism in Hollywood that vehicles produced by and starring a name actor usually fall short. The exception that proves the rule is Clint Eastwood. There are many Hollywood actors who could have done justice to the role of Jack Reacher and looked the part. Tom Cruise is not one of them.
B005LAII80|5|I was expecting this movie to be a little flaky but it wasnt.  It was really good.  I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.  The mama character is played by lena headey, she also played sarah conner in terminator sarah conner chronicles.  She did great in this movie.  Karl Urban is the guy that played bones in star trek 2009.  Did a great job too.  Highlly recommend this one.
B008Y2FRFO|2|Maybe these games are useful to some and I will keep looking until I find a series of games that are fun, challenging and rewarding. I am new to this format so experimenting finding something I like, really like,.
B000BHHVPO|5|I wasn't sure what to expect,with so many artists in one set.The result is one fine artistic achievement covering just about every style of music you could wish to hear, from reggae,to latin beats, hip hop,rock,punk,funk,folk, pop, you name it.Too many highlights to mention,also that will depend on individual musical tastes.However I'll mention a few of the best and the worst......U2 kicks things off into full gear with a great 3 song set.Coldplay slows things down a bit but picks it back up inviting british singer and former Verve vocalist and great songwriter Richard Ashcroft with a soaring version of \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\".Elton John starts off strong but unfortunately makes the mistake of choosing Pete Doherty as a singing partner,Doherty clearly proves that he can neither carry a note or remember the words to the song he is singing, forcing Elton to signal  to his guitarist to end the song prematuraly.The best performance of this set is probably Madonna who knows how to work a crowd and keep the momentum going.Robbie Williams comes pretty close to Madonna in working the crowd,he obviously loves to perform and seems to feel perfectly at home onstage.Linkin Park,Snoop Dog do great versions of their songs on this set,some of the biggest disapointments surprisingly are from some of the biggest names listed, Paul McCartney's set while not bad ,is predictable,Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and David Gilmour seem to loathe each other.The Who sound awesome except for one thing,it's not The Who.It is however a great piece of musical history in one package,I do recomend it to every music lover...enjoy!
074325144X|5|I bought this book for myself.. so impressed with a renewed sense of enjoyment from running that I bought one for my mom, dad, and two of my running friends. Great book, quick read. Would recommend reading the book then getting the DVD. I had both my knees hurting and the back of my right leg... got desperate and bought this book on advice from a friend. I'd already run 5 half marathons within the last year, and one full one - legs started taking a beating. Within two weeks of practicing this approach, all my injuries are gone! This is an honest review, I know it sounds like it was written by the author! For 10 bucks, WELL worth it.
B00IIB1912|5|Best Show on Television!!
B005XBA9Y8|5|Many good surprises, with great sound, especially the most serious works. The light music is ok.
6300218031|5|As a person addicted to '80s movies, this is a classic---love, geeks, preps, etc.  The &quot;practice&quot; kissing scene between Keith (Eric Stolz) and Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) is worth buying the movie alone.   Whose heart doesn't skip a few beats when you watch that kind of kiss!    It's a perfect movie for all us John Hughes' fans.
B00AECGQF2|5|Hair salon 2 is fun to play and its very funny especially when the people in the game make their own little noises. People may think this game is stupid,well that's their opinion. I think this game is fun when you are bored. It doesn't glitch or anything like that. My little brother likes to watch me play a lot. Well it's worth the 2.99!
B009MCRHH6|4|Good game.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Easy read, plot lines predictable. Enjoy a relaxing book with characters that are familiar, fun and lovable.  Ending needed to wrap up the other players in the book
B00005BCOM|4|Michael Chricton's science fiction film, about the debut of a futuristic theme park with &quot;Terminator&quot;-like consequences, was an obvious source of inspiration for such films as James Cameron's The Terminator, Jurassic Park, and others. You will see the similarities!<br />Contemporary viewers will have to consciencely suspend disbelief as the film was made many, many years ago and features dated special effects techniques. However, the idea, the story and the way they are executed by director Chricton create a marvelous classic of science fiction cinema. A MUST view for any sci-fi fan!
B00E8KLWB4|4|I enjoyed playing this game it's a great time filler
B00JB3MVCW|3|A &#34;bit&#34; different from the original but still a good action movie.
B0006VBFM0|5|I love the throwback look and feel of this watch.  I used to wear them in high school and it is great to have a retro look now.  If they have any drawback I would say it is the loud ticking.  I don't mind but other people have commented on how loud it ticks while I am wearing it.
B004FRX0MY|5|Love it
B00R2LTNL2|4|Awesome!
B000ICXQGK|3|I never got to watch this.  I was saving it for Labor Day Weekend but when I went to watch it, it had been removed from my \\"library\\"  I think it is supposed to be good but I don't know.
B005ZOBNOI|3|This book came highly recommended, and I did enjoy the book despite the 3 star rating.  It was a quick, easy read, but I expected more given the rave reviews and popularity.  Though enjoyable, it lacked a theme that will resonate with me for some time.
031606792X|5|Many people gave this a bad review, but if you like resolutions, this book will provide just that. The tenor of the story is very different from the first three books but what did you expect to happen? Life had to move beyond Forks and its' version of normalacy sometime. I feel satisfied with the book even though it was different. I always wanted a perfect ending regardless of how realistic it was. I've got reality all around me; that's why I read fiction.
B000F9RB8A|4|I really didn't know what to expect out of this movie when my buddy got it from netflix two years ago and brought it over.  I've never been much of a fan of martial arts films, but this one definitely had me rolling.  This film is riddled with slapstick humor that will either have tears of joy or or regret rolling down your cheeks.  My wife did not enjoy this movie, but it definitely has a spot reserved on my DVD shelf.  If you think you'd enjoy a cross between \\"The Simpsons\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\", will more than likely get a kick out of this movie.
B0032CVAQQ|5|I think people have a unrealistic view of how difficult TRUE relationships are. I would advise dating couples, and couples considering marriage to read this book early, to avoid trouble later. If your ready to die for the one you love, this book will strengthen your dedication.
B00000ADG2|5|Excellent condition.
B001HC8516|5|This book definitely helped me realize when a guy is just not that into me. I will no longer make excuses, or force myself into thinking theres hope when there clearly isn't.  There were so many times when I was reading this book, where I thought that part must have been written just for me. It helped me understand that some guys are just jerks, and I shouldn't waste my time trying to figure them out.  I am so glad I read this book!!!
B007BZM30M|5|This is the hit Call me Maybe song by Carly Rae Jepsen. If you like the song- you already know the song- hence why you are on the purchase page... The sound quality of this file is top notch, very clear and has a good opening and closing timing. A good buy.
B00AEFYWJG|5|Edward Morton's very first movie. It blew me away. And that's VERY difficult.
B00FHB2XB6|5|nice
B00PJ5AUCO|4|Good game
B00OXE341G|5|She knows how to write songs that are just good to listen to. My wife and daughter love it.
B00ET7EON4|5|Arctic Monkeys manage to outdo themselves yet again with AM.  As hard-working a band as you'll find, they manage to mature and adjust their sound (thanks to some unpredictable, diverse influences) and with each album but produce top quality.  A great mixture of tempo, style with consistency of Turner's unparalleled song-writing with ever-maturing presence, Helders' highly-praised drumming, Cook's skillful guitar riffs, and O'Malley's superb and highly underrated bass.  Arabella, Knee Socks, and Do I Wanna Know? stand out the most for me.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Very good. One of the best in the Star Trek adventures.
B007PT3QOQ|3|Free but when you are hooked you have to pay in order to keep playing.
B000002UJQ|5|This is the best CD that has been released to date. It truly exemplifies the cliche &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&quot;, and is hailed worldwide as a masterpiece, and the best ever. It has everything.
B000GTLQXU|2|Ugghhh.... 40 minutes into this remake disaster, we hit the EJECT button.<br /><br />Yes... with modern effects the waves were bigger, the flames bigger the explosions were bigger.....<br /><br />So what was missing ?<br /><br />SOUL and a concern about the characters.<br /><br />The remake was all \\"flash\\" and \\"effects\\" with no \\"life\\" to the characters.<br /><br />Unlike the original with Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, etc...<br /><br />In this remake you simply don't care if the main characters live or die..... nor do you get lost in the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Came very quickly and as described. Streamed perfect from laptop and have not complaints. Good price and good value for this item.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is fun to play but its kinda hard. It's way better than flappy bird. We can enjoy this game way better.
B00PSID6ZK|1|It was a bit too much of the time<br />I'm not going to say anything about it
B00KMX5V8G|3|It's a fun game, but don't like all the popups and purchases necessary to fully enjoy the game.
B004GJDQT8|1|Since when does a shopping app need to TEXT people off of my phone? I think I'll keep the older version of the Amazon app.
B00DXP7L88|4|My wife and I became addicted to Dexter from the beginning and though we are sad to see the show end,we thought the final season was a realistic conclusion.
6305558167|5|I have always been a fan of the movie and bought simply to revisit the little kid in me. Thanks.
B00HV2KPNW|5|The music is great.  The story is great and includes plot twists.  Sometimes serious sometimes fun, this is a very enjoyable movie.  Clearly one of Disney's finest.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Great book.  Very fast read.  The plot is engaging and the science is at just the right level to be interesting without being too technical nor too dumbed down.
0385504209|5|Ok- first off... I really did enjoy this book. However, now that I have read 3 of Brown's novels, I have noticed a certain formula that Dan Brown uses.<br />1- Use the word &quot;Indredulous&quot; as often as possible.<br />2- The bad guy MUST be known by a term/phrase instead of a name.<br />3- The bad guy is double crossing the good guys... and you are NOT supposed to suspect this.<br />4- The novel must take place in the course of one day.<br />5- Your hero must wake-up and not have a clue that he will spend his entire day many miles away from home, while being chased by bad guys.<br />6- All good guys must be experts at something very arcane.<br />7- The ending must be weak.<br />If you follow these steps you too can write a Dan Brown novel. ORRRR you can use this formula to figure out the book you are currently reading after about 100 pages.<br />This is clearly a case of diminishing returns. One book is Awesome, two is fun, but by the third... you are ready to turn on the television.<br />My suggestion- read the Da Vinci Code (However, remember it is still &quot;fiction&quot; and despite the authors claims- some of his facts are seriously flawed- for instance - &quot;The Gosphel of Mary&quot; is hardly widely accepted as legitimate).<br />&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is extremely face paced, and quite thought provoking. It challenged me to do a little research into the foundation of my beliefs (However, it did not change my beliefs... I found that my views on religon are on much sounder ground that the author's supposed &quot;research&quot;). Enjoy...
B0017KIBAI|4|It's a controller.  Works exactly what it is needed for.
193700788X|1|Like other reviewers have stated or insinuated, it is clear that CH was tired of Sookie.  This book had the feel of being written by a person who just wanted it over and done with.<br /><br />Perhaps, as others have stated, TrueBlood really WAS a bad thing to happen to Sookie.  Especially when the shows began to deviate widely from the books.  By now, the only connections the books have to the show are the names of the characters.<br /><br />In this book, it seems that CH halfheartedly tries to bring things to a close, and yet left so many loose ends unresolved or resolved in an offhand manner that does nothing to satisfy the reader.<br /><br />Yeah, a lot of major characters show up so we can have a final glimpse. But I would rather have had a good story. Something to show me that CH still cared, even if she was finished with the series.
B000FCKC4C|5|A few rare texts linger with you and change the way you see the world. This optimistic story is worth the relatively small investment in time to reap the benefits. Recommend
075640407X|2|arrived with a broken binding, shipped fairly quickly
076115678X|4|Recently trying to embrace my natural curls and this book has all the info a curly girl needs. Easy reading and great advice.
B0031KC8OC|5|Bell is funny, cute, and very witty in this show. It's very well written. It's 90210 meets Nancy Drew. Great show!
1439190275|5|This isn't the same Atkins I was on back in the 70s.  I'm really glad that there are now mandatory vegetables included.  This diet is very close to a diet from my chiropractor that costs $1500 to join and about $90/week for their powdered protein.
B00MORI8C4|5|One of my favorite albums.  Great jazz, great rap, and a constant theme keep this LP together.
B007TBZ63Y|5|I loved this book so much, I read it in about a day. I'm 13 years old and quite picky about my books, but this one exceeded my expectations. I'm going to purchase the rest of the series! I'll have to read slower, though, so that these books will last longer for me. I never got bored, and never felt like there was just too much fighting/romance at a time.
B0091REZMW|4|this game is so much cu I love mystory games like this. I wish I had found this game sooner. cant stop playing it.
B004LWZW7O|3|Sometime in this dystopian future we are genetically engineered to stop aging at 25, and then we get just one more year to live.  There's a giant countdown clock on our arm telling us exactly how many years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds we have left.  We can work to earn more time.  We can give time with others.  We can STEAL time from others.  We can horde time on aluminum blocks that are like bank accounts.  Time is currency, but when you go bankrupt, you're DEAD.  Some are fabulously \\"rich\\" with more time than they can ever use while most suffer in \\"poverty\\" with only a day's worth of time to their name.<br /><br />What could possibly go wrong with a great premise like that???<br /><br />Here's what: after an intriguing opening and a great first act, this movie disintegrates into mindless car chases, fights, and cliches, and utterly fails to live up to its great potential.  A real shame.<br /><br />Maybe they'll release a \\"directors cut\\" that removes a half hour of unnecessary plot diversions and hones this to the great work it could have been.
B004H4XDBI|2|The writing wasn't all that great and the story just seemed to be something a fanfiction writer would come up with. I was very disappointed.
B0082FPIY8|5|Absolutely brilliant. Wish I was there now.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Great superhero movie!  This is one to own for all Marvel fans, old and new.  Brings back childhood comic book memories.
1400069289|5|Just finished reading this book. Amazing is an understatement. What made this book very difficult to put down were the style, content, and message it carries - how anyone can transform themselves using the cues provided in the book.<br /><br />Started reading the story of Lisa and skimmed through the other chapters before coming back to the beginning and read it cover to cover. While each part stands very well on its own, it helps to read it in sequence, because the ideas build upon each other. The breakpoints in each chapter provide the right pause to reflect on what you have just read and come back to it a little later when that part of the chapter / story resumes. Very similar to sub-plots in movies. The extensive notes are like the special features in a DVD - they give you a behind the scenes look into the research and homework that went into writing this book.<br /><br />The Lisa Allen story, which the book starts with is very enlightening because of the nature of her transformation and how one can change oneself if there is a true desire, will power, and the right circumstances all working together.<br /><br />While there are many examples like the Febreze story where a product launch does not generate the initial buzz enough to make it successful, and gets transformed when the logistics and the content of the marketing message modified, the household applicability of this product is what makes the story relevant. Who would have thought that a product such as Febreze would take off only after the `message' and the positioning of the product should be used would make it so successful.<br /><br />Analytics, one of my very favorite topics, is why I liked the Target chapter a lot. To think that there is so much customer information out there waiting to be mined, analyzed, and patterns derived from, is beyond mind boggling - it is downright frightening . One has to just imagine the possibilities - almost nothing in the realm of possibilities can be too far fetched - when it comes to how this data can be used to help customers in every stage of their, their loved ones, friends, and acquaintances' lives. At the same time, the privacy concerns are very real, and with the exponential rise of the social media organizations, those concerns take on a very different perspective. Two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />Other stories that resonated with me were on Alcoa and Starbucks. Alcoa because of the `household' (in stock market parlance) name it has become when it is earnings announcements season, and Starbucks for their omnipotent presence. To think that training has the potential to mould employees responses in such a programmed fashion is truly remarkable - and to be able to handle any amount of traffic. Provides an insight into how to handle any volume of traffic.<br /><br />The appendix is what the makes the book one of its kind because it lays out the step-by-step process of how to use the teachings in the book to make a difference in your own life. As with some of the other books that I have reviewed, it was this chapter that makes the book very valuable for me, and for anyone else who is motivated enough to consider reinventing themselves into the vision they desire for themselves.- when it comes to how this data can be used to help customers in every stage of their, their loved ones, friends, and acquaintances' lives.

B00DUGCLY4|3|This is a fun game to enjoy with your family on rainy days or road trips.  Some of the puzzles are easy enough for little ones to solve as well. Enjoy!
B00B7Y0206|5|Excellent for all family
B004W2UBYW|5|Good
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|Saul the deceiver. How one man took a great philosophy, and turned it into a train wreck, that humanity is still struggling to overcome. A must read by all who have been deceived.
B0068853O6|4|Enjoyed the life like war scenes and the action that followed. The story plot was easy to understand. Generation Kill is not for younger viewers as most content is adult theme.
B000WQW988|5|We need this in bluray... but DVD is good.
1416511946|5|Forbthose who love music I would recommend this book to. But not young ones because there is a lot of sexual things in it. But deffinatley a great book great classic
6305827079|5|This has to be the greatest video I have ever seen and I have loads of them!  What I especially like was the fact that more time was given to performances and actual &quot;Elvis&quot; time, and less to interviewing screaming fans who just say &quot;I love him, I love him&quot; that is in so many of the other tapes.  I loved him, too, but would much rather the time be spent on him than talking to fans if I'm going to watch a video about Elvis.  To me, though this was much more personal insight into what went on at rehearsals and before and after performances.  I felt like I was at a concert, which unfortunately I never got to see live. Thanks so much for making this video available; it was on a cable channel, but not on our cable carrier.  I was so devastated because I wasn't going to get to view it; then a friend found it here on Amazon.com and I snapped it up immediately.  I'm really glad I did - I love it!
B00F0N61AU|5|Stepdaughter love album and was anxiously waiting for the CD to come out in order to buy it and she loves it.
B004Y1WCDE|5|App works great with my amazon fire TV, love the interface & speed. My only request would be for them to add support for the voice button on the remote, so that when you are in the Plex app and want to search for something you don't have to do the manual type in search.
B00000J2KT|4|Yes I said I was mad because it wasn't in letterbox folks.  My error!  The truth was brought to my attention, and I apologize.  The film was not made  to be presented in letterbox format, thus there was no way to release a  letterbox dvd.  <br />So here is my final review.  This movie had great  visuals and impact.  I find this movie to be entertaining each time I watch  it, except for the mass grave speech.  (What is with that guys meaningless  speech and annoying voice?)  I have yet to see a scene that hits as hard as  the bootcamp finale.<br />If you miss the 1980's when Vietnam movies were the  top draws you can relive them with this one.  I know you may be wondering;  is this movie as good as &quot;Platoon&quot;?  The answer is no.  But  either was &quot;Forest Gump&quot;, and people loved it!
B00LXLM05I|5|A great game for the price recommended for everybody fantasy role-playing game like Diablo
B004LOMB2Q|5|I use very few apps but am hooked on evermore.  just beginning to unlock its productivity potential for myself, but found enough value to justify having my staff use it as well.  facilitates work-life balance while sharing what I want with who I want to be productive...leaving narcissism to fb.
1616550414|5|Great Quality! All Zelda fans must have this
0380713802|1|Not much joy here as Bryson, an American Anglophile infected with Europhobia, whines and whinges his way across Europe.  Bryson takes us to Stockholm where he complains about the quality of the Italian cuisine. We stop in major European cities where Bryson refreshes himself with a carbonated, caramelized caffeine drink or with typical American standby hambuger and fries as if Europe's kitchens could offer no better. We share the fights and slights of times past when Bryson flashes back to another Eurovoyage with an equally disagreeable companion. Curiously or perhaps understandably Bryson meets no one who doesn't bore him or anyone he doesn't crown &quot;the most boring...&quot;. Other critics' views are altogether too generous but read it if you must.
B005PK553C|5|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Not overly dramatic, and scenes seem so real. Scares me just enough where I can still sleep and not be terrified. Great story line, I am definitely a fan of this show.
B0089LOG02|5|This was one of my favorite books.  Never heard of the actual orphan train so was very interested.
B000050FEN|5|And I say the best because this movie is so much more than just your typical horror film.  This film has a bite that most don't, it has a sense of reality, a gritty sense of human emotion that gets left out of most horror films.  This movie takes the time to explain it's charactors, everyone from Somerset (Freeman) to Mills (Brad Pitt in his BEST role ever) and even your killer John Doe (Kevin Spacey, Brilliant as he always is).  I thought that was the best part of this movie, that it took the time to explain your killer, took the time to get you inside his head and see why he was the way that he was and to see the reactions that he had to others and the reactions that they had to him (especially Pitt...the scene of dialog alone between Pitt and Spacey in the police car towards the end is the best scene in the film)...So our story revolves around a group of murders in NYC all based on various 'deadly-sins'...opening scene is an obese man who was forced to eat until his stomach burst.  So you see that our killer forces his victims to kill themselves via their sin.  (The most disturbing is lust, believe me!)  So even though the film never shows a murder take place you see the aftermath of each and each one in particular is disturbing in itself.  The while air to this film is creepy, eeire and puts you in a mood before the suspence starts.  You must know that this is not the 'jump out of your seat and pee your pants' type of film, its more like the type you think about later with the lights on and your covers pulled up to your head.  It's a pschological thriller that messes with your head, makes you think about why this man did what he did and may even make you wonder if he had a point.  There is a strong moral backdrop to this movie, which is also something that is lacking in almost every other horror film.  The killer had a reason, maybe not an excuse buthe had a reason that he was able to justify in his mind for doing what he did...a reason that he calculated out, that he meditated on and most importantly, it was a reason he BELIEVED in...it was a code that he lived by and he was convinced was right even though he knew it was wrong.  Kevin Spacey is so convincing in his portrayal of a disturbed man, a man plauged by a hightened sense of morality that forced him to be morally coruptable.  This is a movie I think everyone should see, if not for sheer entertainment, see it for the message it conveys, a message that can be contorted and twisted to fit anyones interpretation, I guess the only way to really appreciate this film is to watch it and interprete it for yourself.
B00HHC33YY|5|just Dolly for sure!
B00NPDVTOK|5|Both the instant download and CD that came by mail work great! I got exactly what I wanted. The instant downloaded music works seamlessly with the Amazon music app too.
B004XDYJRU|2|I've found that when this app is installed I lose the ability to automatically connect to my Bluetooth devices. Very annoying.
B004SKHJF2|1|The app constantly requires reinstall. regular shazam works perfectly. even reinstalling does not resolve the issue. no problem with any other Apps from Amazon market.
B00G3L6KQI|5|Deborah Harkness is a master of the trilogy.  She was able to weave a tale worthy of the readers time.  Her characters easily come to life in the readers imagination and settle there for the duration.  Thank You Deborah Harkness for a complete story!
B00B5HQLMI|5|I loved it the theater and loved it sitting in my living room. I honestly wasn't real interested in watching it again but it was there and available but the instant the 'Bond&#34; theme song started I was transfixed for the next 2 hours.<br />For the Bond purist you need to realize they are re-doing the franchise, new 'M', new Moneypenny, new 'Q' and a new look wrapped around Daniel Craig. I loved Dame Judi Dench as 'M' but the reality is that she is 80 yro and it is time for the series to find the actors that will move the bond movies forward for the next 5 or 10 years. I think they sent her off grandly, brought in a new 'M' and Moneypenny with acceptable story lines of how they got their positions. The new 'Q' was nicely done with a few digs at some of the 'toys' used in past movies. If you've seen every of Bond movie and not seen this one it is a must. If you saw and liked it the first time then it'll be enjoyable to watch again. If you can't see anyone as 'Bond&#34; accept Sir Connery then you might want to pass.
B00Y6QF0PE|1|Very little difference from first book, I felt I was reading the first book all over again, not much thought went into it, made him look even more immature.
B004EBT5CU|5|Excellent!
B00127RAJY|5|I really like this DVD.  I don't have a six pack yet, but my arms are definitely stronger. Three kids, including a set of very large twins, have really done a number on my stomach.  Jillian is really motivating.  They are hard workouts, but her words stay with you  so you want to do them again. I still run, and use the elliptical, but using weights are new to me.  I would really recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to step their workout up a notch.
B006LA6IW2|5|WOW! Chris Kyle is the epitome of GUNG HO.  Thank God for him and others like him.  There were huge amounts of combat and this is a glimpse into the mind of a SEAL at the tip of the spear.  One man can make a difference and Chris Kyle made an impact on me, thousands of American Marines and Soldiers and Sailors and a huge impact on hundreds of dead terrorists. It's exciting, funny, sad, and enlightening.  It left me wanting more.  My only disappointment is with Amazon or Kindle.  I bought the (Enhanced Edition).<br />There were still photos that displayed on my Kindle.  There were videos that would not play on &#34;my equipment&#34;.  They would not play on my PC with a Kindle reader either.  That is why I bought the Enhanced Edition.  What does it take to see the video?<br />Jim Cauthen

B000005AYM|5|This is a classic R&B / Neo-Soul CD.  A must have for any serious music collector. This is a replacement since my daughter wore out the first one.
B00CWV8TIU|4|An odd film that skims the surface of medicine and the problems of drugs. Take one drug for one problem and it leads to another problem.  On and on it goes.  With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, the acting and the twist ending was just a cherry on top of my movie experience.  The pace of the film was slow at times but it did seem to need that part to help explain different things.  I would recommend this movie to a friend.
B0036S4B6M|1|Oh Piper... your &#34;Year in a Women's Prison&#34; reads like a fairy tale.<br />The beautiful princess - complete with luxurious blonde hair, tiny yoga-toned body, and adoring prince - finds herself in prison, ratted out by an evil lesbian.  How cruel!  The princess was simply looking for an adventure...  privileged life is so unfair.<br />Naturally, all the other prisoners loved and respected the princess, she had more books than she knew what to do with, and her prince never missed a visit.  The End.<br />It's bad enough that this book was dull but when you toss in the author's always-present snobbery and self-pity, it becomes insufferable.
1416914285|5|From the moment I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. It came everywhere with me - from work, to shopping, even to a Yankee game (for the hour before the game)!   <br /> <br />I gave it five stars for not only the story that has been told so far, but the potential that has been set up for the next two books.  I am not an avid reader of Young Adult books, but I have been known to dabble here and there.  I thought it was incredibly genius of Clare to address a topic, homosexuality, that other authors, to my knowledge, have stayed away from.  As a lesbian, I would have greatly enjoyed seeing sexual orientation described in such a fashion while I was growing up, devouring every book I could get my hands on.  She did an amazing job of portraying the subject in a true-to-life manner and I applaud her for that. <br /> <br />Also, anyone who is familiar with New York City will absolutely fall in love with the descriptions and settings that Clare uses.  It makes you feel like you are standing right there with the characters throughout the entire story!  <br /> <br />There were many other aspects of the book, however, that made me give it five stars.  The slow blossoming of all the characters into the adults they would someday become was very entertaining to read.  I loved how Jace opened himself up and Clary started seeing herself as a girl that wanted more than just a friendship from a boy.  Simon, I'm sure, would have preferred that boy to be him, but I don't write Simon off just yet.   <br /> <br />I thought that the dialogue and behaviour of Isabelle, Jace, and Alec were spot on considering the fact that they were adolescents who had been trained their entire lives to fight demons.  They are not your typical adolescent, in that regard, and it is best to keep that in mind.  Isabelle seems to be a girl who likes to work and play equally as hard and I love her as a character.  Alec is quietly in love with his best friend, who is clueless, and if I could, I would just keep him as a pet because he is just too cute and brilliant as a character.  His infamous confrontation with Clary is so emotionally packed that it made me shiver!  Though, I would probably trade Alec to Magnus Bane for an invite to one of his parties, or maybe a dozen!  I'm sure Bane would be more than pleased with the transaction! <br /> <br />As much as I enjoyed the \\"kids\\", I also look forward to finding out more about Jocelyn and Luke and Valentine and Hodge.  Their stories can only get more interesting and I can't wait for the next book to arrive!  This entire WORLD that she has created is sure to please anyone who likes good dialogue, good plot, and fantastic characters!
B003EVWDR0|3|The technology used to make this film is amazing! However the storyline was just average and the movie was way way too long.

B00000J7JO|5|When i put this cd in and heard around the world, i thought i had bought the wrong cd. it sounds like limp bizkit or something. it has a rappy tune. i then discovered that almost all the songs had this. it's definitely their best one yet though. still the good songs (otherside, californication, scar tissue) DEFINITELY A WINNER! IF YOU LIKE CREED, RHCP, FOO FIGHTERS, AND FASTBALL, U SHOULD GET THIS! DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!
B008Y1YK9Y|5|Wow, what a surprises--a sequel that is actually as good (even better in some ways) than the original! I love this whole series of movies (I'm ready for a few more), but the first one was vastly superior (probably because of surprise value) to the second. This third edition, however, is really well done and full of surprises. I don't know how this did in the box office but it's a really fun film to watch on a big TV.<br /><br />Bugs rule the Universe! Who knew?
B000NQRE9Q|5|I have not watched the new movie yet. I have been waching the original three.<br />I'm hoping Harrison has not lost his touch and movie number four is a hit.

B0043KK4N6|5|I went to see this movie because of Cher. I also thought that all the music was great. The ballad Cher sings is exceptional. I also loved the movie, and own it. I am glad I own the soundtrack, and thrilled to get it on Amazon.....I had never paid much attention to the  lead singer and star in this movie, until she sang in this film. Now I know why she is also a star.....for me it will always be about Cher, but it is a wonderful sound track. See the movie if you haven't....two strong voices, and personalities...with talent to match.

B00CRWJ7VC|5|If you liked Inception and Matrix, you'll LOVE this! Almost 3 hours, but worth it. Very deep movie you'll probably have to watch a few times.
0385504209|4|This is a wonderful plot, and a step up from Dan Brown's previous works.  Although he keeps the same storyline -- Robert Langdon gets a call in the middle night, is drawn in to solve a grizzly murder with the help of a beautiful and smart woman -- this plot is rich in its historical facts and details, alluding to theology, art history, and symbology.<br />The only drawback (pardon me for being so critical) is that Brown's writing style reminds me of books recommended for 9th grade readers. It is a simple style he uses, and his characters necessarily take on a 2-dimensional nature.<br />The richness of the plot carries the day, however, and the simple and \\"young\\" writing tyle proves little more than a distraction.

B00125WAWS|5|The Great Debaters is based on a true story about an underdog debate team that wins a national championship.  The team is from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, a black institution in the Jim Crow South of the 1930s. The school's English professor is Melvin Tolson (Denzel Washington), who is also a secret organizer for a national sharecropper's union.  Tolson was one of America's leading poets as well, although the movie barely touches on that.  The movie is more about how the debate team, its coach, its school and community believe that an education is their best way out of the morass of racism and discrimination. They are black, proud, single-minded, and focused.  One of the features on the dvd is allowing us to meet some of the actual debaters who were on this team.
B007M45PMU|5|I discovered this band after being invited to catch a G-Love show at the Fox Theater in Boulder, Co. The Lumineers opened for them and I instantly fell in love with them which is a first for me. Back then, it was still pretty easy to get tickets. Now, only a year later, it is nearly impossible! Good Luck Lumineers! Don't forget to come home once and a while!

B0015DYIH2|5|I love this book so much. I gave it five stars cause it includes romance, science,drama,etc. I would recommend this book to be read by a number of people between the ages of  12 years of age and up. I know that you will love to read it. The movie is even better than the book and part 2 is awesome I would recommend that you read the books first and then watch the movies they are way better they have more facts and action.I love breaking dawn I really love all four books and movies but I love breaking dawn part 2 better than all the other movies and books

0439023513|1|I want to say first the I loved the first two books in this trilogy.  The first 2 books had an edge but always had a positive underlying tone.   You always feel hopeful that Katniss will win out over the Capitol in the end. In this final book, everything and everyone is destroyed by either the actions of Snow and the Capitol or by the Rebel's president Coin.  It was utterly depressing, many of the main characters die, and even the ending does not end on a positive note.  Peeta and Katniss end up as broken individuals at the end.  The first two books had suspense, but Katniss always ended up outsmarting the Capitol and President Snow and was essentially the victor.  In this book, everyone loses, and there is no real winner.  I am sorry, but I felt depressed, defeated, and terrible after I finished this book.  I am very disappointed, because really, if everything Katniss goes through (plus all the deaths of main characters)and the book does not end up on a positive note, you just feel like \\"what was the point\\"!    Also, at the end you really don't like any of the characters including Katniss.  It is very heavy handed on the horrors of war (OK we get it already, WAR is terrible!), and Katniss really seems pathetic and a pawn in this book.  Even the niceness of Peeta has somewhat been destroyed.  The reason the first two books worked is because although there are terrible evil people, the goodness in others shows us that goodness usually wins out over evil.  In this book, evin wins hands down, and destroys everything that is good and nice.  What kind of message is that????  Also, the plot is put together sloppily, and the ending feels rushed and unrealistic.  I hated this book.
B004EPYZOO|3|The movie itself is very good, but way to much filthy langauge.

To make this a perfect calculator for me, I would like it to have a key click feature that could be turned on and off and the ability to use parentheses.

006091307X|3|Bears some resemblance to its contemporaneous works, such as the early Monty Python (absurdism) and &#34;The Magus,&#34; in that our main character, the symbolically named Oedipa Maas, wife of the DJ Mucho Mass. (just shaking my head) realized way too late, but possibly not too late for her redemption, that she has been an actor in a psycho-drama at least partly arranged by someone else, in this case by someone now dead, seeking a measure of something unrequited, perhaps, revenge, or not. So the book implicitly asks us to question whether this a definition of reality (?).<br /><br />This may well have been written prior to &#34;V.,&#34; with which it bears similarities, and then updated and published as the newly renowned author hauled out his trunk full of unpublished writing-class hand-ins. &#34;49&#34; DOES seem more in the time frame of 1966 than prior to 1963, V.'s publication date.(speaking as one who came of age in those years.)<br /><br />I might easily have given this four stars, had it not been for the sophomoric journeyings, interesting only to someone else as stoned or flipping out, about possible Elizabethan/Jacobean dramatic plot absurdities. And the alternative Post Office, (?), again, making mice out of mole hills. The work of a giddily brilliant student, not a serious novelist. The following of this Post Office thread is unenlightening and boring, and way over done.<br /><br />I enjoyed much of this book. Very personally. it reminded me of sensations experienced when I first went to California (perhaps as Pynchon had done)  and of 1966, because it captures that moment when youthful energy and rock music was king; when Steve Miller, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane were just hitting it really big, and everybody wanted to start their own band (and did!) -- the nascent rock band, into drugs, sex and rock 'n roll represented by &#34;The Paranoids.&#34;<br /><br />Pynchon captures that time in western civilization (America, England and France in particular) when the world in general almost seemed optimistic, sane, and benignly crazy enough that it was sufficient just to worry about what was going on immediately around you, which if you were perceptive, might seem like a kaleidoscope of fractal shatterings as people in Berkeley or LA bounced off of you, and then back into their own reflections in the mirror of space time. In this sense, Pynchon does capture that mystical-LSD-realization, coupled with ample doses of paranoia, that we are all one, or that there certainly are a lot of fateful coincidences going on, and maybe there is someone behind some of the coincidences. In this sense, the book dwells on elements of comedy/satire, mysticism, and mystery, and touches on horror.<br /><br />Pynchon is a good writer. There are several great, longish Whitmanesque passages, that are both poetic and philosophical. So, why only three stars?  I enjoyed it, but it was just okay, and however brilliant some of the work, editing is/was clearly needed (badly). Even the celebrated  &#34;V.,&#34; unfortunately (see my review) is made up of about nine of these vignettes or novellas (though they are written better), as if Pynchon is writing in bursts, at least at this point. I have not read his other works, though I may reread &#34;V.&#34;<br /><br />Weren't it for the richness of literary reference, word games, and ability to capture the essence of 1966 California, I would give it only TWO stars.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: I read the first paperback (1966) edition with the truly psychedelic Peter-Max-like picture on the cover, with yellowed pages and a bit of black mildew, that I got at the local library rummage sale, where it came from an estate sale, complete with 20¢ written on the first page in pencil (like a postal rate fee!), from a used book sale years ago somewhere else, since I got it for $1 in a bag with about ten other books!)emed optimistic, sane, and benignly crazy enough that it was sufficient just to worry about what was going on immediately around you, which if you were perceptive, might seem like a kaleidoscope of fractal shatterings as people in Berkeley or LA bounced off of you, and then back into their own reflections in the mirror of space time.

But now since I have to impatiently wait til next Fall for season 5 I thought well why not buy the first 3 seasons and check those out while I wait. I honestly didn't think that the first 3 seasons would be as good as the 4th but I WAS VERY WRONG! These first 3 seasons where just as, if not even more, amazing! I especially loved seeing Season 1 and watching how this world unfolded from the begining. You can't help but fall in love with Rick and his amazing Character, you feel like you are really there with him. I Love this show!
B0052UYJDC|5|I'm not what you call a true minimalist and I take a lot of the minimalist ideals with a grain of salt. However, I loved this book and it has helped me think through my possessions and what I find value in and why. This book was truly inspirational (even if I don't follow the advise exactly) and I highly recommend it.
B0007TKNL0|5|The camera role was especially excellent.  One would think the viewer was  in the Theater.  I saw the movie some  years ago, but this version was even more realistic
B00005JL78|4|Argubly one of the best sci-fi stories made to film since Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Minority Report features the main theme to be questioned - Is it possible that we can stop a crime from being committed before hand? The Pre-Cogs are the driving force behind the concept backed up by solid technology of the mid 21st century. But there's a catch...is there a chance of catching the wrong person and letting the real guilty party walk away free? The idea of a pre-crime division has become a subject of fascination and debate among top scientists in the world as well as those in the government law-enforcement agencies today. <br /> <br />This is Cruise and Spielberg's first collaboration ever - but their relationship evolved way back in 1987. Originally slated to work together in Rain Man, Spielberg had to leave following work on the third Indiana Jones movie. While the novella presents the overall outline and concept of the story, filmmakers expanded the scope by putting in noir, mystery elements with a personal character driven-element of our protagonist (we see it in the middle of the movie) together with the futuristic impression of what's it like in 2054. And the story has evolved a lot more better than its novella due to pre-production delays. <br /> <br />Production values were high here from its designs to visuals as well as to its convincing acting and sounds/music. Most of the crew whom worked with Spielberg were veterans in the business having collaborated with him personally in more than 10 of his films. As an anecdote for the visuals, even though grainy and blue in hues and partly hand-held, they are part of artistic reasons - showing the kind of guerilla-filmmaking in the future and intending to make audiences feel the coldness, immediate  <br />danger and the feeling of participation. Towards the end of the opening segment, audiences were given an emotional scare - a 30-second countdown (if you time properly) for Anderton to reach the room. What about the eye-candy shots (Part of what Spielberg films have) of components lowering down in the car factory? Those shots let you feel of being in a roller coaster thing. Those two above demonstrates the great editing that makes the movie less than boring. <br /> <br />Eagle-eye fans of Kubrick's films would be happy to see several moments that serves as homages to Kubrick. Also, the car-factory segment is actually Ernest Lehman's abandoned concept for supposed to be scene in North By Northwest. <br /> <br />Despite big production value, the weakest link of the movie is indeed some of the elements in the movie itself. The ending was quite a difficult thing to work out after well built and thought-out first two acts of the movie. Filmmakers were trying to come out with a satisfying end but still lacks the expected standard. As we go into the second act, there's a loophole maybe more than one. For instance after Anderton is declared a fugitive most systems in the Pre-Crime HQ should no longer accept his entry but the logic was not appropriate. The worst of all is that by the second-act it is detracting from a supposed to be noir story as Lara was brought in into the fray. The old man Burgess was the most wasted character of all - he should be given more depth. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it's a great sci-fi story taken from Phillip Dick's vision of the future to the current reality. It's worth the watch, even though it's a lengthy 150 minute feature.  <br /> <br />Just watch it and be immersed with the future.  <br /> <br />[Reviewed by my friend Melvin, from Malaysia]
B00EGMQIJ0|1|I could not agree more with Luke Miner's comments (\\"Know your material\\"). The editor should have caught the repeated mistakes of word choice. \\"Dissemble\\" is not a synonym for \\"disassemble\\" or \\"dismantle.\\" Using the word \\"ebullient\\" to describe someone's mood sounds absurd in someone's internal speech, unless that someone is named Safire or Buckley. Using \\"ebullient\\" once is forgivable, but doing it three times suggests it was learned while cramming for SATs and has been seeking an outlet ever since.  \\"Diffident\\" does not mean \\"difficult\\" or \\"disputatious.\\"  Nothing in this dull book required such precise words. Using such words when the writer clearly had something else in mind distracts the reader with thoughts about the writer's grasp of English. With the exception of plot (a rather slender one), all the elements of fiction are absent from this hopelessly overrated drivel. Characters are crudely drawn stick figures. The themes (e.g., tyranny of the majority) are interesting and timely, but they were trivialized by Eggers' ham handed, artless execution. The dialog is hopeless. The book is carried along exclusively by a single layer of plot, which unfortunately has all the appeal and nuance of a corporate PowerPoint. Some furtive, gratuitous sex is thrown in, but it is not erotic, interesting, or plausibly needed to support the plot or a theme. This kind of book makes one question the network of interests that promotes the publication and favorable reviews of books by popular writers. If you already bought the book, it may help pass the time on an airplane. But be sure to recycle it before you leave the airport. Abandonment on a convenient chair will work. If you haven't bought it, consider spending your scarce reading time on something worthwhile. \\"Command and Control\\" is a great choice. Unlike \\"The Circle,\\" it's well-written, well-researched, interesting, timely, and true.
B00K2CHVSK|5|Enjoyable!
B00ID4I6LA|3|It's a decent sci-fi film with fairly solid performances and amazing visual effects, but it never really took the time to delve into the many moral issues that the story raises with any depth. However, it was worth the $0.99 I paid to rent it. Don't go in expecting something incredible, and you should be able to enjoy yourself for a couple of hours.
0143039601|1|The operative word from the title is \\"bums\\".  This is a book about them and their self indulgent, self righteous idleness.  A work with no redeeming features.
0375703764|5|I love this book.  It's just a whole lot of fun to read, and it really is scary (I found myself checking my house to make sure we hadn't grown any extra rooms).<br /><br />Johnny Truant is a memorable character, and his straight-face hallucinations (paraphrasing: \\"I ran at my boss and killed him and cut up his body.  'So, Johnny, how are you?' he said as I turned.\\" Where of course he hasn't really killed him) are really skillful and inspiring.  The sex scenes are sometimes graphic but well done.  Although Johnny's run-on rants can be a little hard to keep track of, they are rewarding and a rich read.<br /><br />The main story, the one Zampano ostensibly wrote, is amazing as well, with a genius plot and characters you care about.  It's really well done, and the footnotes add a lot to it.<br /><br />And about the footnotes and appendices... they're really cool, and add a really adventuresome element to the book.<br /><br />What's more, whenever the word \\"house\\" is printed it's in the color blue (at least in my copy; apparently in some it's the word \\"minotaur\\" that's printed in red).  How could anyone resist a book like that??  It's as good as the hype claims.  Read... and risk being sucked into a crazycool world for as long as a few weeks.  (It's definitely not a quick read, although easy to put down and pick up again without losing the flow of narrative.)<br /><br />Overall, a great book that I recommend.

1451696191|4|Bought the book with the idea of using it for my kids. I had not seen the movie, but prefered to read the book first. After I finished it, I decided the language and content was a little too much for my tweens. I did understand the authors thoughts of bringing out the fact of being different from the others. But I would hope adults would read it first.
B003U4ZQRK|5|This was my favorite show at the time and I still enjoy it and have the same emotional ties to the characters. The picture was exquisite & the 5.1 was awesome!  Much better then watching on Netflix.
B005POK858|4|For a mobile platform RPG, it is really done well. The skill system is unique, at least from what I can tell, and the story is interesting. The only &#34;problem&#34; I have is the characters have kind of dumb names, but that is a very minor complaint.

B00005OWEG|5|Director:  Francis Ford Coppola <br />Cast:  Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Harrison Ford, Dennis Hopper. <br />Running Time:  202 minutes <br />Rated R for Rated R for disturbing violent images, language, nudity, sexual content and some drug use. <br /> <br />We hear \\"Apocalypse Now\\" before we see it. The low 'whup-whup-whup' of a helicopter's propellers is audible over a black screen, which slowly reveals a lush, exotic forest. The camera holds a long shot on this peaceful scene before the forest explodes into a fiery inferno as the napalm attack is launched. On the soundtrack, Jim Morrison tells us that \\"This is the end\\" and we are sucked instantly into the mad, horrible, wonderful world of \\"Apocalypse Now\\".  The 1979 film is Francis Ford Coppola's loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness', scripted by John Milius, and updated to take place in the Vietnam War. The story concerns an American soldier named Willard (Martin Sheen) who is living a drunken, tortured existence in a Saigon hotel room while waiting for his next mission. Soon he is called into action (\\"I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one\\") and given the task of assassinating a decorated Colonel who has gone AWOL. Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is in fact living as a kind of god to a local tribe on a compound deep in the Jungle. Willard must travel upriver and \\"terminate - with extreme prejudice\\". <br /> <br />Well that's one story anyway. The other, more incredible tale surrounding \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is how this film got made. There's the story of a six-week shoot that lasted for sixteen months. How Harvey Keitel was cast in the role of Willard and replaced after two weeks by Martin Sheen, who promptly had a breakdown (captured on film for the opening sequence) and suffered a near-fatal heart attack. Then there's the typhoon that struck the Philippines and destroyed most of the film's sets, putting Coppola (\\"The Godfather\\" trilogy) even further behind schedule. Coppola ended up plowing most of his personal fortune into the film, risking bankruptcy, his marriage and his reputation on a project which was out of control. As he said himself: \\"We made the film like America fought in Vietnam - We had too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane\\". It's astonishing that Coppola could salvage anything remotely coherent from the chaotic circumstances in which \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was made. In fact he produced a masterpiece; an intoxicating, utterly singular audio-visual experience which blows away the timid ambitions of most American war films. Aided by the great editor and sound designer Walter Murch, and the glorious cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, Coppola made \\"Apocalypse Now\\" less of a typical war movie and more of a hallucinogenic trip down the river of a young man's mind and soul.  That young man is Martin Sheen, who plays the introspective Willard to perfection, but his performance is unquestionably eclipsed by some of those around him. In a few short scenes Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore seems to sum up everything \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is about; the madness, power and machismo. To see Kilgore standing tall, admiring the waves, while all those around him duck to avoid the flying bullets and explosions, is to witness one of modern cinema's most memorable characterizations. Kilgore is blessed with some of the film's most memorable lines - \\"Charlie don't surf\\", \\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\\" - and is at the center of 'Apocalypse Now''s greatest sequence. The helicopter attack, accompanied by Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries', is one of the most incredible pieces of filmmaking in history. Spectacular, horrific and undeniably thrilling, the attack is masterfully orchestrated by Coppola and is even more satisfying in these days of CGI and digital fakery. It's a high point from which the film, for a while, fails to recover. <br /> <br/>The rest of the film has an increasingly looming shadow cast over it. Willard and his crew slowly make their way up the river to confront Kurtz, and the anticipation of Brando's appearance grows. Brando turned up late, overweight and had read neither the script nor the source material. To hide his bulk, Coppola shot him in semi-darkness, with the light glinting off his enormous shaved head. It turns Kurtz into mythical figure, and Brando's portrayal suits the character of Kurtz, a man drunk on power, broken by warfare.  In 2001 Coppola produced a director's cut entitled 'Apocalypse Now Redux', adding 49 minutes of deleted footage to his original masterwork. Some of this footage was welcome (More Duvall, more Brando, the Playboy bunnies), while the long, politically motivated French plantation sequence adds little to the film and detracts from the film's narrative. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" was a film made by people out of their minds, with the odds stacked against them, and the film reflected that background - it's what made it so special. \\"Redux\\"' is an attempt to make sense of an insane film by people who have had time to reflect, to mature, and their attempts only manage to dilute some of the original's edge.  Nevertheless, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a film that everyone should see in some form, a true masterpiece which reveals new layers and aspects with each repeat viewing. Will we ever see the like of it again? I doubt it. The film is the ultimate apotheosis of 70's filmmaking - a drug-fuelled, self-indulgent, daring piece of work which is so filled with ambition it almost collapses under its own weight. There is no denying the film's raw power and many of the trademark set pieces will never be forgotten or equaled. It's an awesome paradox of a movie; crazy, insightful, overblown and intimate all at once. In it's own unique and magnificent way, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" reflects the madness, intensity and \\"the horror, the horror\\" of warfare.  <br />
B00FAX6XQC|1|I was a fan, I really liked this game. The British Columbia map doesn't work, the graphics all screw up and the tablet freezes and the game glitches. I have tried multiple things to fix this and I can't, please fix this game.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Grisham is so easy to read. If you are looking for an easy, take me on trip, book - read Grisham. His story line, as always, is fresh and surprising. I can't read too many in row but when I do pick one up I know what to expect and that it will be good. He is a great writer. Why not a 5. I safe my 5s for the true masterpieces.
B005DJREGQ|4|Super cute and witty. Loved it!
B00992CF6W|5|This game was worth every penny.  I love this game. It tests your thinking and what to build. Plus if you use the pocketinveditor you can switch it from survival to creative.
B00881VLCE|4|I have quality moments w/ my grandaughter using this app. Just don't like the solisitation, but understand it is a necessary evil.
B008XNZMOU|5|I recommend this to taylor swift  fan and other people who like country and love song it was a good cd  I like it a lot and has a lot of good song
B000FBJFSC|4|Would recommend to read...sad to think people lived like that in Ireland....doesn't match the beauty of the country that it is today
B001PPLIEG|5|love this movie! like all the previous movies! and to say the least, this one is right up there with adventure and intensity. action every where!
0316010669|4|Starts off great but Gladwell tends to hammer home his point in the last four chapters and they're long and somewhat tedious but still interesting.
B00UXFJAJY|2|i should  never listen to reviews.i love the killers..and  his voice but this is not that  exciting yet  listened once.. i give one more try ..fast service  though
B0009KA7BS|5|Great movie, no scratches! I found the discs to be in excellent shape and feel completely satisfied with my DVD purchase.
B001GKJ2E8|1|Script looks contrived, uninteresting. James McAvoy used to have a peculiar nice voice. That is missing in this movie; may be he tried American accent and its bad. He looks like a fool. Angelina just cashed on her looks. \\"Look at me, I am beautiful\\" attitude. She did not act at all. I bet each actor/actress in this movie have acted in a better movie other than this.
B0006J28MI|5|Awesome movie and with Amazon Prime, makes it even better! Highly recommend!
B001TW68P4|5|Don't understand how I made it this far in my life without a good TURTLES greatest hits. This is the best one. Fun music.
B008FRFN7A|5|It does everything I wanted it to do plus extras.  Everything works great.  I recommend this to any one that prints on the go,and uses it at home . Great product.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Very well-written and not easy to figure out, for a whodunit. The characters come alive and the reader feels as if they are part of the story, too. Would make a great movie, starring Reese Witherspoon as Rachel. Other chores got put aside so that I could finish this book. If you are a fan of murder mysteries, this is the book to be reading!
0399241515|5|I've read every Alex Rider Book except this. I can't wait to read this. Eagle Strike was great. My favorite of the 4. The ending in Eagle Strike seems a little stupid. Considering him just leaving Sabina. Just letting her dissapear from his lif. Kinda Stupid. But this one I hear is gonna be great. I never thought there would be a twist like his dad being a contract killer. Great series. Buy em all.

B00L23RZO8|4|Dry humor. A little high-brow.
B002VPE1B6|5|A GREAT MOVIE,MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES.  Just a SUPER GOOD MOVIE with FAMILY!!
0064407667|1|I just read this in anticipation of it being an interesting series for my kids.  However, in this book, the children are abused, mistreated & at every turn there is no hope for them.  The lesson of this book seems to be that you cannot trust adults because they are so stupid and mean.  This book is not for adults or children.
B0009UC810|5|awsome thnx
B0007OY2P8|5|It is my contention that the spirit of this movie is more true to Austen's own than any of the other Austen productions. I can hear the gasps as I write. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that virtually all other productions are far more true to literal interpretations of their books. The text is usually more exact, the adherence to plot (even when forced to abridge) is better, but still other productions come off as stilted. Why is that? <br /> <br />The actors chosen for Northanger Abby are physically much more of a match. Austen did not describe these characters as beautiful, except for Isabella, and the other actors (however attractive in real life) are not photographed as beauties. They look like Austen's real people, not idealized characters from random romances. <br /> <br />In addition, the actors are truly splendid in their amazingly nuanced characters. While the various Darcys and other Austen heroes on film are usually handsome but somewhat constipated looking (running the emotional gamut from A to B), this Tilson manages to show a range of complex emotions just as described in the book. I could go on with praising the voices/vocal characteristics of the various actors, but I think you should just give it a try.  <br /> <br />Open your mind, remember the book, and you will love this movie.
0553108034|5|If I hear &quot;Jordanitus&quot; one more time I am going to puke!  People, quit condeming others for Jordan's sins as a bad writer.  If the writing continues as it is - I would love nothing more than this series to  go on and on.  Every chapter is filled with intrigue that progresses the  story as well as defines characters - Martin is a master of storytelling,  plot development, story movement, and character greyness.  Whereas Martin  delivers a lavish meal that you feel guilty for having so much goodness,  Jordan offers crumbs until you become so warped that crumbs begin to look  like feasts and you thank Jordan for them.  Do not compare these  authors...Martin spoils the reader while Jordan spoils the series - that is  the only comparison.  <br />So what if Martin describes in detail the food  they are eating - that is the talent of a true author - to set you into the  story and make you feel apart of it...food is very important to a reader,  and your comment on Martin liking food himself is also shameful.  <br />This  is the best Fantasy Series I have ever read - sitting next to The Lord of  the Rings, and just above Leiber's Fafhrd and Mouser series...this series  will change your life.

B00026WU9Q|5|Released in 1965, Bringing it All Back Home is a pivotal moment in the history of rock `n' roll, a sparkling jewel in the Bob Dylan catalogue, and one of the greatest albums ever recorded. The record combined the earthy poetics of folk music with the freeform, electrified joys of rock, birthing a whole new sound in the process. The music is by turns gritty, dreamy, propulsive and beautiful, an intoxicating swirl of acoustic and electric, of driving rhythms and rolling melodies. The lyrics are pure poetry, a series of mind-bending verses and stark dreamscapes, a vast mixture of poignancy, humor, anger, and longing. Classic Dylan, if I do say so myself.    In its original (vinyl) incarnation, the record was split right down the middle: Side 1 of the original LP was devoted to amped up, blues-soaked folk-rock, while side 2 featured nothing but acoustic ruminations. Both sides were totally awesome. The electric half featured classics such as \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" a hard-drivin' blast of electrified blues-rock boogie, with s rhythm that is pure Chuck Berry. The lyrics are a head-spinning surrealist ramble with some deliciously subtle social commentary and warped character sketches. \\"Maggie's Farm\\" is a broken-down protest number with a mutilated honky-tonk vibe. \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"One the Road Again\\" are gin-soaked ramblers with some fantastically bizarre lyrics, and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" is a just-plain hilarious slab of distorted Americana. \\"She Belongs To Me\\" and \\"\\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" are gentler numbers, with lilting melodies and nuanced vocals.    The acoustic side is, somehow, even better. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" is one of Dylan's most stunningly beautiful songs- it's a dreamy, ethereal reverie with lyrics that ring with love, longing, and nostalgia. It communicates an uncanny amount of emotion, mapping the contours of pain and joy with an unbelievable finesse. And then there's \\"Gates of Eden,\\" a haunting labyrinth of sound and poetry. The lyrics feature some of Dylan's most striking imagery. \\"It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding\\" is a post-modern protest song, an apocalyptic epic that sees Dylan firing shots at the hollow, materialistic pitfalls of modern life, while his guitar radiates pure tension. Closing out the album is \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,\\" a rolling ballad that manages to be both mournful and scathing. Nice. So yeah, it's a masterpiece. Get it.
B00CATSONE|4|This work confused me at first, not having read any other reviews, the information about the mind and potential had me wondering what I was reading when I thought it was just going to be about Tesla.<br />It poses many interesting questions and continues to reveal the cut throat side of business, in this case mainly in the turn of last century US. Tesla was certainly an intriguing fellow who would probably have helped the world even more had people had more faith in is style of genius. The \\"booklet\\" was interesting and challenging in areas of further thought.
B005IQZB14|5|i love this book. i can really relate. also hiked a lot of the pct myself.
B004ZG5F0K|5|I saw this movie in the theaters and absolutely loved it and wanted one of my own and got it!!!!
B000N4SHPS|5|great item, fast service.
B00EOGZ42U|4|This is a pretty well selling pc game as well. It's fluid and simplistic. Innovative in that nothing plays like it. Give her a try!
B000YHG72E|5|Love this movie. Watched it every year. It's  a  wonderful  addition to  my  Christmas  collection. Everyone young and old will love this one.
B000BTC5LW|5|Not to sound melodramatic here, but quite possibly the best concert ever recorded in the history of music. Before I saw this, Pink Floyd to me was an entity, not a group of individuals. It was mesmerizing to see this concert.  It was interesting to watch the crowd--not moving a muscle.  Every note is perfection, and I will continue to get chills each and every time I watch it. Buy it, watch it, love it.
B006LSZECO|3|I hated the ending.
B006VFLIYK|1|I didn't care for this book at all.  I had it figured out by 2nd chapter.  Rather highly rated for a not so good plot.
B006OCM0G0|5|this is a wonderful game its great for passing time if you are bored all the time.  I love this game
B008SAZHLQ|5|A wonderfully written story that will take you back to your first love.  Heart wrenching and passionate, I couldn't put it down.
B000AMPZF8|5|This is by far Muse's best. If you are a true Muser, or even just getting into Muse, you cannot go wrong with this album. Unlike their newer stuff, (with the exception of Drones) this is Muse at their core. It's a spacey, hard rock type sound. And then there's Matt Bellamy's fantastic vocals! His range is that of a true rocker, with belts and falsettos that make you feel totally alive. Combine that with his amazing guitar skills, Chris Wolstenholme's thundering and majestic bass lines, and Dom Howard's sick drum beats, and you have a sound that will knock you out cold. I would totally recommend purchasing this album. It is well worth it.
0671042858|1|I was absolutely SHOCKED at what a let-down this book was. As other reviewers mentioned, I kept waiting for the book to start, only to realize that the entire story is literally just a girl surviving in the forest. This lesser version of \\"Into the Wild\\" (by Krakauer) seemed only to detail a 9 year old girl (too clever for a girl her age) and her efforts to survive in the wild. It is almost as if King described to his journal how he would get on in the woods of New England, and then later - in order to publish this as a \\"horror/suspense\\" novel - replaced himself with little Trisha and threw in some hallucination of a monster that served as a wholly unsuccessful attempt to build suspense as the little girl navigated her way out of the woods. While King's words paint a convincing picture that will help you understand what it is to be lost in the woods, this book will make you feel as though you are lost in a narrative that ultimately goes nowhere.
1594489505|5|What a remarkable book!  From the first page to the last was just full of emotion.  This story opens up a whole new world of people and culture.  A must read for sure!
B005PK56TA|5|My favorite season out of them all!
B00000AFWZ|5|....all these glowing reviews and not one mention of the best song on all 4 discs. I'm speaking about the NAZZ and \\"Open My Eyes\\".<BR>Lenny Kaye nailed this one in the original vinyl liner notes:<BR>they sound too English to be included with Count Five, Ted Nugent<BR>and The Barbarians but never fear, the Nazz (featuring future Wizard & True Star, Todd Rundgren) were firmly rooted<BR>from Philadelphia, PA -- the true birthplace of rock & roll.<br />Oh and to that kid who claims that Punk started with Green Day etc.,<BR>Please.<BR>Come back when you grow up.
B008QYT7DI|4|Interesting.  Many read it as kids, but not me.  Never had a class that required it.  Glad I got to it
B000000W71|5|I just cannot believe someone can play guitar so well.  I am a guitar player myself but could never image blues could be played with so much soul and feelings.  This will be a great album for audience who loves blues and guitars.  This will definitely be you best buy.
B00KF7OOIW|5|First off as a native of Louisiana I was glad to see a series that didn't go overboard on the Cajun accents like a lot of shows do. The rest of the shoes was pretty good too. It was a pretty good occult mystery and I can't wait till season two.
B006C45MRE|2|How on earth did this \\"movie\\" get made? There goes 2 hours of my life I cannot get back. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. But I guess todays' movie audiences are looking for action, not substance!
B0000787FH|2|Costello fans will likely brand me a heretic, but 'Bedroom' seems to me to be one of his more overrated recordings. 'Beyond Belief' and 'Man Out of Time' certainly rate consideration in a 'Best of' compilation. 'Long Honeymoon', 'Human Hands' and 'Every Home' are somewhat interesting. However, beyond that I find little that's especially compelling here.     There are treats on the bonus disc that I enjoy more than much of the original 'Bedroom' recordings, thanks in part to Steve Nieve's scorching work on the ivories. In fact, the alternative version of 'The Town Where Time Stood Still' and the toe-tap inducing \\"From Head to Toe\\" merit inclusion on my desert-island list of Elvis favorites.
B005Z271Y6|5|Adele's personality is as amazing as her performance. I enjoyed listening to the stories behind each song. This sounds corny, but after watching this I felt as though I'd actually been there.
B007EC27QM|4|Hi.  I found this calculator the best on Amazon app store. But I could not give you 5 stars as it's missing calculator widget.
B00004RGUU|5|What can be wrong with Paul Neumann and Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance!?  They're great and the movie is wonderful.  If you like westerns, enjoy this two actors (especially when much younger) - get this movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5|We both, love  the game, we spend a lot of time playing  it is very addictive once u get started
B00692ASTQ|4|The box is little dented. But considering it has probably been stored for two years or so, I'll take it since I really love it.
B003JTHXOK|5|Sparks maintains his usual flair in yet another book.  Interesting plot and characters, with a bit of a twist!  Recommend!
B008JFUQZ2|5|Those who enjoy monster movies (Godzilla et al.) or giant robot films get the best of both in this outstanding film by director Guillermo del Toro. That the monsters are the second attempt by aliens from another dimension to take over our world adds another layer of interest to this sci-fi film. The imagery is enhanced by Toro's use of colors as themes. The attention to detail in the robots and their construction sites is amazing. The monsters are created with vivid imagination; they are no longer a man in a rubber suit. Special effects are spectacular, yet believable. The second disc of special features is as fascinating as the film itself: here, Toro describes the collaborative efforts of artists, musicians, technicians, et al in producing a film worthy of his genius. I've watched both discs several times and learn more each time.
B00G0OHMUG|5|I've loved this movie ever since it released and in 3D, it's super. Well worth the price, which was nominal, compared to other vendors
B002UD56I6|5|I've always been a Michael Jackson fan but never realized what a great mind for rhythm and choreography he had. This video shows a many-faceted man who will be sorely missed...
B005MLOKXA|5|I think this is the best season of the good wife! I've watched all the episodes many times. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. The writing and acting is marvelous.
B00AREIAI8|3|I think it's a good game but theirs to many ads. I like the game but every 15 seconds  tons of ads pop up.

B00005UKE0|5|All Things Must Pass [DIGI-PAK EDITION was Harrison's first solo album after the Beatles broke up 1970 and it is a dandy of a record. One wonders why so little of Harrison's tallent was used during his days with the Beatles. Harrison was a surprisingly adept lyricist and a much better vocalist then I was aware of. Yes, the book-let is a strange one. Harrison in purple boots, big brown hat surrounded by gnomes. Harrison has also written a very well-written and thought worthy essay regarding the recording.  I love the photographs and one can see that he was a very pensive and cerebral man. This is a recording not to be missed.
B00BN3EE1O|5|A much better film than expected. The acting and the location shots  were wonderful.

B00007KQA3|5|Indeeed, the movie is best viewed if you prior read the book . I remember I was every excited when it showed up because I was just finished reading the book and the concepts of \\"thought police\\", Big Brother, totaliatarian state, etc  were developing in my mind.. I read in the paper that Orwell's window was very much into the production seeing that the true spirit of the book was held at all times... and the movie does that at perfection level.<br /><br />In 1948 Orwell wrote the book to exptrapolate a world where fascism, comunism and other totalitarian forces gradually swept the world to create this dystopia... your thoughts are your own worst enemies.. they must be controlled by the message of the big-brothers and their sect of leaders in a hierarchical scale where beong a common citizen is the worst you can be .. uhmm any similarities with present state is purely coincidential<br /><br />That 90% of the world's population has lived in a state no different than the medival ages, that concepts such as freedom, civility are completly alien, that the few nations that upheld such values are becoming totalitarian, this alone will tell you that we humans are build to live in a primitive state, that scientific progress has nothing to do with enlightment of the soul... that this progress can be ruthfully exploited to make harder conditions on this primitive state...those are the thoughts that this marvel of cinema show us, it is a perfect parallel to what is happening today, of our legacy to our grandchildren.<br /><br />recursiveness, this is a theme xplored by Orwell that just barely now I have been able to see. The meticulous investigation into the control, manipulation and influence of human behaviour is a formidable task, yet, it is  here that no resources are wasted to carry out this at unimaginable levels, this experiment works, the brutal repression is over the point of corporal punishment for those who deviate, it has evolved into a \\"humanitarian\\" method of assimilation.. at the end, we can be like Winston at the end of the movie, frighten, concerned at what is being shown in the tv, wondering if as a society we are able to come through, and then the barman, comes up to us and offers us a shot of gin, it will be alright brother-<br /><br />I can understand why this movie is not available now; again call me a \\"conspiracy paranoid\\", but now is not the best time to question status-quo, now that hey are so focused on finding the enemy of terrorism within and abroad... I thought I never see the day that the USA would give up their freedom over to a group of neo-fascist, christian puritans to convert it gradually in a totalitarian state.. they go out agaist the taliban just as we are converting to a new talibanism... no civil rights if any suspision arises, I wait 4 hours in line trying to get in the US to spend my vacations there, to be considered; just by  being a foreigner, as a terrorist threat.. while at the same time in my country the whole systems marches to a Castro like state..  Is there a place in the world for free thought now?? Is anyone out there??? helloooo... sure hope Australia is still a land of free thought.... terrorist indeed won over, they have taken away by our consent our right to freedom<br /><br />I am amazed at the price and the fact that is not available here in Amazon, or is this part of the conspiracy as well!!<br /><br />Strange enough we see Hurt as the leader of a totalitarian England in V for Vendetta (which you can see my \\"polemical review\\" as well)can be like Winston at the end of the movie, frighten, concerned at what is being shown in the tv, wondering if as a society we are able to come through, and then the barman, comes up to us and offers us a shot of gin, it will be alright brother-     I can understand why this movie is not available now; again call me a \\"conspiracy paranoid\\", but now is not the best time to question status-quo, now that hey are so focused on finding the enemy of terrorism within and abroad...

B00003CXAA|5|There have been reviewers writing full analytical essays about this DVD set...  Let me break it down.<br />Part I - excellent (Marlon Brando in the funeral home, best scene in the movie, he is truly a legend)<br />Part II - even better (Fredo and Micheal in cuba, talk about drama)<br />Part III - good, but does not live up to the first two, but still nominated for Best Picture, so it can't be as bad as people claim.<br />Its the Godfather, enough said... GO GET IT!
B00GEEB730|5|The book was hard in the beginning because of Ove's death attempts.  Once I realized how much he was grieving, I better understood what he was going through.  It was a great book that teaches how to live and die.
B000FA5STS|5|Incredible end.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|It allows u to see his side and how much he fights his battles with his past and how he truly feels I love it !
B003GK2216|5|I like Ken Follett's style of writing. many of his books entwines reality with fiction and one an learn many before unknown historical facts. I also like the way he inter links different characters with one another.
B001GUXJQA|2|Did not like this compared to other books by Michael Connelly. Very predictable. Harry needs to stop smoking. Much prefer jack reacher to Harry Bosch.
B00G4A6VZS|4|Great
B000JMKTLO|3|I liked Gillian Flynn's other books but this one less.<br /><br />My first complaint is that the plot twists and shocks in this story are tropes that I'm just tired of seeing, but that may just be my taste.<br /><br />More importantly, there are mentions throughout the book of ((((trigger warning)))) eyelashes being pulled out, sharp things being jammed under fingernails, teeth being pulled out, and other mental images that really bother me and leave me cringing for the rest of the day. I'm used to reading descriptions of graphic violence in books like this, but the bodily harm here is of a different character. Maybe I'm just squeamish, but I would recommend skipping this one if getting that &#34;nails on a chalkboard&#34; mental image in your head constantly doesn't appeal to you.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5|Great documentary what else can i say
B0024F13NC|5|\\"Dr Feelgood\\" and \\"Shout at the Devil\\" are the top two Motley Crue albums. (Depending on my mood, which is first and which is second.)'Nuff said.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Works great, easy setup etc. I watch streamed shows from NBC, etc. via Chrome browser to TV and it works great. Would like more apps that support it (Amazon, etc). Watching Netflix / Web Videos on 60&#34; plasma come out perfect. Can't beat the price for what it does.
B004LROUNG|5|Excellent book. I could not put it down. Classic John Grisham and one I would recommend to everyone who likes him.
B009NQKPUW|5|The first Blu-Ray we watched in 3D on our new HDTV.  Amazing!  My son promises me that he will go into all the special features to tell me the &#34;answers&#34; to the &#34;questions.&#34;
B004J4WKTW|5|I could not put the book down!! Beautifully written!! A new kind of love story, romance novel! I loved it!
B008602KQI|4|Book is very readable, keeps your attention throughout. Enjoyable - a feel good story. Slightly juvenile in plot and delivery - but still worth the read to anyone, any age, any background.
B00HGJ18C2|4|lot of fun
B000053VAZ|4|I love this movie.  Heck, I own it on DVD.  The best thing about it is Johnny Depp, hands down.  He is not only incredibly good looking (as usual) in it, but he is incredibly cute and funny as well!  This movie just lifts your spirits.  The only thing I didn't like as much was Aidan Quinn's character because I found him annoying and asympathetic, but overall this is a great movie.
0345543246|3|It just didn't hold my interest as did Time To Kill, which I have re-read several times.
B0055S348W|2|This program comes close to adding some useful functionality, but then fails.  You cant print to a standard tcp/ip port or smb share.  No enterprise IT group in their right mind is going to allow installation of a crappy 3rd party application on their print servers.  So, ultimately, it only works with Bluetooth and unlocked WiFi printers.  Not many of those to be found in most offices.  :(
B00C2U6G7C|5|WOW! - All I can say is WOW! - Zimmer has outdone himself this time! Seriously... He really has connected with the 'Man of Steel'/Superman universe!<br /><br />There is no filler here at all! - Every note is very important in creating an incredibly cohesive whole! This 'whole' being a very intense, plaintive, hopeful, awe-inspiring body of music & sound! - Talking about sound... The sound quality of this recording is fantastic!!<br /><br />Bottom line, Hans Zimmer has 'transcended' John Williams' music in every way - the essence and embodiment of Kal El, Clark Kent, Superman, Jor El, Krypton and Smallville is incredibly realized!<br /><br />ENJOY! :] - Lastly I recommend playing this album on a great, powerful sound system - I am actually upgrading my current system as it can't handle the bass (especially from track 8) - the upgrade will definitely be worth it!
B007J4T2G8|5|I liked it kindle us making me write a review this sucks the forced review it's annoying blah blah blah blah
B0036RCVJM|3|A sad story of struggle in POW camps and  the Burma railway, and the even greater struggle living is aftermath. A magnificent story of human endurance and succeeding against all the odds.<br /><br />The writing style is somewhat plodding and pedestrian but it is worth sticking to the book.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Good game just needs stronger weapons that don't cost as much and a better way to be able to get more glu credits
B005MLOKXA|5|I really like how there's stories within the story that carry through each week. But also how they tell a story beginning to end.
B009XIXVU6|3|Ok. Author is trying to find sadder and sadder things to add.  Got repetitive .. It was ok at best.
B00447L4JG|5|This movie is absolutely brilliant; it's dark, yet colorful, brooding yet humorous, and just plain fun to watch. Using stop-motion animation, Tim Burton's masterpiece brings about a flashback of 60s and 70s nostalgia a la Rankin/Bass. This works extremely well for a movie of this type, rather than the CGI of today. Visually, this is certainly breathtaking eye candy, with crisp graphics. In typical Burton fashion, this movie is poetic and has a cadence to it. The storyline is very tangible and easy to follow, so children will love it as well. The Nightmare Before Christmas is an instant classic, and belongs in every Christmas movie collection.
B008RJ6TTC|3|I am very pleased so far. Have only had the chance to watch a few episodes so far , but I am quite satisfied with the quality of the product !!
0425263908|5|Love this trilogy.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to be realeased in May.  I'm addicted to 50 shades of grey and the Crossfire trilogy
B00CWVFVUE|5|Love this movie. My 15th old could relate and so could I
B0045HCJ94|5|I don't know what it is about this movie...it's uncomfortable to watch, but I love it. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton give superb performances. Sandy Dennis' performance was also incredible. Fabulous film!
B005J9ZDYK|5|A great show from GB.  Course you have to love \\"Claymation\\" and cartoon humor.  Arrived on time and as advertised.  I can recommend this unit to all buyers.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Just use it to pass the time when I have to wait for something. Makes the time go by really fast.Makes it easier when I have to wait.
B00G6HO368|5|My favorite movie of all time!
B00M25DDQE|5|just watched it another great movie
B00I3BRLPK|5|The Lauda/Hunt story is a good one, 2 men with great competitive spirit. Ron Howard did his usual excellent job of portraying the characters as real, believable people. The movie had good pace and built toward a strong finish. My only complaint about the movie was the cartoonish nature of some of the race scenes. Have been an auto racing fan for many years and know what &#34;real&#34; racing looks like. Suspension of disbelief overcame the problems with the racing scenes. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and felt it worth my time to watch.
B002I0J5FG|5|I loved the original game Shadow of the Colossus on PS2 (never played Ico). the HD upgrade to SotC is great. Things look much better than I remember. Still one of my favorite games. I look forward to playing ICO next.
B00BFUUMO8|5|Love it!!!
B009SQRL4U|4|This was a different view of what the North Pole and Christmas could be compared to traditional Santa Clause stories. My family and I enjoyed watchingthis show together. It was fun and entertaining for all ages.
B009EEFTMC|3|Very clever cube game. The timed games can be very intense.
B0053FANQS|5|I really enjoy all of the Fast and Furious movies want to collect them all Paul Walker and Vin Diesel make this movie even better
B00DR0PDNE|5|This was a gift for Christmas and was the perfect little gift  for his Media Player, can't beat that for a gift.
B009UX2YAC|4|I love subwaybsurfers but you start off with nobody fun
B0007LGCB8|4|Good Quality Sandal!  I had never worn a pair of Keen Sandals before and usually had a pair of Rocky or Columbia.  They fit just as they needed in my size and are very comfortable.  Quality seems high.
B00881VLCE|4|The pictures are beautiful. The 200+ pieces offer enough challenge. The app was free. My only complaint is that the completed portion is not anchored, so it moves all over when I accidentally touch the edge moving a piece in.
B00DG292SK|5|I Love Pete Townshend and love the book. Very insightful into the life of Pete and the world of The Who.
B00N5987AI|5|I gave this 5 stars for the artwork that went into this. The actual game is slow to progress but I'm older and not into gaming much. The music is also very well done. My friends husband was an art major and this is the kind of art he drew as well that is alot of hard work to draw the people and scenes.
B00FATEJYE|4|I was not sure what to expect from this game because it was few but I was very happy with what I got and love this game.
B006LSZECO|5|This was an awesome book! I was a little skeptical in the beginning, but totally glad I bought it!
B008K8VDPU|5|I love it its even better than my other panio game it didn't even let you do anything. this is an awesome game you should get it. it tought me panio:-)
B009FZHYKU|5|Who knew a show about a zombie apocalypse could be so good?  AMC did it again.  This series is intense.  I can't wait until next season.  A &#34;must watch&#34; for sure.
B00HXYKYIE|3|Great beginning. Very disappointing ending.
B00LXTZ51Q|5|Loving the new album!!
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this game so much I play it all the time and it's so fun. It's just like flappy bird but I like this one more😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
B00FAPF5U0|5|Great entertainment for all ages..u can try to figure out your own moves or follow the game's suggestions...highly addictive!
B0006VBFM0|5|Bought this as a gift for my sister.  She loves it!  It's casual, lightweight and just says, &#34;Fun,&#34; all over it!
0783226063|4|This is a slightly different cut than seen on TV.  It has 3 scenes not shown on the cuts shown on TV and leaves out 2-3 scenes that the TV adapted version has.  It is not the complete movie yet is a nice compliment for someone with a tape of the of the other cut. <br />The widescreen effect is excellant and thus much better.
B00DRPVE3M|5|Great fun awesome meeting new people yeah yeah super fun makes me think. Which at my advance age is important!!!!!!!!!  !!
B008458O3S|5|If you like a challenge this is a great game. Seems easy at first but starts to really make you think as you progress
B003PIS5XI|5|Always loved this movie! Hopefully they will make a sequel some day.
B00846REIS|5|First I read FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY.. loved it. Then a friend told me to read BARED TO YOU.. I absolutely LOVED it. It is similar to 50, but I think it's better. Much better.
B00296A4F4|4|Originally thought it was a two but these guys grow on me.
0785814531|5|Wonderful. I've come across multiple Poe collections before and usually something is edited out of them, and stories would be missing. This is a great, complete book. Dark and mysterious, with great sense of humour, and always my favourite.
B006RQNVDO|5|Robin Williams is (was) a genius. This was one of his best movies, period. He will be sorely missed. This movie addressed some core issues of the war in Vietnam in a suitable that was palatable for most audiences. Not to be missed.
B00D37UQ1K|3|This movie reminded me of invasion of the body snatchers if it were mildly reimagined.  The similarities are too great. Aliens come to earth and take over humans and basically simply replace them, they dress like humans, do the same jobs that the peope they replaced were doing before, etc.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Excellent
B0000CAQ27|5|Pink has definitely proved she has staying power with this album. It's a lot more rock, but it's still fun and still the Pink we know. She has some very deep songs on this cd, like &quot;Save My Life&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot;, but she also has got some awesome fun, rockin' songs like &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;God is a DJ&quot;. If you enjoyed her last cd *Missundaztood* then you should take Pink's advice and Try This!!
B00000BKE0|3|Because of &quot;Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot; and &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, this CD is worth buying if you can find it Used or in the bargain bin.  These are 3 very good songs that are underrated  because they happen to be on a very subpar album.  The production on this  album is also very good.  Unfortunately the rest of the songs on here are a  waste of time.  They range from boring to purposely stupid (&quot;Holy  Smoke&quot;? ).  Program tracks 1, 7 &amp; 10 and then go listen to a  better Maiden CD like &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;!
B00EJOCAYW|5|Perfect gift
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Ordered another book by this same author minutes after finishing this one.  It was a great read!
B006AX6ONI|5|It's a great, easy read, and is extremely motivating. It will be one of those books I'll pick up and read a few pages of whenever I need to be motivated.
B00BAXFAOW|5|Gladwell, known for making complex topics approachable, does it again in this interesting and illuminating book.  You will learn why going to the best university can be counterproductive and how questioning the convental wisdom is a powerful strategy for the powerless.  You won't be disappointed.
1936608898|2|I didn't like the organization or the writing style of the book. The authors speak like teenagers talking down to five year olds. The book recommends a very extreme diet.
B004EPYZT4|5|Wonderful movie!
B006OCM0G0|5|its a rlly cool game. u like own this resteraunt and u make food. I think u wud know that. um I do not the bad reveiws. like telling other ppl not to play it because YOU think its boring. tugs ur opinion. my opinion is tht its a rlly fun game. :)
B00DA6YEKS|5|This is my new favorite book with Way of Kings coming in at a very close second.<br /><br />The world building and character development are superb!  There are a few slow moving parts and occasionally awkward parts, usually surrounding Shallan, but I've come to realize this isn't a fault in Brandon Sanderson's writing style, but a strength.  If reading about Shallan feels awkward, it's because she is a somewhat awkward person!  She's lovable for sure, but still somewhat awkward.  And then all the sudden there is a twist in the story revolving around her that hits you like a ton of bricks and all the sudden I found myself having this new love and appreciation for her story.<br /><br />For me, just like the first book in the series, you will start reading about a character and really start getting into it and all the sudden the next chapter is about another of the main characters.  At first, you feel a bit disappointed, but as you keep reading, that disappointment turns to glee and excitement as it gets further through the chapter.<br /><br />If you've read Wheel of Time and loved the world building, but thought the characters could be more dynamic and likable and thought it could have used action sequences a bit more often, don't read this book until you have some time off because you probably won't be able to put it down.
0345803485|1|Would never spend the money on this so-called 'book'. Even if it was given to me for free, I wouldn't read it unless it was me, four walls, and nothing to do but read that book. Even in that situation, I may just choose to sleep to death.
B00GY0HJ4K|2|Was bored with this game after only an hour or so.
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game it's so addictive I mean every time I play it I can't put it down and it's not like that all the time with me .......so.....Y'ALL SHOULD GET IT!! Byyye
B00H83EUL2|5|I watched this movie in a theater with a nice lady who wanted to go out with me. She always has good taste in movies and trusted her when she chose to watch this one.<br /><br />So, bought this one as a memento of her good taste in movies :)
156898443X|5|Life can change in an instant - Danny Gregory shares the 'instant' change . . . fast and strong story - making the values of every day matters - matter
B00H1UK3UO|3|I was interested . . . but, not completely engaged with this story
B000002C4J|5|Let's talk about Love the album by Cline Dion is a great album.It has My Heart Will go on,Us,and many more great songs on it.You will be so greatful that you got it.It is a great gift.As my music teacher says music is a  great thing to hear.
B000002HHB|5|Natalie Merchant perfectly portrays the emotional statements made by the beautifully written lyrics.  This album reflects her emotional outlook on life, which is an introverted one.  The band supports her singing to a chilling degree.  I would recommend this album to anyone who loves music to be subtle, poetic, mysterious and reflective.  It's also a great date album, married or single!
B004SYP5WC|5|Good one.
B007428UN6|5|Great movie
B00F91H666|2|Brad Pitt in crazy go wrong world.  Not rated to violent.  Parents don't let kids under 17 see it.  It could never happen zombie part. Don't know why they added.
1416550542|5|I just love this book; I could not put it down. The story is a mix of The Secret Garden, A Little Princess and Jane Eyre all in one. Plus, a glorious touch of classic fairy tale magic that makes this the perfect read. If you want an adventure and mystery you will not soon forget, you should read this book. I loved the writer's ability to take you through each of the generations of characters and magically bring their stories together. Destined to be a classic and favorite in your library.
B000G6R7B8|5|A great watch for the price! I'd recommend it to any aficionados looking for an entry level automatic.
B0063IH60K|5|Very entertaining,I spend time every day playing solitary. Whenever my granddaughter is around,the first thing she does is go for this game.
039916927X|5|This book was everything and more!!!!
B00C74SHRK|5|A terrific book on loss and meaning in life, charting adolescent male culture superbly with the meaning of art at the centre.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Really like this calculator.  So easy to use and large enough to make it easier on the eyes.<br />I. Can easily figure out how much tax I will be paying with the percentages.
B00BESJYAY|5|Chasing mavericks was a great movie even if you have never even surfed before,  great rental on amazon on demand
B00003W8NM|5|Don't forget to suspend disbelief.  This film is about a thinking, feeling, individual's quest for self-fulfillment.  Face it: Not everyone wants CK suits and a BMW.  However, everyone wants a sense of purpose.  Fight Club uses primordial, violent, almost sickening imagery to convey the struggle one may go through to sort through society's standards in quest of inner peace, freedom, and individuality in an increasingly materialistic world.  In the modern world, traditional values such as love, honor, devotion, patriotism, even faith are being subverted by slick marketing of desire attachments (BMW?) by international corporations.  Who says work your butt off to protect American values?  No: You work your butt off to get more things.  This film does not solve anything; it just makes you think.  And you'll think about guy things.  The masculine, logical mind has a tremendous burden in each generation.  Thus, people seeking a romantic movie are appalled, and people seeking an adventure are pleased.  The controversial ending resolved one man's life's purpose; his inner struggle was successful.  In a sense, he destroyed his \\"evil twin,\\" who distracted from psychological balance.  Fight Club grew on me, and I now rank it as collectible.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Fun Game. Takes a little time to get started but great for hand eye cordination. I would definatley recomed this.
B005LAII44|5|Great movie and great price and shipping!
B00PSLQYWE|5|Loved it !
0062409859|3|With all the controversies surrounding the publication of this novel aside, I admit that I began reading with some trepidation and skepticism – given the negative press at the time of release. However, I have walked away feeling as though I have bumped into an old friend that I hadn't missed, but was equally happy to see.<br />Rather than classifying it as a sequel (which it can't be, because it was never meant to be as such) I see this novel as a companion. The slightly boring relation with familial traits.<br />Had it been published prior to Mockingbird, this work would have been a mundane set of events and recollections about growing up, with little to no significance rather than what it is: A historical companion to an iconic piece of literary genius.<br /><br />Go Set a Watchman is particularly fascinating for the fact that Scout grows up and sees the world through adult eyes now. The novel is essentially about realisation. The realisation that her (Scout's) father is not perfect – a common happenstance that comes with growing up (for some of us).<br /><br />After all the years I invested in reading the story of Scout, Atticus, Jem, Calpurnia in Mockingbird, I am not sad to have read Watchman. In Watchman, many of the characters have been enriched by Harper Lee and I with them.<br /><br />I found some negatives: There were a few repetitions of some anecdotal accounts; and the anecdotes were not as cursive as Mockingbird; chronology felt somewhat stilted; there were a few issues with phrasing; the tempo was slow in places, but picked up at the end (the best section to my mind are the last 30–40 pages); and it lacked profundity regarding certain areas where I thought there should have been more emotional input invested, considering who the subject at hand was, (I won't say, just in case you wish to read the novel).<br /><br />However, on the positive side: Let's not forget that this novel was published as it was left 60 years ago, without any revision or edits by Harper Lee, at her insistence, apparently. And then if we consider that it is the first draft of her first work, I have to admit that I am impressed.<br /><br />In many ways, it made me think on a deeper level about Mockingbird and how it arrived to be the novel I have read so many times. I enjoyed the realistic shift from, the idyllic world of childhood, to the reality of adulthood.<br /><br />I did come across a few nice sections of prose which I would like to share:<br /><br />“I guess it’s like an airplane: they’re the drag and we’re the thrust, together we make the thing fly. Too much of us and we’re nose-heavy, too much of them and we’re tail-heavy—it’s a matter of balance.”<br /><br />“I am their blood and bones, I have dug in this ground, this is my home. But I am not their blood, the ground doesn’t care who digs it, I am a stranger at a cocktail party.”<br /><br />“You said, in effect, ‘I don’t like the way these people do, so I have no time for them.’ You’d better take time for ’em, honey, otherwise you’ll never grow.”<br /><br />This is a good read but not a great one.<br />The fact is that you don't need to read this book. But if you do, it means you've grown up along with Scout and the memorable characters that Harper Lee has created. You just need to ask yourself: Do I want (or need) to grow up?<br /><br />Question: Has it changed Mocking bird for me... forever?<br />Answer: Amazingly, NO. It changes nothing because Mockingbird is...well, simply Mockingbird.<br />Nostalgia had me edging on 4 out of 5 Stars, but there were too many little niggles, so 3 Stars it is.<br />However, 3 stars is really not that bad for something that wasn't meant to be read, and sat gathering dust for nearly 60 years.<br />Sergiu Pobereznic (author)its by Harper Lee, at her insistence, apparently.

B006VRDZ44|5|Engaging!
B006LSZECO|3|This book immediately draws you into the plot.  You are sucked in the moment you get through the first chapter.  I enjoyed the basic plot but as a reader you can easily figure out what will happen about a third of the way in.  But figuring out &#34;who done it&#34; is not the point.  It is mostly a journey into the psyche of the two main characters and all of their dysfunctions.  I found myself rooting for each of them through out the book, then being surprised and a little disappointed by the ending.  This is not to say the ending was inappropriate or lazy writing, it is that you hoped more for the characters and realize that how it ends is just how it is should be, and it is disappointing for them.<br /><br />I encourage this book for a good psycho thriller, but if you're looking for a who done it mystery something else might be in order.
B00ENXBUR2|5|Man of steel special edition is all of good!<br />amazing box, collectors need to have this!<br />If you like the move and superman probably you will have that in a display stand, since aren't everybody who will have this!
B00IX035QA|2|It is a good game but like most of the free games offered by Amazon there is a catch. This is only the first chapter of the text based adventure. It is not very long and only took me a couple of hours of game play to complete. Story is good which is what will make or break a game like this one. I really hope the paid version which is $5 has the whole game and not just the teaser first chapter.
B00DR0PDNE|1|I have no problem streaming to my wifi enabled DVD player that is connected to the same TV, but my Chromecast stutters and drops constantly. I have completely given up this garbage.
B0051ANPZQ|5|this is officially my favorite book it is such a great book I lov it you should to its awesome
B009MYARIK|5|Fun book to read while on vaca at the beach. Moves quickly, has lots of easy to follow details that make for a lazy afternoon of snacks & reading by the water....
B007XKEY6Q|5|I've played OMGPOP's games through Gaia before, as well as this game via PC and mouse. And I have to say this is definitely addicting on my kindle, a significant difference with finger than mouse. It makes the game a lot more fun.<br /><br />To quickly cover the game, you are given three choices of words to draw and your opponent tries to guess it and vice versa. You earn coins with correct guesses that you can spend on bombs (which take away the wrong letters or give you new words) or different colors too draw with. You can connect with Facebook to pay against friends or find random opponents to play.<br /><br />Overall, this is an addicting game that I highly recommend you get. Internet connection is required.
B00J59ZKV6|4|Great sci fi movie!! We really like it and can't wait for sequel. Yes, it's longer than I expected a movie to be but well worth it.<br />We tried to guess the plot twists each time but were still surprised.<br />Nice to watch a movie (based on book) that's original.<br />Looking forward to reading the novels!
B009CPJHY4|5|I liked this story.  I am always looking for life affirming movies, and this one fits the bill.  If it is somewhat predictable, that isn't a bad quality.  I also like movies that give me a glimpse of how other people live.  It does that also.

B000002A46|5|This continues to be my favorite Christmas CD. Merry Christmas showcases Mariah Carey's true talent. Her version of O Holy Night is often imitated, but never duplicated. This cd is filled with songs that will bring the best memories back to life when listening. Don't miss another year without this cd. You will be so glad that you added this to your collection, Christmas or not!
0374264260|4|The further I got into this book, the more I liked it and the characters inside. The optimism is infectious.
B00MI3C2Q2|5|One cliff hanger after the other.... And good laughs too!
B008Y6YIXM|5|A classic!
B004LOMB2Q|3|It's one of those programs that looks nice on the surface, but gets detailed the more you get into it. The concept of storing your stuff off of your phone has good and bad points. The good point is that your data stands a better chance of surviving if your phone takes a swim and never comes back. The bad point/s deal with the security of your data (it is in someone's hands that isn't yours) and if you have no signal, you do not have access to your data.<br /><br />With storage options on phones increasing every year, the ability to store more info on your phone increases as well. Don't get me wrong. This product has its uses and benefits, but it just doesn't fill my needs right now.

B0026977EK|2|Could have been better - the narrator's voice was super annoying - would have been better with a Spanish accent, or in the voice of one of the characters.  Story was kind of lame too.  Definitely wouldn't watch it again.
B003UESJFG|5|I'll leave the spoilers and plot reviews to others.  I watched this movie 8 times in 2 weeks.  The options, including the popups for movie trivia (Blu Ray) make this movie easily one of the easiest to re-watch of all time.
B000A1ENCU|5|Totally enjoyable!  Well acted, well written, and a pleasure to behold!  They don't make'm like this anymore.  Your money will be well spent investing in this gem from the golden age of biblical films.    Enjoy!
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is quite interesting. I found it to be one that gets an individuals mind to thinking. Images might be quite simple but at times hard to figure out
B0089EHWQE|5|Should get 5+ a fantastic book . I highly recommend it to anyone to read . I need five more words
B00973DDN2|5|this was a fantastic album and I strongly recommend it to any killers fan out there. When you buy this album you to can be battle born!
B004J4WNL2|5|Finally a book with actual facts and science not just the authors &#34;thoughts&#34; on being an introvert.
B000HWZ61Y|5|Highly recommended CD.If you already own Hysteria you'll love disc two on this CD. If you don't own Hysteria yet, what are you waiting for.
B00E3UN44W|5|I've seen some people bashing on the third season, saying that it isn't the same show anymore and all that jazz. However, I think they are missing a very important aspect of this show; as writer/creator Mark Gatiss once stated, this show is not a detective show, but a show about a detective. While the cases Sherlock Holmes involves himself with are, indeed, exciting, the primary focus of this show is Sherlock becoming a hero and a good man. This show isn't a cop show. This season is all about the relationship of Sherlock and John Watson, and boy, is it beautifully carried out. By the end of the season, we are left feeling sympathetic for our beloved consulting detective. He definitely isn't the same man we saw in season 1. Oh no. He's become more human while still maintaining his quirks we fell in love with.<br />So, in short, if you fell in love with this show because of the cases, this season probably won't appeal to you. However, if you fell in love with this show for its brilliant and beautiful characterization, then season 3 will be a treat.
0937381888|5|This is an essential book for new brewers. John is a great guy and a good contributor to home brewing community. Buy it.
B008TVLRU4|5|There isn't much that can be said that hasn't already been mentioned.  This is the classic translation of a classic work.  Read it now, and then pick it up and reread it at least once every year or so.  It pays dividends.
0439023491|5|I have read all three books in this series and they are all good. My son (11) has also ready all three and enjoyed them. I would recommend this series to anyone.
B005L38QHA|3|it's kinda fat for my hands but useable with practice, some what confusing to program .but for now will keep it
B00VXGTJMU|4|Always like Willie and Merle
0345529057|5|perfect condition, arrived quickly.  i really enjoy reading these books even more than watching the tv show.  Highly recommended buying
0316322407|5|This is an excellent book, well written, easily read and a great motivating story of Malala. I have read the book and thought so much of it that I have given it to a young reader hoping it will impress upon this young reader the importance of her freedoms here in the USA and her ability to obtain an education.
B008XG1X18|5|I always use it and it's great long story short if u wanna be an electric border or just a person with a lot of free time here u go.
B009UX2YAC|5|I am installing this awesome game right away! I play this on the ipad all the time and love it!
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Perhaps the perfect popcorn movie.
B0031RAOVY|5|Amazing movie..loved richard gere even more.  Being a dog lover i sobbed as if i could actually feel that precious animals heart.
B000KGGLCU|5|I always liked Madonna but I never really became a huge fan. I have some of her albums but really the one that really got me was \\"CONFESSIONS ON A DANCE FLOOR\\". I bought it right after I heard \\"HUNG UP\\" but I almost hesitated because I really found \\"AMERICAN LIFE\\" simple horrible. Anyway, I bought this combo for the DVD of her latest tour and I simply found it flawless. <br />The DVD perse isn't loaded with extra features but you don't care because the show is amazing. Madonna starts the show with a fusion of Donna Summer's \\"I FEEL LOVE\\" and \\"FUTURE LOVERS\\" appearing inside a huge crystal ball and continues the show with \\"GET TOGETHER\\" and goes on and on with a great selection of songs. Besides the poor speacial features on the DVD, some Madonna's classic songs are missing on the show such as \\"TAKE A BOW\\", \\"RAIN\\", \\"DON'T TELL ME\\" or \\"LIKE A PRAYER\\" she should've made a medley including her old hits. <br />What really impresses me is the perfection and clean performance of Madonna, she looks hotter than ever on this phase of her life, the choreography on the show is very good as the stage. One of the highlights of the show is when she appears on the famous cross and of course her voice is very good now. It's an incredible show, I don't get tired of repeating the same definition for the show. I really enjoy tracks like \\"JUMP\\", \\"CONFESSIONS\\", \\"LIKE A VIRGIN\\", one of my personal favorites \\"DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE\\" and \\"SORRY\\" <br />Another impressive thing about this combo, is the big impact on the charts. In the US it debuted on Billboard's Top 200 selling albums on #15 and had similar positions throughout the world. <br />Give it a try this is something that any music lover that doesn't dislike Madonna should have.
B004LROMWU|5|Great show
B00AREIAI8|2|commercials pop up everywhere and one popped up while I was playing a mini game and had to quit and wait the ten minutes to play. also, something that I do like is that you can watch an ad to get the elusive gems and free energy. unfortunately it wont let me watch the ads because no matter if I'm hooked into the Internet or wireless there is no connection. other than that it is an ok timewaster.
B00IJJUIMY|4|I've read all 19 of Bosch's novels and this one is right up there with the best. One of the best detective characters in fiction.
0440539811|5|This book is very clever. The authors have a well-developed sense of humor, going so far even as to poke fun at themselves throughout the book. <br /> <br />I agree with one of the earlier review that really what this book is trying to say is that an open mind is key to understanding the world. <br /> <br />Reading this book as if it actually will provide REAL answers to to the \\"real\\" world is not a good idea. Conspiracy theories aside, if you trace where some of these facts come from, you can tell that they have been stretched a little here and there to fit the story (though sometimes not by much...). <br /> <br />Bottom line, this book is great and I think any disillusioned liberal should read it. It'll provide a good laugh and maybe even a dose of hope. <br /> <br />And the author of this review will NOT die for Fernando Poo!
B002MQYOFW|5|This is such a fast paced adventure novel and series that you want to be able to read it whenever you have a spare moment. Kindle is portable, the book is on Kindle, you can read to your hearts content at every spare moment.<br /><br />Recommend the book? Of course.<br /><br />Recommend the Kindle version? YES!
B00000JLWW|5|Just a few thoughts...<br /><br />What else can be said about Titanic (1997)?  After nearly 2,200 Amazon reviews, here's one more.  I give this movie a 5-star rating.  It won 11 Academy Awards.  It's sad, interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic all rolled into one.  The acting is great.  Kate Winslet plays the role of Rose very well, but I think the best actor in the whole movie was Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson.  Billy Zane, who played Cal, also did a great job.  He's my favorite character in the whole movie.  Really, every actor did a great job - Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, everybody.  The script is great, the special effects are great, the story is great.<br /><br />For MANY YEARS after this movie came out, I've been hearing Celine Dion's song playing everywhere.  I must say it drives me nuts.  Some songs just get on my nerves.  That's one of them.  An overdone song that's played WAY too much over the airwaves.  You can't go anywhere without hearing it.  And you know what?  It doesn't fit in with the movie too well, in my opinion.  Too commercial, too much of a sellout.  Now, the musical score by James Horner was good and fits the movie well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great epic movie that I highly recommend.
B001EYGOEM|5|Once again, Ms. Swift has created a great album.  Though many of the songs have that \\"made for 11 year old girls\\" feel, this really is some wonderful, fresh sounding music from someone with real talent.  I would highly recommend this album to anyone interested in country music.
B00QROGCPU|4|Good movie!
B004SJ3AXI|3|this game is too hard compared to original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Rio.cant get past the first level for each theme! frustrating.
B0002Z0EYK|4|I am going to keep this short and sweet. Some well known critics have given Troy the \\"thumbs down\\" because of historical inaccuracies. To this I say \\"So what?\\" It isn't a PBS documentary...it is a huge, spectacular, and often thrilling epic movie, and how many people are devout students of Homer's Iliad anyway? If you view movies for entertainment, then give this one a try....you won't be disappointed. Brad Pitt portrays Achilles with a level of charisma and athleticism that will make you believe he truly is \\"the greatest warrior of his time\\". Huge amounts of talent, money, and effort were heaped upon this project, and it shows. The detailing of the city of Troy, the choreography of the battles, and the spectacular art direction...including the darndest Trojan Horse you will ever see, built exactly as it would have been. Rent it...buy it...borrow it...but most of all watch it. Don't let some critical snobbery keep you from an excellent movie.
B0047C2IIE|2|Paying 9.49 for this was a rip off. The music itself is great, but the sound quality is terrible. Sounds like someone TAPED it from a scratchy old record. This is one of the greatest Christmas albums ever and it deserves to be remastered.
0671004107|5|It's hard to know where to begin this review.  I just finished re-reading this book and my thoughts aren't really settled yet.  That happens every time I read it - the ending is so powerful and yet so simple, it inspires strong emotions.    I guess the thing that gets me with \\"Contact\\" is that it works on so many levels.  It's an adventure story (receiving a signal from space and the events that follow).  It's a biographical account of an incredible woman (the main character).  It's an interesting look at our recent past (the late 90s) from a 1985 perspective.  It's an interesting comparison of religion vs science, written by a scientist who obviously was not ready to completely give up on religion.    There are also a couple of messages that always hit me when I read this book.     First, a common argument between science and religion is the age of the universe and the role of \\"God\\" in creating the universe.  Various religions have their stories of how God created the Earth and the Heavens and human beings, etc.  But what if \\"God\\" is actually responsible for creating billions of galaxies and planets and beings?  What if the universe isn't a random collection of atoms and molecules...what if it really is all part of a plan so big that it really can't even be comprehended?  Isn't that even more incredible than what's in the Bible or the Koran or the Tao Te Ching?    And second, in a universe so vast, how can we - who are so small - make it through?  How can we not be overcome by the galactic forces that are so powerful?  By believing in the strongest galactic force of all - love.    Probably not the messages you would expect in a science fiction book, but then, \\"Contact\\" is not your typical science fiction book.  It's really a simple story of hope.  And that's something we could all use more of.
B000063V8T|5|You can't be without even one season of the best star trek ever made.  I wish they would have continued this series.
B00ACP3OOM|1|Maybe my bone density is too thin but it didn't work for me. It also was uncomfortable to wear on my goggle strap
B007MDB71O|5|I cannot understand why this movie did so poorly. In my opinion it is well worth the full price. 2 Thumbs up
B00C5R7B0I|1|Thought it was horrible-couldn't get through it. Found the writing bad and the story was so slow getting anywhere. Amature writing.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|This is a great game just like flappy bird I recommend it plz play This game it is amazing I hope u enjoy
B00BLCHZC2|5|I was really surprised about this series. I t is great. I mean, it has to be the best real looking era period, about the Vikings I have ever seen. Puts the Tony Curtis movie &#34;The Vikings&#34; to shame. Great works people, keep it going. I am an avid fan now and forever.
B00T3DNKIE|4|Quite shocking at first -- interesting historically too. Not the book &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; was, but the writing was always riveting.
B00004XQ83|5|Why don't people write music like this anymore?  The songs have a great, old-timey sound and the lyrics are uplifting.  A few of the songs I had heard of before, like &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; from books like &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, but had never actually heard them, so that was a treat.  That song in particular has really funny, whimsical lyrics if you take the time to pay attention.  &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; is the real reason I bought the album in the first place.  After seeing the movie, I immediately got that addictive song in my head and had to buy the album, although I was not really familiar with the rest of the songs.  I was not disappointed, however.  The whole album has a lot of great music, which, even though you may not have been from that generation will still make you think of church picnics, barbecues, and long southern summers from another age.
B00ARW2XJW|5|I was astonished at the how well this works. With it being so cold outside (18 degrees) and feeling super hot inside, I was assuming the building heat for me room was 80 degrees, sure enough after installing this app, it showed my phone temperature at 80 degrees on the nose.

0812550706|3|Ender's Game is so full of excitement, intelligence, realism, and with such an interesting cast of main characters and a conclusion that evokes such mixed feelings, nominally triumphant but really tragic, it's hard not to love it. The battle room scenes were especially gripping with their detailed explanations rather than just generalizations. For that, and excellent science fiction, 3 stars.<br />There were at least a couple parts that were disturbing (Card argues in his intro to this 1991 edition that some childran really DO think and talk like Ender and the others, and I'm willing to accept that).<br />Without spoiling things, the world is not democratic; evil forces are in control is almost justified with descriptions of \\"peace and prosperity\\". Don't get me wrong but I wouldn't like a book describing a future under communism or facism and putting hope into that, saying that humanity experiences \\"peace and prosperity\\". Would you? The ultimate \\"hegemon\\" has quite a bit of blood (partially) on his hands. There are other characters who do some reprehensible things and get away with it. In the end, a crushing look at politics (as with war).<br />A supposedly more sympathetic character, Ender's sister Val, allows herself to be used by evil and never seems to completely atone for her actions. She runs away, is still the smiling kid who asks why she shouldn't be allowed to have fun, and doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that she was so easily, hopelessly repeatedly, controlled, and helped mislead millions of people. This should have been better developed. She even partially justifies it, claiming that we all \\"fill roles\\" given to us by others. While this may be true, they are not the right words to be coming out of this particular character's mouth.<br />Well the book is entertaining enough but that entertainment seems overshadowed by pain and tragedy, all well represented within the character Ender, and the ironies that result. It draws in the reader very personally. I think it has to, because we are enjoying the \\"games\\" which lead to the killing, by reading the book, in that sense we are like Ender who is the actual doer.<br />Add these elements together, sometimes I think the troubled consquences are simply suppressed or put aside one too many times; the last chapter didn't happen soon enough and wasn't long enough; things went on too long too complacently when evil ruled politics and while Ender followed violence so far (wittingly or not). This is very troubling, because it suggests, despite evidence to the contrary, that the war was after all the centerpiece of the book, and that the other factors were simply the decoration, the after-thought, the accompanying philosophy that cannot exist without first military priorities or military victory. Which would make it a glorification, intentional or not, of violence, and evil. If you think I am crazy judge for yourself. I suppose I am sensitive to such subtleties because I have read one too many biased writings, and know how subtle and troubling these biases can be, even unconscious ones, despite facades that are presented..<BR>It was honestly that thought that kept me awake at night long after I had finished this book. Well, you can come to your conclusions, but while I am unwilling to certainly condemn, and can only express doubts, those doubts are enough to keep me from ever being completely comfortable with this book.
B00005QCVT|5|This movie has to be one of the greatest films i have ever seen, altough it deal with bealk subject matter, the directing style and cuts are amazing. I would reccomend every freshman entering highschool to see this movie, it would turn their stomach's and perhaps someway alter their lives for the better. This movie is not suggested for an immature viewing audiance, no matter how old they are.
B00I8Q77Y0|2|The game sucks flappy bird on my ipod is way better. I can only get 8 when i can get 69 on my ipod
0688014291|5|For years I have considered this the best, quick read management book available.  The \\"catch them doing something right\\" sums up the book nicely and it is a policy that I truly believe in.
B008Y5NO5G|4|Classic movie! Never gets boring!
B007ZGO7EM|4|It's nice to have a calculator when I need it where I need it as well.  If you're always needing a calculator for your Fire, this is the one.
B000UZQI0Q|5|Great book! I'm a big fan of all of Brandon Sanderson's books.
1573225517|4|Nick Hornby's High Fidelity was a laugh not only for its humor but also for its accuracy in portraying that segement of the male population that is utterly neurotic and wrapped up in some silly facet of pop culture as if it was what really defined them. The book was funny and intelligent, through the protagonist Rob Hornby lets slip a few of the things every man does, but doesn't want to admit to.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Of all the scenarios possible, I never anticipated Jack Reacher working for the army. After years of solo operations, he once more becomes part of an official intelligence operation.  This pits him against mobsters, monsters and moral quandaries. Action packed, and fast paced, this is Jack at his very best!
0316322407|5|Seriously folks, this book and this young lady prove how much the Western educational system lacks when you see the intelligence and priorities of this wonderful young woman. I wish this book were required reading in American schools
B0000584V3|5|Opeth's fifth 'observation' is a chilling and emotional journey through various textures and colours.  This (and previous releases)has some of most unique and jarring songwriting to ever materialize.  The highlight of this album is the fourth track, 'The Drapery Falls'.  This 12 minute epic is well worth the price of admission from start to finish, particularly at the 4:30-6:00 min mark.  As a music fan I highly recommend this and after exposure, you will probably ignore your Korn and blink 182 albums as this album is untouchable.  The songs take hold and never let go, even hours later.  Buy this album!
0451169514|5|Thank you
B004FOOQV6|4|Love it!  Converts everything.  Great for making smaller recipes

B00DJFIMW6|4|Once you start playing, you won't want to stop. This game has all your fave characters from Despicable Me 2.
B001LF347E|5|Video is of good quality and it is a joy to watch this charming and different look at Merlin, the young man.  We look forward to upcoming seasons.
B006LSZECO|3|It was good but slow to start. Once it does get to the middle the story picks up.  The end left me a bit puzzled. Did not expect it.
B009MO5960|5|I wanted to complete my collection of Resident Evil movies, and although I didn't quite enjoy this one the first time I watched it, I decided to purchase it anyways. When I got it, I just watched it.<br />After seeing this movie a second time, I don't know why, but I enjoyed it much more. The action sequences were pretty amazing, the music was awesome, and I think (this time around) the addition of more RE-Verse characters felt less cheesy. I love Barry, but I wish there was more to him. I'm not a big Leon Kennedy fan, but he was pretty perfect in this film.<br />I feel that, unless you know the Resident Evil story, this film may be meaningless to you. But to those who have played the games, this movie is great fan service, and I think that it was filmed to lead to the ending of the films.
1451627289|5|great book, recommend
B00B0LPWU6|4|Good Movie, worth watching.
B0062NAX1U|5|Every parent needs to watch this movie. It is powerful, moving and life changing. You will be challenged to make the most of every minute you have with your children!!
B00HVJB4VM|5|I am not a numbers person, which made this an understandable read. Lewis - as is his style - focuses on the people as much as the technology. A fascinating and frightening story.
B00B2V66VS|5|Temple run is a great game  to play I've played all four of the games it is a very addictive game!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008YLV2|5|This was an absolute great movie when I saw it in 2002.  Everything about this movie was great.  The entire movie was as realistic \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  The cinematography was gritty and phenominal, placing you in the middle of Mogidishu.  The sound was in your face.  Ridley Scott did a terrific job of taking on this project, and the fact that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Director was upsetting.       The Deluxe Edition of the DVD is something to be desired.  The Commentary by the Director, Producer, and the REAL soldiers who were there are all insightful.  The History Channel Documentary on the Third Disc is something that needs to be watched before or after the viewing of the movie.    This is a great collection, in an even better DVD collection.  If you think about buying this movie, buy the Deluxe Edition, and you won't be dissapointed.
B00C0K6NUY|4|good reading.
B00EY8BRGU|5|Great story, wonderful acting, and no loss of interest is possible! You'll love it!! Everty actor was absolutely fabulous! Period
B009AMAK54|5|A little different role for Clint but he gets it done Timberlake isn`t half bad either, and if you like baseball you`ll love this movie

B00R2LZ41K|3|Only Peter Jackson could make a three part movie about a short book. The filming is great to watch but seems to be a bit stretched shall we say
B000FBGBPC|4|For hearing one song before purchasing this CD, I am amazed by how much I like the whole CD. It was a great purchase with the limited knowledge of the band and sound. I recommend this CD if you like this type of music.

B000OPOAM0|4|Sarah Conner(Linda Hamilton)is a young woman who has one of the early points in her life made well. Not only does Sarah Conner's job as a waitress support her,her life outside of work is nothing but flashy fun.    But,one day,things take a sudden and dangerous turn around the corner for Sarah Conner. This is when Sarah Conner discovers that she is the target of The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a cyborg from the future that has been sent from time to assasinate her. The reason for this? To save the future by changing the past,in order to prevent Sarah Conner's future son John from being the only hope of mankind.    Now,on the run from danger,Sarah Connor only has one real aide and help throughout the disastorous and terrifying event she finds herself going through. Who is that real aide and help? A cyborg by the name of Kyle Reese(Michael Biehn),who,before he knows it,will be through a lot more than just protecting Sarah Conner.    \\"The Terminator\\" is one of the most richly executed films every made. The plot for \\"The Terminator\\" is very creative,and is skillfully and carefully brought to life by director James Cameron. Throughout \\"The Terminator\\",James Cameron cleverly tackles both science fiction and action. His take on both science fiction and action appropriately and entertaingly represent both of the two genres,without going overboard in any way,shape,or form. The character chemistry in \\"The Terminator\\" is impeccable,and balances out \\"The Terminator\\" well,contributing to the goodness of the film. The beauty of \\"The Terminator\\"? Unlike most films similiar to it,you really don't know who will win:the good side,or the bad side.    It is also worth noting that \\"The Terminator\\" does deliver some very strong acting. In Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's performances as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese,Hamilton and Biehn make a perfect onscreen team. Their take of the action succeeds in going along with the story,not trying to be action stars and being able to maintainthe limnits. The chemistry in the script for \\"The Terminator\\" is intelligently brought to life by Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn,and keeps the heat up throughout the film. Also,despite the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger will never be taken seriously as an actor,Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator is nothing but brilliance. As The Terminator,Arnie keeps one wondering what will happen next,and makes the suspense of the film both entertaining and chilling. Add everything together,and you have the perfect film that posseses the qualities of a perfect and successful film.    As for this DVD version of \\"The Terminator\\",the lenticular cover is very cool. It is something that any hardcore fan of \\"The Terminator\\" will appreciate. But,considering the fact that the only bonus feautures here are the original theatrical trailer for \\"The Terminator\\" and DVD-Rom script to screen(which you have to access with your computer,with only two computer programs being accessible),you may just want to buy the DVD version of this film that comes without the lenticular cover.    Need I say more?
B000002H6C|4|every metallica CD from the 80s had a new approach to musical competence.  Peaking with master of puppets, metallica proved to rise above other bands of metal from that time period.  With almost deafening texture and dynamics  from the group, they redefined what a band should sound like.  With this  album, their masterful arranger, cliff burton alas died, as a result, the  production and sound of the band is also completely different.  The  negative lyrics now have to do with the evils and peril of government,  rather than the excess of power like puppets.  It is not a fun album to  listen too, the singing is blunt and unmelodic most of the time, with the  exception of the lyrical &quot;one&quot;, but it is one of the most complex  guitar work ever by them.  I rate it a 4 because of the poor production  work (probably from trying to fit in newbee jason newstead in) and not as  mellow lyrical singing as before. still an album worth listening too.
6305603847|5|Director Alan Parker teams up with psychedelic supergroup Pink Floyd to paint a vivid tapestry of madness, paranoia, and self-destruction. It is the story of &quot;Pink&quot;, a rock star mixing drugs, alcohol, sex, and a lost childhood into a miasma that so strangles, and overloads his brain as to warp reality itself. In the end, he has nowhere to turn but within: the most dangerous place of all. Nightmarish visual imagery, counterpointed by the music of one of history's finest bands, at the height of their compositional skill, drags the viewer through an experience unlike any other previously created for the cinema.
B009SJ3H8Q|4|It was a fun and entertaining show to watch - if you are into that type of show.  Not quite as good as the first season though.
B00J8CG6KE|5|Although other viewers didn't like this movie I think they just didn't realize what they were renting. However, this movie is not for the sensitive at heart. It's an interesting depiction of a very tough industry. Lots of sex, drugs and ruthless behavior. Very well done though.
B007IXWL2C|5|Very fun easy read. I blushed several times! The characters are so easy to identify with. I don't recommend this trilogy for the faint of heart though!
B004FP1WX0|4|Surprising and unique modern day real life drama.<br />Definitely worth seeing though it is a bit sad at times yo!
0792843584|1|this is one of the slowest moving films i have ever seen .  endless scenes moving at a glacial pace with people saying nothing ,  staring  into space ,  emoting ... very difficult to determine what is happening .   best watched on a dvr where you can fast forward in 30 second intervals to get through the meaningful silent staring ..   the concluding scene is impossible to fathom .   who is the woman ?  where did she come from ..
B005OCFGTO|5|perfect for a warm night or two in, the kids have been looking forward to spending a few nights watching the whole series
B00006JL1Z|5|This was perfect. As soon as I ordered this it was in my cloud on my iPad. Getting music through amazon is amazing & so cool u can get it right away & get the CD 2 days later
B000I9WWHW|2|First of all, I was just trying to rent this. The app on my iPad must have glitched.  The movie's really not that great. I don't blame the actors. I blame the writers, editors, and director.
B00QW8TYWO|1|This game is so hard I can't even get gifty
B001RTP3YQ|5|Leonard Cohen has been a favorite of mine for at least 40 years - and to my surprise, he's getting even better!    I heard a brief review of this two-disc album on WFUV's Sound Opinions, and bought it the next day, and have been listening ever since to this iconic folk singer/songwriter. One disc is in my outside radio, and the other in my kitchen - so I can sit and listen to Leonard all day, and I never tire of it.    Believe it or not, his voice is strong and still mezmerizing, and all the old songs sound incredibly wonderful.    If you are a Leonard Cohen fan, you must have this CD: if not, this will make you one.
B00B7Y0206|5|This is great to be able to see the you tube videos as well as hear them.  The sound on my kindle fire is pretty darned good!
B00DJFIMW6|5|My whole family loves this game. Me and my eighteen year old battle back and forth for hours it's great.
B001M0HGR2|5|Love Robert Downey, Jr.!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I really enjoy the game! Was very glad I was offered it for my Kindle Fire. Happy, Happy, Happy, .:-)
B00HY7VU60|5|Very well put together! I can't wait til the next season comes up! If you like Reign, you'll like this one, too. It's up there with Game of Thrones, in my opinion. The acting is believable & story line well thought out.
B003L77G6A|5|A firm family favorite. Great to watch during non ratings season when there is absolute rubbish screened on free to air tv. Cannot get enough of this series.
B00BHMF578|5|Argo lives up to the hype. The Oscar winner for best film, deserved the crown. A close second for favorite of the year was Silver Linings Playbook, which features some of the best individual performances of 2012, but Argo is a complete thriller that is totally believable. Highly recommend.
1572816295|5|This is my first real tarot set.  It never ceases to amaze me how accurately these cards speak of the world.  They are so detailed that I find a new aspect of each card presenting itself in each new circumstance.  I really could just look at these beautiful pictures all day!
B00EEDJHXA|3|Is fun to play but I don't like the scoring. Should be based not only on time. I'm never in a hurry to solve it
B00KY7PEAA|1|I don't have enough room on my kindle fire to run this game.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Quite a ride through a neighborhood of not so ordinary folks.  Found myself thinking about the characters and their tangled relationships.  Train tracks are straight without sharp hard curves yet this group of neighbors are twisted and rarely straight with each other or themselves!<br />Buy a ticket, climb aboard and enjoy the read!
B000W7JWUA|5|It's neck & neck with Clue as my favorite strategy board game.  Catan is a lot of fun, and even my first-grader caught on quickly and enjoys it.  The box says 60-minutes average playing time.  We usually take 2 hours.  To play in an hour, we adjusted the # of points to win to 7 (instead of 10 per the instructions).  All of my extended family loves this game!
0143113100|5|Great book!
B005LAIII0|2|This is essentially a very long fairy tale with very nice special effects as well as frank religious overtones. It treats the characters in a worshipful/spiritual way and, quite frankly, I really didn't care for this film. Although its cinematography is perhaps worth viewing. As with most movies, your reaction will depend on your personal outlook and interests.
B00080DIWE|5|Item exactly as shown.
B0059XTTW8|1|To read the book or watch the excellent BBC mini series, do not waste your money and time watching this \\"amateur dramatics\\" \\"fast foward\\" presntation of \\"tinker, tailor, soldier, spy\\" from the cliff notes of the same name...<br /><br />You are presented with a cornucopia of interesting characters (interesting that is if you have read the book or watched the mini-series) here reduced to brooding facsimiles... about as compelling as the pictures taped to the chess pieces featured in the film<br /><br />this film must have been made on a budget based upon the number of words Gary Oldman had to speak ...  He phoned this one in ... or should I say \\"blinked\\" it in with his oft resemblance to an owl in those glasses!<br /><br />Gary if only those grenades were real in \\"The Professional\\" we would have been spared this cardboard cutout performance ... Alec Guiness could power a small city if we harnessed him spinning in his grave as fast as he must be ....<br /><br />Le Carre must be short of a bob or two to associate his name with this amateur precis of his matserful novel and the incompable BCC interpretation...<br /><br />p.s<br /><br />Percy (Toby), get a better speech coach if you are going to attempt to be Scottish 100% of the time...
B009FZFONO|5|As the story continues, the characters adapt to their new world and now they must fight other humans.  It will be interesting to see the black and white marathon - that will take out a lot of the gore.
1582701709|5|I recieved this book within a few days of ordering it. The condishion is great.
B009OYSFDM|4|Good story that looks like a lot of money is being spent to produce.  There seemed to be a purpose in the beginning but I am being lost in the later episodes.  Still a good story.
B004MC8CA2|5|For my  morning Bible study this gives you a complete choice of Bible versions as well as having the option of audio!  Great choice for study at home or on the go.
B003OF3R0S|5|I Love this CD,  Almost every song on it gives me Chills when I listen to them,   I have played guitar for over 8 years and This is the most awesome sounding guitars that I have heard in my opinion.  I would reccomend this CD to ANYONE that likes Rock music of any type.  The only thing that I did not like about the CD was the song called \\"God Hates Us.\\" I was not real pleased with the name or the song. It is more Death Metal. (Not my type of Rock) Even though the song was awesome. If the title was different and it didnt talk about God hating us then I would have no problems at all with the CD.     My most favorite thing about the CD is that AX7 had the best intros on almost every song of this CD. I loved them and has to be the highlight of this album. just about ever song starts off slow and quiet, and  then all of a sudden...... BOOM, a crazy guitar and outrageously awesome double bass drums rattles your inner organs!!!!!!!!!!    awseoms CD, I have let three people borrow it already and they too have went out to buy it.     MUST HAVE CD!
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Great problem Solving game.
B0007TKNIS|4|on stage. But a very good and faithful rendition. With exception of being \\"mooned\\" it was up to par. The music was great and the acting was great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This is one of the best books I've read in a while!  Great story with a few predictable plots but a twist too!
B000OVLBGC|5|Even viewing this movie with subtitles, it is unforgettable.  Shocking and powerful.  It captures the dangers of the police state
B00D7JGL36|5|I bought this for my mom who loves old country music!  She plays it all the time.  Vocals are great and the steel guitar awesome.  Definitely would buy it again.
0399143904|1|This book really disappointed me.  I've read all of Clancy's stuff except  for his last couple and the Op-center series.  Since it has been so long  since his last one I was hoping this would be gripping.  It's not.  The  plot could easily have unfolded in 290 pages rather than 740.
B0064MPXFA|5|Awesome show, I can't stop watching it!
B002HJ9PTO|3|the pic piece is poor plastic, broke quickly as I tried to put it together, lost interest quickly. Use wireless instead and go to You Tube for alternatives on how to attach mic piece.
B000002L9M|4|\\"Black Celebration\\" sticks out as the gothic album of the Depeche Mode catalog. It's dark, melodic, ethereal and even upbeat on its down moods (A Question of Time). Ask any Depeche Mode fan what their favorite top 3 albums from this band are, and I guarantee you this one will be among the the three.
B0071XO8RA|5|I wonder how much lost sleep must be put to the account of this book!  I can certainly add to the hours on that one.  It is just so impossible to quit reading until you pass out.  The hard part then is getting up the next morning.  So my recommendation is to start this book in the morning on a vacation day so you can just read and read and get lost in this experience.<br /><br />I am going now to check out other books by this author.  If they are even half as good, I am be finding some more good reads. :)
B00HDMMISA|5|I really was not prepared for this book.  I thought it sounded like an interesting plot so I bought it on a whim.  Wow!  It was really good.....a real guessing book about what was going to happen at the end.  Strong, interesting characters and a flash forward/back style.  I really enjoyed the book and as a added positive thing the ending was so nice because many books just end and this one gave a follow-up to the ending.  In other words everything was explained and continued for another 10 pages to give the reader closure.  Would recommend it highly!
B002KQ6BT6|5|Just when I thought I had this book figured out out would throw me a new curve. It kept me up at night to get to the end. Anybody that has an interest in symbols masons and possibly true history should read this
B00FPH3YQA|3|The movie wasn't bad, but it just wasn't what i thought it would be. It has funny moments but i thought it would follow last ones, but it doesn't. Glad there's no more being made!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Creative hidden object game with multiple skill levels.  Also enjoy the various types of puzzles and the ability to play for free. Opening the new rooms and finding the new objects is also quite fun.
B0011UJMK2|5|I liked this book for it's look into Stalinist Russia and the effect of a repressive regime on its people. The plot was engaging, but the characters were very well developed. By the end of the book I'd come to really like and admire Leo and Raisa.  If it weren't for the price, I would have immediately purchased Agent 6 just to continue the friendship. But since I already have a backlog of books to read, I just put it on readeriq.com so I know when the price comes down.
B00DWZHTRW|5|Great movie, great business.
B004T2QZL8|1|I liked the game a lot until the forced close issues,  well forced me to uninstall it.  I hope someone reads the reviews and fixes this fun game.
B00005B36H|3|Almost everything I have read about this album would lead me to believe it is the equivalent of the Beatles White Album. But alas I find it does not really live up to the hype.Tool is certainly deserving of the accolades presented to them and Lateralus is better than any of the trite rubbish that currently infests the music industry. Perhaps this why I am left a little disapointed. There are scores of great moments but the songs as a whole seems to be the weakness of Lateralus. The Grudge is classic Tool but the ending measures dont seem to have a place in the song. The Patient starts off great but drifts off into a long ,dull movement that features an unappealing melody and far too much eratic, non-supportive drum overkill. Ticks and Leeches would be perfect if not for the completely unimpressive interlude that does nothing accept prompt me to skip to the next track. It feels so wrong to criticize one of the tightest and most genuine bands to come along in a while, but when I think of the perfection of Undertow I cant help but wonder what happened to well thought-out progressive rock songwriting they are capable of.
B00IRISI42|4|Excellent read!!! Lots of twists, turns and the unexpected.  Why only 4 stars? After all his sacrifices to his country, he should have got his girl! (At least once!)
B00DFFHUUA|4|This film was all about following the first version with equally entertaining scenes and it delivered on most fronts - I liked it.
B000MQC9H4|5|Perfect, loved the movie. In great condition, shipping was fast. Would order again definitely.
1451648537|5|A+ seller!
B0064MGU98|5|Addicting!
B00BATINVS|4|The book causes you to think.
0887431453|5|Very educational.  Easy for a preschooler.  Good practice.  Would reorder.
B004GCKRWY|5|This movie was great! I'm not going to be like other reviewers and tell you the plot of the story, because you probabLy already know if your looking at this. Anyway, this movie is very intense. The director, made the movie interesting by making one location different angles and such. GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|4|These puzzles are so beautiful and so relaxing. I love being able to take them with me everywhere and I never lose a piece!
B0070YDOT8|4|I like it It's fun.
B005CRQ2XA|4|This book will make you squirt milk out of your nose, it's very funny. But it's 4 stars because it could be better. But it's a kid named Greg who is a\\"wimp\\" and has to write in his diary, or journal. It is an LOL funny book, believe me on that.
B00N6PD3GE|5|The history of the Lusitania reads like a good novel.  I Eric Larson's writing style.  I can't wait to read his other books.
B008133MDK|5|Sherlock is the classic intellectual snob and it's great to see him solve crimes and overcome evil plots. Great if you love mystery and Sherlock.
B00023B1LC|5|i'm not normally a fan of the espionage/action genre but there is just too much to like about bourne identity. <br /> <br />the plot itself is excellent, with plenty of hairpin turns, suspense and surprise to engage. the ever-shifting european scenery adds another dimension. lastly, the strong performances all round, first & foremost by matt damon, make this a must-see.
B00LXLM05I|5|Fun game recommended
B00HHJPUFM|4|It was great, but I am puzzled. I though I did not have to pay for movies after I subscribed to Amazon Prime.
B007SGM084|5|Awesome!!!! I have to read this series again! These are the absolute best books I have ever read. It's so sad to be finished.
B00005JNTX|5|Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" is a bleak, foreboding cartoonish group of interlocking vignettes depicting the criminal element of corrupt Basin City.  The flick is stylishly filmed in predominantly black and white with occasional splashes of color to enhance the characters festooned against impressive computer generated backgrounds.  The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br /><br />Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.  The trouble is that Stahl is the son of corrupt Senator Roark, Powers Boothe and therefore protected.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, whose style fits like a glove in ultra violent movies, plays career criminal, the seemingly indestructible Marv.<br />He seeks to avenge the murder of a gorgeous hooker Goldie played by the attractive Jaime King.  Goldie was the only gal to ever pay the fierce looking Rourke, made up with facial and mandibular prostheses, any attention.  He goes on a killing spree that includes Elijah Wood, the cannibalistic murderer of his precious Goldie.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro star in another of the seemingly relentlessly violent stories.  Owen plays Dwight, the avenging angel of the gorgeous prostitutes of Oldtown.  The automatic weapon toting prostitutes represented by Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, and Alexis Bledel among others are allowed to govern their turf in a deal forged with the cops.  This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.  Owen helps the ladies quash the evidence that could topple the delicate balance that exists.<br /><br />Miller's slick transformation of his graphic novels to the screen using an impressive and formidible cast created a graphic yet highly entertaining movie experience.
B00D2PJQ96|4|A good solid effort from one of my favorite British bands. It may not be their best effort, but the songs are good with very little filler. If you liked Meds or Sleeping with Ghosts then this one is for you.
B000UOOT1W|5|All the selections are very good especially the alternate version of the song, \\"The Game of Love\\" by Tina Turner which is really special.
B005K17RU0|4|This app. is really pretty accurate compared to others I have used.
B001EC2ISA|5|This movie was always awesome when I was a kid beetle juice! Beetle juice!  Beetle juice!  Lol always funny to watch
B00EUGYM04|5|GREAT CD.  Has everything Seether has done so well.  Always a good CD to listen to no matter where you are or what you're doing.
B006VGGAC4|1|total waste of money , time, a very boring book and a waste of space on my e reader can I get my money back.. Full of fluff and nothing else.. If you must read it  get it free from your library or  better yet wait until it ends up at your nearest dollar store...
B00CW6DAKC|1|I play on my kindle and it needs to update and it won't let me now I'm stuck with I game I love but can't play help how can I update on my kindle please want to play game
B0049GYXDG|5|I haven't even gotten it yet so I'll post again when it gets here but this is my all time favorite movie and the price wasn't bad at all so preemptively I already am not disappointed lol
B008ALAHA4|5|Upgraded from an older 2008 MBPro so I have two extra power blocks.  Really wish I didn't need to buy this.  Disappointed in Apple.  However it works perfectly.
0810989956|5|Excellent.
B008AK8FHM|4|Very interesting getting a neurosurgeon's perspective. As one who recently went through a near death experience myself, I found his experience very similar!
B00BAXFACO|5|Really like this Mickey Haller series. Another good book. Kept my interest, as did the others in series.<br />Do not like his other books , though, with Harry Bosch.
B0071PS7AC|1|No matter where you position the ball, it hooks so sharply that it ends up in the gutter. There is no way to control the ball! Also, the game moves extremely slow with no way to skip all the computer stuff. Not recommended!
1419704400|5|Beautiful coffee table book.  High quality  binding and paper.  Saved money on Amazon. The photos are amazing! I highly recommend this magnificent book
B006K2WXOI|5|I LOVE this book!!!  We read it at school every year:)  It is so well made and the characters are so realistic.
B00018TI5E|5|this is john frusciante's best solo album to date. all of these songs are amazing in their own way. the one instrumental &quot;Failure33Object&quot; is insane. it so sad that so many people dont even know who he is. he is really good guitar player but an unbelievable song writer. if it was not for him the RHCP would still be the funk band they were in the 80's. if u do not have this album then you should then make sure u get it now! also look out...he will be releasing 6 other solo albums this year. this album is worth every penny!
B00E00C70C|5|Don't think twice just buy and enjoy this awesome product!!!
B009C7ZQM4|5|Tee doo lull Jane figure out what does this mean for the sorcerers and the sorcerers stone is up for cats and dogs are
B00IG2DOKM|4|This game is super addictive. Me and the kids love it
B0071XO8RA|5|I downloaded the first of these books for free when I first got my kindle, and I loved it, so my sister got me the omnibus for Christmas. It is a wonderfully written story that keeps you enthralled from beginning to end.
B00B8M4IMK|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Fit's nicely in my car without any bulk. Priced fairly for a well made charger.
B00HEK8JA2|5|I own everything Tina has ever released except  love songs.  this is an amazing collection of all our heads plus songs that have never been on compilation albums it is worth every cent. There really are no words of how incredible this is. The only thing I hate is she has not released some old classics or something that shows off her wonderful and soothing R&B sound. There is a CD that I just got. It NOSTALGIA by Annie Lennox. That's the kind of music I think Tina would excel. it would be something that we just haven't heard from her,I think it would be incredible.
B00001OH7O|5|This is Bowie at his musical best. At first I didn't like this album, but after a few listens I see these are some some of Bowie's best thought up lyrics. Though a less rocky album the music is beautiful. The piano and guitar are both great. Favorites include Changes, Oh! You Pretty Things, Life on Mars?, Kooks, Quicksand, Queen B***h, and Bewlay Brothers. Highly Recommended.
B009LMTDL0|4|As a young college graduate, Sheryl's words gave me confidence to pursue a dream career.  Her message was slightly repetitive but overall great advice. I like how she gives personal anecdotes about her life.
B00PTB7B34|5|This is way better than clash of  clans
0152023984|5|Everyone loves this book.  So there's no need to enter a review about the book.  It's great.  It arrived timely, and was in great shape.  I would recommend!
B004MC8CA2|1|well its the holy Bible shouldn't it be.free to everyone to use without having to have ur.info.?????

IF U WANT TO READ HE HOLY BIBLE GO GET ONE AT HASTINGS&reg; OR SOMETHING PLUS THEY MAKE ONES.THAT R WAY SMALLER THAN A KINDLE
B009T3AHDE|4|To say that COSMOPOLIS isn't for everyone doesn't quite capture it.  This is a film whose plot, such as it is, basically hinges around the value of Chinese currency.  Its central character, young businessman Eric Packer, spends most of the movie in his limo, on his quest across New York City in order to get a haircut that he doesn't really need.<br /><br />In other words: Robert Pattinson's legions of TWILIGHT fans should steer clear.  Not that they will.<br /><br />As far as Pattinson goes, he's aptly cast.  He's able to radiate an emotional detachment, even when he's conveying a sense of ironic enjoyment at the downturn events are taking.  (The best comparison I can think of is Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX: an actor who, talent or lack thereof aside, was perfect for the part; that being said, Pattinson actually does have some acting talent up his sleeve, and shows it here.)  The supporting cast--featuring Jay Baruchel, Sarah Gadon, Samantha Morton, Juliette Binoche, Mathieu Amalric, Paul Giamatti, and others--rotates in and out, each shining in their own, Cronenberg-influenced way.<br /><br />This is definitely David Cronenberg's film; in fact, it's the first film in years that feels reminiscent of the Cronenberg of the 70s and 80s.  He takes Dom DeLillo's basically unfilmable little novel and translates it beautifully to the screen.  The film founders a bit in spots (it's a tad too long for such an intimate, moral story), and comes off as too didactic in other spots.  Of course, that's the point; there's rarely anything subtle about a Cronenberg film, and COSMOPOLIS is a shining example.  It's certainly not for everyone; but for those who dare to enter Cronenberg's devious imagination, there's a real treat to be found here.
B0051ANPZQ|4|the author used a terrible library of adjectives and used yelled and yelling way too much. i suggest that if you read this, try not to pay too much attention to the adjectives.
031606792X|3|I will say the book was one of the weakest of the series, Meyer sort of dug Bella into a hole in the first 3 books and then it was easy-peasy to bring her back out again.    SPOILER    I am a sucker for happy endings, and was glad to see everything resolved and have them all happy, but there was no epic battle or real conflict in it at all! I had higher expectations for it, and it didn't even hold my attention towards the end before the Volturi came.  Overall, it was good, but it didn't live up to its potential.  Oh yeah, I don't have my own amazon account and I'm not making one just to do this review. Just so I don't embarass my dad, this isn't George ha.
B00E8KLWB4|1|I have not yet figured out what the goal of the game is. I don't know what I'm doing or why!  Directions would be nice at the outset.
B00E5Q1LTY|1|This movie was perhaps one of the most awful Star Trek I've seen to date.<br />The plot written by a fourth grader.<br />The acting goes back to 1970's.<br />Nothing new in visual effect.<br />Overall it looks like somebody put together the cut out pieces of previous episodes and dubbed them anew.<br />Too bad there is no choice in giving a star which this movie doesn't deserve.
B009UX2YAC|5|Awesome game !!!!!!!!!!
B002PEP4SC|4|What a hoot! I stumbled on this book, and laughed my way through it. Love Fillion, but can't manage to watch the Castle program, after trying the first three or four.  This book is precisely what I would see his character writing. Clever, clever girls and boys...
0061191752|5|This book show you the real Gordon!  His background, rise to fame & current life.<br />The man is charming, witty, and loving.  If you have ever watched any of his shows,<br />this is a must read!
B006O5YHUY|5|Awesome movie!!!  I don't even like MMA, but the story kept me hooked until the end.
B0049J2BSM|4|Looking for a movie that wasn't too serious or sad (Lion King? NO WAY) and this was great.  For a sensitive kid it was great.
038574126X|5|Wow, loved it. Wow, read it, enjoy it, savor it and then read it again!!
1416523359|1|You know how when one of your friends is dating someone and they use baby talk with each other and it makes you throw up a little in your mouth?  Yeah, this book is kinda like that.  I'm not even done with it yet, but I had to come on here to see if people found it as annoying as me.  I will finish it, if only because I spent a smucking $9.99 on it.    I've been reading Steven King since Carrie, and I buy each book hopefully, but I have found myself more disappointed than not for the past 10 years.  His books sell because his early stuff was genius, not because his current stuff is even average.  Over-priced and over-hyped; this might be the last one I buy.
B0000013GT|5|nice

B001BTG3OQ|1|My first pro use of this speedlight was very disappointing. I was shooting a dance gig with this speedlight combined with the SD 9 battery pack and it cut out early in the shoot. Very glad it was not a wedding!    I replaced the SB900 with my SB 800 and it shot for hours without a problem.    There is a problem with the SB 900.    I do not recommend the SB 900 until nikon fix up this serious flaw.    Cheers  Ron
B0053O89JM|5|Still the best entertainment with witty, intelligent and quick points. Though more and more doors seems shot new events takes speed and entertainment continues.
B009ZQNN90|5|We were really busy when this came out...so we were thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime. Very fun movie and very well done. Now understand where the Broadway show came from.

B00FAPF5U0|4|v<br />Very fun to play but can be frustrating sometimes.<br />Still very good. Really makes you use your grey matter.
B00BN2NY48|2|A very strange and weird movie.
B0064X7FVE|1|The old app was easy to check back forth between cities. This one ..... NOT! Why the made these changes beats me. It's frustrating to use. )
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great series. It's addicting from the very beginning.
B00447RA9Y|5|Simply an amazing soundtrack, even better on vinyl if you have a record player! Makes for a great gift for any movie/music lover.
B00B2QG3K2|5|well, according to Amazon's rate rules, I have to say a bit more, but Paramore is the absolute BEST band out there, in fact this album was rated #1 on the Billboard 200 list in April 2013 with over 106,422 sales!!!!!!!
1419707663|5|It's all about life in a kids<br />Eye and it speaks to me and that's why this is a great book
B00H58VGIA|5|Couldn't put the book down . Good insight into the south at the time of slavery . All the characters were interesting , and liked the way it switched from the thoughts of the two main characters .  A extremely well written book, with a thought provoking ending .
B008XG1X18|5|I Love it, easy to use, you can follow/pin things you love, it's great.
B007AFB868|5|I've never before written a review of what I watch on Amazon Prime but I had to do so now because this film was SO much better than I was expecting and now I'm sorry I never got to see it in a theater.  When it came out it got mixed but mostly positive reviews and I just never found the time to see it before it quickly disappeared.  To be perfectly honest, too, part of me suspected that many of its supporters lauded it  partly in the spirit of a well-intentioned political correctness.  I came of age in the 1980's-90's when identity politics was rampant and Frida Kahlo was a triple-crown hero of the downtrodden so I was more than a bit suspicious:  Latina, female and physically handicapped, she was practically a secular saint of humanities departments world-wide.<br /><br />In reality, the movie got short shrift by critics as well as audiences.  There are only excellent performances throughout but Salma Hayek's performance was incredible.  I was particularly impressed--but hardly surprised--by Julie Taymor's visually rich, psychologically precise direction.  In a movie about an artist it's somewhat expected that the work must be related to the events of the person's life but this film does it as well or better than anything I have seen since &#34;Andrey Rublev,&#34; and that is some very fine cinematic company, indeed.<br /><br />It obviously wasn't a big budget picture but they seemed to squeeze a lot of juice out of those oranges.  Music, production design, locations, costumes--everything--was excellent.  Highest recommendation.
B00E9A656K|5|GIFT FOR MY GRANDBABY WHO IS 8 YEARS OLD.  I THINK IT IS NICE HE IS A BOY AND HE LIKES IT
B000EULJLU|5|This was a Christmas gift to a 17-year-old grandson, who is a member of a new band, and a marvelous guitar player. He collects music CD's by certain bands and groups that he prefers. He is very careful about the music he selects. He is also writing some music at this time.
B000M341RI|5|The sound track really enhances this film. Glad to hear it received such great recognition! The British accents are a bit &#34;thick&#34; at times so it warrants another viewing.
B000ICKPOQ|5|We are huge fans of space opera and enjoyed the original SG series but always found it a little campy.<br /><br />However we thought that both SG Atlantis  & SG Universe got the balance and tenor of a serious space opera exactly right. We are still in mourning over the cancellation of the SG Universe movie.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good solid science fiction, great cast. If you like space opera you will love SG: Atlantis.
0525953728|4|An interesting account of how the most hated man in the world was brought to justice by the USA. Well done.<br />May OBL rot in hell along with his infamous followers.
B000FC1MCS|5|This book is well written and makes you think about those with disabilities.  easy to read.  recommended for any age reader.
B00CH26TL8|3|Fun game, but higher levels are almost impossible to beat without paying for cheats. If you don't mind paying for cheats as the levels get higher, you will probably enjoy this game.
B00CO6QGCE|2|Although the free version is somewhat capable it's disappointing how expensive it is to get a few features.  If you want to buy the lowest 'package' deal that comes with pre CUEing your track it's nearly $50.  That is ridiculous and should be around $15.  To compare the completely fully functional including a ton more features than this, Traktor for the iPad is $20.  To get similar features out of this app you'd have to pay nearly $100!
B004ZRV3AU|3|Maybe, as in life, I just suck at this.
B009X2CRMK|5|So many twists and turns through 3 generations.  Absolutely riveting right to the end. Happy and sad at the same time.
B00BEXB18M|5|I own all the Megadeth albums and the worst album is the System has Failed. That album just horrible.  Super Collider is superior to all the other albums. Super Collider is an amazing collection of music and Megadeth proves yet again why they are better than Metallica.  Don't get me wrong, I like Metallica, but Megadeth is superior and Super Collider is better than I expected.
B009TGVUPA|5|A great film and one of the best horror films ever. It rewards you with every viewing. The small complaint is the mid quality cgi but otherwise it is flawless and honest and harrowing.
B003IWZ1D8|5|****THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE BLU RAY EDITION****  This film is one of my all time favorites of Alfred Hitchcock. This has to be the best black and white film i have seen on Blu ray so far. The quality is phenomenal! In the scene where Marion is driving her car in the rain, i actually had the sensory reaction to be worried about getting wet! I am so glad i updated to Blu ray on this one. Some films on Blu ray are disappointing...not this one!
B00K6D1FZU|5|JUDAS DOES IT LOUD AND PROUD, AND CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT
B0000E1ALR|5|Greatest Hits albums are going to be a blessing and a curse in every situation. They are of course a blessing because you get great songs, often the cream, on one or two discs -- very convenient for your car CD player, for example.<br />Of course, by getting a Greatest Hits album you are only getting the most popular, not necessarily the best, songs. And with Springsteen, if all you ever bought and listened to was this record it would be a damned shame, because there has been no other single artist in the past 30 years with as deep a catalogue of songs. <BR>In fact, because Springsteen's albums are each so rich and lacking in duds, one can certainly question the wisdom of a Greatest Hits album. There is a certain assumption behind hits compilations that they allow you to avoid the dreck that populates 80 percent of the songs that record companies do not release as singles -- a problem that Springsteen does not have.<br />But for a casual fan or a serious Springsteen follower who wants two discs full of hits (and a bonus disc) to go along with the rest of their collection, this does the trick.
B0025WUK1U|5|Twelve years after Jeff Buckley's death, we are still presented with new items. Here we have a disk of live performances, both in DVD and CD form. The performances are tremendous as always, and it is interesting to see the camera movement in the MTV recordings, and the evil eyes Jeff gives them. Vancouver is always a pleasure to hear live because it was in the beginning stages at the time the band was touring; it turned into a gorgeous song. The \\"Star Tours\\" segment and Merri Cyr's interview are fabulous (albiet short) clips that showcase Jeff's sense of humor and sense of frustration with fame.<br /><br />Also included is a documentary called Amazing Grace made by a few fans. It is about Jeff's legacy through his fans, which runs the gamut of unknown painters and musicians to big names and friends. There are some really insightful comments about Jeff in the documentary, about his music and his own soul, why his music is so important to artists, and what he has inspired.<br /><br />The set also includes some cute little additions, like postcards, a copy of a backstage pass, Jeff's boarding pass, and a two-sided poster.<br /><br />Jeff lives and breathes through his music, and sets like this prolong his memory. It is truly beautiful.
B000ATQYT2|5|Not sure how you could ever go wrong with The Muppets.  My boyfriend has always been a huge fan and this was a gift for him.
B00008NG5V|4|I rated Jack Johnson's first album here not long after it came out and said that I was impressed by his ability to execute his songs lyrically and musically while still being original and interesting. When an album like 'brushfire fairytales' comes along and you listen to it, it's a good bet from (other) past experience that the follow-up will fall flat, overwhelmed by studios and producers.<br />Not so.<br />Jack Johnson is the man I would chose to be if I were a musician. He keeps getting it right, seems to be doing it on his own terms and keeps making music that is worth listening to on all levels. The album 'On and On' picks up where the other left off, moving forward with more gentle music that gives a wink and nod at the previous one but then leaves all other similarities behind. The songs are well crafted and well executed, from the happy-go-lucky 'horizon has been defeated' to the more sincere (somber) tones of 'traffic in the sky', this album is worth the listen. The only song that I would ever complain about is the song that I seem to find myself skipping on every listen: Taylor, which seems to be something that the artist shuffled his way through when making. Other than that, tracks like 'Rodeo Clowns' (originally found on a G Love and Special Sauce album, and the song that helped Jack Johnson launch himself- appearing here acousticly) and 'Mediocre Bad Guys' are instantly likeable listening.<br />Bottom Line: Get this one, you'll love it and love yourself for being so nice to your ears.
B00BAXFECK|5|marvelous read
B008Y2FRFO|5|if u are in a very very very long car ride this app is perfect for u it is very addicting!
B000056VPD|5|I must say that I'm also one of the many fans who have waited for nearly twenty years for a &quot;Benson&quot; Video and this Video was worth the long wait.But I geuss everybody can have their own opinion about a certain artist.George Benson is truly blessed, he does'nt even have to play the guitar - he can just sing and still teach hundreds of professional singers a trick or two.He is from the old school and has proovin' himself worthy of doing several albums with such greats like &quot;Quincy Jones&quot; and &quot;Tommy Lipuma&quot;. As for those negative reviewers please understand that a lot of people come to hear Benson sing and play the guitar,you can not expect him to play solos the whole evening,do a moonwalk and spin on his back.Most of the serious musicians don't have time to sit with the camera crew and explain when they gonna smile or who's gonna take a solo next,they always try and iteract with the band or the audience that's live music. We are music lovers and not a circus audience if you want action then you should buy Michael Jackson,Britney Spears or N'Sync etc...because George Benson does not have to pretend in front of the cameras.You must know that a lot of these great artists have only been fortunate to make videos towards their early sixties like James Brown and B.B.KING'S latest Videos where you get less movements and more music.I see nothing wrong with the &quot;Absolute Benson&quot; DVD the sound and picture qaulity is great.This might be the last G.B Video from this great musician to all his fans worlwide buy it now.
B00NZIIPBU|1|Nothing like the real thing.
B009FZFONO|5|This is non stop action and the plot is not predictable.  I love the characters.  Can't wait to see what happens next.
B006LSZECO|4|This Book took me nearly half its read to hook me.  The 2nd half however, I couldn't put down !!
B0054TKAZW|4|I'm an original 80s guy and grew up with the old. Now with children my daughter and I watch this together.  It's not the movie. The show is very well written and the characters can grow.  The FX are very well done.  Tastefully not grotesque.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural story lines.
B0055V6EZE|5|I had the fortune of discovering this album while out at Target.  Having been a fan of Hugh Laurie for many years, I've been aware of his singing/piano talent for some time, and I was curious to see what he would have to offer in this album.<br /><br />This album is, straight up, a love letter to both blues and popular Louisiana tunes.  Laurie's enthusiasm for the subject matter is evident in every note played and every lyric sung.  As a native of Louisiana, I can honestly say that it blows my mind for an Englishman to have more soul than some of the singers found in the bars on Bourbon Street.  But then again, this is also just another reason why Hugh Laurie rocks.  He's never made any secret of his love for good music and his own pursuits in sharing it with the rest of the world.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, I can't even say that I have a favorite on the album so far.  Every track is good, plain and simple.  However, I did realize that I had a winner in terms of purchase when Laurie's vocals begin for \\"St. James Infirmary.\\"  The piano intro is undoubtedly good, but it was the opening vocals that let me know that I had made a good purchase.  Everything about this album is true to form.<br /><br />If you are a fan of good blues and piano, this album is a must-have.  I look forward to buying more of Laurie's work in the near future.
B009NPKTN6|4|I thought it was good. Sometimes silly but the music was good. The actors and very impressive
B00B7FOQCK|5|I've only had this product for a few weeks. My initial thoughts:<br /><br />1) Excellent build quality<br />2) Works exactly as advertised<br /><br />I plan to purchase another, and I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B009EEFTMC|5|I play This game all Night. Its very challenging and well put together. It would be great to have more games similar to This. Love this game!
B00BPDR3F6|5|Elizabeth Gilbert weaves an engrossing tale of a unique woman.  The characters are well developed and the story is full of interesting information.  If you like historical novels you will love it.
B002VPE1WK|5|excellent quality and very well made. This camera backpack can easily hold two full size DSLR cameras and a few extra lenses, a mini tripod can be subject to the outside. What you want here is for your particular needs, you can become it. The main section of the backpack is configured into 9 separate compartments. However, these compartments (slightly padded BTW) are fastened with Velcro, so you can set inside the backpack into anything it would take to. You can even remove all the compartments if you want and use it as a regular backpack
1932907009|5|The humore also helps for ease in reading a book. My friend said this has been very helpful to his career.
B00AREIAI8|5|It was so much fun! I love horses so this was a great game for me and if you love horses you would love it!
B001200OFS|5|Excellent
0440237688|4|My daughter loves it
B00070Q7VO|5|More favorites from Michael.  Sooo easy to listen to and selections take me back to times when young people actually danced together...not like today...doing their &#34;own thing&#34;.
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Controls are touchy, there's a lot of flying but it's fun as hell! All if the suits are available, including War Machine!
B00A2AHU2E|4|Pretty good, but you have to buy on to the improbable idea that a professional killer takes on a 12-year old, or so, apprentice!
B0086HGW42|5|I have been a fan of Ed for a while now, but I just recently purchased this album. He is amazing!
0140544518|5|great gift
B00I6IKSZ0|5|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best game ever I recommend it to every body please get this game you will not regret it .
B00005JNJV|5|As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot.  While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others.  You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place.  Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great.  The whole movie had fantastic casting.  Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen.  I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.
B007J4T2G8|5|This book is so good, words can't even describe how good it is. Every time I would read it, I would picture what's going on and just giggle or jump up and down. It's an amazing book even though it's twisted at some points.
B007IXWL2C|5|I looked this book I read all three books in four weeks .. I can't wait for the movies to come out hopefully the rumor is true (:
B001NTZDMC|5|Fabulous Album
B00K5M19XA|5|Have been a fan of DC and Marvel for most of my life.  Kids wanted to watch this.  Not all anime keep my attention, some just don't cut it.  This was jsust as good as watching a full feature film.  Good story, good action.  Nice to add to a collection if you have one.
B000055Y0X|5|Is war fate? Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb was was directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. This famous directors philosophical nuance shines bright and this one is most certainly a classic. This film is pretty simple really. It's also awesome, thought provoking, and one of a kind. It's a black comedy about the horrors of nuclear combat. If I had to call it something, it would be Vonnegutesque. The film opens with a questionable red alert. It appears as if the U.S. is under some sort of attack. But is it true? What kind of attack is going on? Next you see a U.S. war plane receive a nuclear attack code.<br />It appears as if its go time for the American war planes to drop nuclear bombs on Russia. The unfortunate truth is that the attack was actually ordered by a delusional United States Air Force general.  The general comically (depending on how you see things) believes the communists are secretly polluting American bodily fluids. The reasoning behind this accusation is surprisingly never clearly explained. This key storyline angle makes the film highly relevant today considering the wide range of abstract conspiracy theories embedded in the American culture.  The United States President is faced with the serious challenge of halting the nuclear air strike while the doomsday clock winds down. It turns out that the bureaucratic nature of the military is the Presidents greatest hurdle to solving the problem.<br />The complexity of the situation drives the President to seek consul from a questionable individual named Dr. Strangelove.  Dr. Strangelove is very strange indeed. He doesn't come up with an answer to the immediate problem but he does come up with a plan for the future. For some, this film is hilarious. For others, it's probably terrifying.  The humor is drenched in paranoia and it stands up very well today. The lead (playing three different roles) is the late great Peter Sellers. Dr. Strangelove is certainly a tour de force on a number of different levels. This film will continue to motivate you to question the world around you, and laugh very hard while you do so.a tour de force on a number of different levels. This film will continue to motivate you to question the world around you, and laugh very hard while you do so.
