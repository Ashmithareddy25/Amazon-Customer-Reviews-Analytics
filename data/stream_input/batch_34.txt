0784011605|5.0|Such a passionated film, after watching it for four times, I still feel there is more to know about this story. The four characters approach differently towards falling in love and loyalty.  I viewed the piano as  Ada's old lover, and she had been trapped into this old relationship for a  long long time. By knowing Baines, she was able to fall in love again, and  finally, her old emotions and passions  just sunk with the  piano into the  deep ocean.
078322804X|5.0|Hats off to the makers of this DVD..Great picture and most of all excellent sound quality.The added scenes are great too..Elwood quits his job?? Who knew he even had a job, until this dvd came out. Highly  recommended...Outstanding!!
0380796090|5.0|Claire is me in a very similar situation!  After the initial fog - the climb back up to reality was NOT without it's humorous moments!<br />I'm happy that the friend who turned me on to this author is able to have her books  shipped to her from Ireland - &quot;Lucy Sullivan&quot; is JUST as  enchanting, and &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is said to be the funniest one  of the bunch!!
B00000J8EK|4.0|While DYOH was full of driving beats and textured rhythms, for as excellent as it is, it is a very shiny, polished and clean album with some tracks being overproduced till they feel hollow.  On Surrender, the  Brothers seem to literally surrender the notions of overdubbing and  sampling and have produced an album that is stripped down and less precise  and calculated as previous efforts.  While it is being called  retro-electronic, it represents the acknowledgement that the music has no  choice but to go in a different direction, and has a freshness, a depth,  and a feeling that is vacant in alot of this style.  The reason it gets  only four stars, is that the guest appearances are getting a little tired -  to have Noel Gallagher on the same track number two albums in a row, even.   It is a great record, and makes me look forward to what's next.

B000002LKF|5.0|I enjoyed this album very much and even more so after reading about Uakti and Olodum (who participated on the album) in &quot;The Brazilian Sound,&quot; also purchased on Amazon.com. Understanding the musical  influences adds to the appreciation.
B000002L42|2.0|Don't waste your money on a mediocre live album when there are so many better ones. Everyone who reads this should buy Royal Scam at once.
1573226521|5.0|Deserving of cult status already , I'm sure in time this read will become one the last great classics to be produced this century. In the book I found myself unravelling a great yearning to be on this island sharing the  experiences of a lifetime with the characters I'd come to know so well.  Like a fine bottle of wine I even became selective about where I chose to  read it and finished it one hot balmy day beside a lonely path adjacent to  a desrted pond watching a kingfisher explore his own version of Eden. Great  memories , thanks Alex.
B000002ADT|5.0|Everyone must own this album, doesn't matter if jazz doesn't like too much.
0345404475|2.0|I wont compare Do Androids Dream of Electic Sheep with Blade Runner - previous reviewers have covered it all.  I read the book with an open mind, trying to forget the movie, which I love.  Taken on it's own merit, the  book sorely disappointed.  <br />Written in the 60's, it's a great,  imaginative peek into the future with hovercrafts, empathy machines and  videophones.  It's odd that as much vision as Dick has about technology,  his women of the future remain secretaries and house fraus.<br />Dick is not a  classic novelist as some have called him.  His dialog is stilted many of  the scenes are dis-jointed.  I dropped the book in horror and disgust at  the following:<br />(Rick Deckard has the android who already injured his  partner in his hovercraft.  The android is posing as another bounty hunter  from Moscow, Rick figures it out)<br />&quot;... you're Polokov, the android;   you're not from the Soviet police.&quot; Rick, with his toe, pressed the  emergency button on the floor of his car.<br />&quot;Why won't my laser tube  fire?&quot; Kadalyi-Polokov said, switching on and off the miniaturized  triggering and aiming device which he helf in the palm of his  hand.<br />&quot;A sine wave,&quot; Rick said &quot;That phases out laser  emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light.&quot;<br />&quot;Then I'll  have to break your pencil neck.&quot;...<br />uh huh.  Shut up and kill each  other? Dick has told us already that the androids lack certain human  emotion, but, sheesh.  &quot;Why wont my laser tube fire?,&quot; is just  plain bad dialog.<br />There's better sci-fi out there, and it's not too hard  to find.  Throw you non-functional laser pen in any book store's sci-fi  section and you are bound to hit one.
0671027344|5.0|I really recommend this book!!! I'm fifteen and I don't usually spend much time reading. I saw this book on a comercial on MTV, so I thought I'd check it out. The night I got it I only put it down once. (Dinner) I read through  the night.<br />It reminded me of when I was shy, and it made me be thankful  for my family and friends. I don't know why, that's just what I got from  it. You should definatly read it!
B000009ED0|1.0|Granted, there are those that are sick with the current hip-hop sounds as of late ( i.e., No limit, Jay-Z, DMX, etc. ). But then again, that is the &quot;mainstream&quot;, and anybody who's got an ear to the underground  would know that the &quot;real&quot; is going strong ( Blackalicious,  Company Flow, Black Star, etc. )  Kid Rock does not add to HIP-HOP for he  ain't HIP-HOP. Anybody who thinks so is kidding himself or herself. Kid  Rock is nothing but a faddish marketing figure who infuses rap and rock,  and doesn't even do a decent job of it. If you want some decent bands who  at least have some artistic value go listen to some Rage Against the  Machine or some KORN.
B000002LQR|4.0|One of the best example of the Red Hot Chili Pepppers, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; is one of the most superb recordings of funky, head pounding, body moving music with Flea's flying slapp bass, John's original  guitar (not the standard power chord after power chord), and Anthony  Keidis's meaningful and soulful lyrics.  All of these elements mold  together to create an essential CD to have, which includes the songs  &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Give it Away&quot;, and my favorite  &quot;suck my Kiss&quot; amoung many, many other great songs.
0790736942|5.0|1973's &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is one of the best movies I've ever viewed. I read the book, and the movie does a beautiful justice to it. However, I must say that the most haunting character to me wasn't little  Regan, but Father Karras. Jason Miller puts in an excellent performance as  the troubled Jesuit priest. Also, if you get the chance, read the sequel by  Blatty, &quot;Legion&quot;. I think &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; was based  upon it, and it a very good follow-up to the original book. Excellent  acting all around, smashing special effects and stunts, and a terrifying  storyline make this a must for any film buff.  P.S. Look for the  superimposed images on Regan's face during the exorcism.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is a complete package of metal. &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; is a great speed-metal track. &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is very majestic in its sound. &quot;Creeping Death&quot; has  incredible riffing and a great, fist-pumping chanting part. And &quot;Fade  to Black&quot; is the best non-cheesy power ballad since &quot;Stairway to  Heaven.&quot; While Load and Re-Load weren't that bad, Ride the Lightning  is Metallica's best overall album.
B000002UR7|4.0|Alas Pablo Honey isn't earmarked for greatness. I actually rather like the ablum but it simply isn't as good as its two successors &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer.&quot; The songs are fine, but none of  them really stand out. Creep is (in my opinion) highly overrated, and quite  inferior to most of the tracks on later Radiohead releases.I reccomend this  album to any fan who has the two later CDs and wants a complete collection  of the bands work. If you've never gotten anything by Radiohead before I'd  strongly recommend starting with &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK  Computer.&quot;

B00000IFP6|5.0|These performances have the benefit of the latest research into the Beethoven manuscripts, and have the benefit of superlative performances which, though often significantly faster than typical ones, do not  sacrifice detail and seem, once the new tempo parameters have been  assimilated, to be exciting and yet perfectly natural. The battle of  Beethoven tempi will doubtless continue to be waged, but these performances  are thoughtprovoking and completely convincing.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm a big Led Zeppelin fan. Every song on this CD is my favorite song on the CD. Try a rocking &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot; and a quiet &quot;Battle Of Evermore&quot;. No wonder this has sold over 17 million  copies. This could be an alltime seller in the future.
B000005J56|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the melody, easy rhythm and sometimes hilarious lyrics of these unpretentious musicians.  Buy this and broaden your cultural horizons.
B000009DUY|4.0|This is great music,but it can't compete with JFK and the music from Sugarland Express.I am yearning for a Sugarland Express Soundtrack to be released because it's the best filmmusic John Williams has written.Many of  the tracks on Saving Private Ryan are similar to each other that's why it  only get's 4 stars. But if you like John Williams music don't hesitate buy  this soundtrack!
0425152251|5.0|...and I read it about about 3 years ago, but finally gettingaround to post my 5 stars...stick with it and you'll be amazed as youget into the book.
B000001FA4|5.0|Although this album has less visibility than The Joshua Tree or War, it is their equal in what I consider the most outstanding string of rock albums ever released.  It is exquisitely moody and passionate: fantastic  throughout.  If pressed, my highlights are &quot;Bad,&quot; and &quot;Elvis  Presley and America,&quot; with its hauntingly expressive vocals (which I  never was able to, or even cared to make out).
B000003S0R|5.0|It is hard for me to review Tiger Mountain without resorting to the most fawning, gushing language of which fandom is capable. I will attempt here to be a bit restrained and objective, but the plain fact is that if some  supremely evil dictator decreed tomorrow that no citizen could own more  than a single CD, I would choose this one as my lifelong companion: It has  beauty, excitement, charm, sensuality, intelligence, and -- oh yes, by the  way -- mystery.<br />Tiger Mountain is Eno's magnum opus. Though Another Green  World is probably his stylistic apex, that work lacks Tiger's emotional  highs and overall resonance and energy. Though his first solo album  redefined what popular music could be, this one puts the polish on that  initial redefinition.<br />From apoplectic onset of Burning Airlines, one is  seduced into a blurry Wonderland of connotation and denotation, meaning and  nonsense, wakefulness, dreams and nightmares, where one becomes complicit  in one's own confusion until the slow polar sweep of the title track fades  out. Is this music or drug addiction?<br />Eno's mastery of sonic texture is  never more apparent; his alchemical blending of timbres both traditional  and novel never more glittering. Having once heard the counterpoint of  Robert Wyatt's innocent falsetto and Portsmouth Sinfonia's sweetly off-key  cadences, is it possible either to forget Put A Straw Under Baby or to  imagine the song scored in any other fashion? <br />The redolence and wit of  the lyrics as well is unsurpassed, invoking a broad nexus of meanings  without enforcing any one in particular. Despite their restive refusal to  be pinned down, the words are often startlingly memorable. For instance, it  is delightful if profitless to speculate upon what piety may be contained  in: &quot;There's a brain in the table/There's a heart in the chair/And  they all live in Jesus/It's a family affair.&quot;<br />Released in 1974,  Tiger Mountain has aged well. Twenty-five years later, this creative and  influential rock endeavor does not show any signs of staleness. On repeated  listenings, new surprises continue to well up from its depths. What more  could one ask of any long-term relationship?
0790729601|4.0|I missed this movie when shown on the big screen. I'm so glad they have them on DVD and I've got my copy to keep. Arnold is truly great!
B00000JGOH|4.0|Sorry to disagree, but I thought the part of Shakespeare, and Joseph Fiennes who played it were a weak element in an otherwise enjoyable film. I agree that Rupert Everett would have made a better Shakespeare.
B00000163G|5.0|You could feel his anger on almost all his songs.  And that's what makes, it so raw, originial and, overall, REAL!!  He was the realest artist I ever heard.  Just listen to his interviews.  There will never be another Pac,  RIP.
0684857820|5.0|Sebold's wrenching story is told with such wit and style that it's hard for the reader to remember that it's a true story and not a great work of fiction.  It is not just one woman's story, but also a searing commentary  on a society that chooses to ignore rape and its consequences all too  often.  A handbook for any woman who has been assaulted and asks &quot;now  what?&quot; I'd suggest it for every first-year law student and every  18-year-old heading off for college.
B0000039QA|4.0|This is one of the best double cds I've ever heard period!!!!  Biggie speaks some truth on songs like &quot;Mo Money Mo Problems&quot; and &quot;Ten Crack Commandments.&quot;  All true rap heads should go get this  one.  RIP Biggie!!!
0780622553|4.0|The most common criticism of this film is that the characters are shallow. OF COURSE they're shallow. They have no past. Not one that informs their being in any meaningful way. Taking that as a given, the film is an  imaginative effort worth applauding.
B000001Y16|4.0|This album would stand the test of time, but it's obvious that it's not one of his best, mainly because this was released a short time after his death.  But it's better than most rap albums out there.
0517122707|5.0|Hilarious, witty, and overwhelmingly enjoyable.  THe characters and situations in this novel grabbed me, seduced me and won't let me go.  I loved New Orleans before I read this and now I love it even more!
0201485672|5.0|I simply can't say enough good things about this book.  I've been promoting the process of refactoring for a long time, but I never had a reference to provide authoritative support.  This book provides that and a  whole lot more.<br />By providing a concrete process and a wonderful set of  examples that show how to turn mediocre code into great code this book can  change the way people program.  Considering how many mediocre Java programs  are being written today, this book couldn't have arrived at a better  time.<br />One thing to emphasize is how important the chapter on JUnit is.  Martin provides a firm foundation for refactoring by insisting that it  always be done in the context of a complete set of tests.  I've already  recommended both the book and the framework to my consulting clients, and  will continue to do so.  Thanks Martin!
6305263248|4.0|Ronin is the best government intelligence film of the year.  The reading the back of the film cover is just not enough.  It'll leave you in the dark.  After watching it everything will come together.  The car chase  scene is unbelievable as it takes place in the narrow streets of Europe.   De Niro is perfect for his role.  A CIA agent who joins the group of thugs  since there is no work for him in the agency.  This movie is almost similar  to Mission Impossible, only De Niro would kick Ethan Hunt's ass any day,  twice on weekends.
B00000DBXL|5.0|I have just returned from the free Cake concert in Boston.  I loved the show.  The trumpet is everything to this band.  It adds a nice unique touch.  This is a great band and i suggest you all buy this cd.  The songs  grow on you.
0767802659|5.0|This is what happens when producers get a good script, give it to a good director and leave him alone. Paul Verhoeven has given us cutting edge film since his Arthurian &quot;The Blood of Heros&quot;. An edgy, bloody tale  from a villain's point of view, it rocks your view of that age.  &quot;Robocop&quot; threw us full steam ahead into the next century but  with a touch of ironic satire. &quot;Total Recall&quot; was much the same  but instead of Frankenstein/Judge Dredd, we saw an intergalactic spy story.  Now &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; continues the tradition taking a piece  from all of these to create a space-age vietnam story. When James Cameron  heard that this film was being made he said &quot;I already made that  movie.&quot;. Well certainly the epic book was a major inspiration for  &quot;Aliens&quot;, but ST is it's own animal. It has it's own morales,  archetypes and role models. A special effects extraveganza, we follow the  life of Johnny Rico who enters the service to be closer to his girlfriend.  Sound familiar &quot;Space: Above and beyond&quot; fans? It should. Through  the course of boot camp and a normandy style invasion of the alien planet,  Johnny loses and gains friends. The experience makes him strong, and we see  him grow into a man who gives orders instead of takes them. I think the  timing of it's release is the only explanation for it's underperformance at  the box office. The DVD itself is excellent. It includes many goodies that  take you deeper into the ST universe than just the film itself. Don't miss  out on this truly fantastic film
B00000JMG7|5.0|Haven't got mine yet but I know it's great, after all it's Rory
B00000JGOH|5.0|We received a DVD version of this movie two days ago... We got to watch it last night.  I cried... It was so touching and entertaining. And I know, without a doubt, who should have received the Best Actor Award!  What a  crime for not recognizing the exceptional work of Mr. Fiennes.
6302800897|5.0|This movie boasts both an outstanding (and true) plot that holds your attention and an all-star cast. Though filmed in the 1950s, the movie is still entertaining. I highly recommend the film.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Dolphy's only album on Blue Note as a leader is as good as one could ever hope.  Dolphy was a three instrument virtuoso and he's backed here by an all-star band.  One of the best jazz albums ever made.
6301885732|4.0|I had just graduated from high school when this film first came out so it brings back some great memories. Though the plot is weak, this movie must be seen for its entertainment value: great use of color, fantastic music,  and outrageous characters! If you're looking for a  silver-screen marvel,  stay away. If you're looking for a great hero, you're better off at the  comic book store checking out Superman or whatever. But, if you want to  enjoy an entertaining movie with a bag of hot popcorn, this is a good  choice! And you can't beat Madonna!
B00000DC10|5.0|There is no question that this album is the most inventive and most interesting hard-core/punk album in a long time. Most hord-core gets borring after the third or fourth song but not &quot;The Shape of Punk to  Come&quot;. This album will keep you listening from beginning to end. An  incredible mix of jungle, jazz, hip-hop, hard-core, punk, and just about  any style you can think of. Take my word for it. Buy this album!!!!
0764005685|5.0|This movie was very freaky ( not scary ) the effects are ausome, the decapitation in the begginging could of been better but....my favorite part is the head with the maggots coming out.<br />BAFANGOO DESTA DA MINGYA
B00000J2KX|1.0|I am a big fan of Nicholson, Kubrick, King and of the film THE SHINING. So naturally I had to add it to my DVD collection. What a lousy DVD! The sound quality sucked! I had to turn my dolby digital surround system all the way  up, which under normal circumstances would get myself evicted from the  premises. With the volume all the way up I still had problems making out  some of the text. Another Warner Brothers DVD that sucks for the same  reason is BONNIE AND CLYDE which also has a nasty hum.
0790736233|1.0|The theme of this ~~film~~ is the foolish assumption that superior intelligence will confirm the ignorant and arrogant belief that GOD does not exist. While state of the art science clearly proves the impossibility  of evolution, atheists desperately cling  to the Darwinian fallacy.  Ironically, if there was a personal contact with ``benign aliens`` who  confirmed Divine Creation, the evolutionist would probably still attempt to  justify his own misguided position. While there are ``billions and  billions`` of stars in the universe, this failed film gets 1.
B000000OSE|5.0|If you want to understand what rock is, buy this CD, song like &quot;Don't Cry&quot; and &quot;November Rain&quot; are surely two of the best sons I ever heard. Go for Guns n' roses and get mad for a solo guitar. Open your  window and yell &quot;Coma&quot; at the world, it will satisfy you!
B00000J7J4|4.0|This is an excellent CD.  Almost 5 stars.  I have listened to it several times in just the first couple of days.  Great classic Santana, terrific spanish/cuban and gypsy overtones and some wonderful mixes with the other  popular artists.  I am sure some purists will may not be crazy about the  &quot;pop&quot; nature of a song like Smooth - but it is a great tune -  should be a hit.  Its funny, I like Mathbox 20 - but this is definitely my  favorite Rob Thomas song.  The only knock for me is that the CD is just a  bit uneven (which can't be helped with all the talent) and I am not crazy  about the Carlos Santana references in a couple of songs.  But, frankly,  that is splitting hairs - its a great CD.  Almost 5 stars.  I would prefer  to give it 4 1/2 stars so as not to lower the average and discourage  anybody from buying it - so, if you like good music get this CD! Why  haven't they produced the &quot;Welcome&quot; album in CD?
B000000P17|2.0|If you are a great Gn'R fan and you won't change your opinion don't buy this album, is the worst album by Gn'R (I give Use Your Illusions I and II 5 stars)
6305470448|5.0|Writing doesn't get much better than this, and the ensemble cast, especially Dame Judi Dench (who deserved more than 6 minutes) and Joseph Fiennes bring this to life. <br />After this movie, and Rosencrantz and  Guildestern are Dead, I cannot wait for Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's next  work!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Not only is this Madonna's best album (closely followed by Ray Of Light) but it's also the greatest pop album ever produced!  Like A Prayer is Madonna's masterpiece, and is her greatest artistic achievement.  Listening  to it is like a 50 minute therapy session.  The songs on Like A Prayer fill  you with strenght and happiness.  The best songs on the album are Cherish,  Like A Prayer, Oh Father, and Dear Jessie.
0425152251|4.0|I loved the first half of this book.  It was a great introduction to the great philosophers of history.  I even found the fictitious story of Sophie, Alberto and Hilde enchanting.  But two-thirds of the way through,  the story lost momentum and became silly.  Worth reading for the  philosophy, but not as a novel.
0688171664|5.0|Work...Family...Relationships...Technology...Philosophy...School...Life. This is every entry on a best-seller list rolled into ONE GREAT BOOK. I should have listened to Dr. Herndl (my English professor) when he told me  to read this in 1975. However, I do not think I would have appreciated its  meaning as much then as I do now. Keep at this book, just as you would keep  at any long task worth completing. &quot;Lyfe so shorte, crafte so longen  to lerne.&quot;  Most of you will be glad you did. The rest of you will  just throw the book against a wall. When you need a break, go for a ride  and come back. Phaedrus will be there just like your father...alive or in  spirit...to help you through the journey.
B000002L73|2.0|Contains two songs that are classic Ramones ('Mama's Boy' and 'Too Tough To Die'). The rest is either overproduced misfires ('Chasing The Night') or attempts at pop commercialism ('Howling at the Moon', 'Daytime Dilemma').  You may wish to annoy your uptight friends by playing Dee-Dee's 'Wart Hog'  at maximum volume.
6304510861|1.0|Dumb movie and dumber than his others - so it is. I like the R Crumb movie but I didn't like this trash.  If the movie is based on Lynch's attempt to play with his audience than I find that to be totally arrogant on his part  - to think he has the reputation or chararcter to &quot;play&quot; with his  audience assumes he has the artistic licence and the artistic skill to  carry it off.  I don't think he does - I think Lynch has lost his artistic  creativity.  Blue Velvet and Elephant Man are his epitome of artistic  creation.  Everything after those two movies stink - witness the failed TV  show Twin Peaks -it lost its grab after the murder was solved and  languished on the tube for over 10 episodes before the producers pulled it.  Witness the prequel Fire Walk - sloppy and inane.  Wild at Heart - geez  who even reviewed that embarrassment. Lost Highway is lost for sure in the  trash bin of creative film - it should have been cut right to the bone on  the editors desk and released as some kind of artsy perfume commercial.
0767819543|5.0|Sorry folks, but I just have to add my two cents.  I absolutely loved this film.  Fernanda Montenegro acted circles around Gwyneth Paltrow.  Ms. Montenegro was seriously cheated out of one of the most deserved Oscars  ever.  The boy who plays Josue is also incredibly good and the chemistry  the two share only adds to the pain and humanity that permeates this film.   One of Brazil's greatest contribution to the world of cinema and a film  that will live within the viewer for a long time.  Rent it, please!  When  will Hollywood get it? These are the types of films that truly live on.  No  offense, James Bond!
B000002LQR|5.0|Maybe  the one of the best cds from 'Red Hot'. It's just a masterpiece and if you really can understand it.., you'll problably  see how special the musics are...
6305265666|5.0|I saw Ever After a few days ago and have been crazy about it ever since.  Drew Barrymore is beautiful but yet stands up for herself, and Dougray Scott is handsome but not snobbery as Danielle says.  Both together are  great and I love the fact that the 'bad guys' get dumped in the end.  TWO  THUMBS UP!
B000003N89|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim after being introduced to Krall on the &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good &amp; Evil&quot; CD.  It's a good thing my copy of &quot;All for You&quot; is not on vinyl 'cause it would  have been worn out long ago.
0790733226|5.0|The most important aspect of this movie is the fact that it shows humanity that the cosmos contains so much more than this little planet and its even more insignificant inhabitants.  &quot;Contact&quot; also shows how humans  must embrace each other in times of difficulty.
0385484518|5.0|Wow!!!! A great read that you won't be able to put down.  Even if you don't agree with Morrie, the subjects he discusses will keep you thinking for hours.  I finished the book in two hours, but it has consumed my  thoughts for days.  I received the book as a gift and didn't really care to  read it, but I did out of kindness for the person who gave it to me.  Now I  owe this person a lot of Starbuck trips so we can talk and talk about how  wonderful it is and discuss the subjects Morrie finds so easy to explain.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|i can't see how people criticize this album. Its's great.It's heavy, melodic, and lyrically brilliant. personally its my favorite maiden album, and Can I Play With Madness is my favorite song ever. If you don't have it  You need to get it right away
B000001GBJ|5.0|what is the difference between the &quot;Import&quot; and non-import version besides the price?
0385334206|1.0|One thing about the author is, he loves the &quot;n-word&quot; and he hates blacks. I never could understand how people who call themselves imaginative creators take such pride in alienating select audiences. Don't  you want people to buy the darn book??? You effectively killed your black  audience, Kurt. Now, I'm a smart man with a high tolerance for stupidity  and wacked opinions and am often able to find art in the sublime. From  another black man's promptings, I bought the book and read it. I was  disgusted. No doubt, Quentin Tarrantino is clammoring for the rights to  make the film. If you don't like blacks and you're the type of person who  feels that nobody ever gets your jokes, this &quot;book&quot; is for you.
B000002UAR|5.0|An excellent album- especially the cool cover of Phil Collins' &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows.&quot;
0425104052|4.0|Well, you don't get much of Holmes in this story, and many folks either neglect to mention that or just don't notice. I figure they don't notice because it's such a darn good read. At first, it's TALK, TALK, TALK. But  the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and I became engrossed.  Read it!
0767802659|5.0|Jeez, after a while, I still see this movie getting re-reviewed, but this should be a review of the DVD, not the movie.  Everyone that gives it less than 3 stars speaks of the movie, not the DVD.  Even if the movie may be  poor, this DVD isn't.  There's NO WAY you can give the DVD of this movie 1  star.  I have many of those DVDs.  Here's my first review of this movie  back in January, and it's still the same:<br />After reading the other  reviews, I'm left with this opinion: A lot of people don't know how to  review a DVD. You don't read this section to get a review of the MOVIE, you  read this section to get a review of the DVD. If the movie rates 1 star,  you don't give DVD 1 star because of that. Now for Starship Troopers. I saw  this at the theater, and I liked it somewhat. It was action packed, and had  nice one-liners and some humorous moments. If the DVD just had the movie, I  would not have purchased it. But it has SOO much more! It has the FULL  movie on the flip-side with the directors opinion of EVERY part of the  movie. It also has scenes that didn't make the final production, which I  felt made the entire Starship Trooper experience complete. This is the type  of movie you can throw in when you're not doing anything and just watch.  Get this DVD if you thought the movie was even SOMEWHAT interesting.
1572522232|5.0|The thing that stands out for me about this movie is how well directed it is. So many of the shots are amazing and I have since seen them imitated in other films. I liked the music but not as much as others. The acting is  so-so and the plot becomes fairly routine, but those do not bring a movie  like this down very much. In a horror movie, the barometer I go by is the  depth and degree of fear it induces. Suspiria succeeds on that level. Not  as well as Exorcist or Halloween, but it isnt too far off. The first murder  in the film is truly mesmerizing. Not one gruesome killing in the slasher  movies comes close to this scene.  The key to the fear is the mystery. I  actually didnt want to know any answers. The story works best as an  absolute mystery with only hints at the truth.  Also, be prepared for  color. Lots of color and it is gorgeous to see.  I have only seen the  widescreen version listed here on Amazon and it was worth the cost. Truly  unforgettable movie.
B0000025BL|4.0|Come on... how many teen-agers have not experienced a[n] [emotional] time when life was just so...much?  So vast... and mysterious?  Meat Loaf takes life and delivers - nice and neatly (and musically). So what if it doesn't  appeal to everyone!
B000002GYR|5.0|Is your glass half empty or half full?  Do you think &quot;Martha&quot; is depressing for its content of love never fully consumated or do you find it uplifting for its portrayal of love remembered that transcends the  situation that gave birth to it?  I opt for the second...this song and  album never fail to lift me up with real life bittersweetness.
B00000K19E|5.0|There was nothing that this movie showed that did not move me!  The key is to understanding the concept and having an imagination (some people lack the ability to think beneath the cerebrum).  When you enter this realm ot  thought the movie opens up fanthoms of enjoyment and excitement.  Thanks to  the movie industry for giving us a movie that finally makes us think and  enjoy at the same time!!!!
B00000K44W|5.0|Of the early, middle, and late eras of Tull, I've got to name the middle years as the peak of their creativity.  Most the the albums had a theme.  Heavy Horses looked to the animal kingdom as its inspiration.  HH is very  earthy and atmospheric.  A highly satisfying album that has been very hard  to find.
B000002MG1|3.0|This album in no way compares to their first three, and falls well short of document and pagent... i don't know what people hear in this... rem lost their edge and stipe sounds simpy and too soft... to those who think  otherwise you are wrong.... listen to murmur and tell me that aftp is even  close.... i think not..
1560100842|5.0|I've been in or near the cartoon business for 50 years and Preston Blair's &quot;Cartoon Animation&quot; played a big role in my education. In fact, most of the professional cartoonists I've known or worked with had a copy  of this book in their desks-- I just bought another copy (that makes about  30 in my lifetime-- I used it as a text book in cartoon workshops at the  Univ, of Wash. and Ohio State Univ.)<br />When studied as a text, this book  teaches us how to bring characters to life, whether you are in the  animation field or drawing for print media. The pages on  &quot;follow-through&quot; and &quot;stretch'n'squash&quot; are the most  important lessons a young cartoonist can learn--

1563890119|5.0|&quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; is the first and most uneven of the Sandman collections.  Neil Gaiman gives himself a large task of having to explain many things about the Sandman, thus justifying the lack of cohesion  in the first few issues.  <br />However, I think this is one of the best  collections.  The first story is a classic gothic horror tale that explains  how Dream became mistakenly imprisoned for almost 80 years and how people  all over the world began to sleep all the time. At the end, Dream tricks  his captors and escapes.  The other tales follow Dream's quest to regain  his magical items and his kingdom, which is in disarray in his absence.   Familiar characters from the DC universe show up here such as John  Constantine, Hellblazer, Mr. Miracle and Martian Manhunter from the Justice  League, and the old super-villain Doctor Destiny.  Neil manages to use John  Constantine and Dr. Destiny quite well but isn't sure what to do with the  Justice League.  Nevertheless, the Sandman's journey is an interesting one  particularly his trip to Hell and his encounter with Doctor Destiny in a 24  hour diner that manages to bring out the worst in human nature.  The last  tale introduces us to Death and is a great tale about life despite being  about well, Death.  Neil Gaiman laid down the blueprints for the entire  Sandman series here.  Many of the characters would appear again in later  stories and many events mentioned here would later be expanded upon.  This  is the place to start if you want to get into Sandman.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Don't listen to me, I fell in love with Diana Krall's music when &quot;All For You&quot; came out. Now, I've gone to work singing &quot;Under My Skin&quot; for four days - next it will be &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot;  until I don't miss any of the phrasing while singing along on the way home.   My daughter's co-workers were amazed when she sang along to &quot;Let's  Fall in Love&quot; when it came on the radio.  I thought it was fond  memories of Nat King Cole singing on TV in the early '50s that made me like  &quot;All For You&quot;, but now I like Johnny Mercer songs.  Nope! I like  Diana's style of jazz - both the singing and the piano.  And now Russel  Malone and Ben Wolfe after going to concerts where they played too.  I  bought  Stacey Kent's &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; because she was singing  songs of the same type, and I enjoyed it, but couldn't tell you where that  disk is at the moment. I know where &quot;When I look in your eyes&quot; is  all the time right now. Four stars because it is just a piece of the  picture developing of Diana Krall.
0060920084|3.0|I should have taken note of the reviews for this book.   He gets weary and critical from the get-go and never lets up, even after a winter break!   I know many of the places and agree with many of his observations but he  could have &quot;lightened up&quot; a bit!   A better read for a third of  the price!
B00000JGOH|5.0|I don't know if this movie deserved 7 Academy Awards or not, but it made me read the play again. Enough said.
B000000HSU|3.0|Any Bad Brains disc is gonna have intrinsic value, but why buy this when you can grab the Roir Sessions (s/t)? The songs are 50-70% common, and they don't have the Cars-y veneer that undercuts Rock for Light.
6305313687|5.0|The movie is a no holes barred, look into the racist problem in our society today. And how prejudice can be past on. It's a awsome movie, lots of f*******n bad language and violence. But it is a kick a**, in your face  movie.
1563890410|5.0|All of the Endless (Except one) sit down for a nice family dinner given by Destiny.  As is prone to happen at family dinners, arguments happen and old wounds are reopened.  Desire makes Dream feel remorse for banishing a woman  to Hell because she chose not to love him.  Dream decided he was wrong in  his actions that took place some 2,000 years ago (The entire story is  contained in the prologue to Doll's House).<br />Dream sets out to Hell to  free Nada.  However, once he arrives there, he finds Lucifer closing up and  moving on.  He has decided not to rule Hell anymore and gives the Key to  Hell to Dream.  This is where the story really begins...<br />The research  that Neil, put into this series is fantastic!  He takes pieces from  virtually every religion and mythology in the world and stirs them up in  his own special Sandman stew.  Once word gets around that Dream is now  ruler of Hell, many assorted deities (such as Odin and Thor of the Norse  Gods, faeries, assorted demons, etc.) plead their case that Dream should  give them the key to Hell.   Seeing the various characters interact with  each other is the most interesting part of this complex story.  The ending  (which I won't give away) is very surprising, yet it makes sense.   The art  for these issues is terrific and the characters are equally great.  This  series contains the first appearences of Despair, Delirium, Lucifer, and  Nuala all of whom would become major players in the series.
6301986024|5.0|I think this was a great movie.  It ranks just below the great escape which I feel is the best movie of all time.  The idea of recreating this movie using Pierce Bronson is ridiculous.  I think the swine who thought  the idea up should be casturated, shot and left for dead in a desert.  This  fiend finds that it is the only punishment suitible for such a hienous  crime.   FIEND
B00000IBRX|3.0|Robin Williams is a terrific comedy actor and that is where he should stay.  Not only did I not like the movie, I did not understand all the flashbacks.  Shame on Robin for hoping the visual effects would carry on  the story.
B00000I3JM|5.0|The Blue Nile - mysterious name for a band from Scotland, but don't let that throw you off the scent.  This album is a masterpiece of subtlety, minimalism, and form.  Sure, it takes time to appreciate.  Sure, some of  the sounds are a bit rough and ragged.  But this is pure, unadulterated  experimentation at its greatest and heartbreakingly melodic in places,  angular and sharp in others.  One of the greatest albums of the 1980s, and  possibly modern times.  *****5 STARS.
0930289331|5.0|With &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot;, Frank Miller ended the Batman saga.  With &quot;Batman:Year One&quot; he begins it again.  Exploring Batman's origin and chronicling his first adventures, we are introduced for the  first time to Detective James GOrdon (eventually to become Commissioner  Gordon), Selina Kyle (Catwoman), and Harvey Dent (soon to become Two Face).   Year One explores Gordon's relationship with Batman and is a great tale of  police corruption which justifies the existence of a Batman.  The artwork  is fantastic and Miller's writing is in peak form.  It's a shame he never  returned to Batman after this.  If you are a fan of Miller's writing, also  worth checking out would be Daredevil and Elektra, two other great titles.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I love this album it i the bes
6305313687|3.0|This film is adept, although not masterful, at the manipulation of issues of race.  In particular, it seeks to discredit mainstream white America's distaste for racial preferences (a.k.a. \\"affirmative action\\") by closely  associating it with bigots, racists, losers and Nazis.  As an example of  this rhetorical maneuver, if I were to say that Hitler had the idea of  producing a cheap car, I would be correct, but the mere fact of stating  that Hitler had the idea makes it seem less attractive, does it not?  The  same occurs in the movie, when Derek's father berates racial preferences in  one moment, then spouts bigoted comments and uses the N-word in the  next.<br />However, I don't want to bang too hard on the movie.  It was  well-intentioned, in a 90s liberal kind of way.  To that end, one of the  most enjoyable -- and laughable -- aspects of the movie is its childlike  belief that education (or reeducation at Chino State Prison, in Derek's  case) can change anyone.  That's nonsense, of course, since otherwise we  all would be believing and living the NEA-bred superficial mealy-mouthed  left-wing rubbish the public schools have fed us for the last fifty or  sixty years.  But of course (re)education doesn't change peoples' basic  nature; hell, the Chinese took a serious shot at it 1966-1970 and look what  it did to them.<br />So enjoy this movie for what it is: a superficial,  slickly violent, uneven morality play.  But don't for a second think it  accurately reflects reality.
0380973464|3.0|If you are a mathematician or a cryptologist, 900 pages of Cryptonomicon will probably be just fine. For the rest of humanity, the story would easily fit into 400 readable pages. Of course, you can skip parts, without  missing too much (as Stephenson suggests himself in an interview), but when  more than half the book is &quot;skippable&quot;, that excercise becomes  rather absurd.<br />The story does not have the imagination and sweep of  &quot;Snowcrash&quot;, but is still worth telling. It has a great feel for  Asia and especially the Phillipines, while the part that takes place in  Sweden (which I am familiar with) has no feel of place at all.  <br />Stephenson's obsession with graphic detail often stops the flow of the  story and places a heavy burden on the reader's visual imagination. Who  needs or wants to know what practically every object or feature in the book  look like? And why does the author show off, to such an arrogant degree,  his command of technical terms? You need a couple of specialized  dictionaries to read this tome.<br />Cryptonomicon is a Boys' Book all the  way. Stephenson seems to find women much more inscrutable than Asians. The  main character's sex life throughout the book is one brief episode of  premature ejaculation. How nerdy.
B000002AHM|5.0|Well, nothing I can say here hasn't been said before in other reviews, but this album is perhaps one of the most powerful, rhythmic and inspiring things I've ever heard. Go get it.

630204135X|5.0|I, too, first saw &quot;Persona&quot; in college.. and I was a bit confused by the deatils of the film.. but, I think the film achieves that sense of mystery while still keeping ones' interest and curiousity, making  the viewer wanting to know more. This is a favorite film of mine--  beautifully, and artfully directed, a thought provoker.

B000001FS3|5.0|This album is superb. This is U2 at its most sincere and accomplished. Listen to the words. It runs deep, and the music melds with it perfectly.<br />The hit songs &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;,  &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; and &quot;With or  Without You&quot; (great songs in themselves) at the beginning of the CD  are not the real meat of the CD. The best comes later.<br />&quot;Running to  Stand Still&quot; is an amazing and haunting poem about addiction and  realization. &quot;I've... got to do something about where we're  going,&quot; but going nowhere. &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot; is a  masterpiece - a look at the harder side of life. &quot;In God's  Country&quot; is one of the finest poems I have ever heard, and I cannot  think of a musical score better matching the words it is melded to. (The  whole album is like that). &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; is a fun,  flurty love song. <br />&quot;One Tree Hill&quot; goes straight to what the  album is all about - death and spirituality. Along the way, they touch on  life, faith, temptation, love, rage, reflection and action. You will, too.  &quot;And I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking for.&quot;<br />And it  rocks.<br />Listen to the whole album all the way through and pay close  attention to the words. It is a superb masterpiece. Bono is at his best. It  won a Grammy for Best Album and is widely regarded as one of the top ten  rock albums of all time. I would rank it among the top 100 art creations of  all time. Just listen to it carefully all the way through. <br />It is a shame  that U2 would later turn into a parody of itself and the work of the Joshua  Tree.

031218087X|5.0|I saw Dan Brown at Exeter, and got to meet him after the speech. His book was inspired by a student arrested at Exeter after sending E-Mail to his friend about how much he hated Clinton. The government intercepted the  E-Mail, and inspired the author to come up with the idea for a story about  the NSA.  Good Read!
B000002C1Z|5.0|I own many of Pink Floyd's albums (9 I think), yet this remains my favorite.  Keeping their &quot;theme album&quot; mindset throughout &quot;Animals&quot;, Floyd is able to simply yet elegantly weave political  commentary in between spurts of highly imaginative music.  Gilmour's guitar  solos are full of feeling (as always), but even on one note he is able to  say so much.  A great collaborative album between Gilmour and Waters-- dark  yet beautiful.
0767818040|5.0|O.k., so De Palma may be &quot;borrowing&quot; from Hitchcock now and again, but so what, and who hasn't ?. -It makes for some facinating movies. Like this one. It was made in the good old days, when directors and  casting-people seemed to care less about getting a big star in the lead,  but more about getting the right actor. And Craig Wasson is perfect here.  I've been a fan of Wasson for many years, and the sad fact that he's  remained so underused since then, only proves that insanity rules in  Hollywood. &quot;Body Double&quot; is a marvellous film from start to  finish, and one of the last truly interesting movies to come out of  Tinseltown. -I kid you not.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Although I had just ordered a couple of CDs from Amazon I had to order this one right away. I kept coming back to this page and listening to the sample cuts over and over again. The CD proved to be wonderful. Sweet, pure  simple melodies lovingly sang by a violin. Some of the passages are so  perfectly suspended and resolved that I just have to close my eyes and  smile as they play. This is very much in the style of late 19th Century  Romantic Songs with a bit of new age and Celtic sprinkled on top.  Recommended for those who enjoy, New Age, Clasical, or Easy Listening  Melodic music. I'm going to another of their CDs right now.
B00000ILE7|4.0|Unfortunatley James Cameron ruined the whole series by injecting us with the action laden effects of the second film in the Alien series. Don't get me wrong , I liked Cameron's film and consider it a great acheivement. But  the third can seem dull after seeing the second installment. Sigorney  Weaver is once again thrown into the Alien horror stories and is forced to  fight , literally , to the death. Fincher is a rising director with a new  and hip style. His eerie atmospheres create the perfect environment for the  Alien beast and his story takes us back in time to the first film. In the  first film there was only one Alien to destroy. We felt the sheer power of  the animal because it killed everyone except Ripley. This film goes that  same direction. Fincher's treatment of the Alien was something I really  enjoyed. To me this film will be viewed more as a career starter for  Fincher than anything else. That is , as well , unfortunate. People didn't  like it as much as the first and second because it didn't move nearly as  fast. But to me it moved at just the right pace. And the ending was  perfect. In my opinion the series should have ended there , especially with  the rediculous fourth one. But even I am guilty of wanting to see Ripley  charge the screen again after the only species beside Predator to outlive  almost every star , no matter how big or good.
B00000AFGM|5.0|First off will these prats who come in here and bash Manson stay away! secondly, I am a firm believer in God! Thirdly, the album. This is Manson moving towards a more tolerable sound whilst still retaining his hard metal  edge. This is no Portrait or AS, the album feels more subtle in contrast.  However the tracks Rock is Dead, Dope Show, and I Dont like the drugs.. are  cool yet Coma white is beautifully disturbing. This is Manson being more  tolerable and showing more talent for the various styles. He is  controversial but we like him! This album contrasts well to POAAF and AS,  very subtle.

B000000W5L|4.0|This is a terrific album, but I believe that some of the songs are a bit weak.  For an all around tour de force, check out Beggar's Banquet or Some Girls.
B00000J7SO|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dylan's second best album of the seventies after BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.  The lyrics are complex and highly symbolic, steeped in kabbalistic, tarot and astrological imagery.  Behind the imagery is  Dylan at his starkest and most desparate, grasping for love and meaning.   Many people have criticized the album because of the fairly rough horn  section and the pseudo-Motown backup vocals.  To me, this type of backing  is a fascinating counterpart to complex lyrics, creating an effect that is  exotic but at the same time very soulful.  &quot;Changing of the  Guards&quot; is a song evidently about Dylan's search for a spiritual  answer that evidently lead him to Christianity.  It is my favorite song on  the album, with both a melody and lyrics that continue to haunt long after  the song is over.  The last three songs approach the rich passion of BLOOD  ON THE TRACKS.  Aside from &quot;New Pony&quot;, which I find cloying and  repetitive, there is not a weak song on the album.  The newly remastered CD  sounds incredably sharp and clear.  This would not be the best album for a  Dylan novice to start with, but is an essential addition to the collection  of any fan.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix - possibly the best movie made following the postEra of sci-fi/action movies of it's kind (e.g. Terminator, Total Recall and T2). Combining mythology, religion, literature and kung-fu to produce a  high-octane mano e mano smash. We start our journey in this 2hr 15min flick  with, Neo (Keanu Reeves). A man who lives a double life, a sofware  programmer by day and hacker extraordinare by night. He is contacted by a  group of rebels, lead by know-it-all Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus  believes that Neo is the chosen one, the one who will defeat the computers  who have enslaved all humans and blanketed their minds from truth &amp;  reality. The movie then follows on to see Neo's triumphant rise to leading  the rebels, and most importantly, finding himself. Carrie Ann-Moss plays  the ever so beautiful yet deadly Trinity, who helps Neo in winning the war.  Hugo Weaving plays an encore performance as the vicious Agent Smith. The  Matrix smartly uses it's sleek design and cunning special effects (SFX)  provided by big man John Gaeta to knock viewers off their feet. The kung-fu  scenes are explosive and imaginative (e.g. Walking on walls, blurred  punches), picture a Bruce Lee fight scene raised to the 10th power.   The  Matrix is definitely worth seeing more than once, I left the theatre with a  feeling of ehhhhhh ehhhhhhhh &quot;I don't know&quot;.
B000002IOW|3.0|When Presto came out almost 10 years ago, I couldn't wait to cue up the CD as I had been anxiously awaiting the band's release following their last studio album &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; which I loved.  However, as bright  and triumphant as Alex's solo on &quot;War Paint&quot; was, and as  delicious the wit and humor of &quot;Anagram (for Mongo)&quot;~(remember in  Blazing Saddles, &quot;Candygram for Mongo&quot;?-ya gotta love Rush's  sense of humor) there were at least a couple of tracks that left me cold.   &quot;Scars,&quot; &quot;Red Tide,&quot; even the title track I found  unmemorable, to say the least.  But I loved the spit in Madonna's face with  &quot;Superconductor&quot; (just listen to the break) right at the height  of Blonde Ambition. Overall, though, I think most Rush fans would agree  that this isn't the Power Trio's finest.
B000002L9M|5.0|After Vince Clark left the band, Depeche Mode got really dark. Whether you like them or not, this album stands up as one of the finest pop albums ever made. This and &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; are essential listening, not  just for fans of techno, but of music in general.
B000002ADT|5.0|This is my first jazz album, and I have to say my last.  I cannot see how any other album can be better than this.  Whether you play it over dinner, during work, or just relaxing it is perfect.  Want to know what CD never  leaves my player anymore?  This one...
0684867621|5.0|This was quite a ride ~ enjoyable from start to finish, and I am not even a baseball fan.  It read like poetry.  The images were rich and extremely detailed and well developed.  I felt as though I were right there with the  heroine in the forest and in her head. Great imagery and who hasn't  wondered about the boundaries of reality?  Bravo and many thanks to Mr.  King.
6302293553|5.0|You don't have to be a Monty Python fan to find this funny.  It is just so ridiculous that you find yourself laughing at the absurdity.  Good simple gags, and the concept of the horse/coconuts is more than enough to keep the  humour momentum going.  This is always great for an evening with a group of  friends with a similar sense of humour.  Great fun.
B00000ILGL|5.0|It is a groundbreaking album from Giorgio, &quot;The Godfather&quot; of electronic disco. A &quot;must have&quot; in your collection if you still remember the 70's.
0800141326|4.0|This is either one of those movies people really love or really hate. Personally, I've like this movie, but I think they changed Godzilla waaaayyyy too much. Godzilla's atomic ray is nothing but breath that just  ignites fire. Godzilla also dies too easy too. Two or three missles kill  him. In the original Toho Godzilla movies, Godzilla dosen't even budge when  a missle hits him. If you're not sure whether to buy this movie or not, you  might want to rent it or ask a G friend that (hopefully) likes the same  things as you.
B00000J7S8|2.0|ok. love scenes was a fantastic album. diana krall really showed her colours and her talent. i feel that with the latest release she falls short. she should have just stuck to the piano and her voice. with me, that  wins. the whole orchestral bit in the background is stuffy and useless. it  sounds like muzak and not much more. the two stars are for the superiority  of her voice alone. finally, the song popsicle toes makes me physically  ill. sorry.
B000003BF1|5.0|If you like the Stones and don't have this album, then you're really missing out.  This album is just pure genius, and is my favourite along with the brilliant Exile on Main Street.  County Honk is probably (in my  view) better than Honky-Tonk Women, Love in Vain is very beautiful, Gimme  Shelter is simply wonderful.  Listen to the bongo's on You Can't Always Get  What  You Want and be amazed.<br />Get this album now.  It was my first Stones  album.  If you havn't listened to the Stones before, make it your first  Stones album too.

We run with  him, wanting to shout to the screen what we know that he doesn't.<br />In what  I believe is one of the greatest and most disturbing scenes of all time,  (Yes, he was able to work my emotions like putty in his hands.) Roger  Thornhill is in a crowded auction--completly safe from the bad guys  throughout the room.  Only to find himself alone, on a lonely streach of  road, where he is in a true run for his life!  Only Hitchcock could have  pulled that off.  <br />Today's movies pale in comparison.
0767812387|4.0|This movie was wonderful it was about a man from Cubia who came to the United States to work as a handy-man in a building where pepole did ballroom dancing.The man fell in love with a great dancer. To see more you  will just have to buy it from Amazon.com
B00000G3CK|5.0|this movie was very well put together, and certainly is a refreshing turn from typical holleywood garbage... it just goes to show that it doesn't take $30,000,000 and a &quot;thrid eye blind&quot; song to bring patrons.
B000002BQK|1.0|I think that &quot;Butterfly&quot; from Mariah Carey was the most boring, factory-made CD ever. There is nothing creative or new, same old, same old. This CD is a total waste of money. I would rather listen to Lauryn Hill or  even Cher!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CD PERIOD.  THE ORIGINAL RELEASE WAS A CLASSIC HARDROCK LIVE PERFORMANCE THAT SET THE STANDARD FOR ITS TIME.   HERE THE SONGS ARE SET TO THE ORIGINAL SONG LIST AS THEY WERE PLAYED. ALSO THERE ARE TWO BONUS  TRACKS, HOT 'N' READY AND CHERRY.  THE SOUND IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.  THERE IS A  LOT MORE TALKING BETWEEN SONGS FOR SINGER PHIL MOGG AS COMPARED WITH THE  ORIGINAL.  IF YOU LIKE UFO OR MICHAEL SCHENKER YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS CD, NO  QUESTION.
0783222904|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again and it thrills me just as much as the first time. The effects are fantastic and, now that I own the widescreen version, they are even more lifelike. This movie starts strong  and doesn't let up for a second, with a very climactic ending. Great fun  for the whole family.
B000002LQR|5.0|i still get shocked when i listen to this original masterpiece. it's my best cd, in a collection which contains other notables such as: Appetite for Destruction, Check your Head, Van Morrisons Best, Sgt. Peppers,Seventh  Son, Tribute to Randy Rose, In Utero, Discography, etc...
B00000K19E|4.0|No one can be told what the matrix is. You just have to see it for yourself.  I was very intrigued and amazed at how well THE MATRIX has turned out to be. I myself have seen the picture about three times.  The  special effect are so amazingly done that it puts STAR WARS THE PHANTOM  MENACE to shame. The story is good and the acting is ok, although I believe  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus was brilliant. Despite the fact that Keanu  Reeves is in good shape in this movie his acting ability is nowhere in  sight which is kind of good for his caracter.  Even though in just about  every Keanu Reeves movie he looks dazed and confused I think this or his  caracter he plays here in THE MATRIX suppose to look confused.  Anyway THE  MATRIX was a great movie and I defenitaly recomend this movie to everyone.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Celine has been my favorite artist ever since she released her first album in English. I listened to Celine singing in French for the first time in 1991 and it just astonished me. Her singing abilities improve with each  album. S'il Suffisait D'Aimer is just a gorgeous piece of art. My favorite  song is &quot;En Attendant Ses Pas,&quot; which is Celine's current single  in France. Two thumbs up!
6305426651|5.0|La vita e bella is a movie with impecable content.  In a world that is often controlled by hatred, lust, and jealosy, it isn't often that a movie bypasses all of life's troubles and focuses on what really matters. Roberto  Benigni demonstrates the love that every father, and mother as well, should  have for their children.  He also teaches us that nomatter how many dead  fish you find on your doorstep, you can always jump over them and keep  smiling.  I think if nothing else, everyone should have to see this movie  to know what true love is all about.  True love is giving all of oneself to  the one you love. So, carpe diem and love unconditionally.
0790729725|5.0|Warner should re-issue this disc with dual layer and clean up some graininess in most low-light scenes. They must not have used masters to make the DVD -- there is a scene (when Pauly and Vincent come to Henry's  hideout to tell him to go back to his wife) where a huge line goes right  down the middle of the screen.  It is the best ganster movie ever made, to  re-quote Ebert, but Warner's DVD implementation needs revisiting....
B000002BBY|3.0|I like the guys voice. Wonderwall is a amazing song and so is Don't Look Back in Anger. I like Morning Glory but besides those three there are only some decent and bad songs
6304118392|1.0|The film that I heard so much about was from beginning to end, a waste of money and time.  Graphically, mindless, stupid, and pointless violence makes up this film.  NBK might be credited for the reason you dont see  Woody Harrelson in any good movies any more.  Actually none come to mind  anyway.  Oliver Stone is over rated, which is an understatement, because  most actors and directors are these days.  Oliver Stone, Tarrintino, and  Araki and others come up with a series of violent sh-t and  &quot;offensive&quot; images to show you, knowing that most viewers will be  so &quot;outraged&quot; by it they'll forget the pointless plot.  NBK was  popular for its violence, there is nothing else in this movie.  So if you  dont enjoy graphic, bloody, mindless, violence, over and over and over,  then dont see this.
B000002UEB|5.0|this is the best QUEENSRYCHE cd ........if you like QUEENSRYCHE ........you must hear MAGNITUDE 9 !!!!....a new melodic metal band from usa ....Amazon   sells  the MAGNITUDE 9 cd ,...search - MAGNITUDE 9
067960085X|5.0|&quot;I am always drawn back to places where I lived, the houses and their neighbourhoods&quot; is the perfect first sentence to a novella that is perfectly written. It is hard to describe prose that is so elegant and  describes characters and situations with spareness, yet with such depth and  feeling.<br />Just as you experience New York in the early sixties in the  film, you experience New York in the 1940s in Capote's story. Holly  Golightly runs from herself -- and keeps running -- but the reader is not  left with any sense of loss, only warmth.<br />&quot;Breakfast at  Tiffany's&quot; is a true work of art. Displace one word and its genius  would diminish.  It is highly recommended.
0131103628|5.0|This book is the best C books I have seen. The style, completeness, depth, and conciseness of this book are all excellent. It may take some effort to read but your effort will pay off very soon.
B000002KBH|5.0|There is no way I could more strongly reccomend this CD.  Quite simply this is an American music classic.  \\"Box of Rain\\", and \\"Ripple\\" alone make this worth buying, then add in such classics  as \\"Truckin'\\" and \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" and you have a  masterpiece
B000007SPT|5.0|I first bought this recording as an album when I was fifteen years old, and still listen to it today. It has an almost unearthly quality to it, a must for anyone who appreciates truly beautiful music.
B00000DQT7|5.0|I love music, I love good music. I can honestly say I rarely get tired of this album. It is unfortunate that this album often gets overlooked when talking about bands that take great leaps forward musically. I think this  would be a case in point. Too bad it is so old that it has gotten lost in  time. It is a shame, this album is well worith remembering.
B000002BQK|1.0|I was incredibly dissappointed in this album for a number of reasons.  First of all- what happened to her voice?  She sounds hoarse and she literally talks through all the songs.  She used to be able to sing high  notes and now she can't. Second, there are rappers coming in- saying things  like Mariah on fire which have absolutely nothing to do with the song. I  thought maybe after this poser album she would go back to her old music.  But no- she even put herself on the Funkmaster Flex Mix tape.  (In case you  don't know, it's a cd with various rap artists)  If that isn't posing then  I don't know what is.  Her old music was so much better, like for example  Emotions and Unplugged.  I love those cds.  This cd is all filler.  And  it's weak, commercialized, and SO overproduced.  The lyrics are dumb and  why is there all this sampling?  She could write original songs before.  So  what happened? Emotions, Music Box and Unplugged have a timeless quality.  This already sounds dated.  Her new image might have been cute at first,  but now it is just really annoying.

B000002KCC|5.0|This album is probably one of the very best ever made. Dark, honest and so beautiful. One of my faviorte songs of all time is Tired Eyes. I know these people and I know that world and so does Neil. It sticks with you and in  your minds eye you see all that this song conveys. If you like Neil Young,  be prepared, it will be on you CD player a for a long while.
B00000IQMT|5.0|This sountrack offers an exquisite look  at the emotional flow of this greater than great film. 'Duel of The Fates' has got to be the most exciting and original Star Wars song ever. Its and instant great. Music is  what gives Star Wars if not all films their deepest emotion.
B000005QH3|5.0|I've seen it as a kid and never forgot it.  Recently I was watching it again on VHS and it is still excelent flick. Highly recommended!
B00000DGUG|2.0|There are a couple of catchy tunes on this CD, I'll admit.  &quot;Thank U&quot;, for example.  That's the reason I bought it.  When I heard it on the radio, I was pleasantly surprised, because I considered her first CD  (or should I say first American CD, considering she released some teeny-bop  dance stuff in Canada before she became angst-ridden and  pseudo-alternative) to be a real headache-inducing piece of juvenile  garbage.  So I bought it, thinking that maybe, just MAYBE, this woman had  grown beyond her self-obsessive phoniness.  Surprise, surprise, surprise!   You can't change a zebra's stripes.  Every single song (and I mean EVERY  SINGLE SONG) on this CD is utterly selfish, banally New-Age and reveals the  singer to be utterly, un-embarrassedly unable to keep a confidence or to  carry a tune.  (How many times must we hear her yodel a syllable when she  could just stretch it out a little bit?  For example--and this is from her  'first' CD, but there are examples on this new one, as well--she'll sing  'ti-yi-yi-yi-yime' intead of 'time'.)  Who would want to be her boyfriend?   &quot;Are you still mad I shared our problems with everybody?&quot;  Well,  yeah, her ex-boyfriend must be saying.  Alanis definitely has an unusual,  interesting voice, but she needs some coaching.  She also needs to pull her  head out of the sand and quit whining about her life.  How many people can  empathize with a young woman who's obviously bright, energetic, filthy rich  and famous, yet who keeps whining about the minutiae in her 'painful' life?   Maybe it's something that will disappear as she gets older and is able to  get some perspective on the unfairness of life that she seems to have  escaped.  Or maybe not.  I think the latter.
B0000029AL|4.0|OK, so it's not their best album. Then it's their second best. Right after &quot;get your wings&quot;. I don'tcare what anyone says, &quot;one way street&quot; is the bomb! And worth the price of addmission!
B00000ILBK|4.0|Great film!  When someone knocks it they say it's simply fluff and didn't have any overall effect in the Trek Universe.<br />Who the heck cares?  This is vintage stuff.  Yep, it has some stuff stolen from the episode &quot;Who  Watches the Watchers?&quot; but the message and the following plot is  relatively fresh.<br />No mandatory scenes like in the first TNG movies.  In  the 1st we knew we would have to see some contrived plot putting Picard and  Kirk on screen at the same time.  We knew we would have to see the  Enterprise.  We knew we would have to see Data get his emotion chip and a  few cutsie scenes about it.  In the 2nd, MOST of us knew we would have to  see the Borg.<br />This movie was, as some lament, a &quot;big-budget TV  episode.&quot;  Damn straight.  And I got my money's worth on a Trek film  for the first time since I saw &quot;ST IV&quot; on the big screen.
B00000DGRX|5.0|&quot;Machine Head&quot; is a classic for anyone who appreciate Deep Purple's contribution to rock music.  The music speak for itself (I guess if you are reading this review you know all the songs anyway) but the real  surprise is the sound quality.  Anyone who listened to the original  recordings remembers this sort of flat and not very clear sound.  This  edition will be a surprise for you, because the band almost sounds like it  was recorded today.  Roger Glover did superb job remixing the original  tapes.  Definitely worth the money.  However, don't fall into the trap with  anniversary edition of &quot;In Rock&quot; like I did.  You will be back to  the high school boombox!
0375707972|5.0|I read the book in 4 hours.  I'm not trying to say it was an easy read, but wow, what an interesting one at that.  In the beginning, I was a bit embarrassed at the fact that my nana was the one who recommended it to me.   I didn't really see the importance at first of the author's need to be so  specific with their sexual encounters.  But as I read on, towards the end,  I realized just how important it was that he included those details for his  readers in order to understand the effect Hannah had on Michael.  An effect  that never escaped him.  I'm sure glad nana didn't let her delicate side  interfere with her recommendation of the book.

B000002MFN|5.0|I find it sad to think there's one &quot;music fan&quot; out there who gave this a one star rating.  Quite suspicious when this record certainly is one of the most daring albums ever produced by a major pop superstar.   EROTICA IS NOT ONLY SEDUCTIVE--IT'S PURE POP MUSIC WITH A VOICE OF TRUE  EMOTIONS.  Catchy, fun, and with a lesson.
0792151712|1.0|I actually had to watch this stupid film and wonder why so many people liked this horrible movie that it makes my stomach turn.  It was either that women wanted to see DiCaprio, the moviegoing public wanted to watch  horrible stupid and miserable acting, the special effects that hide the  film's awful flaws, or the awful love on the tradgedy of the great Titanic.   I advise you not to even watch this film ever and I mean EVER for it's  unsympathetic storyline, harsh reality, and stupid characters doesn't  deserve the fame.  Cinema has lost it's leap of faith!
B000002JR8|5.0|To say it briefly, Far Beyond Driven is Pantera's best album. To be perfectly honest though, when i first got it, i was disappointed. It took a few months for the genius to become apparent.
6303402348|1.0|The moviegoing public must have turned off their brains when they watched this mindless and stupid piece of contamination.  Surprisingly, all the characters act meaningless and they were awfully acting.  Plus, the special  effects blending famous scenes from the past is just a distraction to keep  away the viewer from realizing the filth of this overrated film that will  remain, in my opinion, one of the worst films trying to be sympathetic!
0783235607|5.0|Gus Van Sant recently decided to remake this film, but he chose to copy the original shot for shot and use Hitchcock's same sets and camera angles.  Why?  Because he knew that there was no way he could improve it!!  This is  without a doubt the best horror film of them all because it scares the life  out of you without all the gore and stupidity of today's horror films.  In  fact, Hitchcock used black and white film to reduce the impact of the  bloody shower scene.  The real kicker is the performance by Anthony  Perkins, which makes the movie the classic that it is.  Don't bother with  the new one, rent the original!!

B00000J7J7|5.0|I've never listened to Brad Mehldau before.  But I'm glad I found out by chance this recording, which reminds me of Chopin, Brahms and Rachmaninoff, but in a jazzy setting.   The pianist is quite talented and his solo debut  is worthwhile. One of my favorite tracks on this album is Resignation.  Moreover, the cover of the album itself has a beautiful scenery and  reflects the spirit of the recording.  Congratulations, young man!
B000001E7L|5.0|Delores's lyrics are poetry to the soul, sometimes brooding, sometimes sentimental but always overflowing with the best of a woman's heart and spirit. Zombie is a powerful glimpse into the hardships and emotional side  efects of growing up in a land of constant violence and turmoil. The songs  on this album span a wide range of topics from being lovelorn to reverance  of parentage, to the sadness of seeing injustice done to others. I feel it  is by far the zenith album of the Cranberries to date. It is complete and a  masterpiece for women.
0783235380|3.0|The Movie was very very funny, the theme was great, the actingwas great, but the ending ruined the whole movie. But if you just wanta good laugh this the movie for you.
B00000DHTF|4.0|a question. This set speaks volumes for itself, as it should, finally coming as much a gift for Bruce fans as a HUGE payday for Columbia execs. My question is...did Bruce really send that message included in the main  body of reviews here on Amazon? This may seem silly, but I was shocked when  I saw it. Why? It is so out of character for the Bruce Springsteen I know,  the reserved and guarded recluse who values his privacy as much as we value  his presence. I think someone got one over on us...like those dunces who  call in to disaster scenes pretending to be reporters or persons with vital  information, only to be flunkies for Howard Stern. Really. I suppose it  doesn't matter, but I'd rather go on believing in the Bruce who lets the  music do the talking. Think about this...he hasn't given any interviews  since the tour started. What does that tell you?
B000002HIK|4.0|It's a good sign when an artist's worst album is still worthy of four stars. I Care Because You Do, in my mind, just doesn't stand up to the rest of his work. I mean, the Richard D. James Album is simply incredible and  the haunting sounds of SAWII are just amazing. But to be honest, I don't  find anything that memorable on this CD. Ventolin is ok, a bit harsh (an  understatement? I think so.), Come on You Slags is pretty good, but I swear  I really can't recall much of it.<br />This is a shame, too. I mean, Aphex  Twin is probably my favorite artist, but this CD was just a little on the  weak side. It's still worth a listen though, since it's still better than a  lot of the techno you hear these days.
B000002BMV|5.0|In response to comments below (primarily Cohen's): ESCAPE ought to be ranked and/or compared to JOURNEY and the work of JOURNEY only. Giving ESCAPE 5 stars is rather like saying that it ranks as some of their best  stuff. Are the 5 stars for ESCAPE and 5 stars for Jimi Hendrix or The  Beatles' Sgt. Pepper equal? No. By no means can these artists be compared.  Using your logic, and comparing ESCAPE with Jimi, we would have to rank  ESCAPE as a 1 and Jimi's Experienced as a 2! Why? Well, there were MANY  other works of which were MORE artistic, original and influential than  Jimi's! Perhaps Robert Johnson might better rank as a 5? Certainly, he left  more of an indelible mark than Jimi and Clapton combined. In fact, it was  Johnson of whom Clapton claims as his idol. All I'm saying here is that  JOURNEY gets a 5 star for ESCAPE because it deserves it compared to the  entire body of JOURNEY's work. Also, it's simply a perfectly crafted album.  And I think that's the reasonable way to look at it.

0060977493|2.0|This could have been a great book. However, it's only a mediocre one. I found Roy's word play springing not so much creativity, but from laziness--especially as she uses the same phrases over and over again. In  addition, Roy seemed to take great joy in muddling the timeline. She would  go back a forth a day, a few days, a week, a month, and years. Even at the  end of the book, I was still slightly confused as to what happened when.  HOWEVER, the final chapter was beautifully written and seemed to be almost  the work of a different author.  This writer was mature, disciplined and  willing to open her soul and expose the love and pain within. As a result,  this one chapter was much closer to poetry than anything offered in the  previous twenty. As I see it, poetry is more a state of mind than a state  of words. If Roy can continue to write as she did in the last chapter of  The God of Small Things, she will be a great writer.
B000002NJS|4.0|I can't understand the people who gave ROL only a star. True the album does tend to drag at times but it is miles better than the other pop stuff comming out right now - Backstreet Boys et al.  The title track, Nothing  Really Matters, Little Star are pop gems and even though I bought this  album over a year ago it still sounds as fresh as ever. If you want to  listen to an unchallenging but intelligent pop album you've found one with  Ray of Light.
0380796090|3.0|This isn't the best book ever, not even the best book I ever read, not even close. However it is worth reading, especially if a good laugh will make you a little forgiving about certain weak spots in the book. And this  book does provide a good laugh. Several, in fact. I can say this about  Watermelon: It's hilarious. Really. Literally laugh out loud. I think that  stands on its own. Give it a try....and don't be put off when you're first  reading it, if it seems a little TOO over the top: the book eventually find  a rhythm and carries it well towards the (predictable) ending.
B00000J7JO|2.0|&quot;Californication&quot; is the perfect title for this album: The joke is old and unoriginal, just like the music. After hitting their peak with the astonishing &quot;One Hot Minute,&quot; one of the most original and  important albums of the decade, the Peppers have done worse than regressed:  They've begun to sound like hundreds of other bands. The musicianship is as  tight and solid as always, and Anthony's vocals have taken on a pure,  controlled quality that they never quite had before. But the songs are just  plain blah: some boring rap (and we thought they'd grown out of that!);  some pleasant but thoroughly forgettable ballads; and some hard-rock  numbers that have neither the raw energy of the band's early work or the  creativity of &quot;One Hot Minute.&quot;      They miss Dave Navarro  big-time. John Frusciante is a capable player, but he's nowhere near the  soloist that Navarro is, and Navarro's dark, sinuous background lines were  largely responsible for the amazing textures on &quot;One Hot Minute.&quot;  Still, no one player is going to save an album when the material isn't  there, and on &quot;Californication,&quot; it ain't.      Save your money.

6304806426|5.0|This movie is the best. Ever since I saw it on December 1996 it seemed to me it would probably win the Best Picture Oscar. The acting is sublime in addition to the cinematography which on the big screen was mesmerizing. It  should have won Oscars for Fiennes and Scott-Thomas.The DVD is excellent,  just missing on the extras. I hope they release the Criterion Collection  version aready existing on laserdisc on DVD. Truly recommend it, you will  see why it swept the Oscars that year.
0062502182|5.0|The Alchemist is easy reading with a clearly defined messege.  Yet, within the simplicity is a depth of wisdom about life that one must work to understand.  Anyone searching for their destiny or just needing an extra  push to persure dreams should spend a few hours reading this delightful  book.  This is also definately a book to give recent graduates of any  school or age.
0767802659|4.0|This adaptation of a science fiction classic got clobbered by the reviewers when it first came out, and that's a crying shame.  The movie actually comes closer to capturing the flavor of the book than 90% of the  book adaptations I've seen.  On the surface, it's a gratuitously bloody  shoot-em-up with clean cut youths defending us against a homogeneously  bloodthirsty, fabulously-computer-generated enemy.  But below that B-movie  gore and violence, you'll find a healthy smattering of Robert Heinlein's  political beliefs.  Like them or hate them, they are certainly food for  thought.<br />Paul Verhoeven happily surprised me by managing to translate  many of the themes of the book onto the screen.  Of course, as a purist,  I'd have preferred a syllable-for-syllable screen adaptation of the book,  and some of the omissions and liberties taken with the story, themes, and  elements were disappointing.  But all in all, I thought the movie worthy of  repeated viewing.<br />I'd recommend that anyone who hated it or didn't get it  to read the book, then watch the movie again.  Why?  It might open your  eyes to something, and you'll probably become a Robert Heinlein fan.
6305470448|5.0|i saw this movie after school about 3 weeks after its release; there were 10 people in the theater. with such a meager crowd, i didn't expect much from this movie. but this movie delivers line after line of pure  brilliance! the screenplay: the weaving of romeo and juliet and twelfth  night into the movie, is absolutely genius! in fact, i was so taken away by  the writing, i also attended a play written by stoppard called &quot;indian  ink.&quot; once again, i was confronted with the same type of quips and  sharp insights. but, as a warning, i personally did not believe this movie  deserved the oscar for best picture. But this movie is definitely worth  watching.
B00000IFP6|4.0|Zinman uses the smallish, modern-instrument Zurich Tonhalle to record performances that are informed by the latest Baerenreiter editions of the Nine, employing performance practice insights, including faster tempi than  we generally hear. Most delightful, for me, are the little cadenzas that  the principal winds occasionally use at cadences; they are unobtrusive and  amusingly unexpected.
0312952813|3.0|Black Ice is a good book about police work as it should be, honest forthright and uncomprimising. But unlike The Poet or Black Echo, Connelly seems to take a cheap way out, especially in his handling of Cal Moore. A  short cut I am inclined to say. Still, I will be waiting for the next Bosch  novel.
B000002UAX|5.0|I think what most people are forgetting is that this record is a reaction AGAINST making a grand sweeping statement a la &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (check out the cover). After &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;,  and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, how can we blame the Beatles for just having  fun in the studio? We Beatle fans must also recognize that the main  motivation for releasing &quot;The White Album&quot; on two albums/cds is  that it served to fulfill their contractual obligations more swiftly to  their record company (they were a little busy, especially compared to  today's artists who may produce one album every two years).  What I'm  trying to say is that given the ENORMOUS amount of pressure to produce  popular AND artistic success, the Beatles still come up good on this  record.  Sure, some of the stuff is unnecessary, some is just plain weird  or mediocre.  Many of the songs will not make the &quot;Best Of&quot;  collection, but I think that's precisely the point. But you still get  &quot;Back In The U.S.S.R.&quot;, &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, &quot;While My  Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;,  &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;,  &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;Happiness Is A  Warm Gun&quot;, and &quot;Yer Blues&quot;. Many (if not most) bands would  dream to have an album/cd with this much good material, even if it is  spread out on a double set.  Finally, the curio pieces (&quot;Honey  Pie&quot;, &quot;Do It In The Road&quot;, &quot;Revolution 9&quot;) only  serve to strengthen the overall effect of this recording, especially if  it's heard from start to finish.  It's not their most achieved work, nor  does it try to be.  Just listen, sing the lyrics to it, put it on as  background noise, have a party........Buy It!
B00000I8BX|4.0|Fear Factory is the best, next to Black Sabbath. This is a really great album. I bought it the day it came out and haven't been diappointed. I have all of their albums and haven't been disappointed. I gave it 4 stars cuz it  wasn't &quot;typical&quot; FF but it was great without a doubt. But if you  want to know &quot;typical&quot; FF, try Soul of a New Machine. Their first  one. That's if your heart is up to it.
B000002NHN|3.0|Most of these songs have very short (as in 8 to 20 notes) melodies. This melody is repeated over and over and over with no development once so ever while the song goes on and on and on. For instance the Prologue has her hum  a sweet 8 note phrase about 50 times for four and half minutes! And the  Highwayman has a nice standard A B A B form with all the sophisticaton (or  lack there of) of a 3 minuet pop tune except this song goes on for over 10  minutes. As far as her journey and moving lyrics - well it is hard to  understand a word she says - her diction is just horrid. It short a  pretentious overblown effort that could have been a very pleasant album is  all the songs have cut it half and handful added. Totally overated.
B00000J7SO|3.0|The sound of a legend, still on his feet, singing some new songs he's written and hoping you like them. Robert Johnson imagery aside, these are all second or third rate Dylan songs gussied up with girlie choruses and  saxophone. It's shrugworthy. To everyone who gave this record FIVE! stars,  i ask---are you out of your minds? If this is a five star record, what do  you give HIGHWAY 61 or BLONDE ON BLONDE? A 20?
0425129608|5.0|Great Book! I couldn't put it down! I love her books and she is a great writer!I would recomend this book to anyone!
B000000W5L|5.0|I love reading all the one and two star reviews of this album. Jeez, how can you miss the power of this thing? It's like being run over by a train, for God's sake. It's Jimmie Rodgers, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, and Hank  Williams channeled through Keith Richards and Charlie Watts. What more do  you want? The Stones would have their moments after this---SOME GIRLS,  TATTOO YOU, the unjustly underrated DIRTY WORK--- but this was the point  when all their influences met up with their abilty to match them, and they  were never the same afterwords. The greatest work of art that rock and roll  will ever produce.
6303014100|5.0|I thought I would say something about this amazing Movie thatwas made in 1993.  I have seen the Movie 3 times already, and eachtime, I find something I didn't see before.  I thought the acting by the late Actor Richard Jordan, who portrayed at Brig. Gen. Lewis Armistad was very moving indeed.  I have since learnt that he had passed away just 3 months after making this Movie, and he was not well at the time of making it.  Apparently, he died of an Inoperable Brain Tumor in August 30 1993, so he never got to see the review of this magnificant Film!!  I am seriosuly thinking of purchasing the &quot;Collector's Edition of Gettysburg&quot;, as I have also read some of the comments regarding this item, and think it well worth while to have.  I think this Film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, was both an emotional and heartrenching , and it makes one ponder of what these brave men did in their time!  I also correspond with a Penfriend for the last 10 years who lives in Florida, and is also very interested in the Civil War, he has told me so much, and also have read books here in Australia about the Civil War!  IN MY VIEW, WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF THESE BRAVE MEN, BOTH UNION AND CONFEDERATE.!!
B000002MG1|5.0|This album was a balm to me after my father's death. &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; would make me cry.  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; would console me.  The final three songs would leave me feeling wistful, sad, but deeply  touched and comforted.  Life goes on.  Art goes on longer.<br />I've been  with this band since the beginning.  I was with them the other night at the  Greek in LA.  They are greater than ever.
B00000IFWE|4.0|I was a little leary about buying the album at first since the critics were so rough on it, but I'm happy that I bought it anyway.  Sure, it isn't the same hard driving rock of the earlier years, but Petty just keeps on  growing.  Anyone who has been a long time fan knows that whatever TP is  feeling at the time he's working on an album is what you get, and since he  was not in a &quot;happy place&quot; it shows, but I really enjoy his work.   I actually don't like &quot;Free Girl Now&quot; but do like everything  else.  Nobody is worth going to see in concert more than TP, I hope to  catch him on this summer's tour since it's been 4 years since I saw him  last, and that's way too long!!
0783235607|5.0|many have tried to make another movie as scary as this but few have succeeded-maybe none.The acting is great, and how many of us take a shower without thinking about this movie? I still enjoy it and get the shivers  whenever I see it. The untalented producers of slash movies should pay more  attention to its simplicity and effectiveness
B000002TQV|5.0|This is a great album, and I actually like it better than OK Computer. Every song on this album is great, especially &quot;High and Dry&quot;, &quot;Street Spirit&quot; and &quot;Just&quot;.
B00000ADG2|1.0|Well, that about says it, except for adding that she also can't sing worth a damn and her melodic sense is nil.
B00000FZ1V|3.0|Being one of the biggest movies of its time, it was important to see how well Ghostbusters held up 15 years later.  Well, while it still captured the moment, much of the humor, costumes, hair styles and music really shows  the date.  The movie still has some great Bill Murray tag lines, but the  movie has been so over exposed that the lines aren't that funny anymore.  The special effects also really show off how old this movie really is,  unlike other special effect driven flicks like The Thing and Alien that  hold up even today.  Still, it is a classic film of that time, and deserves  to be treated as such.  The DVD is an excellent version with a full 16x9  enhanced 2.35 to 1 aspect ratio and a 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack.  There  is also a bunch of extras including a Mystery Science Theater 3000 style  commentary with silhouettes of the commentators over the screen (alas, this  does not come up unless your DVD player is set to 4x3 which mine is not, so  I did not get to see this feature but I still listened to the commentary).  A plethora of other features also exists.  Overall, while dated, this movie  was a landmark film of the 80s.  It is just unfortunate that it did not  hold its own when compared with current special effects driven movies.
B0000025SB|5.0|After listening to this CD for the first time I just wanted to curl up with all the lights out, and mourn the world.  I am a college student, and I spend a great deal of time studying WWII, and talking to the vetrans and  survivors of the war.  This CD brought the hell of their experiences to a  very brutal, and sometimes harsh light.  Musically it isn't Pink Floyd's  greatest accomplishment, but I believe that it is the most powerful of all  of the Pink Floyd albums because the experiences are real, and the  experiences of men and women that we meet every day.
B00000IL1K|3.0|This would be a superb piece of work if only Sarah's voice wasn't submerged in the background instruments. I found myself straining to hear the vocals over the accompanying din. Perhaps an equalizer would help make  her more audible? A remix is definitely in order.
0780626478|5.0|Alicia Silverstone is NOT a terrible actress.  Dave Foley is one of the funniest people I have ever seen (&quot;he's like from X-files or something&quot;),  and Brendan Fraser pulls off another awesome surprise for us all.  There  aren't many actors these days that have the depth (yes, depth) that this  young man has.  Compare George of the Jungle to his Clayton character in  Gods and Monsters.  Or Adam Webber to his character in &quot;Twighlight of  the Golds&quot; I actually did a little research on him after seeing  several of his films...he is educated, talented, bright, certainly can  dance (ballet, jazz, swing, etc), and has both comedic and dramatic  qualities that you just can't find often anymore.  He certainly will never  be stereocast. This film does exactly what it is supposed to do--Blast you  back to the Past for little rest and relaxation.  Thank you all for the  refreshing rest!!!!   I'm buying it before the price even falls, I enjoyed  it that much.
6304436386|5.0|This is one of the best motion picture I've ever  seen  before (The Director's Cut). The normal version is very good to, but it doesn't go really deep in the characters, like the director's cut. Anyway, this is a  must see.
B000005H40|5.0|This CD, while perhaps not among the most well-known of Coltrane's works, is unique in that it has been placed on what is known as an &quot;Enhanced CD&quot; format.  What this means is that you not only get the music, but  by downloading QuickTime to your computer, you can also get a series of  photographs and interviews talking about the record and the artist.
0553277472|5.0|This is one of those books that you start because you feel that you should and finish because you love it.  It has a telling message for students just entering the realms of adulthood and of higher education about the truly  important things in life.  It's easy to maintain the status quo, but Pirsig  will influence you to pursue your own Holy Grail.
B00000IL1K|5.0|THE LAST WORDS YOU SAID is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Great songs at all. I just love this cd - my favourite. The best of Sarah.
630407185X|4.0|This movie was terrific, although I agree with the reviewers who say you should read the book to fully appreciate it.  Books will always be more thorough and complete than movies.<br />One thing that was not captured at all  in the movie version was the harrowing crossing of the Rhine by the British  paratroopers fleeing Arnhem.<br />Also, the movie creates the impression that  Browning (the British commander) supports Market-Garden without  reservation.  He utters the  famous &quot;bridge too far&quot; line to  Urquhart at the end, and this appears to be more than a little  disingenuous,coming after the fact.<br />In the book, we learn that, in fact,  Browning tells Montgomery &quot;we may be going a bridge too far&quot; at  the initial briefing for Market-Garden.<br />However, I am terrible with  identifying celebrities and hope that someone can tell me what characters  were played by Dirk Borge and Lawrence Olivier?  Also, who played Maxwell  Taylor (commander of US 101st Airborne) and Gen. Gavin (commander of US  82nd Airborne)?  Both actors looked familiar, but I could not place  them.<br />Thanks to anyone who can help.
B000001EIA|5.0|Probably the best aucostic I have heard
B00000J7J4|5.0|Not much to say: get it now. Santana again at his very best. Great melodies, great texts, great sessions. My absolute favorite: Love of my life.
6304493681|5.0|You know, I've never banged a cartoon chick before, but if I did, I'd bang Matoko Kusanagi.  She ranks right up there with Princess Jasmine from Aladdin.  And I bet Bateau would agree.       Seriously though, I love this  movie.  The animation is so realistic it's astonishing.  Except for the  scenes with the old police chief, it's eye candy from start to finish.  The  story is mostly good, but the ending is unsatisfying.  Especially  considering that there hasn't been a sequel yet. (has there?)  I find the  car chase scene absolutely beautiful.  It's very hypnotic.  I also like the  visual of the tank being hit by Bateau's &quot;Big Gun&quot;. Just about  every visual element of this movie is so realistic.  It's amazing.  I've  watched this movie at least a dozen times since I got it on DVD a week ago,  and I also saw it at Piper's Alley theatre in Chicago in 1995 when it first  came out.  Two of our friends that saw it with us fell asleep twenty  minutes into the film.  I can almost sympathize with them as most of the  movie is so sedate.  I wonder if that's the influence of the Shinto and  Buddhist religions in Japan.  As a piece of visual and sonic art, this film  is one of the best ever.  Even with the weak ending, it still blows me away  every time.Brian M.
0783235607|5.0|It's amazing how a movie made 39 years ago can still have impact through the watchers. I mean, I am 17, the special-effects-blockbuster-movie generation. Therefore, I shouldn't get terrified and impressed with acient  movies. But I was! The plot is amazing and surprising. The camera views are  really impreessive. Loved  it!
B000002C4C|5.0|I think this is a great album.  She did a good job writing these songs. I'm hooked on listening to it, in fact, I'm listening to it right now.   I can sing to it, and it definetly has some songs that you can dance to. I  love it!
B000002H6C|1.0|This band, as well as its members (Hammett and Hetfield) are as overrated as I've ever seen. All the reviewers citing this album as great rock music need to go back a couple of decades to the true masters - Led Zepplin. In  comparison, Metallica pales. Period, no discussion.
6305137293|5.0|PERFECT! PERFECT! PERFECT! Donald Pleasence's performance andthe lines he is performing are much better than in the firstone. Jamie Lee Curtis also played verry good. One of the best Horror sequel ever made in the Cinema History. DON'T MISS IT. ITS PERFECT.***** OUT ***** !!!!!!
B00000K19E|4.0|This is the type of movie where some people love it and somehate it, with no gray area in between. I believe it just matters onwhat someone expects when they go in to see the movie. The plot is interesting and to an extent original, as no one in holywood ever came up with anything like it.  But then there are sci-fi books where plots like this are very common. I gotta admit though, it did get me thinking. :)<br />One thing which I was dissapointed with (not surprisingly) was Reeves' acting. He just isn't the right actor for this movie. Other then that, and a couple loose ends here and there I have to say that the movie is great. The special FX are mind dazzling, and the soundtrack isn't half bad either.<br />A sugestion for anyone who hasn't watched it yet: When you whatch it, don't analyze it, just take it as it is and give in to it... That way you're guranteed to enjoy it.
B000001FTQ|5.0|The eight-minute live version of &quot;Bad&quot; alone is worth getting the CD...
0201633612|5.0|Great book, althoug it's not for beginners. You'll have to read some sections twice and study the code to understand it.  It's more of an academic book because most projects don't allow sufficient time to do a  proper design and implement design patterns (I wish they did).  If you want  to be a good OO Designer/Developer, this book is required.
0684867621|2.0|My least favorite Stephen King Novel.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  Anything!
0684874350|5.0|Soon after starting this book I realised that I had begun to read something I would never forget, and would always recommend at every opportunity. This book gave me the over overwhelming feeling of  inspiration. Thank you Mr McCourt.
0440180295|5.0|All I ask of a novel is that it take me somewhere I have never been before.  This book did.  I highly recommend it.
0767819594|5.0|cruel intentions is the best movie i have ever seen.sarah michelle gellar was great in it. i love how she plays her part in the movie.i also love how ryan phillippe plays his part i love how they play spoilt  rich people who  think they have nothing else in the world but money.i thougt it was exelent  what i think is if you loved it buy it.
B0000048CX|5.0|Sort of an &quot;unplugged&quot; effort for Yo La Tengo that really works.  The musicianship is excellent and the production is even better.  Simple tunes played to perfection.<br />A wonderful piece of music by one of the best  bands around.
0790745399|5.0|This movie friggin rocked.  I have seen it about 4 times nowand it gets better each time.  The parallels between the Matrix andthe life of Christ are awesome.  Don't listen to these who blast the movie due to Keanu's bad acting.  Hey, he's no Oscar winner, but who cares.  This story is so cool, that even Jennifer Tilly could have pulled it off.  Please see this movie.
0606005919|5.0|This is one book that I picked up to read over my vacation at the beach.  I finished it before we even got to the beach.  I knew I liked Steinbeck, but I had never heard of this one before (unlike The Grapes Of Wrath, Of  Mice And Men, etc.)  Boy, am I glad I picked it up!  At the part where Adam  Trask goes to his wife's whorehouse to finally face her, and comes out  triumphant, I had to stop reading and let out a shout of victory.  This  book also made me cry, laugh, get angry and sad.  It's one of the few books  I have read that has made me feel so many different emotions.  To any of  you who have read the book already, Timshel.
6304925131|3.0|I must confess I watched this movie only because of Claire Danes, that's one of the best best actresses of her generation. She's also so pretty and sweet, that it makes it worth watching this movie, even if it's not so  good.
014028009X|1.0|Reading DIARY is like eating potato chips--hard to stop, not very nutritious, and resulting in a sick feeling when you're finished.  The popularity of this novel is the only reason to read it, after which one can  only marvel at the response of readers who loudly proclaim that the  vacuous, spiritually bankrupt Bridget is &quot;just like me!&quot;  Our  secret, shallow tendencies are charming when they are presented in  opposition to, and at war with, our more profound nature--since Bridget has  no depth, her obsessions with weight and men are not comical, but pathetic.   Fielding's clumsy parallel with Pride and Prejudice will elude those  readers who wouldn't touch Austen's novel with a ten- foot mascara wand and  simply annoy everyone else, so what's the point?
B00000JJQK|5.0|I was lucky as a kid. I lived next door to a guy named Steve who turned me on to great music when I was only 7 or 8 years old. I remember hanging out in Steve's room, listening to Hendrix, Zeppelin, Bowie, Who, Wilson  Pickett, Jefferson Airplane and others while every one else my age was  listening to Osmonds, J5, Tommy Roe and other pure sugary pop. But... I  never got clued in to the Beach Boys. I thought they played silly,  throwaway ditties about surfing and convertibles. I went ahead and got into  Sabbath, Aerosmith, Trower, Travers, Mahogany Rush, etc etc  plus alot of  Motown, and I still didn't know anything about the Beach Boys, and didnt  want to. I kept hearing about Pet Sounds being the inspiration for Sgt  Pepper and it was so great and all but I just wasn't interested. My wife  joined a record club and Pet Sounds was in the catalog. I got it on a whim  and threw it in the CD cabinet and didn't even listen to it. Then, one  sunday, with wife and kids out of the house, I decided to listen to it. My  god, I sat on the couch, dumbfounded, astonished. This is not what I   expected. This was a mature, fully realized masterpiece. The songs are  bittersweet, melancholy, angelic, perfect. The themes are not carefree  youth and beach cookouts, but deal with lost youth, uncertainty, the  fragility of love and the human condition. Damn it, Steve, why was I  listening to &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; for the 100th time in a row when I  could have been listening to this?
B00000APLB|4.0|Great CD featuring Classic Stones.  Some songs sounded like they were not remasted.  &quot;Sympathy For The D....&quot; has the first minute of the vocals sounding like Mick was in the hallway singing and not out on stage.   Overall 4.5 stars
0684800713|1.0|I really don't like this book. There's no plot - all they do is go to parties. All the symbolism and meanings I was suppose to find, I couldn't understand. Either its too shallow or its way over my head, I'm not sure  which.
B000002UAX|5.0|I absolutely agree with you - the White Album should have been edited down to a single. But why then the poor choice of songs? 'Birthday' was accurately described by John Lennon as 'garbage', and the only interesting  thing about 'Back in the USSR' is that it simultaneously parodies both the  Beach Boys and Chuck Berry. No, if you decree that only two songs off the  White Album are allowed to survive, then I would make my choice based  solely on the level of musical innovation. That gives me 'Revolution No. 9'  for Side A and 'Happiness is a Warm Gun' on the flip. And by the way, who  on earth are 'Led Zepplin?' Are they in any way related to the fine but now  disbanded British quartet of Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and  the late John Bonham - better known collectively as Led Zeppelin?
0440180295|1.0|I don't like how Vonnegut down-plays death. What's the phrase? &quot;and so it goes&quot;?  I also don't like how the author puts down morals and values. I don't care if Pilgrim has been through war, that doesn't give him  an excuse to loose all human pride.
1573226521|5.0|Anyone interested in travel and youth culture will very much enjoy this unique story about backpackers set in Thailand. Read this book before the movie comes out, which will not capture the pulse of the fast, witty, and  convincing narration.
0783235607|5.0|This is the best PSYCHO there is.  Yes, some parts may be boring or dull but some parts were pure great.  Those of you who like the new modern horror films like Halloween H20 would hate this movie.
0399128964|5.0|Dune was the first science fiction book I read, and 10 years later, it is still very much my favourite book. Don't be discouraged by the first 50 pages, it does get better once one has acclimatised himself to the language  of Dune. Herbert does not try to impress with scientific jargon, instead he  creates a fantastic political arena and a detailed eco-system that is  totally convincing and dazzling. One reading of this book does not do it  justice. Nor do any of the sequels. This is science fiction at its best,  and I have yet to find anything else of the same standard.
B00000INEX|5.0|I first showed this video to my son at 8 weeks old.  He is absolutely enthralled by the moving toys and colors! I don't hear a peep from him throughout the 30 minutes.
0812550706|1.0|You would have to be a masochist to like this book. Chapter after chapter, all the main character does is try to drown himself in self-pitying drivel. 90% of the cast of characters are sadistic psychos, and the terrible  &quot;aliens&quot; couldn't hurt a fly, much less conquer a planet. I mean  really, you never get to see them in person, and insect-like hive creatures  have great promise! I was expecting a book about a grown man who actually  does more than get picked on, wallow in self-pity, and play video games!  The book is more a view of &quot;What Earth Could Be&quot; ( horrible and  judgemental, kinda like Earth today), and is more fiction ( fantasy) than  science fiction, with a few starships and orbital space station throw in  for good measure. The part about Ender's sister and brother taking over  world via internet and public opinion is amusing, but unrealistic. I'm glad  I took this doozy out of the library and finished it in a day, rather than  buy this. I'm still going to try a few more of Card's book, but since this  is the first of his books I read, I'm rather unsure. Live long and prosper,  but for your own sake, don't read this book!
B000000OQF|5.0|Go for it and get mad. Slash's God
0783231032|3.0|The reason this movie was shotdown by critics is that they don't have a sense of humor.  Occasionly they'll give a comedy a good review but they're usually comedy/dramas.  This movie was really funny.  Who thought it wasn't  does have a sense of humor.  nother reason why is that it was probably it  wasn't raunchy enough.  People probably expected another Bluto
B00000K2SC|4.0|DESPITE the film's many flaws I immediately fell in love with it. The visual appeal, the blue-greenish toning, the sound, the atmosphere, the darkness: The Matrix looks beautiful.<br />But there's more : the sexy voice  of Lawrence Fishburn, the cool and emancipated Carrie-Ann Moss (The line  &quot;Dodge This&quot; is the coolest line a chick has said in a film for a  long time!), and of course my personal favourite : AGENT SMITH. He plays  without a doubt the best part in the film, particularly when he gives  Morpheus the lecture about the human race being a disease. You just gotta  love his face, his voice, Smith is sexy, funny, merciless and so very, very  bad.<br />There are so many corny lines to quote from, I predict a  Cult/Campstatus for this flic!<br />Free your critical mind and go see this  sexy picture!!!!!
6304466498|4.0|Spaceballs in one of the most hilariuous movies I have ever seen.  All the jokes in the movie are original.  The cast features not ontly Mel Brooks,  but funnyman John Candy,  Rick Moranis,  and Bill Pullman.  Rated PG
0767819462|5.0|Stepmom is a very good drama, a little depressing at times butower all a must see. 2 thumbs way up for Julia Roberts!!!!!!
6304288433|4.0|A good horror movie.  The killer who can't die returns after his sister Laurie.  The movie was good and gory.(The Hydrotherapy seen.)  Good how he gets closer to his sister when she doesn't know.  The only part that wasn't  good was the part where he breaks through the glass door. Rated R for  violence,  gore,  and nudity.
0783231202|1.0|This movie would have succeeded if it had starred Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Leslie Nielson and Dan Ackroyd. It's so appallingly acted, scripted and directed that it amounts to a laughable parody of a  'serious' subject matter. An exercise in sickly false sentiment with the  requisite maudlin musical score that has become Spielberg's unmistakable  trademark.    It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly  made - derivative of the TV  mini-series 'Roots' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago. A cynical and inevitably failed attempt by Spielberg to gain recognition, legitimacy, and status as an auteur filmmaker. He  should stick to what he does best: catering to his uncritical and adoring  fans.
0783225202|4.0|This movie is great.  The car chase scenes are excellent(The Mall).  There are other classic parts in it(The penguin).  I Personally recomend it. Ratedc R for language
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is an excellent stop-in-my-tracks-and-look-at-life kind of book.  The author weaves a story of two perspectives that reach far beyond the day-to-day rat race.  This book reminded me of what was really  important: integrity, dignity and love-- things that no one can take away  from you.  I appreciated the candid and honest view of death.  Very well  done.
0783226160|4.0|Animal House is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  The toga party is a classic scene.  The road trip was funny,  too.  Thew grades were funny.  The end was good.  This movie has no point but I don't think  comedies should have big lessons in them if it's like this one. Rated R for  language,  crude sex rrelated humor, and nudity.
B000002HRE|5.0|Metallica has had many good recordings over the years, and this is definately one of their best. Metallica proves that they do not have to stick to one style only, like many lesser bands, but they can change and  grow. This album shows growth towards a new direction, away from their old  speed metal and towards a new equally great point. It will be intresting to  see what they do with their next record.
0871137380|5.0|This book is well worth your time and money!   Very good research! Has a fast-moving story which covers all the perspectives of the battle.  Caution: contains realistic language.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Most people know James Cameron from making TITANIC.  I know him from making ALIENS.<br />Of all the movies I have ever seen no one movie sets a mood like Cameron does in this one.  Every set conveys the image of being  in a true foreign world.  How this movie failed to win an Oscar for set  design still escapes me.  The sets are wonderful.  The props (and there's a  ton of them) are all great-looking and believable.  James Hoerner won the  Academy Award for best score in Titanic and could have also won that same  award here.  His eerie score is terrific and is instrumental to setting the  mood.  The music from this movie's climax has been used to promote at least  5 other movies.<br />The Special-Edition DVD version adds about 15 minutes to  the film. Too bad it was removed from the theatrical release because it  really explains why Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) risks her life to save that  of a little girl. Also, this version has an interview with Cameron, shows  pre-production test shots and has over 100 photos of story boards, set  designs and actor biographies.<br />If you like action or science-fiction this  is a must see.  If you've already seen it watch it again and pay particular  attention to the sets, props and score.  They are all terrific.
6304458894|1.0|First of all how can cast like this star in a movie like this espically Jack Nichollson you let me down on this movie you were just in it for the money. If i was president of the united states id rather commit suicide  than starring in this movie. AND ONE MORE THING? This movie can kiss my  a--? see if you can fill in the blank
B00000JPH5|5.0|A good fun movie that you can watch with your kids.  I've beentrying to get it on video since my son was born in '96 and I cannotwait to share this movie with him.  I think he is going to love it (espeically the f**ting swamp).
6301562925|2.0|The halloween saga has reached it's lowest poiny ( not including Halloween 3).  The movie just wasn't good.  No suspense.  Rated R for really bad movie.
B00000JMG7|4.0|A must-have for any Rory Gallagher collection. The only thing that keeps me from rating it 5 stars is the annoying and obtrusive keyboard player. I've always felt this was the case in all of Rory's recordings.   Nevertheless, it was fantastic to have something new from the most  under-appreciated artist in rock. We really miss you Mr. Gallagher.
6304458223|3.0|This highly ranks as one of my favorite movies which you can watch over and over again and not get bored with...replay value. BUT... I am giving it three stars only because I am not about to shell out that amount of money  for a DVD version with no &quot;real&quot; difference from the VHS, namely,  no widescreen! And the extras are soooo meager. This is very very  disappointing...I don't have a 16:9 set yet, but I always get widescreen  VHS (when available) to begin with as I much prefer them that way...
B0000021RB|5.0|This album is a delight, which POs me all the more because subsequent albums had as much distinction as tapioca pudding. Here, they raise the roof, with a rousing &quot;Only The Beginning,&quot; a version of &quot;I'm  A Man&quot; that Stevie Winwood only HINTED at, and so much more. And I  don't care what anybody says, I LIKE &quot;Free Form Guitar;&quot; hey,  anybody that likes Sonic Youth has got no reason at all not to like what  Terry Kath does here. A great album; if only Chicago had made more like it.
0792842723|5.0|I never saw the movie before I played Goldeneye for N64, butthey are both great. The Russian setting makes for cool scenery, andthere are a wide range of characters, from the very good and helpful Natalya Simonova, to the evil Xenia Onatopp. The plot never loses it's flavor. A must buy for any action or Bond fan.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Everyone should have this album
157330087X|1.0|Yes, there is a geat sound and a big list of performer artists. BUT there is a lote of dialogue befor any songs, that make this DVD goot to one time earing.
B000002LIM|5.0|This is one of the best scores of 1989,if not the best.It captures the dark beauty of Gotham City,as the super hero Batman chases and captures the villains. Can someone explain me why this is was not Academy Award  nominated???I can't understand,really.
B000000OAH|5.0|It was the fall of 1978 and i was a 20 year old student at the university of new orleans. My favorite band was queen and when i heard they were coming to the big easy on oct 31st i was estatic. Now put these three  together and you can understand what a cool time it was.   New orleans  french quarter, halloween night, Queen concert, Need i say  more?<br />Unfortunately their new album jazz wouldn't be on the shelves  untill a couple of weeks after that date. Well the concert was fantastic  and the partying after was a blast. One of the best times of my life! I did  get to hear 2/3 of jazz live before it was out on vinyl and i liked what i  heard. They opened with &quot;let me entertain you&quot; and to this day it  is one of my favorite queen songs.<br />This is an album of good times, a  celebration of personal freedom. Look at the words to bicycle race  &quot;i'll ride it where i like&quot;. Then there's &quot;don't stop me  now&quot; an anthem to good clean fun! &quot;Fat bottom girls&quot; is in  the same vein as is &quot;fun it&quot;. &quot;Dead on time&quot; rocks with  the best of them! This is typical queen great rock music with that  unmistakable artistic brilliance. Every song except maybe mustapha and the  dreamers ball are outstanding though &quot;jealousy&quot; isn't quite the  equal of love of my life or you take my breath away. <br />If you are a queen  fan buy it. If you are a rock fan buy it. 5.5 stars!<br />.............socks
0451169514|5.0|I thought that this was a great book. It was about a group of 5 adults called to their childhood hometown of Derry, Maine. As children, they had defeated a shape-changing monster known to them as It that ate children. As  grown-ups, the attacks have started up again. They must destroy It once and  for all. As  a child, leader Stuttering Bill Denbrough's brother was killed  by It, so Bill holds the biggest grudge against the monster. This book is  really long, but if you can make it through page 100, you get addicted. I'm  only 11, and i can tell you that this must be one of the most creative and  horrifying tales cooked up by the award-winning horrormaster himself,  Stephen King.Mass
B00000342V|5.0|A great CD that quickly brings me back to the 1970's.  The lyrics are both filled with sadness and hope.  The music wakes up a part of me that has been asleep for 25 years.
0553260111|5.0|My first &quot;action adventure&quot;!  I'm hooked!  I loved this book
0385484518|5.0|this book touched me to my very soul.i want to share it and its profoundness with all my family and friends .i feel so mush in common with this little man ,my regret is that i could not have known him or been a  student of his. once readers can get beyond the sadness of the illness to  the depth and true meaning behind it they will hopefully learn a life  lesson for themselves.  it is so outstanding ,this book that i have already  ordered one for my dad and my mother/father in law. definately a can't put  down 5 star book. i have lyme disease and this helps me put new perspective  on what i am going through.
B000001DTM|5.0|Usually you'll find that bands release albums with one or two great songs, and the rest is filler.  Not so with Achtung Baby.  Most of the tracks were excellent; they should have been hits in their own right.  U2 is a great  band, and here they're at their best.  With any luck, they'll keep churning  out good music for many years to come.
0800141326|1.0|I hated this so much I can hardly find words to express my utter contempt for all involved in this monstrous abortion.I hesitate to grace it with the word 'film'. Truly wretched.
1568493541|5.0|We all seem to be so free with our criticisms of objects of art.  When I was fired as a schoolteacher for recommending Slaughterhouse-Five and Breakfast of Champions to my college-bound seniors here in Alabama, I was  forced to confront the merits of the books.  Sure, Kurt is self-indulging.   That's why we like him.  He is a moralist.  This is a fine book that I  would recommend to every person.  It is hard to label one of KV's books the  best.  But if I were forced to do so, Breakfast of Champions would be the  best.
B00000JGOH|2.0|Technically, I suppose this movie deserves some credit.  The stage and costumes were exquisite, and, for the most part, the actors seemed to have given their all.  It wasn't their fault the flawed screenplay was as dull  as a door.  I'm sure Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave were he to  see some of the historical inaccuracies portrayed here.  The use of music  was inappropriate.  Just about every scene was filled with notes and notes  and notes, as if to cue the audience what emotion they should have at that  point.  Although I feel Paltrow is a fine actress with a stable career  ahead of her, her character in 'Sliding Doors' had much more depth.  Also,  I would have rather seen Colin Firth in the role as Shakespeare instead of  Joseph Fiennes.
B0000024KQ|5.0|From begining to end this album is spot on. I mean howay, is there another song that realeses as much stress than Shout...No, is there another verse that tells you more truth about dealing like Sticky's verse in Last  dayz...No. These nutters with brains talk about nothing but the truth, the  violent reality that we all live in and the more I listen to it, the more I  love it.
B000000OSW|5.0|An excellent, mellow, album
B000002UJQ|5.0|Suffice to say, this is a beautiful recording.  One can only hope for more quality music like this in the future from Radiohead.  They can create sounds only other bands can dream about, and all the songs are very  sincere.  Maybe British people do have souls after all...
6305470448|2.0|An entertaining, but somewhat offensive look at what &quot;might have been&quot;, but I was disappointed that it had so little depth.  It's called a comedy, yet wasn't all that funny.  Also not enough substance to  be classified as a drama.  The many references to other &quot;Bard&quot;  works does NOT transform it into a fantastic, artistic masterpiece.  The  sexual relationships could have been IMPLIED without spelling them out so  unnecessarily, and the acting, although good, wouldn't go down in history  as exceptional if it hadn't been handed an Oscar for Best Picture.  When  you compare it to classics in the past (of different genres) such as It's A  Wonderful Life, High Noon, North By Northwest,  Ben-Hur, and Chariots of  Fire; Shakespeare in Love just doesn't begin to come up to those standards  of great films.  It's entertaining, and amazingly enough was awarded  Oscars, but for all but its most ardent fans, this one will fade into the  past as just another entertaining, but not GREAT, movie.
B000002UUX|5.0|This is a really good cd. Espically the song 'Holy Wars..' When I first listened to this cd I thought it was okay because I'm use to the new stuff. But now that I have listened to it I think it's better then the new stuff.
B000005QH3|4.0|Every time I watch this film it gets better. The story is early 70's all the way, but you can learn about america at the time it was filmed. Exellent chase scenes. Makes you want a white challanger. Watch it more  that once.
0380973464|3.0|If you haven't bought this one yet, you may find the following valuable.<br />For the first third of the book, I felt I was reading an exceptionally superior piece of work and was tempted to begin throwing the  word &quot;masterpiece&quot; around.<br />In the middle third of the book, I  began to be irritated by some of the author's attempted humor, and what  appeared to be a very self-indulgent style, including long asides in a book  that was arguably too long to begin with and in need of editing.<br />Nearer  the end of the book, I formed the opinion that the book, though a great  story and a book that I found hard to put down, even when I was not happy  with it, was flawed.  Here are what I would call the flaws of the book:          The role of The General (AKA the old soldier who faded away) was  terrible.  I didn't think the stuff ascribed to Mac fit what I read about  him at all.  To me, it sounded like a description of Patton retrofitted to  the pompous Emperor of The Western Pacific.  You might not notice this if  you have a higher opinion of Gen'l. Dougie-doo than I do.         The role  of the heroic Marine is so pumped up as to make anything that Arnold  Schwartzenegger did for Hollywood look like sissy stuff.  Of course, I  realize Marines may have a bias there that would make them think the role  was, if anything, understated.  &lt;g&gt;         The inter-twining of  several families through three generations seemed far too far fetched.<br />I  think that with better editing and better story advice this would have been  one of the best books I ever read.  As it is, I am not sorry to have spent  the time on it.  I guess it is just that after the initial promise I felt  the book sagged, and that disappointed me.<br />In any event, Neal Stephenson  is brilliant!
B000002TPS|1.0|This is one infuriating record. It starts out with two strong metal songs that combine earlier Megadeth technique with newer more melodic approach, and makes one look forward to the rest of the songs, but then something  incomprehensible happens. Not ONE of the following songs come even within  an INCH of the quality displayed in the two opening songs. Strictly grade C  metal, instantly forgettable, meandering, unoriginal. A case of acute  writers block, laziness, or what? I havent heard CRYPTIC WRITINGS but  since it hasnt made any waves whatsoever, Im sorry to say that Megadeth  seem Megadead.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Obsolete is another masterpiece of indutrial metal, from the boys who do it best, Fear Factory. From the second track to the last, (Shock is kind of weak for an FF tune) Obsolete is a very well-crafted, technical metal CD.  The digipack is even better, adding 4 new very cool songs, and a cover of  Cars, which somehow turned out good. Of the 5 digipack songs, the last one,  Concreto, is the best. It's a leftover from the Demanufacture sessions,  although it sounds like Meshuggah playing in good old 4/4 time. O-O (Where  Evil Dwells) also has a Meshuggah-like tone to the sound, in that the drums  and guitars blend together in several bursts of grinding noise. All in all,  Obsolete gets 4 stars, while the digipack gets 5.
0671015206|2.0|This book is a simple read of how a few millionaires acquire wealth. They have an above average income and are incredibly frugal/tight. Now, they can retire better instead of being in poverty. But basically between ages 20-50  they were in poverty (no spending). And then from 50-80 you can spend your  money.<br />On a philosophical note, which is better, to spend your money when  you can truly have fun with it when you're 20-50 or when your life is  nearing it's end anyways 50-80.<br />I think that millionaires hoard money  too much, they live &quot;well below their means&quot; and others  (UAW..Under accumulators of Wealth) spend &quot;far above their  means&quot;. Live your life the best possible, it's far too short to let  your life pass by without having the luxuries life has to offer.<br />This  book has good advice however, which ranks it at 2 stars instead of 1.  Unfortunately, it's only about 2 sectences worth of info, spanned into  about 300 pages or so of CONSTANT repeatings. I found this book annoying as  hell.
006017322X|5.0|I first read this brilliant tale of prejudice and understanding for my O levels at school.  Since then I read it regularly every few months.  The story has everything - humour, sadness, you name it.  Recommended.
B00000I924|5.0|One of the top five innovative guitarists in rock history and this is among his best. A range of styles which may not all be to everyone's taste but all are superbly conceived and executed. I love it.  He was last here  in 1977 - when is he coming back?
B00000J7J4|3.0|I bought the CD because I am a big Matchbox 20 fan and really liked &quot;Smooth&quot; (with Rob Thomas) when I heard it on the radio. Rob Thomas steals this CD and shows that he has the versatility to synergize  with Carlos Santana's masterful, soulful, guitar. This is about it, though.  Eric Clapton, Dave Mathews, and the various hip-hop artists efforts  disappoint.
0783226128|5.0|This film rocked Hollywood in 1983, and continues to be one of the most coveted gangster pictures of all time.  Among the ranks of gangster classics such as the Godfather Trillogy, this movie ironically illustrates  the fragile balance between having everything, and losing it all.  A must  have!
B000002NJS|5.0|I can't believe the awful reviews some people have made of this CD. It's Madonna's best music ever, her voice sounds like never before, her lyrics are powerful and I just can't get tired of these songs. The best tracks are  &quot;The power of good bye&quot;, &quot;Ray of light&quot;,  &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Nothing really matters&quot;. It's a shame  &quot;Has to be&quot; wasn't included. Madonna has reached 41 years and  she's ready to evolve with the new century. Ray of light is just the first  step. MADONNA WILL ALWAYS BE THE QUEEN, THE GODDESS OF POP MUSIC AS WELL AS  A CULTURAL ICON OF THE 2Oth CENTURY!
B000005PRX|4.0|I really *loved* this thrilling sequel to Tim Burton's&quot;Batman:The Movie&quot;. Its one of my favourite movies! Both TimBurton's films are a zillion times better than Joel Schumachers 'Batman Forever' which totally s**ks, or even 'batman and Robin', which IMO, was quite good, but comapred to Batman Returns and Batman, it was nothing! Danny De Vito was the best actor in this masterpiece! No one can play the Penguin better than he can!  He beats Jack Nicholson as Joker! Michelle Pheiffer was *excellent* as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, but I was a bit dissapointed with Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne(I love him as batman though). He's not very &quot;Bruce-Waynish&quot;. They should have got someone else as Bruce Wayne! I also think they should have focused on Catwoman a little more.....they dont actually show that she's a very popular villain in Gotham City, and that people are afraid of her! Anyway, the film was terrific in its own right....the storylines couldnt be better....The film was so emotional and I also liked the darkness! The Penguin is a misguided deformed person who was abandoned by his parents because of his horrible looks. He grew up with the penguins, and was always seeking revenge on mankind, because he couldnt be a part of their society. He pretends that he's an angel, and that all he wants is to develop Goptham City, but deep inside, he's planning to make everyone miserable like him. Then we turn to Selina Kyle, who was thrown out of the window by her boss Max (who eventually teams up with the penguin to ruin Gotham City) for reading files which contained most of his evil plans. She vows revenge on her boss, and after realising that she has tremendous powers and skills, she turns into the villanous feline nemesis &quot;Catwoman&quot;. She is one of the most dangerous villains Batman ever faced, but unknown to Batman and catwoman, their alter-egos Selina and Bruce and lovers...and now Catwoman has teamed up with the Penguin to destroy Batman and wreck Gotham City!  This is one thrilling, action-packed movie which is NOT to be missed!
B00000K19E|5.0|I simply do not know where to begin; however, I will do as best I can.<br />When the movie was released the Wednesday prior to Easter, I knew something was up.  I mean, my exposure to Matrix equations in undergrad led  me to sense &quot;balls to bones,&quot; that this was a must see.  Therefore, I set out to see the movie when I left my office.  Upon my  arrival, the theatre was not as full as I anticipated; yet upon settling  in, it got a little fuller, and I was ready for anything.  Boy did I get  it.  When the movie was over, I sat there in awe.  I peeled myself from my  seat to leave.  Having done so, I, once outside of the theatre, decided to  see it again; that evening.  I have seen it so much, my colleges are  suggesting that I have a &quot;problem.&quot;  I reply, that seeking  knowledge, and its accompanying behavior has, for millennia, been regarded  as &quot;weird.&quot;<br />This movie is crammed with many levels of  information that I, like Morpheus, tell others &quot;The Matrix, no one can  tell you what it is.  You have to see it for yourself.&quot;<br />By far, this  movie is a thinking person's movie.  In that it deals with juxtaposing our  world as we &quot;know&quot; it with the created world of &quot;The  Matrix.&quot;  In other words, we create the reality, collectively and  individually, we experience at any given moment.  Be it our clothes,  careers, institutions, constructs, or places of residence.  We create it  all.  It is the proverbial &quot;dream world.&quot;<br />I am choosing my  words carefully in an effort not to give the movie away.  Yet, I must say  if you are looking for an understanding of the world around you, please  see/buy this movie.  Please remember, everything in this movie has a  meaning; EVERYTHING.  Its philosophical, theological, sociological, and  esoteric messages will cause you to become not unlike myself, a walking  question mark.  Let your journey begin.<br />Travel in peace.
078062369X|1.0|This movie stinks! Its totally disgusting! Its one of the worst filsm ever made! Theres more blood in it than in a million people! If you like this movie, you have to be *sick*! Stay away from this disaster! Its doesnt even  deserve one star!
0393312836|5.0|I had heard all of the hype about this book before reading it, and I'm happy to say that the hype is absolutely warranted!  Clockwork Orange is this mind-blowing story about the freedom of choice and the consequences of  totalitarianism and being trapped in an extremist world.  Is being evil on  your own terms far better than being good on someone elses?<br />If you're not  sure, and you're ready for a thrilling and fast-paced read,  &quot;slooshy&quot; me and read this &quot;veshch&quot;.  You will  &quot;veddy&quot; what I mean...
B0000019HU|4.0|Don't be turned off by the idiotic &quot;math rock&quot; nomer.  This is a spare yet dense, very dynamic record and the sounds you hear prefigured the sounds of many other bands. These guys do the odd time signatures with a  smooth groove, and it doesn't smack of &quot;prog&quot; or &quot;jazz&quot;  (which is good!) They do the &quot;loud/soft&quot; thing as though they  invented it. There is certainly a spidery, creepy feeling to all the songs.  The other reviews here are correct about the vocals. They are throwaway,  though not annoying--they're more just 'there.' The only annoying thing is  they keep this record from being truly &quot;great&quot; music. Maybe no  vocals should have been the way--if you've got nothing to say and no talent  to say it with, why bother trying? Lame, aloof vocals are the bane of indie  rock! Steve Albini called this a &quot;landmark?&quot; Well, I don't know.  One thing about Albini is he either doesn't care about or have an ear for  vocals, or possibly, he just has particular tastes. Another thing about  Albini is he's usually right! And he does record a hell of a record. I  don't think &quot;Spiderland&quot; has that memorable quality or emotional  pull that truly great music has. But it is a record of substance, I think  it will stand up very well with the passage of time, and it can be seen as  a primer for a particular strain of independent rock music.
0767817443|1.0|Quite frankly, one of the worst movies ever made. Perio
B00000J7RZ|3.0|I like &quot;If you had my love&quot; and listened to a little of this disc at Borders -- it seemed pretty good.  But when I got it home and listened to the songs all the way through, a lot of them were really  repetitious and boring.  I think she's a good singer but I only liked about  2 other songs besides &quot;If&quot;.  Too bad!  I can't stand the hokey  &quot;talk-singing&quot; routine (pseudo-sexy murmuring in Spanish) that  she does near the end of one otherwise good song.
B00000K19E|5.0|I thought that the concept was great. This was a visually stunning and original movie. I recommend it highly.
B00000I1OY|4.0|This film, written and directed by the Perry's (a husband and wife team who also are responsible for several other films with mental health themes) stars Burt Lancaster who does, in my opinion, a beautiful job.  It is based  on a short story by Cheevers, which it follows faithfully (with an added  scene where the protagonist meets the young girl and obviously is  recreating his youth).  The Director's were changed during the filming, I  believe, and I am not sure who did or redid several scenes.  This is a film  which I have used in my teaching of psychiatric residents to illustrate the  diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I really loved this CD! It has funny songs, like &quot;Pretty Fly For a White Guy&quot; and &quot;Walla Walla.&quot; But it also has some songs that really tell it like it is, like &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright.&quot;  If you liked their last album, you'll love this one even more! OFFSPRING  RULES! :)
068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourt strikes just the right timbre for a memoir of such misery. There is a matter-of-fact tone to the book that resonates and stays with you and in your consciousness when you're not turning the pages eagerly for  the next Limerick adventure. There are plenty of tragedies in McCourt's  young life, but the distance and stoicism with which he tells the story  allows a deeper involvement by the reader than one would allow oneself if  the tone were outright maudlin or weepy. There's a humor here and an  acceptance that is admirable and that also contribute to hope. It's a  compelling story and a compelling life and I strongly recommend it.
B000002KDZ|5.0|It's a shame that this band never got as popular as Santana, because this was truly a band ahead of it's time. Listen to how tight the whole band is and that was almost 30 years ago. I bought the album then and I bought the  cd as soon as it came out. Jorge Santana is as good or better than Carlos,  the percussion was better(some of the percussionist here later went with  Santana) and also Luis Gasca on trumpet,what a great horn player, don't  know what happened to him but would like to know. He did a solo album that  I would love to find on cd. If you love Latin music with a touch of rock  and jazz buy this cd, you will not be sorry.
B00000JMG7|5.0|What an incredible surprise collection this is! First we were treated to the re-issue of Rory's catalogue albums, remastered with bonus cuts, and now this shining jewel from the BBC archives. Wow! I assume that since you  are reading this you are already a fan of Rory Gallagher's music. Well,  from one fan to another, don't even think about not buying the CD. The  &quot;live&quot; disc alone is a treasure; Rory at his absolute, typically  stunning best! Plus you get an equally impressive set of &quot;studio&quot;  recordings on the second disc. Arguably, this may be the best Rory  Gallagher release ever! Big thanks to Rory's brother Donal for making it  happen. The &quot;Bullfroggers&quot;, as Rory's internet fan club members  are known, are just ecstatic about the set! Buy it and you'll know why.
B00000JG41|4.0|Definately a different Mr. Bungle, but its really good.  Much more soothing and interesting than their previous work, it lacks the wacked out circus music but the cool mellow tracks are kick ass.  I liked it a lot,  not as good as their first album but way better than their second.  Check  it out.
B000002J1B|5.0|WOW, and again ... WOW.  This continues to be one of my favorite Yes albums that never ceases to astonish.  As others have said, this is not an easy acquisition.  Only a Yes fan will have bought it in the first place,  but many will reject it too soon without giving it the attention it  deserves and demands.  At first the sensory assault seems too overwhelming  and terribly disjointed.  But give it a couple of more chances and it  becomes a transcendant treasure.  After a time the way through the  &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; becomes clear and resplendant to a summit  pouring out into the epiphany of the mystical and wafting &quot;Soon.&quot;   This isn't background music!  It demands close attention.  Headphones  help.  Leave your world behind when you approach this one.  This is Yes at  their best, and given all their other great albums, this is saying a great  deal.
6304366019|5.0|Very believable portrayal by DeNiro.  I was sure it was Judy Garland I was watching, Minnelli is her mirror image.  Warning though, the fight scene in the car will make you cry.  That was a little tough to watch for me.
B000002J1U|5.0|This is possibly my favorite Led Zeppelin album, and it's certainly their most underrated.  Before I say anything else, did I read right?  Did someone below say that &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; sucks?  That's insane.   &quot;OOTT&quot; is one of their great lost classics, and I can't believe  that anyone could be aware of that tune and not like it.  <br />This album  definitely benefits from its lack of radio saturation (i.e. Zeppelin IV).   In short, this album deserves a place in your collection, certainly before  either of their first two records.  Get it!
0767836251|5.0|First let me say, I liked the movie.  Everyone was great in it, and Christine Baranski was a hoot.  Sara Michelle Gellar really has shown some range lately with her different roles.  I think she'll go far.  The only  problem I had with it, was I knew everything that was going to happen due  to the way they had advertised it, and when I finally got a chance to see  it, nothing surprised me!
6305205620|5.0|This set is awesome.  It's almost like being there.  Especially if you have the system to handle it.  I've been to two of there concerts and I've never seen them this close. Excellent DVD's!
0375701427|5.0|I loved this book. It shaked me and it hurted me but it gave me real emotions. In a world only made of appearances (you are what you appear) and of superficial relationships this book showed what real life is. Yes, not  everybody has a terrorist as a daughter, but please look into yourself...  how many difficult , unconfessable moments have you encountered in your  life? How many silences ? Roth gives voice to these silences and with a  clear cut description of details shows us the &quot;real&quot; life in  deep.
B00000IL1K|5.0|One of the most influential, inspiring and compelling Music that I've heard until now. An adventure into the deepest of all senses, with every song there is a fantasy or a realm that will drift you away towards a  sanctuary with infinite boundaries.
0684874350|5.0|If you didn't think someone could live as poorly as the McCourts did and survive past childhood, this book would be a real revelation. A fatalist would read this remarkable story as a great, depressing tragedy. An  optimist, on the other hand, would recognise the wonderful humor and love  of life that kept these little boys going. They are true survivors, in  spite of and as a result of their incredible beginning.
B000000W5L|5.0|I still own my 27 original Stones purchases on vinyl, and Exile on Main Street is easily in my Top 3. Why?? Because of classics like Tumbling Dice, Rocks Off, Rip This Joint and Happy?? No actually, because of the plethora  of beautiful non-hits all over this album.<br />Sweet Virgina, Shine A Light  (beautiful), Loving Cup (incredible), Sweet Black Angel, I Just Want To see  His face and All Down the Line are some of the greatest songs out of  Jaggar/Richards. Bluesy, diverse, rocking, they are differnet songs but  united by some of their best lyric writing. The sympathy and redemption of  Shine a Light is tremendous, the country rock of Sweet Virgina will lift a  mood, and Loving Cup is one of the best all around rock songs the Stones  gave us. You will be straining to sing &quot;Give Me a Little  Drink.....From Your Loving Cup&quot;, after your second listen, I  promise.....
068815333X|5.0|The two things that really impressed me about Prayers for Rain were the intricacy of the story line and the improvement of Lehane's prose.  The plot had more twists and turns than an Irish back road but no dead ends  (although Bubba's multi-faceted skill set does, more than once, make him a  machina ex deus).  <br />Lehane maintained the pace with a writing style that  flows easily, markedly better than his earlier works, and they weren't  noticably awkward.<br />I was so engrossed in Prayers for Rain that I missed a  flight call in the Cleveland airport, of course I was going to Cincinnati.
B00000K2SC|5.0|this is by far, one of the most spectacular sci-fi movies that i have seen in years. the effects were very well done, and there was actually a plot that kept my eyes glued to the screen!  although i'm not a big fan of Keanu  Reeve's work, this is his best effort yet. Fishburne and Moss were  excellent. the kung fu actions scenes were outta sight! if only i could  martial arts that easily... i saw this movie 3 times and i cannot wait to  get my hands on this video. i don't usually rant and rave about movies, but  this movie is different!
6302413931|5.0|Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's best film and I'm wondering why it hasn't been released on DVD yet...please let me know when it will be.<br />Mike
6305075468|5.0|I have been intrigued and fascinated by this seminal vampire movie for many years, so when I discovered its release on DVD, I was excited, to say the least. I was not disappointed. The original primary colored camera  filter effects are restored, as well as the organ soundtrack (newly  recorded), as opposed to the head-scratching Type O-Negative death-metal  soundtrack used with the VHS release. An unbelievably creepy film that  retains its power to this day. Also, this DVD boasts an impressive array of  bonus features so lacking in many DVD releases. A must-see for fans of the  bizarre.
B000002A3T|5.0|I know what a lot of you will say - there is no Floyd without Waters.  Perhaps you are right. Yes this album like Lapse of Reason is heavily tinged by Gilmour's style, which many say is not 'real' Floyd.  Well I  don't care what you call it - I absolutely loved this album.  In fact the  only album I like better than Division Bell is Lapse of Reason.  <br />Many  may claim that this is not classic Floyd and I agree.  But that does not  take away the fact that this is a brilliant album.<br />I for one like the new  Floyd style better than the old one.  If you are looking for a classic  Floyd album you will be disappointed, if you have an open mind and can  appreciate good music without placing limits as to what it 'should' sound  like - you'll love it.
B00000IBRX|2.0|I recommend people watching this movie with their TV set on 'mute', just look at the colors on the screen.
0792156684|1.0|First of all, the poor casting selections did the film in fromthe get-go.Leo DiCaprio looks all of about 16 years old and has aface oily enough to grease a cookie sheet.  Kate Winslet is a portly petunia whose acting is so contrived that you wish Jack wouldn't have given up his spot on the floating wreckage.  The worst thing about &quot;Titanic&quot;?  All the laudits from people who don't know what a good film is will only serve to feed James Cameron's massive ego. Look for another disservice to the movie industry at a theater near you.  Oh, and James, pick someone else besides Celine Dion to screech your next theme song, please.
B000000ZGO|5.0|I purchased the LP of this Isaac Hayes Album back in 1970. I had it for a long time and really enjoyed it then as well as I do not. A great version of &quot;By The Time I Get To Phenoix&quot;.&quot;One Woman&quot; brought  back some memories. You won't be sorry if you purchase it.
B000002JPA|5.0|I hadn't heard of them before...and when I did, it was because I heard &quot;Take the Time&quot;...my brother had bought the CD. It's a brilliant band, still showing that there are people capable of treating music with  the respect it deserves. John Petrucci, Kevin Moore, John Myung, and Mike  Portnoy- this is a band with top-class names that brings on constantly  top-class music. Amidst the lightning-quick finger movements racing along  fretboards or synthesizer keys, the musical sensitivity is evident here,  the soul, the harmony...everything for a masterpiece, a sheer lesson of  musicianship brilliance, is here. Enjoy.
0767835107|5.0|Don't get me wrong, this was a great movie.. I loved every aspect of it.. superb casting imo, but if you own a JVC dvd player, do not invest in buying/renting the dvd just yet.  You won't be able to watch the movie,  just a blank screen, and what's worse is, trying to play the movie, causes  the dvd player not to be able to read other dvd discs...  BEWARE!
B000002JEV|5.0|The BBC Sessions, a two-CD set, present Led Zeppelin at their peak, and is vastly superior to their 1976 release of &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, which captures a less-energized Led Zep live in 1973.               CD One is culled from 1969 BBC performances and is largely blues  oriented.  While &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; is represented three  times (once is adequate), standout tracks include &quot;Dazed and  Confused&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; which is equal to (or  better) than the studio version.       CD Two is culled from 1971 BBC  performances f few months prior to release of their monumental 4th album.   All songs on this CD are excellent and demonstrate that Led Zeppelin was  one hell of a live band.  Particularly good is the 18 1/2 minute version of  &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; that contains a very haunting instrumental  solo by Jimmy Page and proves that Page was one of the best guitarists  ever.  To get the full effect of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, turn off  all lights and turn on a lava lamp or facsimile, sit back and relax.  It's  a neat way to blow your mind without chemicals.  Don't pass up  &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Stairway to  Heaven&quot; or &quot;That's the Way&quot;, all of which were superbly  performed with both accuracy and innovation.       The BBC Sessions is the  ONLY CD in which I bought two- one for home and one for the classroom.  As  an owner of 300+ CDs, the above remark alone confirms how great this CD  really is.
B000003S0R|5.0|Don't even bother listening to dopes who give this less than 5 stars or who think that Eno rocking out is &quot;believe-it-or-not&quot; material.  They're probably quite young and quite tall.  This is possibly the  strangest, and certainly the greatest, pop-rock record ever made.  If you  don't own it, there is a gaping hole in your collection (and your life).
0788816454|2.0|I should have known better than to even think I would like this movie.  I like Adam Sandler, but....I hate football, and the two just don't mix at all.  I guess Drew Barrymore must bring out the best in 'ol Adam.  Happy  Gilmore and the Wedding Singer were MUCH better!!!!!
6302824613|1.0|The unfunniest comedy ever made. Might have worked as a 89 minute film...but at two hours plus...ouch ouch ouch. You will laugh at the 4 or 5 minutes in which Woody Allen stars, otherwise this is a piece of trash.  Save your time..save your money.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|I have had friends show me their DVD video collections and haveplayed a few titles for me, showing off the features available on thedisks.  But as a new DVD owner myself, this version of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; makes the best use of this technology that I have seen so far.  By providing so much background information about the film and its creation I came away with a better sense of the contributions made by the actors, writers, and directors.  And the ability to compare storyboard information with certain scenes and the animation concept of certain scenes with the finished product makes this a DVD that any movie buff would love to own.
0780626494|4.0|It's fantastic to see a movie that delivers legitimate entertainment. Silverstone, Fraser and Walken were terrific! When a movie makes you laugh like this one, it's a keeper. Simple is better. Boy meets girl back to the  basics.The film was meant to be a good time and it was nothing less. Alicia  silverstone once again shows that she is a diversified actress that spells  Quality.
6303913881|2.0|I love campy movies, and this borders on camp.  But the good thing about real trash classics is that they are basically likeable.  There's nothing likeable about this!  This movie reveals a lot of female flesh.  After, oh,  about ten minutes of nonstop bare body parts, that gets pretty dull.  Then  you start to notice the people and the words attached to the nudes. . .and,  oh my God. . .your breath is sucked away by the stupidity of the dialogue  and, OK, I'll say it!  The hideousness of the faces!  As Gene Siskel said  about this movie, &quot;Elizabeth Berkley doesn't look good.  I'm talking  about her face.&quot;  That's for sure.  When she's not batting her  mascara-encrusted eyelashes, she's pouting and snarling.  Then, when she  opens her mouth, she whines or yells.  Boy, I sure would like to know her  better!  And Kyle McLachlan.  Whatever happened to him?  After this  disaster, he couldn't even get a part on a soap opera.  He looks puffy and  gross.  I don't know if he was made up to look like a jaded Vegas  sleazeball, but I tend to think not.  He probably did some major drinking  to work up the nerve to do his role.  Then, last but not least (Berkley is  the least), there's Gina Gershon, who, I admit, I will never forgive for  doing the travesty 'This World, Then The Fireworks'.  What an actress.  Do  you know what this movie makes me think of?  Rodents.  Elizabeth Berkley,  in a hilariously un-sexy love scene, slaps her back on the surface of a  pool like a beaver tail warning away viewers.  And Gina Gershon looks like  Bugs Bunny.  Who would buy her as Vegas' top showgirl?  Boy, this review  has been disjointed and illiterate, but I found that my IQ slipped about 30  points after watching this movie, and it'll take some reading Mark Twain or  viewing 'The Virgin Spring' to raise it again.
B000009ED0|1.0|With music like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit ruling the charts, it's no wonder that our society is so problematic these days. It's very disturbing that this is what our high school kids are being fed. What's even more  disturbing is that all these Kid Rock-worshipping young people are going to  be running the country some day. The USA is in trouble. <br />I wish that some  sort of campaign could be used to introduce our young people to good music.  If Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock are all that our kids are being exposed to,  they will have a very perverted idea of what the art form of music actually  is. If you kids want to hear good rock and roll music, I suggest you buy  the Beatles' white album. This will give you an idea of what music was like  back when musicians actually had talent.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is a truly remarkable and wondrous recording. Pay no attention to the naysayers. This set of recordings shows amazing breadth and versatility and every single track is a gem. Get it.. get it now.
B000006OAM|5.0|I have close to 200 Cd's and this one is absolutly one of my favorites.  Her voice is one of the most beautiful that I have heard.  The third song KIND AND GENEROUS is full of humility, something a lot of people in her  industry need to learn.
031218087X|2.0|Really an upsetting book. The flip's notes claims it isinspired to very well informed and updated intelligence and encryptionsources, but you won't find nothing much more than what G.Banford wrote in his excellent &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; (1982). The book even contains evident mistakes about the origin of the internet (clearly, the auhtor did'nt read another great book - Where The Wizard Stay Up To Late). The characters are quite obviuos: the heroin (as the book say, the firs swimsuit model, doctor in mathematics), the bad guy (a nuclear radiation addicted Japanese scientist who betrayed the bold ones). the psychology analisys is almost absent throughout the book. The style is nothing special (even for a foreign reader like me) compared to other novelist (i.e. M.Chricton's Jurassic Park, A.Dershowitz's' The advocate's devil. No comment about the role choosed by author for the EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation), who appear like an annoying fly who buzz all around.
0140281622|5.0|at first the book seemed to long.but the more you read on and start having the sensation you feel like you are actually IN the book,which forces you to take a break.but the break won't take too long because you can't wait to  read and finish this wonderful piece of art that seems contemporary in our  unstable economy/world. bye from ISRAEL.
630179513X|4.0|This movie is only good after you havent watched it for a long while. The Old West seams to be a little boring. Well anyways, The Story is not as good as #2. The Barroom scene where Marty first encounters Buford &quot;Mad  Dog&quot; Tannen, is interesting.
6304479689|4.0|This is Elvis in a decidedly post-comeback funk, looking tired, stoned and bored much of the time, going through a routine that he, very obviously, was no longer enjoying a great deal. At one point in the film, Elvis is  sitting in the back of his limousine after a show and asks, half-heartedly,  &quot;How was the sound in that building&quot; as if he could care less.   As one of his bodyguards noted after his death, Elvis needed a challenge  more than anybody he knew, and the challenge by 1972 was no longer there.  Compare this depressing documentary with the exuberant, involved Elvis of  his '68 Comeback Special and Elvis--That's The Way It Is in 1970 and you   plainly see the rapid deterioration that ultimately would lead to his death  in his Graceland bathroom only five years later.
078322706X|5.0|An unusual and interesting story with excellent acting throughout.  Interpersonal conflict mixed with a fascinating love story.  I loved the scene where Susan talks with the stranger in the coffee shop and without  exchanging names discuss rather personal issues.  Brad Pitt plays this  character so well and naturally - highly animated with lots of smiles and  gestures.  So much personal charm and appeal.  You would expect him to ask  Susan out or at least get her phone number.  They obviously hit it off, but  after all the chit chat they part realizing that they may not meet again.   How sad!  The music brings out this emotion so that you personally feel the  loss of an opportunity that might have sparked a wonderful romance is gone  forever.<br />When Susan sees the guy again and Death has taken his body,  she's put off that he doesn't seem the same charming guy she was smitten  with in the shop earlier that day.  Claire Forlani is another natural for  her role as Susan.  She conveys so much with her facial expression and the  timing of her dialog.  Pitt's part as death is peculiar indeed.  Awkward,  uncertain yet extremely polite.  Brad plays this part with a great deal of  quirkiness and subtle humor.  He's really entertaining.  The movie and  dialog plays slowly.  It allows the viewer to really study and absorb  what's going on.  As death, Joe pursues Susan with the same fervor as the  guy in the coffee shop but with less animation, he's much more formal and  rather stiff - always dressed in black, like an undertaker.<br />Hopkins is  equally impressive as Susan's father.  he plays the role with the  excellence you expect to see from Anthony Hopkins.  Another wonderful  performance!  He's determined to keep his business from being derailed even  though has little time left.  He conveys so much affection for his family  all the time keeping the secret that his life is about to end.    <br />The  music throughout this movie is filled with emotion and fits each scene  perfectly.  I loved the music so much I bought the Soundtrack  CD.<br />&quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; is a highly personal experience.  It may  not click with everyone, but for those who appreciate its message, it  offers much to ponder about relationships, and seeking passion in work,  love and life itself.
6305291446|3.0|I said that because it wasn't that gory and the wait between the beginning and the end was too long.  Another was that they never mentioned Halloween 4-6.  They could of at least acknowledged it when they searched Marion's  house by saying &quot;Call haddonfield, warn them that Micheal could be  coming.  Rated R for violence/terror and language.

0767819543|5.0|there shines the foreign-film market.  i cannot wait till this film is out on video for the masses.  i saw it back in feb of 99 and i absolutely loved the stunning story-line of this brasilian film.  it truly is a unique film  and should be seen by everyone.  i'd rather go see gems like this than  anything hollywood can dish out.
B000005J56|1.0|Great proof that slide guitar doesn't go with everything.  Should have been subtitled &quot;How to Ruin Good Music.&quot;  The bad news is that there is a whole world of music for Cooder to butcher in his inimitable  way.
B00000IQUT|5.0|I had been trying to get this film for a long time and when i finally did, i thought it was a cool movie. I only recommend this film to horror/gore/revenge film lovers. I myself am a fan of horror/gore movies  and i think it is great.
B000001C6M|1.0|What the hell is this?  I used to listen to Slayer just for laughs, but I recently sold my collection because I grew so tired of their neverending rant.  FACT: This band has no talent.  Tom Araya can't sing; he spends most  of the record trying to sound tough and going through a series of  high-pitched screams (TORMENTAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!) His bass-playing is  inexcusably sloppy, but most often its drowned out by the over-amped  guitars.  Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman need to learn how to play solos -  solos are meant to be melodic and powerful.  They don't consist of running  your fingers up and down the fretboard in random bursts.  Dave Lombardo may  be a decent drummer, but how can you tell?  He spends the whole album  beating on the drums as fast and as wildly as he possibly can.  Lyrically,  the album is a joke.  The lyrics are ridiculous to say the least, and  really don't make a whole lot of sense.  They try to be dark and Satanic,  but how can you take these guys seriously?  Grade A crap, all the way.
B00000AFGM|4.0|this isnt near as wierd or good as superstar but its good though, it sounds like garbage (the band i mean), its not heavy at all but its pretty cool though, the only reason that superstar was better was cause trent  reznor worked on it, and keep in mind, mr. manson isnt the one who comes up  with the riffs or the music, no one ever gives the rest of the band any  credit, they do most of the work
B00000K19E|5.0|Anyone who gives this movie less than 4 stars needs to be shot and killed or get a brain transplant with a smart person. How could you fall asleep in this film. Ground-breaking effects, nearly top-notch acting, great plot and  storyline, and almost every form of genre! Truly Brilliant!!!
B00000IOSU|5.0|I wish they had added other songs like 'Into the Fire', which is a wondrous song live. Still, Sarah sings with such passion that its nearly impossible not to enjoy all these songs. She is clearly the finest  singer/songwriter among all females today. How Sheryl Crow was ahead of her  in the 100 best female singers of all time is a true mystery. I like Crow  but she isnt nearly as talented as Sarah.
B000005JXG|5.0|I love this CD! I just can't bring myself to take it out of my diskman! this is my favorite Pogues CD as of yet.
B00000099Y|5.0|it has really good songs but the problem is there are 14 tracks and only about 7 or 8 of them are actaul songs, i can understand why they would want to put in some wierd stuff to help add to the mood of the album but i think  it woulda been better with more songs, its great but don't buy it if you  don't like art rock stuff, to me it seems like nirvana and r.e.m. mixed,  its cool though.
B000002MUQ|5.0|Balance is, without question, one of the finest albums ever recorded.  Van Halen has taken music and perfected their style.  This CD offers a several different types of music, from the love songs (Not Enough, Can't Stop  Loving You) to the plain old rock and roll (Aftershock, Big Fat Money).   This CD is a great investment, I have been listening to it for several  years and I have yet to grow tired of it.
B000002JS6|5.0|The first great album of the 1980's.  Not only one of the best metal CDs of all time, but one of the best ROCK CDs.  Killer.
B000007NYS|5.0|I love the sound of Lucinda Williams voice.   It allots a sound of passion and familiarity.... I would love to see her again-----best show I have ever seen in concert.
6300214400|4.0|The third movie in the Star Trek series is the second segment in the ongoing storyline that spans over three of the Star Trek movies, and is often considered to be the weakest of the three.  However, I think the  movie comes off quite well and stands on its own out of the large shadows  of the successess of &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;The Voyage  Home.&quot;  Leonard Nimoy is brilliant in the director's chair.  William  Shatner turns in a solid performance as the defiant Admiral Kirk, who  disobeys orders and steals the Enterprise. And he does all of this in order  to save his fellow officers and friends Spock (Nimoy and several different  child actors) and Dr. McCoy (DeForrest Kelley.)  Christopher Lloyd is  captivating as the ruthless Kruge and Robin Curtis, having the difficult  job of trying to fill Kirstie Alley's shoes, does a fine job as Lt. Saavik.   You'll certainly want to see the followup movie.
0380973464|3.0|Well written, but as others have said, the ending is just not there.  Stephenson keeps going, and has a hard time ended the story.  If you like computers, this book will be more enjoyable.
B00000J8EK|4.0|When I heard the first track on this album, I thought this was going to be cheesy, but as I listened to the other tracks, I started liking it. Some good tracks are: &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;Out of  Control&quot;, &quot;Got Glint?&quot;, &quot;Hey Boy Hey Girl&quot;, and  &quot;Surrender&quot;. The others are fairly good to listen to as well.
6303029027|5.0|I just saw this video, and it was great brought me back to the time when I lived in the Bronx.  Lillo Brancato was great as Robert DiNero's son.  He looked so much like him!  Everybody should see this movie.
B00000JYGX|5.0|I bought this CD while I was in Paris earlier this year not knowing what it was about, being from Australia and not knowing much French.  However, from the moment I played it the music was so strong and powerful that  cultural boundaries are transcended to make way for a deeper meaning.....It  is about Quasimodo - the Hunchback of Notre Dame and his search for  acceptance in society.  I did not know this until my cousins from France  explained it to me!!!  But it does'nt matter whether or not you can  understand a thing they say because the music is so amazing.......The song  Bohemienne and my French cousin Nassif's favourite Belle send shivers down  the spine!!....It can be put on the same level as the Phantom of the Opera  in the sheer masterpiece of this truely fine French musical. I can't wait  for the English version to be released!
0783233477|5.0|I just saw this DVD and I was so impressed by the delicate feelings expressed throughout the movie, but shocked that it didn't do so well at the movies. It goes to show us that people nowadays prefer violent movies.  This movie was incredibly sensitive, the acting was fantastic, by all  actors involved, Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and the rest. I haven't seen  such a delicate and sensitive story in years! Thank you Mr. Brest!  What's  wrong wiith people? Have we become so ignorant that we cannot accept  something so beautiful?
B00000IHHN|5.0|This album is so amazing that no review can do it justice.....I don't speak French, but it doesn't make any difference when it comes to Notre Dame......Bohemienne and Belle are fantastic masterpieces......if you don't  have this one get it today!!!!
B00000JPH5|5.0|Oh my God, they heard my prayers, comnplaintsdand demands and it is finally coming back out on video. It is such a kick, I love this movie. It is my favorite of all time. It is not just a kids movie, but every one can  enjoy it. Goblins kidnap a fifteen year old girl's baby brother. She has to  travel through the Goblin King's Labyrinth inorder to save him or else her  brother will be turned into a goblin.<br />Angel of Love

B00000J7RZ|1.0|If the point here is music, I am afraid Jenny , you missed it. Incongruity between vocals and background beats ; and the attempt to mix R&amp;B, lateino and dance pop makes the Jennifer Lopez CD a big fiasco.In fact  according to my esimation, this is the worst CD I've ever recommended for  the university's library.
6304383827|5.0|This is absolutely the best movie made this decade!  Even my teenage brother likes it, and when I'm with my girl friends, we watch it over and over and over and over and over!  There's always a new word, a new glance,  a new nuance of meaning to be found and laughed at!  BUY IT, TRUST ME!
B000000OQY|5.0|Patience is one of the greatest song's ever written in my opinion.  All the acoustic track's are very will done.  The song I USED TO LOVE HER &quot;but I had to kill hear&quot;, made me laugh for hours. The live  recordings are also EXCELLENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH POWER!<br />DO NOT  LISTEN THE COMMENT ABOUT THIS BEING TRASH BECAUSE OF THE OFFENSIVE LYRICS!   If you can't handle raw in your face music with powerful lyrics, GN'R are  not the band for you.  Besides you must not listen to modern music if you  can't handle harsh and in you face lyrics!
6303029027|5.0|I just finished watching A Bronx Tale for about the 30th time on cable and came to this site just to order it because I wanted to be able to watch it over and over again.  It is an honest, touching, warm story about real life  and its conflicts.  DeNiro shows us the real side of struggling between  right and wrong plus following our hearts.  All characters were portrayed  as real people. I will watch this movie again and again and cry each time.
B00000JCB2|1.0|I've never thought less of a band.  Ever
B00000JGHM|5.0|I'm usually critical of ridiculous mistakes directors make in otherwise decent movies, but Heat is close to perfect.  Simply one of the best &quot;cops &amp; robbers&quot; films ever made.
B00000JZIK|5.0|The movie it self is very good and interesting but when you seethe end it just makes you see the whole movie in a different, betterway. I think it's one of the best film noir/suspense movies I ever saw.
B00000JGOH|3.0|I love this movie.  The screenplay is very clever, the acting superb.  But I was disappointed by the DVD.  The image transfer is excellent.  The 5.1 soundtrack didn't use the surround channels as much as they could have, but  it still sounded good.  The main complaint that I have with the disc is the  lack of any supplementary material.  This disc was originally marketed as a  special edition with deleted scenes and commentaries but the actual disc  contained only the movie and the trailer.  If you don't care about  commentaries, this is still a great disc.  But if you enjoy supplemental  material on a DVD, as I do, you will be disappointed.  I suppose that  Di$ney will put out the special edition in another 6 months so that we all  buy the disc again.  <br />The second issue that I have with this disc is that  the layer switch occurs at a bad time.  Layer switches should occur at  major scene changes or slower parts of the movie so that they aren't  noticed.  This one interrupts the action between the time when Will learns  of Marlowe's death and when he storms out of the bar.  It just didn't flow  well with the layer change interruption.
0380973464|2.0|Stephenson seems to have gotten in the good graces of his publisher to an extent where no one reined him in. The premise was great; the characters fascinating and then the book dribbles to a nonsensical conclusion as if  Stephenson really didn't care that much and wanted to move on. Too bad as  it's now a huge blemish on his reputation. Hope the next one is tighter.  Hear this Neal?

B00000ILDE|5.0|Before TITANIC, before TERMINATOR 2, and before THE ABYSS, James Cameron made what is the ne plus ultra of his action-film output, ALIENS.  Many of us wondered what on earth could a sequel to ALIEN ever be like.  Ridley  Scott's mesmerizingly terrifying Gothic thriller in space seemed as if it  couldn't be matched.  And indeed, wisely, Cameron found the way to do it by  avoiding the horror-movie aspect, and instead fashioning one of the finest  pieces of filmmaking in the action genre.  ALIENS is a war movie of almost  unstoppable velocity. This new DVD version includes the 20 minutes or so of  footage that 20th Century Fox demanded be removed to keep down the  theatrical running time.  The new footage (previously available only on the  boxed-set laserdisc) forestalls the action elements, yet provides very  clear motivation for the character of Ripley to embrace the discovery of  the lone little girl on the &quot;alien&quot; planet.  This footage  stretches the introductory sequences to about 45 minutes, but once the  story is set up, the action set pieces begin coming in gangbusters style  for the remaining two-thirds of the picture.<br />Beautifully, intelligently  designed, photographed and edited, ALIENS mixes suspense, terror, and  full-throttle action in a supremely confident and entertaining manner.  The  DVD's picture is intensely sharp, and the 5.1 digital surround howls with  power.  The movie has never looked or sounded this good on home video.  For  thrills and chills, it's a one-of-kind experience.
0385484518|4.0|What shines through in this biographical sketch of Morrie&quot;s last days on earth is Mitch Albom&quot;s love for his former mentor, teacher, and, as he called him, coach. He sheds tears for Morrie's passing at the end of the  book and so do we. Thanks to the author's report, we too shed a tear at the  passing of a simple but noble human being. And Morrie's lessons to us are a  tonic for this violence-ridden culture of ours. Thank you Mitch for sharing  a painful but valuable experience with readers all over America and  elsewhere. If the book changes the heart and perspective of even one reader  about what is important in life, it will have been a successful  book. Oh  that we all are able to face death with such humor and courage!
B000003NA4|5.0|Diane has an incredible voice, and her songs seem to flow with a sense of greatness.
0385484518|5.0|I read this book in 2 nights.  I recommend it to anyone from the ages of 10 to 110.  It makes you appreciate life, growing old, compassion for the sick, and friendship. If you've ever lost someone through a terminal  illness, I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down. You'll be  laughing and crying throughout this book.
0792842103|5.0|Another incredible film from Frankenheimer!  The world did not know first-rate directing before Frankenheimer.  Toss in a outstanding performance by DeNiro and you've got one hell of a film.  Car chase makes  &quot;French Connection&quot; look like a ride in the park on a bicycle.   Underrated during its run in theaters, Ronin is perhaps the best action  films of the nineties.
B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Young has written countless classics but this album is probably his most cohesive and heart-wrenching.  It seems to capture all the soaring highs and crushing lows that the sixties drug party dragged along with it.   One listen to &quot;Borrowed Tune&quot;--that drunk, creaking voice--and  you know that you're hearing an artist incapable of slickness.  Neil Young  is always who he is at the moment he records.  It may not always be pretty  but it's always honest.
B000000WFU|4.0|The first time I played this CD was on the weekend in the office (sigh) cranking out Visual Basic code.  I left it on repeat the whole day.<br />The idea of music that has the form of vocal music but substitutes nonsense  syllables for the words is disturbing, particularly when some of it music  reminds me of religious music which has both nourishing CONTENT as well as  form.<br />But for BGM for the code-hacker, this CD hits the spot.  No  concentration-disturbing intellectual content ;-)
B00000JCB2|5.0|Awesome CD, there best yet! There first CD was amazing and I thought it would be hard to beat, but man, &quot;Significant Other&quot; was awsome! I would reccomend this CD to any KoRn or Rgae Aagainst The Machine fan!            P.S. BEST SONG IS No.11!
0767835107|5.0|The show it on the DVD as an &quot;extra scene&quot;, but I think this would of made the film even better. I think everyone wanted to slap Kathryn across the face bye the end of the film. Also, I love the other cut scene's  as well, and you really see what a b@stard Sebastian really was, and how  cruel Kathryn is from the cut scene's
6305263248|5.0|Even if you've seen it before, or own it on VHS, this has to be seen for the Frankenheimer commentary.  He gives a VERY GOOD commentary on essential details of the film you would have never ever known before.  The audio and  visual impact of DVD really shines through in the action sequences (car  chases and gun fights).  I've watched it about 5 times so far and still go  back to it.  Worth every penny...
006016848X|4.0|While I could not put this book down because I felt that the author stated exactly how I felt, getting my husband to read it is another story. I think if a husband and wife could read it together, there would be fewer  misunderstandings within their marriage.  I wish that I would have read  this book earlier in my marriage.
B000002NHN|4.0|Personally, I didn't think that this album was as good as her exceptional CD, Mask and the Mirror.  However, it's still better than anything else being offered today.  Definitely worth getting.
0694003611|4.0|Goodnight Moon is my 1 yr old daugher's favorite bedtime book.  The book ties in wonderfully with my attempts during the day to teach her colors, nursery rhymes, time- reinforcing my efforts right before bed.  I love it  and so does she!
B00000K19E|5.0|The previews on TV didn't do the movie justice.  This is the best cyberpunk movie yet.  I like the original (more than most) storyline.  The reason for extrapping the humans seemed stretched but otherwise the movie  was very consistent.
0671015206|4.0|Some people need a kick in the pants when it comes to saving for their future. The &quot;ME&quot; generation would be much better prepared for retirement if we simply absorbed a fraction of the ideas put forth in this  book.
B00000163G|5.0|First time i listen this album,,, i think that it's not bad,. but every time i listen this,,,, i think that all songs in this cds are so so so  cool and bomb.... there's nothing bad...
B00000295A|5.0|Emergency on Planet Earth was the first album I bought from Jamiroquai, and in my opinion it's the best. Travelling without Moving is also very good, but I miss the organic and melodious sound of &quot;Blow Your  Mind&quot;. The only title I don't like is &quot;Revolution&quot;. It's an  album you won't get tired from, even if you hear it for the 1000th time.
0517122707|5.0|Brilliant, hilarious, a must read
6305499365|5.0|I have seen this movie about 5 times, and each time, I waslaughing the loudest in the theater. This is great humor for theoffice worker and the student. You can relate the humor into your own experiences. I think its a must see for comedy fans, and office workers.
B000001Y16|5.0|I believe that Tupac is one of the best performers of his time. His music not to mention lyrics have touched and reached all sorts of people that have listened to his music. One of my personal favorite cd's of his, is  &quot;R U Still Down&quot;.  A lot of his songs on that cd are up beat and  good for partying.  Tupac was a great people person.
0060976624|3.0|After reading Buckley's &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, I was looking forward to &quot;Thank You...&quot;, especially after one person wrote, &quot;...laugh[ed] out loud on every page.&quot;  There's something wrong  with that person.<br />This book was a good way to spend an afternoon when it  was too hot to be outside doing yardwork.
6305426651|5.0|A true comic, Roberto is Chaplin alone, or Abbott &amp; Costello when teamed up.  Sight gags and beautiful score are a must.  That violence is downplayed is at once artful and appealing in its handling of violence.  MUST SEE for thinking human beings.
B000009DUY|5.0|I was impressed by the way Williams captured the emotional power of this film.  His use of 20th century &quot;Copland-like&quot; modalities in his music complemented the film exponetially.  It was well crafted, and not  like any other Williams score...Not since Schindler's List was I so  pleasently surprised with such vertstality in this composer.   This CD is  always in my machine!
0131103628|5.0|What more can be said about the ultimate C reference / text? I've been programming for years in C, but still consult this book first when I need to find something. For some reason it's also the last book I consult. It's  complete, precise, brief, and elegant.
B00000K19E|5.0|Look - I no great Reeves fan.  However, the movie actually has a plot that requires you to think (unlike ID4 or Phantom).  It doesn't leave you hanging at all (like &quot;Blair&quot; - a horror flick I know) and it  almost out Woos John Woo himself for action.  The hype may have let some  down.  But if you went to see the movie with an open mind, you come out  impressively suprised and happy (same with Starship Troopers).  It was  worth the $8 bucks a few times over and will be on my self in DVD as soon  as it hits.
6305470448|5.0|A charming look inside the mind of a great writer, William Shakespeare.  The script seemed to be written by an adoring fan and it's story seems as timeless as it's heroes.  The fact that Joseph Fiennes was not even  nominated alongside his mesmerizing co-star is beyond me, but Gwyneth  Paltrow did bring glorius life to the incredibly dismal scenery she walked  through.  Both the writing and the acting were superb and I highly  recommend this movie to anyone who ever believed in love.
0375402675|4.0|THE GOOD:<br />Realistic Plot-I could see something like what was being planned happening.<br />Good Cast- This book could be made into an excellent movie IMHO, the characters are plausible(I myself liked the 'Techie',  probably since I'm a CS major).<br />Good &quot;Writing&quot;(Since this is a  book on tape)- The  action scenes were tightly written and the planning  scenes framed the action well.<br />Good Reader-I wanna know how Dukes did  all of those voices!<br />THE BAD:<br />The Language- A bit raw--I think I see  where the phrase&quot;A mouth like a sailor&quot; originated.<br />The  Ending- This book kinda petered out a bit at the end(I was hoping for a  dramatic gun battle at  the Syndey Airport).<br />The Sides- This book bears  the stamp of a man who grew up in teh chill of the cold war.  The bad guys  were a &quot;Radical Environmentalist&quot; group with ties to various  radical groups.  Why not have them take on a militia or a white supremacist  groups(You reading this Mr. Clancy).<br />THE REST:<br />A FILM?--Clancy hasn't  had a book made into a movie for awhile, why not this one!<br />THE GAME--I  can't wait to get my hands on the Computer Game(Either for a PC or a Game  Boy Color!)
6305171769|5.0|Being a Horror Movie Fan of the 3 most popular franchises,Elm Street, Friday The 13th and Halloween, this was the best last sequel than the other two have done. What makes it so good was having Jamie Lee cast again and  not to mention having her mom Janet Leigh (Psycho) also cast in it with  her. The two Scream Queens in one film together. But having Steve Miner and  Kevin Wiliamson putting this baby together is enough to make the Horror  movie fans of this genre want to see it regardless. Although,as others have  stated, it could have been longer, the creepiness does work its way up to a  great &quot;Showdown&quot; that Halloween fans have been wanting.  Williamson is a genius with the red herrings throughout and the homages to  Psycho are so entertaining. Example: Janet leigh tells Jamie Lee that the  girls shower drains are clogged, or Janet getting into a Ford Fairlane, the  same one she drove to the Bates Motel in Psycho. I say you will be  entertained and you will jump.  The connections to past horror films within  this one is intriguing enough for a fan to want to buy this one.  Steve  Miner(Friday The 13th),Kevin Williamson(Scream 1,2 and 3),Janet  Leigh(Psycho) and Jamie Lee Curtis(Halloween 1 and 2, Prom Night). So I  just say rent it and then buy it. No need to tell you what happens because  the film is never shoddy or slow.Also for those who say that sequels 4-6  are not mentioned of any sort. Watch it again and listen to what Michelle  Williams says in class when she is daydreaming and glances out the  classroom window and Micheal is looking at her through a gate. She sums it  all up in a short sentence on the topic the class is talking about which I  believe is about Frankenstein.
156224003X|5.0|Outstanding.  As a musician and teacher (of band and orchestra), I can barely express my gratitude to the author.  My outlook on teaching and musicianship has changed drastically for the better since reading this  book.  After reading it through once and practicing a few of the  &quot;steps,&quot; I am now re-reading more thoroughly.  The students I  teach are already benefiting from my more realistic and relaxed approach to  their music education.  Every music teacher and musician should read  this!!!
6302518423|4.0|Nope, it's not one of the greatest Shakespeare films ever made, certainly not to be compared to Sir Ian McKellen's brilliant 'Richard III' or Kenneth Branaugh's superb 'Henry V'.  Nevertheless it's a clever riff on a  wonderful play.<br />Frankly, the most interesting character in Shakespeare's  'The Tempest' is Prospero, Caliban running an ultimately disappointing  second.  Miranda, Antonio, Ferdinand and the rest are not well developed  characters compared to those in other Shakespearian dramas.  Greenaway  wisely expands Prospero and uses the story's emphasis on logos and illusion  to create a visual feast of Lucullus, wretched excess in almost every frame  (Los Angeles 2 is not wholly off-track!)  This is a cinematographer's film,  sheer visual richness.<br />Oh man, all for $17.00?!?  Buy it!
B00000K19E|4.0|There seems to be a deep hatred felt for Keanu Reeves.  Every actor has his good and bad movies and Keanu is no different.  Yet people rushed to the cinemas to watch and hate this film because of the man.  This film is  excellent.  Nicely written and acted by all.  One of the few films made  these days where the effects serve the story and not the other way round.   So, if you don't like Keanu, don't see the film and spare us the  complaints.
0767830555|5.0|Robert De Niro is fantastic in this movie, there are many scenes when he is driving his taxi, when he does not even speak but you, the audience, knows exactley what he is thinking.  This film is truly one of the greatest  movies I have ever seen, to see De Niro's slow fall to insanity is great,  and is wonderfully fillmed and executed.  The special edition has great  extras and an informative documentory about the movie.  I recomend this  movie one hundred percent.  Ending's of movies to me can either make or  break a film, and the ending to this movie is just magnificent, I was not  even expecting it to end this way, it took me completly by suprise.  Get  this movie, it is great, I had not even seen it before buying it, I just  had a hunch that it was great and it was.  Watch out for Jodi Foster to,  she is only in the film for a little while but man does she do a wonderful  job. I give this movie a big High Five.  <br />P.S. Look for the cameo  appearence of the director  he is the one who bosses Travis around in the  cab.
B000005H55|4.0|I suppose the freedom-of-speech approach Amazon supports in these user reviews is a good thing overall, but it bothers me when listeners who don't like or understand a music genre can post reviews ranking alongside those  of veteran fans. It's possible their comments might turn a jazz neophyte  away from what might have been the most prized disc in their collection.  Dolphy, and other &quot;free&quot; artists like Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra,  Archie Shepp, and Captain Beefheart are too often maligned by those who  bought the CD's on a lark and didn't get what they expected.<br />For some,  &quot;free&quot; jazz is an acquired taste that requires knowledge of the  player's influences and the norms of the day; others--even new  jazz-listeners--seem to pick up on it right away with no introduction  necessary. In either case, Dolphy definitely ranks among the greats of the  genre, and &quot;Out to Lunch&quot; demands a listen by any fan of  &quot;free&quot; or moderately unorthodox jazz. He's a technical master on  several instruments, and brought to '60s jazz a new sense of humor drawing  from Monk's odd chordal &quot;pokes&quot; and Ornette Coleman's knack for  quoting riffs from &quot;straight&quot; tunes in the middle of a wildly  free solo.<br />On this session Dolphy assembles contemporaries who were  closer kin with his musical vision than any on his previous Prestige  outings. The young Tony Williams in particular sounds as if his drumming  has been finally freed from the mainstream cage. As he would on later  records with Miles Davis, he lets the bassist keep time while he explores  polyrhythms and &quot;stop-time&quot; beats, all the while keeping things  musical rather than technical. <br />Dolphy's tune writing owes plenty to  Monk, but his soloing points the way to a new jazz that has never been  realized since his death. In the period of this recording, small-group jazz  was still at the point where an experimental artist could still sell a few  records evenwith an avant-garde approach. Modern jazzers don't have this  luxury and are often forced to compromise their vision in the interest of  pleasing their label. <br />The capsule review: If you're not yet a fan of  &quot;free&quot; music, don't risk your hard-earned cash on this disc until  you've first developed a liking for Monk and Mingus. On the other hand, if  your ears have already been attuned to artists who dare step outside  conventional forms, this CD may spend more time in your player than even  the incredible &quot;Conference of the Birds.&quot;
B00000K2SE|5.0|This movie was fantastic, I saw it first day first show and almost no one was in the theatre, this shows you that almost no one was waiting in line because of MTV.  I don't even watch MTV, the special effects are absolutley  amazing it would take the academy award if it was not for star wars.  The  sound is amazing to, since sound is 50 percent of the movie this plays a  very important role, it would win best sound to if it wasn't for Star Wars.   All these reviewers that hate this movie do not know what they are talking  about.  Sure you might not go to this movie because of its drama, or  because of the romance, if you want pure adrenaline pumping action and non  stop thrills see this movie, if you don't trust me rent it when it comes  out you'll see.  I have been watching movies all my life and yes The Matrix  copy's off of many other sci-fi, action and kung-fu movies but it does not  try to hide it.  The Matrix takes all the elements of all the great action,  sci-fi and kung-fu movies and splices them together and it does it  seemlesly.  See this movie, it blew me away from opening to end, I saw it  six times in the theatre, it got better every time.  It will blow you away  too.  <br />P.S. Look for the GIANT BUNNIES on the television      at the  oracles house.
B00000F1D3|4.0|I think the CD's cool,but you don't really expect this kind of music.If you know that Cher has a low voice,then it sounds better.
B00000JMG7|5.0|Rory Gallagher, the Irish blues legend, combines blistering, passionate, raw blues guitar with heartfelt lyrics on this BBC sessions CD.  Rory Gallagher is truely a find.  Any serious lover of the blues and/or rock  guitar must own a Rory Gallagher CD.  You will get hooked by his energy and  his incredible playing.  The double CD has a studio disc and a concert  disc.  Both are awesome and show Gallagher's immense talent as a guitarist  and songwriter.  This compilation includes much of his work during the  1970's, as well as many previously unreleased songs.  Buy this CD!  You  won't be sorry.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has done it again.  Making steady changes from CD to CD and continuing to keep an audience of wide opened ears!  PLAY may contain concepts that have been used in the past (i.e. past lyrics used in new  tunes), but the musical creations surrounding these vocals of so long ago  are superb!  The Moby collection has been bumped up a notch with PLAY.  For  those who question the perfection of this CD, at least see MOBY in concert  and you'll soon change your mind.  Watch the music come to life!  Moby will  lead the electronic scene into the new Millenium without a flaw!
0782008372|3.0|&quot;Highlander&quot; is one of the great movies.  I saw it *twice* in the theater when it came out.  It has people to love, a fight worth winning, and a truly despicable villain.  Michael Kamen's score,  embellished by Queen's songs, has long been one of my all-time favorite  soundtracks.  The additional footage in this director's cut finally  explained to me the origin of the catch-phrase &quot;It's a kind of  magic,&quot; which has puzzled me for years.<br />The bad news is the  soundtrack on this album.  In the original theatrical release, every word  of dialogue came through crisply and clearly.  Here, portions of dialogue  come through as barely comprehensible mumbles.  Furthermore, the sound  level varies all over the map, and, especially in the latter half of the  movie, I found myself endlessly fiddling with the volume as one scene would  be almost inaudible and the next scene, played at that same volume, would  assault my eardrums with deadly force.<br />*This* is one DVD that *won't* be  replacing my prized non-Director's Cut VHS copy of the movie.  At least  with *that* one I can enjoy the soundtrack - all of it.
B000002BPS|5.0|If you buy only one Offspring cd, make it this one. High energy, fast  music, intelligent, sometimes funny lyrics with a positive message, an  all-around awesome cd. I just got it today and it's my favorite cd that I  own so far. My favorite songs are &quot;The Meaning Of Life&quot;,  &quot;GoneAway&quot;, &quot;I Choose&quot;, and &quot;All I Want&quot;, but  I love every song on it. &quot;All I Want&quot; is probably my all-time  favorite Offspring song. It really pumps you up, and brings you up when  you're feeling down =D This cd is a must have for any punk or rock fan.   The Offspring are, in my opinion, the best band ever.
6302994063|5.0|As a theatreical costume designer, I found the whole movie fascinating, visually rich, fun.  It pokes fun at design obsessions I also hold dear and takes them to an etreme levelin costumes, setting, characters.  The sarcasm  and wit of the story are charming, charming, charming.  The characters of  Scott and Fran are people we 'know' in our own lives. . .heck,  maybe they  are US.  And who hasn't questioned their parents' wisdom at some time in  their lives?  Embarking on the 'road less travelled'  is a good risk, this  movie says.  And, of course, &quot; a life lived in fear is only half  lived&quot; encourages us all to take those good risks.  Did you know that  this movie's beginning were in a design class at the Royal Academy of the  Arts in Austalia?  Bravo to that risk-taking designer and to those who took  that project to this extreme, lovely level, too.  SEE THIS FILM, you will  love it.
630398021X|5.0|My second favourite film ever.<br />For me this movie is all about the redemption of Lenny Nero.  I can relate to his fall from grace, his subsequent attempt to lose himself in the dark world he deals with and then  his final redemption with Mace.  The final moments of film from the  shooting of the second corrupt police officer onwards never fails to  genuinely move me, with the slow-mo and the soundtrack being used to  admirable effect.   The final explination of Jeriko One's demise. via the  elusive clip, was genuinely shocking to me.  Very well done.<br />The  unveiling of the main criminal in the film's finale was well done.  I DID  NOT see it coming, and I must admit to hating reviewers who harp on about  being able to see major plot twists from a mile away.  Maybe I'm just dumb,  but I rarely see them.<br />The visuals of LA on the brink of implosion were  fascinating to me.  I will find out the truth as I have booked my flights  and accommodation and will be there for New Year.  I'll post an update if I  survive!<br />Mace was a well written strong female character and was a  perfect role for Basset.  I would not like to go up against that  lady......<br />My only quibble with the film is Juliette Lewis.  I confess that I  have hated all the characters in all the films she has ever done, but Faith  takes the biscuit.  I am sure that the character was SUPPOSED to be whiney,  narcissistic and annoying and she really turns in a performance which  fulfills that to the hilt.<br />Also, as previous postings have said, the  Peter Gabriel/Deep Forrest track over the closing credits is worth buying  the soundtrack for.  I did!  What hasn't been mentioned is the use of the  black and white stills at the beginning of the end credits.  I think they  are striking and their use is perfect.  Does anyone know where I can get  hold of good quality versions, either printed or electronic?
B000002H6C|5.0|...and justice for all, is one of those CD's, that if you werestranded on an island with only one CD to listen to, this would be theone.  i've been listening to it for 10 years now and it still makes me want to thrash around. Great stuff.
B00000F1D3|1.0|I listened to this cd and didn't think it was worth my money
B00000FZ1V|4.0|I agree with most of the positive comments on this DVD, BUT my Samsung just does not like the FX multiangle stuff. Try to play any of it and the machine just hangs. A big downer, but this release  has enough content to  render it a mere niggle.
B000002J1C|5.0|This third Yes album sees the introduction of guitarist Steve Howe into the ranks and is generally regarded as one of their best albums. I agree. Yes' fascination for extended compositions is starting to take shape here.  Inspired stuff!
630419143X|5.0|I've seen many animated movies where the plot goes nowhere; one would expect the same here because so much time was devoted to the animation.  Not so.  I've never seen such attention to detail--check out the scuff  marks on the bedroom door.  I've also never seen a movie that tells such a  great tale.  I was astonished by this movie while I was pregnant with my  daughter, and now that she's into movies, I love that she's chosen Toy  Story as her new favorite. Young and old will certainly enjoy this movie  time and again--I know I have!
B00000JAQ8|5.0|Finland's Nightwish is an amazing band. Oceanborn is their second release and definitely it is one of the best CDs of Power Metal music. The frontwoman Tarja has an incredible opera-range voice (probably the best  female vocals of metal music). The author of the music is the keyboardist  Tuomas and he has a great talent. The superb production also fits with the  music. No doubt Nightwish is not a common band. Just listen to it and judge  for yourselves.
0800187814|2.0|. . .could this man be treated as a hero.  Honestly:  did anybody ever lose money underestimating the taste of the public?  Flynt was raking in the dollars with a stupid magazine which holds primitive attitudes toward  women, sex and minorities.  OK, fine.  He has the right to do so. . .maybe  an imperative in this country which treats the almighty dollar as the  purpose of existence. . .and he can appeal his right to do so all the way  to the Supreme Court.  But is he a hero?  Great.  We live in an age which  could use a few heroes, and Milos Forman (who I once thought a semi-great  director) spends his producers' money on a flick celebrating a stupid  redneck and his crazy wife.  (Although I must give kudos for his  casting--he found the perfect actors for the two leads.  In fact, I don't  think either one was 'acting' at all.  Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love  were made for their roles.)
1573226521|2.0|The Beach has all the makings of a great novel - original story, interesting environment,etc. - but the writing is so dry that I could care less about any of the characters. This book was written with one philosophy  in mind - concerning pop culture - but with these one dimensional  characters I really didn't care about the author's views. I'm sure Leonardo  Di Caprio will be perfect for the film. Hell, the screenplay was written  even before it was adapted. Boring stuff.

0679731725|5.0|This book just took my breath away.  It is an  exquisitely written novel that touches the soul on every level.  Without question, one of the great English language novels of the last 25 years.  Mr. Ishiguro is a major  talent.  Pity he's not heard from too often.  The story of Stephens, the  ideal English butler who quietly watches his orderly, yet empty life  collapse around him with only regrets to comfort him is a universal tale of  loneliness brought beautifully and painfully to life by this very talented  writer.  This is a novel for those who understand what literature truly is.

B000002UJQ|1.0|After two fine efforts we get this horrid banal mess.  Hyped up the wazoo - and delivering a moaning, grumpy drone with barely any melody.  Oh sure, there is an occasional moment,  but overall this thing is horrid.<br />Get the  other two &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; and join me in  hoping the hype stops and Radiohead get their act together for the next  one.

B000002BMD|5.0|&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is the closest the Manics ever got to their dream of making a real masterpiece. While their earlier Sex Pistols/Clash  sound was fantastic, they have struck gold here. &Iacute;t took me a while to  fully get into this album, but it was worth the effort. Listening to  &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, it is hard to believe that the same group was  capable of this. The real standout tracks here are &quot;A Design For  Life&quot;, &quot;Kevin Carter&quot;, and &quot;Interiors (Song for Willem  De Kooning)&quot;. Lavish, orchestral at times, and more grandiose than  anything they have done before. Not for everybody, but a treat for those  who can understand it.
0425170349|5.0|Please don't listen to the negative reviews posted.  This book is not a spy novel so don't treat it like one.  It is about a anti-terrorist &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; team.  It is exciting, action packed, and detailed.   Give it a chance please, I loved it !  If you like the game Rainbow Six,  this is the book where it all started.
B000002JB3|5.0|Well, to be honest, I don't like pop very much.. I'm a rock/alternative/metal fan... but this album blew me away. Phil Collins has  a talent.. and it shows. This album isn't that phoney pop stuff like  Backstreet boys, this is real music... afterall, Phil writes and preforms  his own stuff, including instruments! I personally like Love Police and his  remake of that classic Bob Dylan song &quot;The Times Are A Changin&quot;.  Way to go Phil!
0767819462|5.0|This movie had some mega strong languege, but I'm not gonna be a drag and go on about that. This movie is a tear jerker. Like the movie (and book) &quot;To kill a mocking bird&quot; A lot of it was from the kids point of  veiw, which I think was a nice touch to a movie which would have been sad  any way.
0767811038|4.0|What delighted me in this film was Verhoeven's cleverness in having it both ways--he gave the kids the action picture they wanted (lots of blood and guts, things blowin up REAL GOOD) but at the same time had good  grown-up fun at Heinlein's fascist philosophy, the tedious setting out of  which makes his novel almost unreadable.  The recruiting advertisments in  the film (&quot;Do you want to know MORE?&quot;) were a hilarious send up  of Heinlein, probably had the old soldier spinning in his grave.  Verhoeven  is aware of the ethical blind spot at the center of Henlein's  philosophy--what if the enemy is not a bunch of odious bugs but other human  beings?  The problem, in other words, is one of empathy.  This is nicely  exposed at the very end of the film, when Doogie Houser announces of the  Brain Bug to the assembled crowd of bloody warriors &quot;It's  Afraid!&quot;--thereby humanizing the bug, making it a potential object of  human sympathy.  Oops!  Compare Henlein vision to, say, Philip Dick's  perspective  in &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; where the  ethical problem of empathy is foregrounded, not evaded.  Verhoeven's film  is Heinlein strained through the guts (as it were) of Dick.  Brilliant  satirical stuff.
630518299X|3.0|I didn't hate it or love it. It was just another movie I saw. If you know what I'm saying? This is the kind of movie they made weird because lots of Jim Careys movies are the kinds of movies where you don't like them or love  them there just another movie. So they made this one weird so it would be  differant. If you like movies that couldn't come true with out some one  gettimg arrested (That aren't violent) then this is a movie for you.
B000002568|5.0|Being true to his own loud-mouthed opinion of himself, Jaco sets out to  prove the statement &quot;I am the world's greatest bass player&quot; and  does it.  Well.  Donna Lee absolutely burns, Come on, Come over is so funky  you might fall over if you're not ready for it, and Portrait of Tracy is a  wonderful ballad played almost completely in harmonics.  This is one of the  albums that made me want to really start to play bass... I mean _really_  start to play, like practicing 4-5 hours a day sort of thing.  I highly  suggest this album to anyone who likes jazz/fusion/funk.  It's all here,  purchase and enjoy.
0782008372|3.0|i use to love this movie...but seeing it for the first time in about 7 years, i realized how cheesey it is.  don't get me wrong, it's a very nice story, but this movie could have been much better.  the world war 2 scene  added in the director's cut is absurd (kind of like a bad 1970's action  movie) the plus side to this movie is the photography work.  the  transitions from past to future are very creatively done.  and so on.  this  is probably the best bad movie i have ever seen.  the dvd seems fine  though.  the sound was a bit questionable in places, but the picture  quality is top-knotch.
B00000K19E|5.0|&quot;The Matrix&quot; was the Spring's biggest blockbuster. If you watch, or already have watched the film, you can see why.  1. The Special F/X are great. Since this film takes place inside a computer-like world (the  matrix) stunts can happen in there like no other movie has ever shown  before. The scene where the helicopter crashes into the building is a  standout. 2. The script is good. It makes sense when you pay attention to  it. Even though the film may have slow parts, you don't even realize  they're gone so fast. 3.The actors. 4.The freeze-frame is liked by the  audience. (as seen in the Gap Khakis commercial)  The audience definately  got a big kick out of this film. I know I did, and I can't wait for it to  come out on DVD! Reserve your copy today, and see what everyone's been  talking about.
0671449028|5.0|My seven month old daugther hated her car seat.  I have read this book to her so many times I have it memorized.  My husband has it memorized and our daughter now 18 months old has it memorized.  It continues to be her  favorite book. It has stood up to some really heavy use. The rhymes are  great.  The imagery is easy for kids to understand, ie. brushing teeth,  hanging towels on the wall, taking a bath, exercising, sun setting, saying   good night. I cherish this book for helping us survive many long trips  between KS and MI to visit relatives.

B000002NHN|5.0|I first heard this CD when a friend came down to visit.  He explained to me that this peformer had a magnificent voice and that I would enjoy it.  Enjoy is not the word!  Her musical talent is amazing.  My favorite track  is &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, for I love her interpretation of that  wonderful poem.  Since hearing the &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; CD, I have  purchased all of her CD's (7 in all), and I am not disappointed.   &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; is a must have for those that love haunting and  stirring music.
B000002U9W|4.0|I remember being a teenager and absolutely hating this record.  Being fed &quot;Dark Side&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; just didn't prepare me for the  weirdness factor, which is high.  Fifteen or so years later, I've  discovered that this is actually a worthwhile album/cd.  &quot;Atom Heart  Mother&quot; is typical of the post-Barrett, pre-&quot;Dark Side&quot; era.   One long symphonic/suite/experimental/progressive/pretentious piece is  followed by more traditional rock/pop/psychedelic tunes.  While the results  are wildly uneven, you have to give Floyd credit for creating such bizarre,  un-commercial music (especially after the outlandish &quot;Ummagumma&quot;  and &quot;More&quot;).  This is definitely not a &quot;singles&quot;  record, and I don't think I've heard any of it on so-called  &quot;classic&quot; rock radio, which is too bad because &quot;Summer Of  68&quot; and &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; are great rock tunes.  &quot;If&quot;  sounds awkward and unsure.  &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; is  exploratory, although the trip really takes you nowhere (was that the  point?).  The main attention, obviously, is given to the title track/suite,  an exercise in immensity that is simultaneously uplifting and laughable.   Repeated listenings helped me put all the disparate pieces together, and I  realized that Pink Floyd actually have a sense of humor (look at the  cover).
6304806426|2.0|A lot of much ado about very little. The story concerns a burn patient who may- or may not be - a war criminal. The patient, Ralph Fiennes, overacts throughout and has enough mannerisms and affectations to win an Oscar. Why  he didn't win is beyond me. The plot is only so-so and falls to pieces at  the end. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.
0375707972|5.0|DON'T WASTE ANYTIME ON THIS BOOK.  I COULD BARELY GET THRU IT.  SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO FINISH IT SO I WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD WASTED MONEY BUYING IT.
B00000J2KX|3.0|This is not one of Kubrick's best. Both Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall overact. The music? At times I felt Kubrick put this music on the soundtrack to parody film scoring in general. That said, this film is much  better than King's own made-for-TV version which is just plain bad. As for  the DVD, Warner Bros. should be ashamed! There is no widescreen version  available and the &quot;standard format&quot; version is a mess with  scratchy images and lousy sound. The only good Kubrick DVD is 2001. Beware  of the other DVD versions of his films! Even the DVD version of Barry  Lyndon is virtually ruined by a bad transfer.
B00000IFWE|3.0|After reading several of the reviews, I finally figured out why I can't bring myself to rave about this recording (and I was long ago labeled a Petty fanatic by friends and family).  In general, it seems that most of  the favorable reviews come from fans that tend to gravitate towards his  solo material, which has a distinctively different sound than the  Heartbreaker recordings.  The less flattering reviews, in general, seem to  come from fans who tend to enjoy the earlier sound.  This recording has  some nice cuts, but for my taste, most of it sounds too much like Petty's  solo stuff.  Give me more of the earlier sound (i.e. Strangered in the  Night, Wild One Forever, Too Much Ain't Enough, Magnolia) and less of the  solo sound (i.e. Won't Back Down, etc.)  TP &amp; the HB's are still the  Kings of live rock concerts, but this recording may disappoint the  long-time fan.
6302424887|4.0|This version is not for everybody. Polanski has directed a very realistic film which at times is quite brutal. The opening sequence with the witches is brilliant. Unfortunately, the video version of this film is not  widescreen. This is one film which really needs a DVD widescreen release.
B00000K19E|5.0|Even though I love movies of every shape and size, I never thought of myself as the type to gush dramatically over a flick.  But let me tell you--the Matrix literally made me drool!  <br />I've read some of the other  reviews here at Amazon, and I'm so surprised by the poor reviews.  I'm sure  we all agree that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor on the planet.  I like  some of his movies, and dislike others.  Yet I cannot imagine any other  actor in the role of Neo.  He was perfect!  He and the rest of the cast  were ... words cannot describe.  What a movie! What a concept!  I've never  seen anything like it!!<br />I especially liked the still/moving action  sequences--and the kung fu fighting scenes.  What an ending!!!!  I loved  walking out of the theater excited, thinking about how Neo stopped those  bullets, and talking about this great movie with my husband on the way home  in the car.  How could any science fiction lover not be absolutely  mesmerized by this movie?
6302150930|5.0|This is my favorite film version of Hardy. Polanski has done a fabulous job of directing and the cast is first rate (including Kinski). The music by Philippe Sarde is also very well done. The video is not widescreen.  Hopefully, a DVD version will be out in the near future.
0767835107|4.0|Funny and very sexy, this movie is the perfect Saturday-night cure for the dateless.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is brutal and hillarious, and Ryan Phillipe and Selma Blair are hysterical.  I highly recommend this movie!!
6304340486|1.0|Considering Sylvester Stallone thinks guns should be banned for citizens of the US, I don't understand how he could allow himself to be in such a film that glorifies violence, killing and mayhem.  This film should be  banned.
B00000K19E|5.0|What an awesome movie!  OK, so I'm one of Keanu's biggest fans but that won't bias my view of the movie as a whole.  I found that my friends who work in the Information Technology industry (like me) LOVE the movie and  saw it countless times.  Non-IT people don't seem to relate to it.  I have  no idea why.  The musical score is fantastic and the scene in Governor  Macquarie Tower (for all you Sydneysiders) was THE best action scene I  think I've ever seen.  I loved seeing the various Sydney spots where they  filmed and the martial arts scenes were awesome.  Very well acted and the  special effects blew me away!  Bring on Matrix II!!!!
B000002I57|4.0|There is some very nice interplay between Jackson and Coltrane on this album. It's the best I've ever heard Milt sound, as a matter of fact. I don't think he quite keeps up with Coltrane, but who can? &quot;Three  Little Words&quot; is a Coltrane soling clinic, and &quot;Blues  Legacy&quot; is a marvelously arranged and executed song as well.  &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot; litls along dreamily, the way a song with  that title should. As mentioned, Jackson has never, in my opinion, sounded  so fluid and confident and uninhibited. A great CD to add to any serious  collection.
630018448X|2.0|I was very disappointed with this one.  At the start of the series, they go and rip off a western story that has been done countless times before.  They should have been trying to establish something unique at this point,  trying to prove they were original.  Instead, they did the opposite.
0440224764|4.0|One gets the impression from his books that mr Grisham has little respect for the legal profession.Being a qualified member of the ABA perhaps this is no surprise. His latest tale is the story of Patrick Lannigan a junior  partner in an unscrupulous Mississippi law firm who runs of with a not  insubstantial amount of his company's receipts.During the four years he is  on the run Patrick is fully aware a search is out for him and find him they  do.Patrick is happy to return and face the music but only under his  terms.The rest of the book regales us with the ensuing courtroom drama and  legal battles from his ex-wife,the US government and his previous employers  hopefully to retrieve the missing money.The author captures our attention  from the beginning and never lets go.One of his better efforts I think.The  twist at the end was unexpected but inevitable.
6300182266|5.0|Still good clean fun after all these years.  I love the special effects, the costumes, the sets, the sound effects, the music....it's all great stuff.
6305119961|3.0|Every so often Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant movie.This is not one of those times.An interesting story but not as gripping as had been promised.Also I saw little evidence of director Tamahori's  workmanship,rumour has it he gave in to most of his star studded actors'  suggestions.Alec Baldwin had nothing good to say about the experience.The  only thing to commend it is the Alaskan scenery.A good movie but not good  enough for your standards mr Tamahori.Better luck next time.
6300184498|5.0|Yes, it starts off with a cylon attack, but after that it gets much more interesting.  Starbuck -- as only Starbuck could -- gets tricked into becoming sheriff of a tiny agro community, Adama fends off the unwanted  attentions of Siress Bellaby, and there are many nice humorous moments to  be had.  Really one of the better episodes made.
0783233477|3.0|Beautifully filmed and superbly acted,Hopkins does another of his effortless star turns.Brad Pitt and  Miss Forlani pull out all the stops just to keep up.I liked the whole premise of the story and the ending was  inevitable but sorry it was just too long to hold my attention-the story  could have been told in two hours max! Better luck next time Mr Brest.
B00000J2L7|4.0|Something to remember when watching this film - Stan Kubrick didn't originally see Dr Strangelove as a comedy, instead intending a powerful portrait of nuclear holocaust. This was all until Sellers came on board and  lost control. However, nobody told Slim Pickens (the bronco bomber) this,  so he is allegedly playing the film straight. This, of course, makes his  performance sixteen times better.
6300214559|4.0|This is a wonderfully put together account of the 9 days Queen of England,Jane Grey and the events that led to her unwilling accession,eventual abdication and subsequent execution at the tender age of  19.The superb cast is led by a petite Helena Bonham-Carter in the title  lead and Cary Elwes in his leading debut role.Although some licence was  taken regarding the historical portrayals and the events that unfolded  during that period in history this does not detract from the theme of the  film.And there are excellent portrayals from John Wood as the scheming and  ruthless Duke of Northumberland and Warren Saire as the dying boy-king  Edward VI.Cary Elwes as the reluctant but doomed bridegroom Guilford Dudley  proves here he's not just a pretty face.The stirring canticle music by mr  Oliver should also be commended.Anyone who loves historical dramas and  reads history will still enjoy this tudor tale even if you already know the  ending.
0440219078|5.0|When I finished reading this book at first, my first thought was that it was a little weird. But later I decided that the &quot;weirdness&quot; was what made it interesting and hard to put down. This definitely is one of my  favorite books, because it is well-written in its details and very original  in its plot.
0783211856|5.0|Steven Spielberg brings the holocaust to life withbone-chilling reality as he tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, aNazi war profiteer. With the help of a Jewish prisoner, Izhak Stern, he builds a factory and employs 1100 Jews, thereby saving their lives. The only thing that I really wondered about (and this goes for many people) is &quot;did Schindler know he would save their lives?&quot; this is a question that will probably never be answered.<br />I don't know why I like this film. It's not entertaining and wasn't meant to be. Maybe it's my Jewish heritage.  Maybe it's my obsession with Spielberg and movies in general. Maybe it's the spectacular acting done by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsle and Ralph Fiennes. Whatever it may be, this film is a truly disturbing and memorable one with one simple message (and I say this from the bottom of my Jewish heart) DON'T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN!
B00000JGOJ|3.0|I would actually like to give this film 3 1/2 stars. The problems however, I have with Playing by Heart are that it incorporates too many lives of characters with conficting personalities and lives that are contrasting as  black and white.  You can't figure out who this movie will appeal to.  When  they switch from the younger characters to the geriatrics characters (one  played by Sean Connery), it offsets your mood.  You are just getting into  one plot and Bam! switch-a-roo! It was frustrating.  I also thought they  could have eliminated Jay Moer's character (who was dying of a.i.d.s).   That is so depressing!  How are we going to be entertained by that!?!  Yes  it was quite sad and it did make me want to cry, but hey, that doesn't  belong in this movie! One of my favorite scenes is where Dennis Quaid's  character goes into the gay club and talks to a transvestite.  I found that  to be a touching, surreal momement.  I also loved Angelina Jolie's  character. She was intriguing and brought some life to the film. (check her  out in &quot;Gia&quot;!).  I also enjoyed the overall style of this  film.<br />Eliminate some of the depressing elements to the storyline and you  would have an above average movie.
0679735909|5.0|A love story, a mystery, written in language you may have to read several times, but worth it! Poetry abounds! Great to read and absorb.
6304259093|1.0|Making a sequel to The Crow is like making a sequel to Grease or Terms of Endearment.  We all know what the outcome of that was.  The Crow: City of Angels is a disgrace to it's classic prequel.  How dare they tarnish the  sacred Crow this way?  This film lacked everything the first one possessed,  even down to the music! Where was all the cool music?!?  Let me say that  again, WHERE WAS ALL THE COOL MUSIC?!? I was so looking forward to seeing  this film and it has to be up there with &quot;biggest dissapointments in  film history&quot;.  It's like, &quot;let's make a sequel to Fargo...yeah,  yeah, good idea, yeah.&quot;<br />There's just some things you don't do  Hollywood!
0440180295|5.0|This book was awesome one of my all time favorites it was difficult to read but well worth while.
0792151712|4.0|Titanic is an epic movie that has something everyone can enjoy or at least find interesting. If your not busy gazing at the special affects and beautiful majestery of the ship, then your being captivated by the  performances by Kate and that one guy. (totally overrated performances  though). I loved  one review where someone mentioned Leonardo DiCrapio?   Haha. I was dissapointed in the fact Kathy Bates didn't have a bigger part.   The music is also moving.<br />The ridiculous part of the movie is the gun  fight at the end.  Give me a damned break, you mean to tell me if a ship is  sinking, some fool is gonna pull out a pistol and start shooting into a  crowd of drowning passengers?  Yeah right, I don't think so! All and all,  it was a compelling drama with that great Celine song forever linked to the  movie.
6305013578|1.0|This is the worst DVD I ever saw: The image is totally unsharp and cropped to about 60% of the original image area, the soundtrack seems to have no nothing to do with the movie. Terrible. This DVD is simply unwatchable -  don't buy it.
6305363668|5.0|I have read many, 2 MANY reviews of this movie complaining about this and that about the damned voice over narration!  What about the rest of the film!?!  What about Darryl Hannah's haunting performance? What about the  amazing umbrellas that also serve as flashlights (how brilliantly  innovative!) And the rain! And the costumes! And the rain! And the  blimp/billboard with the spooky geisha lady singing! And the...rain! These  visions and sounds are permenately etched in my brain, and I like them  there!  There is so, so much more to this film than the voice  over narration by Deckard. Harrison Ford probably thinks were all a bunch  of losers squabbling about this much ado about nothing.  <br />AND BY THE  WAY.....Where were all you Blade Runner buffs when they released the 10th  anniverary edition of Blade Runner in 1993? It's the original version and I  have it! Ha ha. :)
B000002A3T|5.0|Say, does anyone know when Pink Floyd will come out with a new album?  <br />Division Bell is a great CD, but my favorite has to be High Hopes.  There is just some fantastic guitar passages in that song especially at the  end.  With the exception of Lindsey Buckingham, Gilmour is the best when it  comes to creativity from the guitar.  This CD is a must
B000002JOH|5.0|Think of all the hard stuff you've listened to. This one is different. Chances are you don't know what &quot;powerful&quot; means until you've listened to this. More powerful than ANY other band (not exaggerating),  they know how to handle their instruments. Original style, power and an  amazingly powerful singer. This one and the other one which came before it  (Cowboys from Hell) are the only ones I keep on standby with my Metallica  albums at all times!
0688062334|5.0|I must've been 14 years old at the time I discovered this book, quite by accident, in my high school's library.  I'd always loved fantasy novels, but when I'd cracked this book open at home that night, I was sucked into  an entirely different world (I got in trouble for reading the book instead  of doing my homework.).  It's been high on my list of favorites ever since,  going on 12 years now.<br />It mixed all the best elements of fantasy and  fairy tails with something I'd never been exposed to at the time, humor.  I've always been a sucker for magic and romance and this combines both in  spades.  I'll admit, I was intrigued by doorways from one world to another.   Add in a  self-declared cowardly wizard who really wasn't and a young  woman in a old woman's body as the main characters were a perfect  match!<br />I'm looking forward to introducing this story to my nephews, and  renew my own aquaintence with these engaging characters (I just discovered  that there's a sequel!).<br />Like I said, read this book, even if you are an  adult.  This is an enchanting, engaging book for both youngsters and adults  alike.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I ordered the cd because I needed to get &quot;Nookie&quot; out of my head.  I am so pleased with this cd that I might get the other LB album.  It is one of the few cd's that have made me laugh out loud while by myself.   The song that did it was &quot;Break Stuff&quot;... a song that anyone can  love.  I don't think this cd is for everyone, but if you love metal you'll  be as happy as I am!
0380002930|5.0|This book is without equal, and I pity anyone who can not appreciate it as a masterpiece.  It is a story about comraderie and relying on each others' special abilities.  Where else would you find the skills of 'story-teller  and runner' (Dandelion), 'statesman' (Strawberry), and warrior (Bigwig)  given equal billing within a group of individuals. I am a personal friend  of Richard Adams and have hiked the storyline from Watership Down four  times from start to finish.  Yes, that's right -- in case you didn't know,  Watership Down is a real place, and all the locations listed on the map in  the front of the book are still in place, probably much as they looked in  1972.  Another interesting fact, the characters are loosely modelled after  officers with whom Mr Adams served during World War II.  Hazel and Bigwig,  in pacticular, are modelled after two specific individuals.  So, how can  this be a story about just rabbits?  As I have stated above, this story is  about a group of individuals who depend and rely on each other.  As Richard  Adams says, in one of his most eloquent passages, &quot;They had come  closer together, relying on and valueing each other's capacities.  They  knew now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives  depended, and they were not going to waste anything they possessed between  them.&quot;  Sounds like what you'd expect from a group of soldiers in a  life-and-death situation, doesn't it?  Oh, pity the poor fools who can not  comprehend the meaning of this book.  &quot;A rabbit who does not know when  a gift has made him safe is poorer than a slug, eventhough he may think  otherwise himself.&quot;
0871137380|5.0|Simply stated, Blackhawk Down is leaps and bounds better than any fictional accounts of warfare that I have read, including Tom Clancy's myriad of novels.  The book opens up with excitement and never lets go.   Whereas many non-fictional accounts stumble through the boring prelude,  reason for the mission, etc., Blackhawk Down goes straight to the action  and gives historical anecdotes where needed to give a broader meaning to  the story as it unfolds.  Quite simply the most enjoyable book on modern  warfare that I have ever read.  Highly recommended.
6305128952|5.0|Excellent movie, beautiful cinematography, impressive acting. Another outstanding work from Kristin Scott Thomas(The English Patient); looking forward to seeing her in her new movie, Random Hearts with Harrison Ford  this fall. You will enjoy this DVD.
B000002IMG|4.0|Although the post production on this album is a little underproduced, the overall riff and solo structure show a mastery of the true metal style.  If you wonder why guitar playing is &quot;sloppy&quot; these days, it is  because the youth of today do not posses the skill or tenacity to learn the  instrument the ways the masters have shown us!
B000008LH5|5.0|This is a must buy for any TYA fan or anyone who likes rock/blues.  I'd buy it just to get 'Slow Blues in C', which I consider the BEST blues song ever recorded!  (A Huge Assertion I Realize!) This album puts out high  energy in songs like 'Good Morning Little School', 'Help Me', and the  classic 'I'm Going Home' and really displays the tremendous versatility and  talent of one of the best Rock N Roll bands ever.  As we're all saying,  'Bottom line, Buy this cd'!
0380973464|5.0|Who would have thought that a book full of equations would be a great read?  Very different from Snow Crash.  I wasn't much of a crypto buff before I read the book...  but I am now!  I LOVED the description of the  Capn' Crunch dining experience:  a 3 page exploration of the taste  sensation of one of my favorite cereals.  Also, he deftly skewers all  technology start-ups with his brilliant summary of the biz planning and  money raising process.  I'll use his template for my next plan.  I'll never  munch Capn' Crunch again w/o thinking of this book.
6305513406|3.0|Much the same as it ever was. I know that interviews are available because they where made with the actors in the series. The CDs are of course of better quality then before, but I expected more of my CD collection. If you  want more than the Video copies were capable of furnishing you'll have to  wait. The interviews done by the Science Fiction channel could have been  added as a bonus to this collection. If it sells I hope it's because  someone adds the interviews.
B000002UAU|3.0|Sgt. Pepper is on OK album, but by then the Beatles had been superseded by the true greats: musicians with real talent, such as Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, the Stones, Cream and Led Zeplin. The basic difficulty is that  the Beatles did not understand what constitutes Rock and chose to confine  themselves to Pop. Buy Sgt. Pepper if you really must, but be warned that  it's not LET IT BLEED by THE ROLLING STONES because if it was, it would be  called LET IT BLEED by THE ROLLING STONES.<br />Also recommended: CHROMATIC  SCALES FOR AIR GUITARISTS by Eileen &amp; Ben Dover.
078401115X|5.0|This movie is one of my overall best movies to watch!  It's a gritty mystery with a touch of evil that will keep you holding on to your pillow. The film gets kind of artsy in some moments, but if you can get pass  those-it's a film worth seeing!  As I said one of Mickey Rourke's greatest  performances!!!  As for the scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet...it is  erotic and evil rolled into one.  It makes you feel sexy and seductive one  second and scared for your soul the next. I highly recommend it!!!!
B000002UB6|4.0|Finally, someone who recognises George's major contribution to the Beatles. Mind you, I wish L &amp; M had been a bit more tyrannical at the 'Let It Be' sessions and prevented Mr. Harrison from recording the abysmal  'I Me Mine'. A nostalgic cover version would have been more acceptable -  and they went through a lot of classic rock n' roll workouts at the  sessions.
B00000J7J4|4.0|When you mix the clean sounding Santana guitar with the various artists on this CD you really have a winner.  Of obvious note is the Everlast tune &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; - yes Everlast!  The wanna-be rapper sounds  like he could be a pretty darn good rocker.  Maybe some positive feedback  will help Everlast find his musical niche - away from the rap - and into  the acoustic/rock arena. Maybe playing with an artist like Santana will set  him straight - in any event the Santana/Everlast  sound is outstanding and  worth the CD's price alone!
0783229372|3.0|George C. Scott turns in a good performance in this story about the dirigible that blew up in Lakehurst, New Jersey.  The film indicates that the Hindenburg was the victim of sabotage, but I find that view  unconvincing.  The dirigible's balloon was filled with highly flammable  hydrogen.  It was raining that day, and there was electricity and lightning  in the air.  It does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that the  airship was a disaster waiting to happen.  One thing is certain:  had the  bag been filled with helium, there would have no explosion.
630407185X|5.0|I've seen a lot of war movies, and this is one of the best. The film is about Operation Market Garden, an operation meant to bring a swift end to WW2, but turned out to be a huge military blunder. It's just as good as the  book, and it's full of great stars and excellent acting. Filmed on  location, this film has everything. Infantry, Tanks (Although the German  ones are mock-ups), and plenty of Paratroopers. It's accurate (although not  as realistic as it should be), and it sticks to the book well. I highly  recommend this film to anyone who has read the book, or just enjoys a good  war movie.
B000002LOE|5.0|All right--I know a lot of die-hard R.E.M. fans think the band sold out when they made this album.  They also probably think this is not one of R.E.M.'s better albums.  All I can say to that is that they're crazy.  THIS  IS ONE OF R.E.M.'S BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME.  I'd put this up there with  &quot;Murmur,&quot; &quot;Life's Rich Pageant,&quot; and &quot;Automatic  for the People.&quot;  IF THIS ALBUM WASN'T THAT GREAT--THEN WHY DID IT GO  TO #1 ALL AROUND THE WORLD?  All these &quot;international&quot; people  must have thought this album had something for them to buy it.  I  especially like:  &quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; &quot;Low,&quot;  &quot;Near Wild Heaven,&quot; &quot;Belong,&quot; &quot;Texarkana,&quot;  and &quot;Me in Honey.&quot;  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM.
B000002U82|5.0|In Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd takes a step further as they add brilliant saxophone and tons of special effects. This album not only defines the Pink Floyd sound, but what music should sound like. The lyrics  are like the greatest poetry, the notes like the greatest classical  masterpiece, and because this album is so emmensely popular, the tunes are  extremely recognizable. This is the best album ever made by anyone. Ever.  Period.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie. The story was unique and not overplayed like most movies today. The action sequences and special effects are unbelievable!  I highly recommend this movie, there is not a single  person I know that didn't love it.  The only way you could give this movie  a bad review is if you didn't understand it (or your one of them). Can't  wait until the next one...
6304025831|5.0|The thing that is so fantastic about this movie is that it is absolutely true! The dialogue is crisp and real, and the acting is great. Most movies are fiction, so when you think that these characters and events are real it  brings an added dimension. The cinematography and music will move you, and  the sets and costumes are suberb. If you love Las Vegas and mob stories  (like I do), you'll be in hog heaven while watching Casino.
B00000IQMT|4.0|The first review that Amazon prints about this album (the long review) isn't entirely accurate regarding the re-use of earlier musical material.  In fact, the Force theme isn't the only one revived for this score:  there  are others, though they are very fleeting.   The first phrase of Yoda's  theme is heard near the film's conclusion as Yoda and Obi-Wan discuss the  training of Anakin, and it is closely followed by the first phrase of the  Imperial theme as Yoda foretells the danger of training Anakin.  Both of  these can be heard on the soundtrack album on the penultimate track.   References to the Imperial theme can be found in Anakin's theme.   The  other theme recycled is the Emperor's theme from the Return of the Jedi  score.   It is sung by quiet, low men's voices.   On the soundtrack album,  it can be heard near the end of track 14, and it occurs at various points  in the movie when Darth Sidious (aka Palpatine, aka Emperor) is speaking. I  feel that this soundtrack has many fine moments.  As popular and dramatic  as the Duel of the Fates, Flag Parade, etc., are, my personal favorite  music is that of the final scene (before the parade) -- track 16 on the  album.   This music, in an extended version, is also heard in the film at  the dinner table discussion between Anakin, his mother, Qui-Gon, etc.   I  feel that this excerpt is very moving and beautiful, and the progression of  the funeral &quot;chorus&quot; into the final, haunting major-minor chord  (which accompanies the close-up of Palpatine -- master or apprentice?) is  remarkable.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Aurally stunning from start to finish, this album isn't &quot;easy listening&quot; but is best experienced in total immersion.  That said, it's surprisingly accessible, both smooth and mind-bending, a rollercoaster  ride of emotions that somehow draws back from the brink at the very moment  you think it's going to tip over into schmaltz.  It takes a genius like  Piazzolla to make music this dramatic without being maudlin.  Like Mahler's  9th, it altered my views of dissonance and harmony forever.  I know of no  recording quite like it.<br />A few Piazzolla fans may prefer his more  straightforward works, but I believe that he himself pronounced it his best  recording ever.  Recordings like &quot;La Camorra...&quot; succeed with a  somewhat more rough and impromptu sound; on this record Piazolla and band  aim for perfection... and achieve it.
0790731002|4.0|Val Kilmer understood this part. Unfortunately, he couldn't develop it the way he really wanted to due to the ego of the director.  Their feud is well chronicled and disturbing.  I will agree that the first two were more dark  and forboding, especially RETURNS with its intense sexual energy (not for  the kiddies), but FOREVER did an excellent job of providing more action to  an action starved series while staying true to the Batman mythos.  The last  scene in Arkham Asylum is really well done and leaves the door open for the  future.  Come back Val, we miss you!
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is the masterful work of James Cameron and I believe that it actually surpasses the original Alien in action, suspense, sound, and special effects, but not in claustriphobia.  This special edition version  on DVD is superb, the extras are fantastic, with an interview of James  Cameron, and  cut out scenes.  The extra footage that some of these  reviewers are complaining about is great.  They are saying that it is not  essential, of course it is not essential or else it would have been in the  original movie, the extra footage is more of a gift to fans of James  Cameron and the Alien series who want to see James Cameron's original  dream.  I think the extra footage is great and completes James Cameron's  masterpiece.  I recommend all of the Alien movies but this one is the  best.<br />I give it a High Five
630512762X|5.0|good story, great actions. Woo, you've done a good job
0784010188|5.0|This movie like the original is one of the greatest action movies of all time.  The way this movie is put together so intricatley.  There is one scene near the begining where the T1000 is chasing the boy and Arnold is  chasing the T1000 you just can not get any better than this, this has to be  one of the most intense scenes ever filmes and produced.  All the  characters are introduced to each other and to the audience in one  amazingly action packed scene.  The sound on this film is also amazing,  from gun shots to gates to the amazing bass, is always use this movie to  show off my Home Theatre.  This is truly one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's and  James Cameron's best films, and the Special Edition is even better.  Get  this movie it is great<br />I give it a Big High Five
B000002LRX|5.0|Without a doubt, &quot;Angle Dust&quot; is one of the best hard rock releases to ever hit stereo systems (It certainly didn't hit the airwaves-FOR SHAME!!!) A great blend of all types of rock: funk, punk,  metal, progressive, jazz, you name it.  I can honestly say that there is  only ONE cut of this cd that I skip over, 'RV' - but EVERY song is  masterfully put together: 'Land of Sunshine','Caffeine', 'Smaller &amp;  Smaller', 'Jizzlobber', ect. ect. If 'Angle Dust' is not part of your cd  collection,  you aint got ****. So, why has this not scored well with the  public? I believe it was before its time: If released today, 'Angle Dust'  would be at the top of the charts.
078322706X|5.0|Well I've seen it half a dozen times already - no kidding!  It's that good.  At first, it was to discover more and more that I missed the first time.  After that I found the interaction between Joe and Susan so  wonderful to watch I just started watching when ever I could.<br />This  romantic fantasy actually covers plenty of serious, thought-provoking  issues surrounding life and death, love and relationships.  I loved the  message that Hopkins gives his daughter, Susan concerning passion and  finding someone who makes you want to dance.  The rest of the film develops  around that theme.  &quot;If you haven't loved, you haven't lived at  all&quot;.<br />I see from the customer reviews that most of the other viewers  also feel passionately about this film.  I can't add much to what they have  already written, but certainly agree about the wonderful aspects of the  film.  I don't get the part about the movie being too long.  It's only 3  hours.  That's a lot less time than it takes to read a great book.<br />Looks  like some of the viewers didn't care for the movie.  (One star?  The music  alone is worth more!)  How unfortunate...<br />I guess it would be impossible  to make a movie that thrills everybody.
B00000JMQC|5.0|It was a very good movie! It is not as good as The Wizard of Oz, but it has its good points.
6305470448|1.0|I was so utterly disappointed in this movie after all its' rave reviews at the Academy Awards that I am still reeling from the aftershocks.  What a complete and utter waste of time !!!  The plot was silly and pointless and  so historically inaccurate that it was embarrasing.  Judi Dench did a fine  job as Queen Elizabeth, but her on-screen time was so short even her  performance couldn't save this picture. The plot seemed to be an  afterthought and only used to hold together painful love scenes between  Shakespeare and Viola.  Geoffrey Rush provided much needed comic relief and  played his part with grace and courage in the face of incredibly bad  performances by most of the other cast members. I cannot believe that this  film won a Best Picture Oscar over &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The  academy should still be apologizing to Stephen Spielberg for their gross  oversight.  I guess they were looking for lack of substance and lack-lustre  performances this year and not quality screenplays or realism.  I know war  is hell....but so was this movie !!!
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is certainly one of the best war movies ever to be released, and it is definitely the most effective anti-war movie. Simply put: It humanizes the Germans that are normally diabolic thugs in most WW2 movies.  The 'bad guys' are the protagonists here, and the incredibly detailed sets  and their claustrophobic feel make you feel like you're crammed into U-96  with them. The stark images and melancholy feel of Das Boot, combined with  the excellent writing make it one of my top ten movies. However, it does  have what is perhaps the most depressing ending ever seen in a movie.
630471288X|5.0|A long movie that is so gripping that you will wonder where the time went. Ranks up there with  Schindler's List and surpasses Titanic. Choice of Red (Freeman) to narrate was outstanding. That choice is what makes the movie  &quot;unpredictable&quot;. AFI missed the boat when this didn't make their   top 10 list!
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix is the movie of the year, maybe even the millennium.  It is a huge movie with a huge plot and a huge cast to carry it off. Keanu Reeves was &quot;The One&quot; he managed to go from a scared and nervous thief to a  savior of the world. And I believed every minute of it. The special effects  are great, but its the ones that are doing it that makes it  &quot;special&quot; I still have the picture in my mind of Trinity walking  on the wall, Keanu doing Kung Fu and ducking bullets in slo mo or jumping  in the air and getting off 3 kicks before hitting the ground. Don't miss  this one!
0891902236|5.0|This is one of the finest books I've read in my life, in fact I've just recently re-read it.  This young girl's courage, insight into human nature and ability to preserve a sense of humor in the face of such oppression is  remarkable. So much potential was lost when Ann died of Typhus in Belen.  She had said in her diary that she wanted to go on living even after she  died, and she did, she truely did!
0780624890|5.0|I love this movie.  I like vampire stories, I like action, and I liked the acting in this movie.  The DVD itself has quality video and audio and the disc is loaded with extras.  The audio commentary was very interesting, as  were the other extras.
B00000JCOV|5.0|If your are into the heavy stuff, not korn or limp s*%t, then you have to get this cd. This is the heaviest cd I've ever heard. Everything about this cd is great, its definitly worth the money.
B00000JGOH|5.0|It was a great movie but &quot;thedigitalbits.com&quot; caught wind that a special edition will be out soon. It was previously tied up in legal issues, probably with getting extra footage and the like. If you're a true enthusiast, wait.
B000002UT5|5.0|You know just when you think it can't get any better. It does.  Richard Marx did it again with his second release.  REPEAT OFFENDER.  From the #1's.  Satisfied and Right Here Waiting to the unreleased songs on this Cd.   They are all amazing.  This artist is one that will be around forever.  I  recommend getting all his Cd's.  His first CD Richard Marx, this one, Rush  Street, Paid Vacation, Flesh and Bone and his Greatest Hits.  They are a  definite plus to ones collection.  Worth every cent you spend plus some.   So what are you waiting for?!?  Buy them all now!  At the prices here at  Amazon.com you can't go wrong.  The service they provide here is far beyond  excellent. I am customer who will &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot; (shameless  plug )~~&gt;song from his Rush Street album.  :)
078322608X|5.0|I love this movie.  Pitt, Willis, Stowe are great and Gilliam is one of the best.  The video and audio quality are good, and the disc is loaded with extras.
B000002TLX|5.0|For those of you not sure whether or not to buy this Cd.  Just buy it!  It is a great compilation of his hits.  Richard Marx is truly one of the worlds most talented singers/songwriters/musicians/producers/arrangers.   Shall I go on????    5 stars all the way around.
0399143904|2.0|Don`t read this book, it isn`t worth the time and money! No real characters in this book, just killing machines on both sides of the law trying to look at least a little human, but failing. Lots of stereotype  impressions. The only good thing is the tension during the  counter-terrorist attacks but everything is over soon and you have to wait  for the next terrorist happening because the story between the action is so  boring.
6300216268|1.0|Everyone does love this movie- and I don't know why. And I mean *LOVES* this movie. It isn't that great, it's highly overrated. The best stuff is the different &quot;suicides&quot; that Harold comes up with, after that  it's just this eccentric old lady doing crazy, wacky things.<br />And that's  why people love it, the wacky grandma. Man, that's always an easy way to  get laughs or whatever, it's like throwing a little red-headed girl into a  sitcom that's lost its edge. The wacky Maude appeals to the lowest common  denominator within this &quot;cult&quot; genre. She's a tool to manipulate  your viewing, it's not good filmmaking or good storytelling. It's really  not that good, rent it, don't buy it.
B00000IQV1|1.0|There's nothing funny about this short-sided comedy.  The characters, especially Williams, acted so mentally challenged that it makes you want to hate this movie.  Ridiculous is the thought about this movie.
0312199066|1.0|In the small portion of the book that actually talks about the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan spends an inordinate amount of time on mean-spirited personal attacks on his fellow crewmate Harrison Schmitt.  The only reason I read the book was that I was hoping it would cover the Apollo 17 mission  in detail.  This book is a complete waste of time.
0790731754|5.0|This movie still leaves me in hysterics, it's not just a great comedy, but a great movie too! This will always be one of my favorites!
B000002LB6|5.0|My experience with Erasure has been a little backwards.  In fact, since buying &quot;Pop: The First 20 hits&quot; and &quot;I Say^3&quot; a few years ago, I have bought every erasure album (barring the latest two of  course) in reverse order of release.  Anyway, I just recently purchased  &quot;The Circus&quot; and after one listen was kicking myself for waiting  so long.  <br />Before buying it, I was sure, as I was with  &quot;Chorus&quot;, that the best songs would be the singles from  &quot;Pop..&quot;.  It ended up, however, just as with &quot;Chorus&quot;,  that my favorite songs were entirely different.  While I love &quot;Victim  of Love&quot; and &quot;The Circus&quot;, my favorite tracks are  &quot;Hideaway&quot;, &quot;Don't Dance&quot; and &quot;If I Could&quot;,  with &quot;Don't Dance&quot; being the top one. (I know I'm in a small  minority there)  This is just simply a great album and it brings my list of  Erasure albums better than &quot;The Innocents&quot; up to four with  &quot;Chorus&quot;, &quot;Erasure&quot;, and &quot;I Say^3&quot; being the  others.  I don't know what it is about me and &quot;The Innocents&quot;, I  guess i just &quot;Don't Dance&quot; to the Rhythm. <br /> As for the extra  tracks, &quot;Mountain King&quot; is fun, &quot;Sometimes&quot; is a little  unnecessary, but I do like the &quot;Boop Oopa Doo&quot; Mix of &quot;It  Doesn't Have to Be&quot;.  All fans of synth-pop will love this outstanding  album.  Next on my list to purchase is &quot;Wonderland&quot;.  (Can you  believe I don't even own their FIRST album???)
B000002UA0|5.0|The Abdabs, Sigma 6...syd barrett finally picks; pink floyd or the pink floyd sound, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is a magical first album of the greatest band of all time, Pink Floyd.  Mason, Wright, Barrett &amp;  Waters, work together really well creating what will begin an era of  pscychedelic Rock &amp; Roll.<br />You've heard later contributions, like  &quot;the wall, dark side of the moon, meddle&quot;--well this  &quot;piper..&quot; is where it all began.  If you want to reach into the  heart and the magic of Pink Floyd, here it is FIRST hand.<br />Amazon has a  great price in the basket, take advantage...we all have a bike, but cars  are still nice.
079073804X|5.0|Part supernatural horror (little twelve year old girl is possessed by evil demon), part religious drama (a troubled priest is made to deal with the pressures of death, doubt and the question of whether he is losing faith or  not while trying to provide evidence that the victim has been possessed: an  elderly priest with bad health and experience in performing exorcism; both  risking everything to drive out the demon), and part mystery (a local  detective who is trying to solve the murder of a hollywood director through  his involvement with the girl's mother and a mysterious witchcraft style  desecration in the local Jesuit church).  Now you have the ingredients to  the most disturbing, but well developed film of all time.  The Exorcist is  a rather off beat film for oscar winning director William Friedkin (The  French Connection), but thanks to him and an oscar winning screenplay,  written by William Peter Blatty, who also wrote the book, unforgettable  performances from Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller, and  especially, Linda Blair, and some of the most graphic makeup effects ever  caught on film, we have what is probably one of the most well made films of  the '70's.
6305426651|5.0|Roberto Bengnini deserves every honor. This movie touched me unlike any other in a very long time. Hysterically funny, sad.  I just can not describe it.  For those of you who don't care for foreign films and  subtitles, this is one movie that may change your mind.
0440180295|5.0|As a non-native teacher of English it is always difficult to decide which books the pupils have to read for the curriculum. I have been a teacher now for the last five years and needless to say every year Slaughterhouse Five has been the book my pupils have had to read? Why, simply because to me it  is the best book to come out of the second World War. It has the  grotesqueness of Kozinski's The Painted Bird and the way in which the  narrative is conveyed is absolutely brilliant and the story never gets  boring.  Furthermore, the pages are filled with truth and makes the reader  see the madness of destruction; of war. I recommend this book highly te  every person on earth. I believe if everybody would read books like these  the world would be a better place to live in.
B000002UA2|5.0|Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright all made huge contributions to this recording.  If you want to hear Pink Floyd working together as Pink Floyd; this is a great example.  An excellent selection to be remastered, and yes  another 5 star Pink Floyd attraction, buy it at Amazon or die!
6303471714|5.0|i've been using this tape on &amp; off for about 8 years. it works the bits it should, they ache and then u start and look great. no prancing around like some chicken on heat, just concentrated reps and sets targeting  all those essentally &quot;dangerous&quot; areas for the female form! It's  not too fast, in actual fact once u do this everyday, it's counted too  slow. as for &quot;unsafe&quot; - where? i always feel stronger in areas  previously weak e.g. lower back, so ignore that! (just don't push til it  burns, reduce the amount of reps as recommended!) looking at cindy's figure  throughout actually motivates me as she isn't a stick insect but has the  body I want and can aim for (apart from the extra 5 inches in height  unfortunately!) and the music is good, although if i had one dig - bring  out another tape of similiar format, 2 new workouts and newer  music...everytime i hear &quot;crazy&quot; by seal now i'm constantly  reminded of kicking my legs in the air!!!! and one more thing - YES, for  the first 2-3 days after the first workout dont be surprised if ROBOCOP can  walk better than u can!! It hurts!
0451160916|5.0|I have fallen deeply in love with this book. I am 15 years old, and have acquired a growing love for all of King's books...he's a pure genius...but this one is definitely his best. The way it grows excedes novel format; instead, it feels like you are literally inside Jack's mind, or inside  Danny's mind, or inside the hotel itself. Chilling, horrific, and  wonderfully, eerily psychological, this book is a masterpiece and should be  the rite of submission for any new Stephen King fan.
B00000JSJC|5.0|I was hoping that this great film would come out on DVD, and now I see it has, and will include a commentray by Ms. Bigelow, the director.<br />The virtual reality phenomeon is intriguing, of course, and this film how it  can be used for good or evil (mostly evil).<br />There is a something else  scene of a wild rock concert.<br />Ralph Fiennes has certainly redeemed  himself after The Avengers.  His portrayal of the purveyer of virtual  reality discs is excellent.
0688062334|5.0|This is my favorite (and most read) book. My sister got this book 10 years or so ago, and I read her copy a half dozen times or so. She's since bought me my own copy from England, which I've also read repeatedly. Being the  oldest of three sisters, I identified with Sophie, the main character and  also oldest of three sisters. Everytime I read the book, it just gets  better. I highly recommend Ms. Jones' other books as well.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|I thought that this movie was kind of boring. Ryan and Angelina's performence made this movie 10 times better than it would have if they werent in it.And it was funny that angelina had always been my fav actress  and lord knows I'm gaga over Ryan, it was so nice and surprising to see  them in a film together.Angelina is just so good in this film,its breath  taking.I love the part where she lets the vodka run out of her  mouth...thats so cute!OOHH and their romance scenes all I have to say is  ooo lala. The part about Keenan and Joan was so heart warming. It was so  surprising to find out why he wouldn't have anything to do with this very  attractive women. I was sooo surprised... I almost peed my pants..lol.  I  could have sworn he was gay or he like lost his manhood in the war or  somethin. Everyone is always saying how Ryan Phillipe is just a pretty  face... well I think that in this movie..he did the best darn job I ever  seen. At first you just want to strangle him(cus you think he's a huge  jerk) well then you start to understand his coldness towards Joan. I think  this is a beautiful love story that shows that under any circumstances you  can always turn to love and everything will be ok. I thought that was great  that Joan did'nt turn her back on Keenan after she found out the real  reason he didn't date. I said it once and I'll say it again Angelina and  Ryan made this movie.And because I love Ryan and Angelina I give this movie  an A++.I think they make a great couple and I wish he was with her instead  of REESE'S pieces.

0380002930|5.0|My wife read me this book ten years ago. It has been an item in my mind since. Fivver the mystical rabbit who understands numbers beyond the kin of normal rabbits is an icon for me. What is the top number for man? 1.8 million people incarcerated in US, 2,100 killed in Turkey today, how many  people with AIDS, how many people  are out of work, etc Fivver would  understand. You should meet him. Read the book.
B000002HIK|5.0|The second half of this album is not nearly as interesting as the first half. Songs one through seven are exceptional, but after that, with the exception of &quot;Alberto Balsalm,&quot; the tracks remain dry and boring.  &quot;Wet Tip Hen Ax&quot; is a perfect example. Songs like &quot;Acrid  Avid Jam Shred,&quot; &quot;Wax the Nip,&quot; &quot;Icct Hedral,&quot;  &quot;Come on you Slags!&quot; and &quot;Alberto Balsalm&quot; are my  favorites from his album. <br />Also check out: both Selected Ambient Works  albums, &quot;The Richard D. James Album&quot; and the &quot;Come to Daddy  EP&quot;
0780622650|4.0|Not a big fan of the transfer of old TV series to feature films (what's the matter, Hollywood witers getting lazy?), I was surprised by the effort made by this film.  Instead of taking the sugery campyness of the 1960's  show, they make it more real, giving it a dark edge to it.  The storyline  seemed to drift all over the place, as though the Robinson Family wasn't  the only thing lost.  But it did provide a good opening for any sequels  that they may plan on doing.  (Rating: ***)<br />The DVD production is  fantastic.  New Line went a long way in creating a full pack of features  and options, including cut scenes music videos, comentary, a game that can  be played on any DVD player as well as several games that are accessable  via a DAD-ROM.  This is the second New Line DVD I've seen where effort was  put in it's production.  (Rating: *****)<br />Average Rating: ****

6305181772|2.0|Being a fan of the original &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; TV series, I was impressed with the story line and production efforts of the movie.  Instead of giving everything away upfront, they handed it to you piece by  piece.  I felt that this was true-to-form of the original series.<br />What  ruined it was the lame effort to transfer the movie to DVD.  Paramount has  a problem of grabbing all the money on the latest fads without giving any  concerns as to what the fans want.  All they did was provide you with a  couple of screen formats, a few audio a caption options, and a copy of the  movie trailer.  Big deal!  <br />If you like the movie and want to have a copy  of your home library, consider the VHS version.  But if you're looking for  a quality DVD, this is NOT the one.
068815333X|4.0|I've worked in bookstores for over 10 years now. I've read a few things. Recently I had a customer tell me I had to read Lehane. He came back a week later to see if I had. I said that before he came back that I would.I've read all 5. I want more. I'd hate to live in the Boston that he's created.  I'd certainly get my Grandmother out of Brockton where she lives, but I  can't wait for the next Lehane. I'm thanking that customer the next time he  comes in.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|This sweet movie tells the story of a few deeply engaging characters. It is as invinting as a hot cup of soup on a cold day.
B00000IQMT|5.0|There isn't allot that can be said about this music, except the fact that its absolutely beautifull. Just like he always does, he gives all the main characters their own little themes that appear allover the place.. I love  it. Especially in Anakins theme, where Anakins dark future is revealed by a  few notes, easily recognized from the imperial march.<br />ARRGHH..... I love  him.<br />b.t.w, if you liked the EP1 soundtrack youll love the original  trilogy just as much.. buy em.
B000009ED0|5.0|Devil Without a Cause is Kid Rocks best!  It has the hard rock, the rap, and every now and then the laughs!  A must have!
B00000DHRX|5.0|This is one of the best collection by any artist. I wouldn't  complain about the hit songs  that are not part of this collection, instead I would enjoy the ones that are on the CD.  <br />I normally don't give 5 stars in my  reviews. But, this one deserves a complete five. No doubt about that. Thank  you George Michael for this wonderful collection.
B00000JCB2|5.0|It's a great CD!  I liked the mix of pop, rock, and rap, but most rock! A must have for any Bizkit, Korn, or Orgie fan.  Better than any orgie CD!
6305513414|4.0|Popped the DVD in and was pleasantly suprised. The picture quality was excellent, the sound so-so (to be expected). Did not care for the menu screen and a few more &quot;extras&quot; would have been nice. May have to  make room on the shelf for a few more of these...
B00000I0XW|5.0|I like the familiar opening song with Crawford. Unexpected Song was just that- Unexpected and very much a showcase for Brightman's fabulous vocal range. Nobody else mentioned Amigos Para Siempre but I loved this number  because of its passionate declaration of friendship and love.The playful  side of Brightman is underscored in Macavity. My heart broke with Tell Me  on A Sunday because Brightman poignantly sings the ending of love.I give it  5 stars and I'm going out to buy one for my friend for her birthday. Let  HER have a good cry too.
630505116X|5.0|This is my favorite movie. The plot is good, the effects are excellent, the action is solid. The cast is superb. Treat Williams, Famke Janssen, Wes Studi, Trevor Goddard, Kevin J O'Connor, and the rest combine to form one  of the most wonderful casts ever. This movie is a pleasure to watch over  and over again.
068815333X|1.0|Although I am a big fan of Lehane's work, Prayers for Rain fell short of my expectations.  Angela and Kenzie's characters are usually more believable, but this time their one-liners seemed contrived and their rekindled relationship wasn't fully justified.  After Angela's reaction in  Gone Baby Gone, I think their reunion would have required more of a reason  than a shrug of a shoulder. The only redeemer in this novel was a new  perspective on Bubba.
6305513414|5.0|The first season of Star Trek is, for me, a pinnacle of television entertainment, and having these new episodes in this vibrant, remastered, digital format is a dream come true. Both &quot;Mudd's Women&quot; and  &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; have a great sweaty, nocturnal look to their  cinematography and terrific performances. It often seems to be a given to  our 30-years-later perspective that the original Star Trek contains  &quot;bad acting.&quot; People forget the esteem in which this show and its  cast were held when it originally aired--Leonard Nimoy was nominated for an  Emmy Award for his role on the series and Shatner--yes, Shatner!--was a  respected stage performer. I can't imagine anyone else attacking the role  of Kirk's evil double with the kind of flamboyant theatricality that  Shatner does. You couldn't get away with it today and the aesthetic has  changed completely, but I miss this kind of scenery-chewing, and it's  definitely one of the reasons why this show can be watched over and over  again. Roger C. Carmel's deliciously hammy, hilarious performance in  &quot;Mudd's Women&quot; is almost as good. Just remember, you're not  watching NYPD Blue, you're watching Star Trek.
6304765231|4.0|The Comic Book by O'Barr was his way of dealing with his own loss of his fiance`.  The comic was much more dark and poetic, the movie however did it justice.  Lee of course was not the best but he was at his best and no  doubt would have gone on to do better.
0393316041|5.0|A smooth, flowing, and entertaining autobiography about a man of true genius but definently rooted in the world with the rest of us.  From the Manhattan project to picking up the ladies in smokey bars, Dr. Feynaman and  his curiosity has narrowed the gap between the superlative and the mundane.   This book is not a boring account of a scientist, but an exciting book  about a man who lived mostly on his terms.

0380778556|5.0|&quot;Last night I dreamed I went to Manderley again...&quot;, I was captured.  Probably one of my top five favorite books, &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; being first.  I simply loved this story and the way it is  written.  They don't write novels like this any longer.  The words and  sentences are more clipped and spartan nowadays, and while I can't put down  a John Grisham novel I also couldn't put down &quot;Rebecca&quot;.  And how  many people noticed, I wonder, that the author never mentions the second  Mrs. de Winter's first name, whereas the name of the first Mrs. de Winter,  Rebecca, dominates everything!  You must read it.
B00000K2SE|5.0|I have not seen the video version of this, since it is not out, but this is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The plot is complex, but too hard to follow, and the special effects are wonderful, but don't take  over, as in most action movies lately.  The real wonder of this movie, is  the fact that Keanu Reeves didn't annoy the hell out of me. There is only  one other Keanu Reeves movie, where he was able to accomplish this, and  that was Speed. This can be the makings of a new image for Reeves. I hope  he doesn't blow it, when he makes the 2 sequels.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix is a must for any DVD owner, and to even get close to the incredible special effects seen in the theater you need to own it on DVD.  The Matrix is a 5 out of 5 for action.
B00000DBXL|1.0|Bought this album on the the strength of Never There but I was totally disappointed. The rest of the album ranges from mediocre background muzak to abysmal inane rantings. Who the hell the lyrics to these songs??<br />As  for the other reviewers who claim this is the best album, etc, etc. I pity  the losers. They either have never heard any other CD's or are gullible  fools easily swayed by marketing hype.
6302800927|4.0|Excellent performances all around in a film that is both moving and amusing. The older actors are all brilliant as the rebellious &quot;rock 'n'roll&quot; adolescents. As much talent as you will ever see
078062369X|5.0|To those of you who have called this movie disgusting, stupid and gory...if you don't like action movies, don't go to see them.  And if you go against your own taste, have the decency to keep your whining to  yourself.
1881273156|5.0|This book helped me understand what my husband was asking of me. He's very pleased with the results. Now he has to read it!
0684833395|5.0|In Catch-22, Joseph Heller created a hero, Yossarian, who will go down as one of the great heroes in history becuase he is adamantly unheroic.  If that seems like a paradox, it is, but it is only one of many in this  hilaroius novel. This book is considered to be a stylistic masterpiece  becuase Heller creates huge, laugh-out-loud funny moments by describing  everyday situations in a way, and with a certain tone, that makes them seem  ridiculous.  Everything from standing at attention to picking up  prostitutes while on leave is funny in this book, and the truly amazing  thing is that Heller does all of this while at the same time bitterly  satirizing the military, big business, and the lunacy of combat itself.
014028009X|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. (I laughed out loud reading it in public). It's a mix of very smart wit with cringing (but still very funny) reality.   I know her, I used to be her!   Much more fun than Ally McBoring, even to a &quot;smug married&quot; like me.
B0000046KM|5.0|One of the most beautiful CDs ever produced.  The combination of Shirley's vocal styling, wonderful lyrics, and lush strings make this an irresistible package.  A must buy for anyone who appreciates quality.  Shirley is  clearly at the top of her game on this CD.
6300271285|4.0|This is both a great and bad movie: What's bad? For some parts of the songs, there's too much &quot;empty&quot; wordless space and in some spots as well as too much crammed in some spots. Something that's good and bad:  Having the original ending (where several Audrey II's take over the world)  cut off, which would have made it depressing; yet more strong  metaphorically (someone being persuaded by riches into destruction).
B000002H33|5.0|Im listening to this CD and banging my head, while thinking to myself: &quot;it isnt possible someone has written something so perfect, so metal-orientated, so good, all tracks perfect!! I cant believe they now do  Reload and Load. THis is a mark, this is real MEtallica!!!
0783228600|1.0|I love movies and I'm willing to accept films that are out there but this movie wasn't just out there it was just stupid. Everything had been done before. The way they treated drugs and the effects of them was at least a little on the mark but it never captivated even a little bit of my attention. I was so sad that I had paid money to watch it. I finally got fed up with it and turned off the tape 3/4 of the way threw the film. Therefore it may have some quailites in the ending that I'm not aware of but I think that the rest of the film is so terrible that it couldn't possibally be worth it. If you like J.Depp, as I do, then you would be much better off renting one of his other movies. If you are interested in the effects of drug abuse you could do much better by viewing almost any other movie with the same subect matter.
B000000OMB|4.0|When your first listen to this album, you think: &quot;Uau, its fantastic!&quot;. Then you see the flaws on it. But, in general, is music played by virtuoso and seasoned musicians, so it has a very good taste. I  like it very much, and dont unerstand why the critcs thought it to be so  bad! You must consider it by what it is: a modern progressive-rock albun,  with good lyrics and enjoyable songs, nothing more.
0790736926|3.0|It is difficult to enjoy a film with so many inaccuracies in time and place.  Texas looks NOTHING like the Monument Valley of Utah, where this was shot.  All of the characters are using 1892 Winchesters** and Colt  Single Action metallic cartridge revolvers*** which were not manufactured  until **1892 and ***1873, respectively.  The idea that our  &quot;?HERO?&quot; wants to kill an innocent white girl simply because she  was captured by, and is living with, Indians is not believable.  There are  many other Westerns with better stories and acting, such as: Treasure of  the Sierra Madre, True Grit, The Unforgiven, The Missouri Breaks, etc. .   Why some people consider John Wayne (the person) as a Hero is baffling as  he did nothing heroic in his entire Real-life.
B000001Y9I|5.0|What a disc,what a disc!!! Guitarrist Steve Morse is like saying &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Blackmore! Here I am!!&quot; This Cd is estupendous, creative, rocking, with GIllans fantastic voice and songs so rich, so  intense, its hard to believe that it is a band with almost 30 years on the  road (with various formations, of course). This is an example to Iron  Maiden, Rolling Stones and others, that are merely going on (and making  money, of course)without creativity.
0880381736|2.0|hmmm... obviously a great number of people enjoyed this book, and I must say that I found it interesting, but good it is not. This book rips great bleeding chunks from 'The Lord of the Rings', whilst making no attempt to conceal the fact. For Hobbits, read Kender, for Riders of Rohan, read  Knights of Solamnia, etc, etc. Even the concept of the travelling  'fellowship' is pure plagarism.<br />Each to his own of course, but I strongly  suggest that you look elsewhere for truly inspired fantasy (Tolkien, Vance,  Moorcock)
B000002LUB|2.0|With Dio, or Hughes or Martin, theres no chance: Sabbath is gone. THis CD really has its momentos, but they are very feel if you consider the capabilities of Iommi and Butler.
B000001FK3|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best album (oops - CD) that has been ever produced.  If you think this is strong language, listen to it.  Eric Clapton recorded &quot;After Midnight,&quot; but Cale's version is better.   &quot;The River Runs Deep&quot; is one of those perfect songs. Strong  guitar riffs and laid-back singing.  Truly great stuff!
B000002B7O|3.0|THis sequence in OZzy's career is worthwhile only because of RAndy Rhoads. In general, is a good album.
0385484518|5.0|This book is the BEST tool for learning how to live in the present. It will heal your depression, anger, or confusion. The story allows the mind to come to rest after so many years of pain.
B000002JSZ|2.0|This last Phil Rudd appearance in AC/DC (until &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;) marked the beginning of the three weakest AC/DC albuns, along with FLy on the Walland &quot;Blow Up Your VIdeo&quot;. It has bad production, a sense  of Deja-Vu, Brian Johnson singing his worse. For Christ's sake, just listen  to &quot;For THose About..&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot; to see the  difference!!!
B00000AFWW|5.0|I could say many things about this album.  The tracks I most enjoy on this album are so beautiful, yet sometimes, chaotic to hear.  Courtney Love, and Hole, proved to me that a hard album can be made with melody at the same  time.  Hole has made one of the best album of the 90's.  It's sad that this  album didn't sell as well as it should have, it was underrated in my  opinion.  If anyone takes the time to listen to such beautiful songs as  &quot;Malibu&quot;, such hard/sad songs as &quot;Reasons To Be  Beautiful&quot;, and a major album cut classic, &quot;Dying&quot;...one  realizes that this album should have been huge, but unfortunately wasn't.   I saw Hole in concert, and they were awesome...they haven't lost any of  their hard, raw edge...the only thing that changed was they decided to lend  an ear and chord to melody.  This album is a must-own, an excellent album  from Hole.  I love you Courtney.
0517122707|5.0|Not my kind of book! However, from the outset I was captivated by the larger-than-life characters who were carrying on such small, miserable and bizarre existences.  What kept me reading was the bizarre and fatalistic way in which the characters repeatedly impacted each others lives.  I  finished the book because I had to witness the inevitable explosion that  takes place when opposing forces are brought together.  Tremendously rich  characters with brilliantly conceived, hilarious interactions!
6305470448|1.0|Aaaarrrggggghhhh Uuuuuggggghhhhh
6301247485|5.0|Unlike many of the other reviewers, I found the movie to be quite faithful to the novel.  Redford played the transperent. love-driven arriviste with just the right amount of insecurity and naivete.  Daisy Buchanan is  beautiful but shallow, and Mia Farrow did justice to the role.  Similarly,  Bruce Dern made Tom Buchanan into the selfish, oafish playboy that he is in  the novel.  The costumes and the period detail were magnificent.  This is a  movie to own and go back to with pleasure.
B000006OS2|4.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Was hoping it would come out on DVD.  However, very poor transfer to DVD.  Quite possibly the poorest quality DVD I have ever seen.  I realize that I might just have received a bad one,  buyer beware.
B00000064G|5.0|I love all of Nick Drake's music but there is something special about this album for me.  I've heard that, while recording it, Nick was so depressed that he could barely speak.  Thank God he could sing, at least, and sing as  hauntingly as anyone I've heard.  As Shelley wrote of John Keats upon his  death, &quot;Here lies one whose name was written on water&quot;.
B00000K19E|5.0|Excellent Sci -fi movie.. Very complex move. Reeves is Good in this one.. Fishburne plays the part and the action is gripping. The movie will leave you on the edge of your seat the entire time
B0000025T6|5.0|This album is as cohesive in theme, imagery, and artistry as any album ever made.  Only Neil Young's &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; sustains such brilliant, haunting melancholy across every track.  Each listen brings you  more deeply into a world of small-time criminals, dreamers, and losers.   The lyrics are staggeringly poetic and the spare music is tough and lovely  at the same time.
B00000K501|5.0|I have heard so much about Rammsteins awesome shows :) And now I will be able to see them preform up close(pro shot)! Their music video's kick arse and the music is not like any other band I have heard! Rammstein Rules!!!!
B000001F76|5.0|I'm a fan of all kinds of music but I truly despise slick, manipulative country music.  Everything Hank Williams recorded in his brief life was completely the antithesis of that.  He ranks with Picasso, The Beatles, Bob  Dylan, and precious few others whose work towers over the cultural  landscape and always will.  All the songs here are classics but &quot;I'm  So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; is among the greatest works of art created  this century.
B000002NBY|5.0|This is a must have for every music lover.  No matter what your musical background, tastes, and preferences, you can not fail to fall in love with Paul Simon's masterful lyrics and arrangements.  It is a celebration of  love, life, loss, rebirth, and the brotherhood of man.  Each track will  touch you a different and personal way. Although the unusual African  rhythms and influences grows on the listener.  This is a CD which you will  listen to over and over again, learn every lyric verbatim, sing along to,  dance to, and love, until it wears out.  I wish there were artists of my  generation who made this sort of substantive music.  Untill then, I have my  &quot;Boy in the Bubble&quot; who sleeps &quot;Under African Skies&quot; to  share some of that &quot;Crazy Love, vol. II&quot; with me on my long ride  to &quot;Graceland&quot;
0783216084|5.0|This movie is the absolute best movie ever made.  No other movie will ever compare to JAWS.  I can only hope they will bring it back to the theater again.
0140186409|3.0|First it goes w/out saying that yes, I am a high school student who was required by her teacher to read this book. And although that put s me at a somewhat biased opinion I am still entitled to it and it is a valid one regardless of what some of the older generations who like to lable all  teenagers as having ADD. The book has many flaws but one saving grace. It's  important in the sense that it gives a great insight to a period in history  that many prefer to ignore or forget. But that's it. The story line is as  dull, unengaging, and and long as you could possibly imagine. And if  anybody has a problem with my opinion, tough. Like I said before, it's mine  and I'm entitled to it.
6304708521|4.0|The Laserdisc remains the definitive version of this film.  A poorer quality film transfer is used (the color is very washed out on the DVD, while on Laserdisc it was much more vibrant) and for some odd reason the  opening sequence was altered, showing a zoom in and out shot instead of the  'stardust' after the opening titles and also the 'released' version of the  title track was used rather than the film's exclusive version, with the  spoken intro.<br />      For all those who are critical of the film's lack of  plot, you are taking the film much to literally.  Think of the dialogue as  a segueway between musical numbers (like a long form music video) and it  becomes much more impressive and entertaining.
B00000IZOR|4.0|my daughter can beat this phone up and it still keeps on working.  There is nothing she can do to stop this wonderful toy.  I belive that it teaches a child the right and wrong way to use a phone even at an early age.

B00000JPH5|5.0|My husband and I saw the movie in the theater when it came out a million years ago, taped it off cable, and have been watching it ever since. Our daughter, who was still just a wish then, loves pretty much everything  about the movie. I really like the way the movie incorporates traditional  fairytale themes, really funny special effects (the frightening machines  that turn out to be operated by a little guy frantically pedaling), and a  terrific soundtrack. How good to get an announcement of the movie's  re-release! A wonderful surprise. Thanks for the e-mail!

B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams has done it again.  The soundtrack evokes all the feeling of the movie.  The way he combines some of the old themes into the new ones is simply brilliant.  Especially where you here some of Darth Vader's dirge in  Anakin's light hearted music
B000003CMC|5.0|The ABB is at its height here.  My copy of this CD (I'm too young for vinyl), is about as worn as can be.  Oh, and by the way, the ABB is not the Grateful Dead of the South, calling them that detracts from the awesome  musical talent, creativity, and power demonstrated very well in Eat a  Peach.
0684874350|5.0|This book affected me in ways I was not expecting.  One minute my heart was breaking for what this family was going through.  The next minute I was laughing because of how this world is viewed through the eyes of a child.   It struck every maternal instinct I have.  Mr. McCourt is an inspiration.   I realize now how lucky I am in my life.  I recommend this book for anyone.
1556154844|5.0|Highest recommendation. A good treatment of the fundamental skills needed for writing readable, well structured code. I've seen so much code written in the latest languages, tools, and &quot;paradigms&quot; that's still  buggy, low quality garbage because the programmers didn't master the  fundamentals like how to write a decent procedure, or use meaningful  variable names, or write useful comments. I wish I could give a copy of  this book to the programmers whose code I maintain and get a court order to  make them read every page before they touch a computer again.
6304140711|5.0|The movie was incredibly predictable, but I watched it 7 times straight b/c I couldn't stop myself.  It was awesome!!  Anyone looking for the soundtrack- it IS out there but the songs Mark raps, isn't :(
B000000OU0|5.0|as an eagles fan....i love their music....but this albumn is the best of their best...making it a must to have and replace if ever it got stolen as my previous 2 copies have...get it...you will love it...and keep it under  lock and key if need be...
B000002NIW|5.0|I too am part Mexican and like the fact that the Deftones are into metal and don't care that they're not blond whiteboys , except for the drummer.MUCH thanks to the Deftones who mix rap and metal and have helped  me get into rock music.I have to be honest I don't like metal... and still  don't,but there is exceptions like the Deftones!Chino Moreno is the best  singer in any band,any genre of music,at any style.I love KoRn's Jonathon  Davis but Davis can't rap,scream,bark,   rage,and come of in a voice so  beautiful that would rival any R&amp;B singer which is too bad but at least  Chino can.For some reason Chino reminds me a little of Layne Staley,another  one of the few metal bands I like if you can call them metal,from Alice in  Chains maybe thats why the girl from seattle mentioned them.Both Layne and  Chino have beautiful voices that can do a lot.&quot;Be quiet and  drive&quot; is my favorite song on here but all of the songs kick @$$. Deftones deserve lots of notice and not for being so-called KoRn  wannabes or for being part of a so-called &quot;trend&quot;.Get the album  and maybe an AIC one too.
0783219172|5.0|I'm not a big Michael J. Fox fan, but I did like this one.   I loved the character of Frank and Lucy.  It made me sad to think that for all those years Frank blamed himself for the death of his wife.  Patty and Johnny are  great they are a 1990's Bonnie and Clyde.  If you are a ghost lover see  this one.  It even has a good love story theme.  It proves that people can  find love again.
6300181340|5.0|To those of you who have tride to review a Hitchcock film at least try to spell right. This movie is an all time classic that will scare you IF you let it into your mind. Those of you who want nightmare on elm street, STAY  AWAY. Hitch was the master, just do what he wanted, leave your so-called  intellect at home, GET INTO WHAT HE WANTED YOU TO BELIVE!
B000002UVZ|5.0|As everyone else has been saying--this is arguably R.E.M.'s best album to date and my personal favorite.  This is the album that turned me on to R.E.M. back in '86.  I had just moved from New York City (where the radio  stations are LOUSY) to San Jose, Calif. (where the radio stations are  GREAT).  Anyway, I remember driving with the radio turned on to Live 105.   Out of nowhere I heard this incredible song called &quot;Fall on Me.&quot;   Ever since then I've been hooked  on R.E.M.  Besides &quot;Fall on  Me,&quot; I especially like &quot;Cuyahoga,&quot; &quot;The Flowers of  Guatemala,&quot; &quot;What If We Give It Away,&quot; and &quot;Swan Swan  H.&quot;  This is like an R.E.M. Greatest Hits album.  After 13 years it  still sounds as great as when I first played it.  Do yourself a favor and  buy it--at least listen to it.
B00000F0KC|1.0|I love John Wayne. I have embraced his movies for decades, including the rollicking &quot;McLintock.&quot; However, Amazon.com's only offering is a knock off version from &quot;Gemstone Entertainment&quot; - an infamous  movie distributor that is famous for sub-standard work. On this version  offered by Amazon, the back of the video's jacket says this: &quot;This is  an edited version of the original motion picture. All of the original  music, including background music, has been deleted and replaced with a new  soundtrack, some video musical scenes have beed edited out, and some  portions of the dialogue have been recreated by dubbing.&quot;<br />Thumbs  down to Amazon.com for even having these kinds of class FFFF videos on  their shelves - and there are many sitting there waiting for unsuspecting  customers to order them. The dialogue is muffed, the color is blurry and  the edited  music is worse than you can ever imagine. Now get this - even  John Wayne's voice isn't always his voice!!! <br />Shame on you, Gemstone  Entertainment, for destroying such a great origianl motion picture. <br />I've seen and loved McLintock, and this isn't McLintock.
B00000JPH4|5.0|The Dark Crystal is undoubtedly the most inspiring tale of courage ever portrayed in a children's fantasy adventure. After countless viewings from childhood through to adulthood, Jim Henson's films have inspired me with  his flawless mastering of the puppets.  The courage of Gen and Kira in  comparison to the evilness of the Skeksis keeps the interest alive  throughout the film.  The scenery and props are a fantastic backdrop when  there is dialogue and provides a framework so realistic that the viewer  feels that they are travelling with the characters.<br />The Podlings  demonstrate just how diverse in appearance the puppets can be, adding  realism by nuances as well as the interesting speech.  In much the same  way, the Garthums embellish all that is evil and serves evil in the  Skeksis.  Jim Henson's portrayal of their greed, pride and vanity is a  clever device in showing the viewer how divided human nature is with the  Mystic's being all that is good and just.<br />The Dark Cystal is a must for  children and adults alike which can teach us all a moral lession.  Most of  all though, Jim Henson has created a masterpiece of cinematics which I  believe will remain an all-time classic.
B000002GWN|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this
0790736233|4.0|As I had read - and loved - Sagan's &quot;Contact&quot; by 1987, I went to the cinema with a great expectancy, that was not completely fulfilled. In my opinion Contact the Movie is not bad, but it really fades if compared to  Contact the Book. The Hollywood guys have flattened the characters to a  point of not even resembling the original ones; who reads the book and who  sees the movie will hold very different opinions about Dr. David Drumlin,  just to mention one example. Many others are around. In the American  &quot;popcorn-selling cinema&quot; industry, heroes are heroes, villains  are villains, period. Aside it, the scene in that Ellie and Palmer go to  bed is a dark spot: not related to the story, absolutely unnecessary, and  worse, a reason for many people to blame the film. Sagan didn't make this  mistake in the book. And the final activation of the Machine brought me a  &quot;Back to the Future&quot; dramatic sensation (Bob Zemeckis again and  again), as the &quot;time machine DeLorean&quot; released a colossal storm  as it jumped to the time trip.<br />But apart from these flaws, the movie  leads us to think about humankind, our place in the Universe, science and  religion. Moreover, the movie shows that even the most determined skeptic  needs, sometimes, to rely on faith. By criticizing equally the extreme  attitudes from the dully skeptic science and the fervorous radical  religion, Contact the Movie is fair in this matter. In a way, the movie  kept at least part of the spirit of the book. Just to be short: see the  movie, and READ THE BOOK.
B00000JGOH|5.0|The DVD delivers as far as I am concerned.  I loved the film in the theatre, so I was expecting to be a little disappointed when I saw the DVD, but this is not the case.  Seldom do I see a film where all elements--  acting, direction sound, music, costume, etc.. -- work so well together.   This is a really intelligent screenplay which blends in real people  (Marlowe, Webster, etc..) into a fascinating tale of genius and how  elements all around, not just Paltrow, contribute to the inspiration of the  creative mind.  The sequences in which you see the creation, to the  rehearsal, to the first performance are often amusing, inspiring, and  dramatic.  Because so little is known about Shakespeare's life, movies like  this, although fictional, offer us another look at the greatest writer in  the history of the English language.  Outstanding acting!!  The final  sequence, where you see his formation of Twelfth Night I found very moving.   As for the people who didn't like this film, it's a mystery!
6305558167|5.0|Not your typical fantasy epic that glosses over the grime, lust, greed of the Dark Ages.  This movie lets it all out.  Robert Taylor in Knights of the Round Table is a good light version of the Arthurian Legend.  Some have  requested info about the music...Carmina Burana composed by Carl Orf and  Wagner's Rings of the Niebulung (sp) are well used in the movie.  You will  not be disappointed with these sound tracks.
0790737973|4.0|I enjoyed the movie (somewhat).  The special effects were good, the cast was excellent, and basically all of it was good, except for one thing: They don't explain many of the strange events in the movie.  For instance, there  is the sphere.  They never explained where the sphere came from (there was  only a brief &quot;sent out to pick up things like this&quot; to serve as  an explaination).  Events are disorderly and unexplained, and  &quot;Jerry&quot; seems to be a naturally-born psychopath, as opposed to  the &quot;child king&quot; he is in the book. Finally, there was a scene in  the book that was the absolute best scene, and it was not included in the  movie. However, the end sequence wakes the audience up again, and was  rather good.  All in all, the movie was entertaining, yet there are no  explainations for certain scenes.  Read the book!  It is much, much  better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002MFN|2.0|I bought this album after reading all these good reviews. What a waste.  Erotica the song just sounds like a bad remake of Justify My Love. The rest of the songs aren't bad but hardly ground breaking like everyone here is  saying. Bad Girl would be a great song if a better singer performed it,  with Madonna it just sits there. Unless you're a die hard Madonna fan, this  record isn't much to listen to.
B00000I0XW|5.0|I shake my head in wonder at the music snobs who denigrate Sarah's singing.  Quite aside from the fact that she is technically almost flawless, she does something more.  My reaction to &quot;Amigos Para  Siempre&quot; (sung with Jose Carreras), is really visceral.  I keep  wanting to play it over and over.  She excels at duet singing with talented  tenors and they don't come much more talented than Carreras. Why is it that  Britain produces popular music of this quality and we have rap?
B000002NJS|1.0|This whole album is just Madonna complaining about how people mistreat her and how smart she thinks she is.  Her singing stinks, and so does her attitude. Does she really think people should be impressed it took her  until she was fortysomething to realise money and fame don't buy happiness?  I knew that before I was twelve.
0684830485|4.0|Hemingway relates his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War in the form of a novel that is his own inner wish of life as he wished he knew it.  The story is of an American scholar/warrior, working behind  enemy lines (it's hard from the present to understand that the Stanlists  were &quot;good&quot; and the fascists &quot;bad&quot;, both turned out to  be evil, rotten at the core in the end) with a Spanish guerilla band.  Many  noble, brave acts are performed - even falling in love, having sex is a  noble act, as Papa writes it into the plot - the hero dies valiantly, the  true heir of an American Civil War hero.  Why, in Hemingway's hands, this  is regarded as first-rate literature (the stuff of a Nobel laureate?),  while in the hands of someone such as a Graham Greene or John LeCarre, it  would be regarded as merely well done escapism, is beyond me.  There is the  usual nonsense on the false, macho bravado of bullfighting and other  Hemingway stereotypes appear at intervals.  There is certainly enough of  the Hemingway literary power to carry the reader through to the end, but in  the end I was left convinced that Papa should have stuck to short stories -  where he left his lasting mark.  As usual, Hemingway is a man trying too  hard to prove that he is a man - never becoming one.
B00000J8EK|3.0|Somewhat of a change in heart from dig your own hole.  This album seems to dive into club music in places.  It lacks some of the creativity that other songs by c.b. have produced. Please don't tell me that they are going main  stream.
B00000J7J4|5.0|that sees some (strong) resemblance between &quot;Love of my life&quot; and the third movement of Brahms most famous Symphony (sorry, I can't recall the number). I'm a Santana's fan since I was a teenager and Abraxas  was one of my favourites ever. I love this cd, it's wonderful, and of  course being a Dave Mathews fan it's a real nice surprise to listen to them  together. Don't miss it, it's great!!!
6305428298|5.0|I sat through this movie feeling slightly ill at ease with the reality of these characters. The casting and the acting was spot on; it was great to see the incredibly talenetd Jane Horrocks reprise her stage role - I can't image any one else making her character work. What a stellar cast - Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, Michael Cain and Brenda Blethyn were all so absolutely believable, reinforcing my belief that English actors are the most versatile in the world!
B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit is sterile, play it safe music, and it is completely about cashing in.  Limp is a neutered dog of a band, dragging it's a@@ and trying to make a ruckus to draw attention.  They are not good at the heavy part of  their music, just like they are no good at the rap part.  If anyone wants  to hear the downright most abrasive album, it would have to be White Light  White Heat by the Velvet Underground.  Unbelievably raw, it will hurt your  ears.  Limp fans, just give up.  Everybody knows Limp is about as weak as  the Backstreet Boys.  They are just a little louder.
0140430148|5.0|The book is well written and the plot is very interesting.  The author has a fine sense of humor.  This book is one of the best mystery novels that I've read.
0451191153|5.0|I had read this book as a young girl and decided to read it again on a recent vacation; stayed up 2 nights reading could not put it down. Even as a woman I so identified with the Howard Roark's character. The struggle  between altruism and egotism is one that we are faced with on a daily  basis. Maybe the best position to be in, is a balance between the ego and  altuism; or is this a &quot;cop out&quot;?  To be a true egotist is so  difficult to achieve in today's society and perhaps can never be achieved;  but we must try. Self love is the only true freedom; when you love self  then everything around you becomes beautiful; you begin to operate from a  position of non-judgement. Oh! if only we all could get there what peace we  would have in our hearts and on earth. The individualist rules!! I loved  every inch of this book and am on my way to Atlas Shrugged.
B000000W6X|2.0|I originally had only &quot;Mezzaine&quot; which I thought was a great album so i bought this one next at a music store without reading any reviews at Amazon for it.  BIG MISTAKE!  I should have saved my money and  probably bought&quot;Blue Lines&quot; from the sounds of it because this CD  I think sucks.  &quot;Protection&quot; though is a really awesome song and  i like that one, but the rest don't even come close.  I'm not going to  throw it away but then again it's not my most listened to album.  Buy  something else, unless this is your last CD you need of Massive Attack's.
0553296981|5.0|We live in a society where we can walk, talk and think without persecution. Anne Frank didn't have that. At the age of thirteen she had to leave her home and friends to hide in the &quot;Secret Annexe&quot;. For  two years she lived in a few small rooms with her family and another  family. She had no girl friends her age to talk to, no TV to watch, no  computer to play on, and couldn't even go outside! Not only that, she lived  in constant fear of being discovered by the Nazis. Yet all through this  time she remained cheerful, unselfish and fully deserving of a better life.  As you most likely know, her life was tragically cut short when she died at  Belsen at the hands of the Nazis in March of 1945, two months before Belsen  was liberated. Anne Frank was light in a dark, bitter world and I think we  should all try to be like her, more cheerful, unselfish and deserving of  the wonderful freedom we have. And one more thing, &quot;Go outside, to the  fields, enjoy nature and the sunshine, go out and try to recapture  happiness in yourself and in God. Think of all the beauty that's still left  in and around you and be happy!.....Whoever is happy will make others happy  too. He who has courage and faith will never perish in misery!--Anne  Frank&quot;
B00000K19E|5.0|Every decade or so, a phenomenal science fiction  film emerges that transcends the traditional  &quot;Oh, but it's sci-fi&quot; barrier.  In the last few years, the media, the X-files, a lying president, Television  Warfare, MTV-culture, and the internet have the solopstic scenario of The  Matrix possible.<br />Look about you, 5000 people are dead in Turkey.  What  does this number mean?  It's baseless to us - another cipher on the evening  news.  The same as Vietnam's kill ratio: &quot;What does it mean?  What  does it measure?&quot;  Only the absurdity of our modern time.  The fact  is, The Matrix is already here - and kiddies, there's no way out.  <br />But  that's reality, to the movie - Rich, dark, and complex, The Matrix weaves  Biblical references, Homeric allusions (compare Odysseus and Telemakhos'  shootout vs. the suiters and Neo &amp; Trinity's finale assault),  post-Structruralist ontology, and a visual poetry unlike anything seen  before.  It's like Beethoven's passionate symphonies, Hegel's conquering  Spirit, the final scenes of Faust.  It is a phoenix borne of the massive  weight of it's own message.  I can't express how wonderful the film is -  metaphor fails.  <br />Perhaps the best part of The Matrix is that it gives  voice to the underlying tensions of this era.  As we approach &quot;The  Millennium&quot; (or to those familiar with Baudrillard [Author of  Simulacra and Simulation - where Neo keeps his cash] we could say the  &quot;sign&quot; of The Millennium), many have become aware of an edgy  nexus where something about us or in us may by revealed...Ergo all this Y2K  paranoia, flim-flam (note to consumers: someone's making money on your  paranoia).<br />The Matrix gives voice to this suspicion and resonates with  the braveness we must hold in stepping out into the following years.<br />In  short, the movie is the animus for the cynicism, the doubt, the danger, the  disillusionment of our time.  It is not truly a film, but an embodiment of  the spirit of the time (zeitgeist; or, if I may abuse Hegel's terminology:  &quot;A world-historical film&quot;).<br />That the movie is phenomenal and  should be bought goes without saying, that it is a powerful representation  of our society must be acknowledged.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This cd has to be the best I've heard in over a year. Limp Bizkit have managed to mix rap,metal with a hard n' heavy sound, which doesn't include all the screaming as some songs had in the last album. If youre into korn  and kid rock buy this cd today!
B000002MTR|2.0|I am a little disappointed with it.  A lot of the songs don't flow well.  The songs I do like are Pea, Walkabout, &amp; Tearjerker.
B00000J6AG|1.0|I bought this thinking I'd like it a lot. Every review I read made it sound like the type of music I'd like to own, esp. the idea that this was groundbreaking genre bending man-machine melding music. The clips sounded good too. Unfortunately, the clips pretty much summed up the album, and when I stuck it into my stereo expecting more content than a few 30 second real audio samples could provide (which I usually get, even from albums I don't like) I was disapointed. Moby takes some good ideas and goes nowhere with them.
B0000026WD|5.0|Michael Jackson is a true and often overlooked musical genius. He has consitently proven his musical and lyrical versatility throughout the years, and Dangerous is his ultamite statement. His voice soars through the  CD with fresh, original music, and touching lyrics. I have always had an  enormous amount of respect for artists who can find something good about  this world to say, because Lord knows it isn't easy. It takes alot to care  and to love, and Michael has done this. It seems that artists before him  who have done this, and united people in harmony have been taken from us  (John Lennon, Freddie Mercury). It is hard to imagine what will eventually  become of Mr. Jackson. And it is even harder to imagine what music wouldn't  have been without him. He is a man who is undoubtedly touched by God, and  like most geniuses... misunderstood.
0767811046|1.0|Adrian Paul is not in this movie. Why is it in a list requesting videos staring him? I've found at least 3 movies so far that he's not in &amp; they're in the list of his movies.  Somebody needs to do a little  correcting, don't ya think!
0060926317|5.0|I hate reading reviews that say things like &quot;this book is garaunteed to change your life, blah blah blah&quot; but I can honestly say, that after finishing this book several days ago (I am now buying another copy so I can lend it out to several people) I have already changed.  The wisdom  expressed in this book rang true to me.  One of the things I most remember  from her book, and I use all the time in wishing/praying is to add &quot;if  it's in the highest good of everyone everywhere.&quot;  Also, I teach  children, and on all of their &quot;end of the summer/farewell&quot; cards  I am writing (taken from this book) &quot;We love you and support you on  your lifes journey.&quot;  Marlo wrote that this is what the aboriginies  say to a baby as it enters the world, and is also what they say to the  person getting ready to die.  I think that's great.  I have already given  one card out with this saying, and the child came back to me after reading  with glossy eyes, saying nothing, but expressing love, and she opened her  arms to hug me.  I guess she liked it.  I know I would.  &quot;We love you  and support you on your lifes journey.&quot;  This is only one of the few  inspirations in this book...
B0000029DD|4.0|I have to be truthful and say that I would never have bought this CD as I had heard through people that this music was very depressing. But after actually hearing it played by a workmate I was hooked!  I have been totally  enthralled by this CD since I bought it.  I have had the CD for one day now  and have played it around 5 times through.  This mans voice is unbelievable  and I agree with other reviewers notes on how he sounds like an angel.  His  singing range is so diverse it is truely beautiful, the different emotions  are just so complex.  I just love  Last Goodbye and Eternal Life.  Last  Goodbye had me in tears- it really moved me. No song has ever done that to  me before, WOW it was mind-shattering.  I will be playing this CD for years  to come.  I know I have been introduced to the great sounds of Jeff Buckley  later than most but better late than never.
6302798450|5.0|I have never been to a film where the ENTIRE audience jumped out of their chairs screaming and cheering like at AOD. Bruce Campbell is the greatest actor in the last 100 years (amply demonstrated in Evil Dead II in the  scene where he is attacked by his own hand). I also thought he was great as  Brisco County Jr.. But my God! Did this movie ever exceed expectations! To  everyone who worked on this, thanks for making a jewel.
0060987464|4.0|I would like to say the book was very interesting and i throughly enjoyed the book. The only thing that annoyed me was his stories!  He just went too over the top with him in his childhood etc.  The man obviously doesn't  believe everything he preaches. But there is truth in everything he does.  For instance we all know Marilyn Manson would not be where he is today if  it wasn't for him being SO over the top. His make up and him ripping up the  bible in concerts and wiping his behind with the american flag. YOU know i  wonder if he is laughing at his fans right now, with his millions!  But  none the less a very intelligent man and a very good book.  I read the  whole book in less than i day, i couldn't put it down!<br />I have to say i  love his music and i agree with him on many points.  Oh yeah, and pls  email me if you want more info on the book.
B000006OHL|5.0|No cigarette puffing-espresso slurping romantic's life is complete without this edition of Herrmann's final score to Scorcese's best film. The lush, sad main title rendered on sax commands still after 23 years of listening  to it over and over, and the newly restored dark crime jazz cues here  almost atone for the sappy Neely Plumb pop covers tacked onto the end of  the CD (they aren't awful, really; kind of kitschy maybe in a late 70s  sheen-funk way.  It's just that they have absolutely zilch to do with the  film in tone or placement. This gesture was a product, by the way, of Julia  and Michael Phillips reportedly snorting too much nosecandy in the 70s when  producing this flick and its score. Why a contract soundtrack plumber  was  hired to &quot;re-invent&quot; Herrmann's brooding, psychotic/romantic  themes is an answer a certain blow monkey must one day confront!) Ahhh,  Betsy, Betsy, Betsy...  Cybill was never ladled with such good music.

Jeez, this double CD was fine, and  makes me mourn for my lost youth and celestial journeys, but damn, I'm at  least glad I can say I was there.  I'm one those who cease to give a fig  about Floyd after Dark Side of the Moon.  When they abandoned the acid, so  did I.  But I can still play &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the  Sun&quot; and reconstitute that wild glimpse of eternity I held for what  seemed like a million years.  Thanks, Gilmour and Waters.
B000005J56|5.0|Here's the deal.. in a country full of musical talent (to say the least) largely unknown to the general American population, lives a Gold mine of aging musical genius. However, unlike most musical wizards, these musicians  play out of love, for their nation, their music, their life. All it took  was a &quot;Gold prospector&quot; and his Hawaiian slide guitar to find,  publicize, and exploit these musicians for a cool buck.. or two. However,  none of this leaves this cd any worse. No guitar could ever destroy the  brilliance of the rest of the musicians in this album, or take away from  the fact that they are all still playing for all they've ever known.. What  is left is worth far more than money; authentic Cuban brilliance in music.
B00000J7SS|5.0|i thot i wood like this ablbum cuz of the trippy art and that it is considerd to be in some circle a &quot;classic&quot;, but i just cant seam to get into it.  i am metal fan who despiritly wants to change his ways to  listen to something new, but i can't take this torture no more.  im not  ready to exspand my horizons i gess.
B00000K19E|5.0|Sure makes me we wish that I had a Wide Screen TV So I could actually see the awsome VIDEO impact. I Buy a big screen TV and what does the movie industry do . They shrink the movies into a bandage strip across my screen.  I'll just have to buy it on VHS I guess.
0783110928|5.0|I just want to say that Angelina Jolie was amazing, but no one's giving any credit to Elizabeth Mitchell, who was incredible with her sweet smile, terrific performance, and angelic  demeanor. Great movie! I recommend it to  open- minded people. I'm a heterosexual woman, but the sex scenes were very  touching. It's a bit of a romance, too.
6305169195|1.0|Amageddon stands as a towering example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days.  This is just an MTV music video expanded into a feature length film.  If you have the IQ of a Forrest Gump and the  attention span of a fly, you'll probably love it though.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|In 1935 the British film industry lagged far behind Hollywood in technical expertise, and that gap somewhat mars this film.  But Hitchcock far exceeded anyone working in Hollywood at the time in his knowledge and  mastery of his craft, so that while the film might be a bit grainier and  the sound a bit muddier than contemporary American releases, THE 39 STEPS  reflects a mastery of craft and film technique largely neglected in the  U.S.
6305513406|5.0|Folks, this is as good as you're going to see and hear the original series.  This most striking aspect was the remixed Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.  Red Alerts were going off all around, my sub boomed with explosions, and  the Enterpirse flew right by via rear speaker panning.  No, the extras we'd  all like aren't there, but this is a must see for real ST fans!!!
B000002J1H|5.0|It is unbelieveable to me that anyone would ever rate this album less than 5 stars.  It is simply one of the greatest albums recorded in its era.  In addition, this album has led to other genres of music which we now enjoy.   The voices are angelic, the guitars are flawless, and the writing is  seemless.  This was the first CD I ever bought and only the clarity of the  compact disk was able to improve it from its original materful standing on  vinyl.  If you don't own it...I pity you.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is my first CD by Secret Garden.  I actually bought it a year ago, and I listen to it all the time, still! I work with computers, and I use this CD to keep me calm when the coding gets frustrating. It's very  relaxing and helps me keep my focus (there are no vocals on this CD).  My  favorite tracks are Steps and Moving.  I find myself humming them all the  time.
0060930349|3.0|Although the book clearly displays much work and effort on the part of the author, the Civil War period contains glaring factual errors which proper research would have easily uncovered.  For example, the author confuses  Confederate General's Joe Johnston and Albert Sydney Johnston. His  description of 1st Bull Run and Shiloh clearly show that he believes that  both Johnston's were the same person. The way it reads, he has Joe Johnston  at Bull Run getting killed as A.S. Johnston at Shiloh. In a second example,  he has Robert E. Lee taking over the A.N.V. after (A.S.?)Johnston's death.  In fact, Lee took over before the seven days battles due to Joe Johnston's  incapacity.  This is shoddy history. My personal interest in the Civil War  made it easy to pick up the mistakes, but the errors make me question other  parts of the book which I may not be so knowledgeable about.  Also, the  author should lay off the religion. large portions of the book are  engrossed in describing and over emphasizing religious movements as  historical turning points at the expense of more important social events.   Nevertheless, if you are historically informed enough to see through the  mistakes and opinions, most of the book is interesting and informative. His  description of Abraham Lincoln as a &quot;Moral Genius&quot; is right on  point.
B000002P5W|5.0|Once again, a cd this good needs no explanation.  &quot;Axis&quot; continues to expand and redefine the range of Hendrix's musical landscape.  Some of the songs may not be familiar to casual fans, but every track is  essential in understanding the nature of his genius (ok, Noel Redding has a  song too).  The musical, lyrical, and sonic explorations achieved are  sublime.  Masterful.
6302909651|5.0|Any movie that has Sharon Stone in it, especially one where she is doing her sex thing, is all right with me.<br />Although it has some plot mistakes in it, I don't know why critics gave it such a bum rap.
B00000J7JO|4.0|This is a quality CD library investment that will not dissappoint.  Top tracks are Californication and Scar Tissue, check em out!
B000002ADT|5.0|I heard this music for the first time in 1970,  when I was a college student in Riverside, CA. Sitting on the balcony of my shared rental in the &quot;student ghetto&quot; late one hot summer night, I heard a tune  floating softly from the open window of the neighbor's house across the  street.  Like a maiden seduced by a beckoning Pan, I was compelled to walk  over, introduce myself and ask what they were listening to: Miles Davis'  &quot;Blue in Green&quot;. Later that same week, following one of our  all-night keggers, I found a copy of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; that someone  had left behind and claimed it for my own. Now, thirty years later, each  time I listen to that very same record, it still fills my soul with the  magic of the first time.
B000002LPD|2.0|Wrong. It's like expecting cold Pizza in the fridge and finding old vegetables instead. If you like Van Halen skip this one, if you like Van Hagar buy it. For some reason most bands seem better when the members hate  each other. I don't know why, I do know that Van Hagar was cashing a check  that was drawn on previous achievements and Eddie V's guitar skills, he's  still great, Sammy couldn't drive a golf ball 55 yards if he had a V2  rocket.
0767803434|4.0|Air Force One's premise does require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, but this is easily done with the fine acting of Harrison Ford, Glen Close, and Gary Oldman.<br />But what really makes the DVD package so  complete is the commentary by the director.  Instead of some aimless  bantering that often makes up these commentaries, this one is done in an  interview style, which helps keep the discussion on track about the film.   There are only a few times when others films are mentioned within the  commentary, but then the discussion comes right back to the film.<br />The  disk is double-sided, with one side devoted to the wide-screen format and  the other side for standard.  Although I would have like to seen more  information about the production on the film, the excellent commentary  presented made up for it.
B000002552|5.0|This is an absolute classic, but when will we see the official release of the 5 CD set from these sessions.  The 5 CD set is widely available to the true believers and has even had a book published about it (&quot;Invisible  Republic&quot;).  The 5 CD set gives a much different, and more  interesting, picture of the sessions and contains many great cuts not on  this official release.  Why are Bob's fans tortured for decades in this  way? Just release the stuff already.
0441003257|5.0|This has to be one of the most delightful stories I have ever read. If you enjoy quick, clever witicisms you won't be disappointed. The footnotes are as funny as the text itself. I'll be giving copies to all my friends.
B00000JJM2|5.0|Everyone should go out and buy this one in a lifetime CD! It's truly the best!
B000002B7U|4.0|This is a good hard rock album. I see it as the low point in his carrear. Look at the titles of the songs! A little bit on the suicidle side. Ozzy himself has admitted to it. I will always love shot in the dark. Overall he  is still the best hard rocker there ever will be.
0345377370|4.0|This is the best spy novel - and one the best books - I have ever read.  Le Carre gives a very real look at the world of espionage during the Cold War.  A real novel of suspense, deceit, and intrigue.  He holds you on the  edge of your seat as Leamas tries, for one last time, to &quot;come in from  the cold&quot;.  If you're looking for a fast-paced book, don't look here.   You won't find it.  And if you can't handle hard-to-follow plots, you won't  like this one much either.  Reading this novel makes me want to read even  more of Le Carre.  A must for a &quot;real&quot; spy enthusiast.
0767835107|3.0|Excellent movie, but the &quot;Parental Lock&quot; feature was not compatible with my JVC player. The &quot;Parental Lock&quot; feature allows the movie to be rated by the player. I.E. this movie has a PG version as  well with the right settings on your machine.<br />On my machine, I was able  to view the full R rating, but the additional features were locked out.
B00000K19E|5.0|This was the best movie I've seen all year. Period.  Keanu Reeves, who I'm not a real fan of, plays the part of Neo perfectly. His slow-to-catch on, reluctant hero type couldn't have been played better by anyone else. The  rest of the cast is great especially Laurence Fishburne. But the real  reason the movie works is the story and the fx. The story, like the  Terminator movies, is disturbing because it's not that far-fetched from  what the future could be when artificial intelligence surpasses human  intellect and reasoning. And the special fx are just that  &quot;special&quot;. It was a treat to see this on the big screen and I  can't wait to get it on DVD.
0688152023|5.0|the book was just great! the pictures are fantastic, note the black/white photos really draw attention to the beauty of the human body, the work-outs are well written so that anyone regardless of whether they are beginners or advance can do. It is also a great book just to sit down and read.
B0000042MY|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Some people say that the whole soundtrack only really consists of 3 songs (1,3,6) and that the soundtrack could be more complete, but I think diferently.  The soundtrack  is so emotional.  It fits the movie perfectly!  Every song is so good.  I  listen to the soundtrack every day and I still believe it is one of the  best soundtracks of all time.  My favorite songs are: 1,2,3,5,6,11,the  beginning of 12,13,15, and 16. All I can say is AMAZING!
0375707972|2.0|Everyone suggested that it was a real quick read-short in length and you can't put it down. Well, I had a hard time picking it UP!!!  I despised Hanna even before her past was exposed. The book was hard to get through  but I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I found it very  disappointing!!!!!
B000004286|5.0|This movie was so amazing.  It was so emotional that I cry every time I see the movie, and most of the reason I cry at the movie is because of the music.  It is so beautiful.  I don`t understand how the man, James Horner,  can right music that fits the movie and the setting so well. This man is  absolutaly incredible.  On ascale of 1-10, I give this sountrack an  11!!!!!!! Amazing!!!!
0767835107|4.0|After the horrendous opening sequence with the (usually wonderful) Swoozie Kurtz, here directed SO wrong, this nasty little film settles down and becomes very enjoyable.  Phillippe tends to be doing his  quasi-Malkovich/Hawke-Great Expectations imitation too earnestly, but the  females are all exemplary.  The biggest kudos go to the director of  photography, the production designer and costumer designer (be sure to  watch their featurette on the DVD) who make this film as sumptuous as any  $60 million film.  This film will easily slip into my Guilty Pleasures  category.
0679731725|5.0|The book is brilliant.  The film is a crashing, misguided, Merchant/Ivorized bore.  <br />This is not the story of a misguided man too repressed to see romance staring him in the face; it is the story of  man  who has been a possession all his life; a man who comes from a long line of  human possessions, born to selfless servitude and dedicated, blindly, to  his aristocratic  &quot;owner&quot; employer.  He is so thoroughly a part  of the Upstairs/Downstairs social strata that he barely has a soul to call  his own.<br />Selfless in the truest, saddest,  sense of the word--he is  almost incapable of functioning with out a master;  a social embryo far too  old to develop properly once his is finally let loose into the world.    <br />The miracle  is that Ishiguro manages to convey, from first person,  everything that his protagonist is oblivious to.  The reader knows and  feels the acute poignancy and tragedy of all Ishiguro's butler misses;  ignores, denies; turns away, as each unacknowledged opportunity is either  fumbled, misunderstood or overlooked.   His uncomprehending and hopeless  determination to learn how to take and deliver a 'joke' is one of the most  heartbreaking sequences  ever written and a perfect example of the subtle,  exquisite, objective sympathy  Ishiguro affords his characters.  <br />This is  Ishiguro's best book.  If you start with it, don't go back.
0783231032|1.0|After hearing about how horrible this film was for years, I decided to check it out, thinking it can't be that bad. Trust me, it is that bad.<br />&quot;1941&quot; is nothing but 2.5 hours of smug, overpaid  celebrities screaming and yelling, and trying way too hard to be  outrageous. Spielberg's limp, PG-rated attempt at 1970s  &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; humor is the obvious precursor of such unfunny  &quot;wacky&quot; dreck as &quot;The Cannonball Run.&quot;  Lame, lame,  lame.
6305426694|2.0|Living in the Boston area, we were pretty excited to watch this movie about the real-life Woburn case.  Both Travolta and the script left us detached and deflated.  William Macy was the best thing about the movie.   Certainly not a flick worth purchasing.
B00000AF98|4.0|This is my favorite Kiss cd. I love their mid-80s sound. This record has more of a pop feel. I like that it is slickly produced and has lots of keyboards. The songs are catchy and a lot of fun. Kiss is ultimately just a  pop band, and it is nice that they finally embraced that fact on this  record.
B000001Y42|5.0|this album totally kills... i have it 4 a while and i just can't stop listening 2 it. this album just rips... i mean w/ pollution opens w/ dat great guitar and counterfeit is phat. stuck is sweet...nobody love's me has  the best yelling on it... faith is catchy but not great...stinkfinger  kills...indigo flow grooves and leech is DA song 2 play in ur car  stereo...i just love this song...especially when the music stops and fred  just screams w/ so much rage...u know when i heard there were making a new  album i thought it would have this style but it just doesn't...i like the  new one but not nearly like this ablum..this ablum will defitnely will  stand the test of time w/ great metal albums...the new just doesn't cut it  compared 2 this...this album is just so unreal and i have learned 2  appreciate much more since the disappointed new album came out...i heard  fred describe this cd like&quot; this ablum was like us hitting a baseball  that goes down the base line and on r way 2 first base we tripped and fell  on r faces; the new album is like us hitting a home run outa the  park&quot;...well this statement is totally wrong...if u wanna LB cd go w/  this 1 ...it is ur best bit
0783219172|5.0|This movie is a wild ride full of great special effects. I must admit that it starts out a bit slow but when things heat up, look out. I think that Jeffery Combs was an excellent choice for the insane FBI Agent/Nazi look  alike. His character really brings in the laughs.
B00000JMOF|5.0|For us fans of the Universal Monsters this was what we have been waiting for. After waiting for more than 2 years for Universal Studios to come to their senses and issue their &quot;Classic Monster&quot; series, they have  done so in grand style. Their first offering is the classic of all  classics, Frankenstein !  The picture quality of the DVD is superb, a nice  upgrade over the slightly grainy laser disc. For horror buffs the best bit  of news is that they have restored the line &quot;In the name of God, now I  know what it feels like to be God&quot;. This line has been edited out of  all versions I have seen in the last 20 years and it is great to see it  back in it's full glory. Extra cool perks included on the DVD include a 45  minute documentary by David Skal. He hosts this documentary and there are  interviews with Sarah Karloff as well as make up guru Rick Baker and many  others. Just a side note that Mr. Skal is a most interesting gentleman who  I had the pleasure of bumping into in NYC a couple of months ago and he  filled me in on all of the upcoming Universal Monster releases. He says  that one movie per month will be released between now and December  concluding with Dracula.  It is unknown whether any of the &quot;Son  of&quot;, &quot;House of&quot;, or &quot;Ghost of&quot; Frankie movies are  due, perhaps they will see how the current batch sell before committing on  the others. So, in conclusion, go out and GET THIS DVD AND ALL THE OTHER  ONES DUE OUT ON THE UNIVERSAL MONSTERS.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|The cd was ok in my opinion. Staring at the Sun, The Kid's Aren't Alright, The End Of The Line, and No Brakes are great songs. I even laughed my ass off when I heard Why Don't You Get A Job. Pretty Fly (For A White Guy) is  way too over played and gets pretty old. It was funny the first time but it  just isn't as good anymore. Like I said this album wasn't their best but  wasn't bad either. If you want great Offspring I would reccomend Ixnay On  The Hombre.
B000002VRZ|5.0|JUST SIT BACK,CLOSE YOUR EYES AND ENJOY THE  GREAT SOUNDS OF THE MOST UNDERATED GROUP OF THE 70'S.
B000002BPS|5.0|This one is definetly their best album. It's a lot better than Americana and has a more of the fast punk beats. Best songs are The Meaning of Life, Mota, Me &amp; My Old Lady, Gone Away, All I Want, and Change the World.
6304383827|5.0|I've loved this movie from the first time that I saw it! (And not just because I'm a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow!)It's not just a wonderful romance, but it's also got some surprisingly funny parts. They did a very  good job on bringing Jane Austen's novel to life while adding her sense of  humor. I love watching it over and over again so that I can catch things  that I might have missed before. One of my favorite parts is when Emma says  to Mr. Knightley &quot;Your entire personality is a riddle, so I thought  you over-qualified.&quot; This is a movie that needs to be owned by  everyone!!
6305428220|1.0|This movie was so lame and un-original it's not even funny. Is robert rodriguez so desperate to make a movie that he chose this piece of trash? Scream spoofed horror movies, like this spoofed sci-fi movies. Very lame.  Scream was unoriginal too, but it was funny, faculty is extremly boring,  with too many f-words, and that didn't keep me awake either. I want to see  another Rpodriguez movie with style, not trash, cause Robert Rodriguez ais  a GREAT director, but this is stupid.
B000003TA4|1.0|I first heard &quot;Nevermind&quot; in 1991, and thought I had heard it all before. In retrospect, I had. This Cd offers absolutely nothing new, and just recycles old seventies-bop-rock riffs. Also, the singer mutters  intelligibly. Some people find that cool, but it just shows he can't  actually sing. This is probably the most over-rated Cd of all time.
B000002JSV|4.0|One of AC/DC Bon Scotts age finest efforts, this CD has classics like &quot;Rockn ROll Damnation&quot; and &quot;Riff Raff&quot;, paving the way for the great &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;. THis CD lives through time!! It  rocks!
B000009EAD|4.0|I can't claim any expertise in Metal bands, but I know what I like, and I like this album! I dropped one star due to &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot;, which is too raw for my tastes, but the rest is just fine, thank  you very much.
B0000073NC|4.0|While guitarrist Ulrich ROth was still on board, Scorpions made set-standard rock. Songs like the tittle track adn &quot;Speedy's Coming&quot; were amazing. Klaus Meine's interpretation (albeit full of  sotak) was divine, adn the band flourished. After ROth left, the band was  gone.
6304119046|3.0|dont get me wrong, this wasnt a bad film.  it was kinda long and slow at parts but it wasnt bad.  i actually thought it was pretty good.  but the lunatics who claim its the best film ever are crazy.  truely, i couldnt be  asked to pick one movie as the best ever, but this one wouldnt be  considered.  maybe the camera work, etc were revolutionary at the time, but  we've all become so accustomed to it in this day and age that its hardly  noticeable.  i liked the way the story unfolded between the different  characters and i liked the whole rosebud thing.  my final thought is that i  dont know why everyone feels its necessary to exclaim &quot;he was only 25  when he made it!!!&quot;  big deal.  check it out, but dont expect  something out of this world.
B000002JKA|2.0|Call what you want, but in this CD Dream Theater cannot be called a &quot;rock band&quot;. It's a group of gifted players doing complex music for their own egos. But I enjoy listening to it, although I shouldconseul  you to listen to classic music by Beethoven, Bach and others, if you want  to hear real virtuosity!
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles went out with a bang producing this masterful CD, featuring the famed &quot;Beatles Medley&quot; that ensues on track eight and continues on until track 16. The melodies flow into each other smooth as  butter, with the Beatles producing their magic throughout. The Beatles, who  had been struggling as an ensemble band in the past year-and-a-half,  collaborated together to produce beautiful harmonies (on track eight's  &quot;Because&quot; especially) and great instrumentation (i.e.: drums,  bass, sitar, etc.). This is truly a CD to savour, full of lilting melodies  and quite possibly the first recorded rap song (&quot;Come Together&quot;).  The Beatles are at their best.
B000002HRE|1.0|&quot;The worst blind-man is the one who doesnt want to see&quot;. We get so &quot;emotionally&quot; involved with a band we love that, when they release a record which is third-rate class, we refuse to believe it, and  starts &quot;seeing things&quot; in it, like: &quot;They have set new  standards in their music&quot;, &quot;Theyre searching for new  directions&quot;. Come on! Face the truth! This Cd is not Metallica! Its  something weird. Will it be that Hetfield and the others are trying to copy  U-2, changing completely their sound  for the sake of... what? I dont  really know. Stick with &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; (the second CD, of course,  which contains the old covers). Its the best thing to do.
B000002BQK|1.0|For the longest time I couldn't decide which &quot;artist&quot; I hated more...Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, but after hearing this cd the choice was obvious...
B00000IL1K|5.0|I have always thought Sarah Brightman has one of the greatest female voices of all time. It's great to hear her expanding on a broader selection of tunes. Reminds me of Enya - if you love her, you love this one!
6304119046|5.0|This logic that art has to appeal to a mass audience to be great is so stupid its ridiculous. By that logic we would have to assume The Spice Girls are better than Mozart. But anyone who knows anything about music and  has studied it knows that Mozart is better. Anyone who knows and studies  film knows that Citizen Kane is a masterpiece. These are not ivory tower  critics, they are people who love movies as a way of life. Its not some  Saturday night diversion for them. You don't have to love Citizen Kane to  be a true film lover, but you must see it.
6303212263|5.0|Rarely does one find a film whose quality is of such a grand scale as to be difficult to quantify.  We finmd such a film in Superman - The Movie.      Director Richard Donner literally and figuratively had the word  Verisimilitude plastered all over the various locales used in shooting the  film, to hammer home the point that the film required genuine  verisimilitude.  The crew got the hint, and delivered a film that remains  powerful.    The opening is a clever mix of inauspiciousness and epic; a  child reads the opening pages of the original 1938 Action Comics issue that  launched The Man Of Steel; we then fly over The Daily Planet building circa  1938, reach space, and are then confronted with the awe-inspiring sliding  names and words that make up the film's opening credits.  The credit  sequence is worth discussing because it alone is worth the price of the  film, from John Williams' tremendous Superman theme (here presented with  increased reverb) to the clever mixture of lights and solar waves as the  audience is transported through space.    Finally the film begins in earnest  on the planet Krypton, a world populated by humans whose molecular  structure has been changed due to the radiation of the planet's crimson  central star.  Krypton is doomed because its sun is pulling it out of orbit  onto a collision course, but the ruling quorom pay no heed to the warnings  of its greatest scientist, Jor-El (people have put the rap on Marlon  Brando's performances over the years, but here he shines).  Joe-El  nonetheless builds a starship so that his infant son, Kal-El, can be  transported to Earth, a planet orbiting a yellow sun whose radiation will  allow his molecular density to make him strong, fast, and all but  invulnerable.      The destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's journey to Earth  are harrowingly presented, and culminate in the crash-landing of the  starship onto a field near the Kansas village of Smallville.  The impact  blows a tire on the truck of local farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent  (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford), and as they stop to repair it, they see  the meteor bearing the small child.    And so it goes, until some eighteen  years later.  The boy, Clark Kent (played by Jeff East in the Smallville  sequence with Christopher Reeve's voice dubbed in), finds the spire and is compelled to travel to the North Pole (this following a tearful goodbye to his Earth mother),  where the spire creates a huge crystaline fortress.  Within this Fortress  Of Solitude, the spirit of Jor-El summons his son through the boundaries of  space, where he evolves into an adult being, bearing the S-shaped crest of The House Of El amid the now-familiar blue and red costume and  cape.    Christopher Reeve now takes over, and the film nicely relaxes from  the love and pain that permeate its first third.   Clark Kent is played a  bit too broadly, coming off more as a doofus than a believable person - this is due to Reeve's interpretation of Kent as in the mold of Cary Grant's comedic persona.  But  when Kent changes to his super-powered alter ego, Reeve shines, presenting  him as authoritative, but not excessively so.  He pulls off a series of  acts, saving lives and stopping crimes, that excite the world and lead him  to be dubbed Superman.    In comes criminal lord Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman).   Mysteriously deducing Superman's weakness from a National Geographic photo  of a meteorite, Luthor traps Superman to prevent him from pulling off  \\"the greatest real estate swindle of all time\\" via sabotaged  nuclear missiles intended to detonate the San Andreas Fault and set off an  earthquake that will collapse the West Coast into the Pacific Ocean.       Superman's battle to stop the missiles and stop the ensuing quake  involve some of the best SFX ever put to screen, between the tremendously  effective flying sequences (this is the only Superman film to speed up  backgrounds to present the look and feel of flying at light speed), the  amazing sequence where Superman flies UNDER the California coast to move  the enormous landmass back into place, saving a teetering bus, saving a  train running headlong to a collapsed spur, and trying to stop a flood from  the collapse of Hoover Dam.      Not only will you believe a man can fly,  you'll wish all of it could happen in real life.  Such is the enduring  power of Superman.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Simply put, Santana is one of a kind. His style and rhthym are captivating ad put a 'swing' in an otherwise boring musical genre. He has survived many different stereotypes and emerged with flying colors. This cd is one of the  best I own, perhaps the best. Santana surely shows his musical genius as he  bridges a transgenerational gap that exists in music today. My vote of  confidence in his style is surely there. I praise him for his work.
B00000ILGB|5.0|It's easy to over-think the meaningfulness of German rock (Krautrock) of the late 60s and early 70s, especially since its image has always been somewhat cerebral and cold in itself.  Too much from the head, not enough  from the crotch, some have complained.  Its players meant for it to be  &quot;head&quot; music certainly, and all that implies - there was an  intention to the music, a commitment to experiment and improvisation  sparked by the intellectual and chemical freedoms of the 60s.  But at its  best Krautrock conjured a mood distinct unto itself, which in its post-WWII  teutonic heaviness could be as threatening and scary as any music ever  made, and in its experimental innocence also convey a warmth and humor that  speaks to the soul.  The album Yeti does both these things.  Amon Duul II's  second record is a double-album monument of dark European soundscapes that  possess a Led Zeppelin heaviness without an over-reliance on the blues or a  dependency on rock cliches.  The hard riffing has a much more exotic,  eastern European or central Asian tone, and the improvisatory tenor, no  matter how edited the music might have been in the end, contributes to the  feeling that this is NOW music, that this music is happening in the  present.  Made in 1970, it could be straight out of any time in history.   It's as heavy as Beethoven, as Gothic as, well, the Goths, as free from the  restrictions of language as Can, as art-y as Roxy Music, as punk as you  think you are, and ROCKS in its way like the most electric god of all time.   So yeah, it's music that's actually worth thinking about.
0671578278|5.0|Lucky selhat to get a complete advance copy of &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot;; my comments are based only on the first nine chapters currently available on Baen's website.<br />But believe me, the hook is set  deep and I'll be paying hard cash to finish this book.<br />As an unabashed  admirer of Miles Vorkosigan and Lois Bujold's writing, it would be tough  for me not to want to buy the book. But thinking of coming cold to the  universe Ms. Bujold has created, I think any sci-fi reader would first want  to find out how this particular story worked out, and second go out and buy  all the other stories in the series (lucky you for not having to wait all  these years for the whole series to expand as all the committed fans have  done.)<br />What happens? The hero, Miles Vorkosigan, a 30-year-old near-Count  in a fuedal society turning  Galactic, wants to marry a widow who doesn't  think she will ever marry again. His clone brother is trying to make a buck  with a gene-adapted bug modeled on a honey-bee. His hunky cousin Ivan is  beginning to despair of a permanent relationship in a society which is  short of females. And if that doesn't make you laugh, there are  complications more to make this truly a comedy of manners in a society  whose rules resemble very little those in force in late 20th century  America.<br />&quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; should appeal to any reader who  enjoys the worlds of fantasy but who will accept the lack of magic---and to  the reader of hard science fiction who will accept that certain aspects of  current-world limitations will eventually be explained (perhaps we will  find &quot;wormholes&quot; to make &quot;jumps&quot; through to other parts  of the sky). I think you'd pass only if you require your hero to overcome a  life-threatening force closing in on him (there's enough of that in earlier  Vorkosigan adventures...starting with his mother). <br />Not since reading  Larry Niven in the 1980's have I found such enjoyable, credible writing. I  look forward to finding out how it all turns out.
6302814782|5.0|A very well done movie! With really beautiful actors, amazing songs, modern elements, and like many already said it, very modern for it's time.          Two reasons for people who doesn't like this movie: -They don't  have taste for what is good on life,            OR           - They  don't  know this movie was released in 1987, YES, 1987. An inovattion for the 80s.  It has amazing aspects, much better than any of the stupids teenager-  movies made nowadays.             THUMBS UP FOR THE BEST MOVIE!
B00000JCOV|5.0|incredible this is the best cd i have and i have 130+ cds. slipknot is perfect but only if your a fan of really hardcore stuff. slipknots 9 members ables them to play great music in a fast paced fear factory fury.  if you like soulfly, fear factory, or snot you should definitaley look into  buying this. you won't be sorry!
B000002J7U|5.0|Having initially found Vangelis via albums like  Direct and Themes (both of which I really enjoyed) I wound up buying nearly all of his older and newer stuff.  This is very different than almost all of his other albums,  but is phenomenonal and definitely one of my favorites.
B000003N7K|5.0|This is probably the greatest jazz vocal recording ever made.  Hartman is awesome led by Lush Life - one of the most difficult of Strayhorn's songs to master.  I have listened to this recording over 1,000 times and I still  have a lot to hear.  Jazz classic and the foundation of my collection.
B000002UKS|5.0|I like this CD a lot, and every song on it is a really good song in my opinion. The Foo Fighters are my favorite band, and they really have talent, unlike these one-hit wonders like the Spin Doctors (way back) and  Citizen King. I think the Foo Fighters are massively underrated; a lot more  of the songs on The Colour And The Shape should have been played on the  radio, like Hey, Johnny Park!, and See You. I hope they come out with  another CD real soon, I love them!
6305095566|5.0|This movie rocks, I love it. I think it is the one of the best horror movies ever. None of my friends have seen it, only one has and that is because I told him, and he thinks it is scary also. And not much scares us.  I'm telling you, WATCH EVIL DEAD!!!!!!!!
B000002UB3|3.0|By the late 1960's the Beatles were maintaining a pretence of being a unit. Basically they were just laying down tracks separately in the studio and relying on George Martin to save them. And while their contemporaries  were pushing the boundaries of Rock, the Flab Four contented themselves  with churning out Pop or Garbage. I'm astonished that anyone can put them  in the same class as true greats such as Sheryl Crow and Blondie. Also,  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is not LET IT BLEED by THE ROLLING STONES, because  if you look carefully the covers are completely different. Now you  know.<br />Also recommended: ADVANCED HARMONICS FOR NOSEFLUTE PLAYERS by Hugh  Mungus.

B000006U44|5.0|The one and only first album! MOVING STRANGER..DOES IT REALLY MATTER...AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT AFRAID TO FEEL.......
B0000025DI|5.0|Well first thing is first.  I could go about the strength of the tracks on this album - but that's subjective.  I've been a little surprised at some of the comments others have made about the songs.  I love this album and  don't think there's a bad track on it.  Dylan has certainly had different  phases in his career - and this was just another one of them.  For me it  works - but the strength of the songs along was not what generated the five  stars.<br />Too few people who have posted here have addressed the real issue  at hand - how good is the remastering job?  So let me get right to that -  the sound of the music is light years ahead of the original Columbia CD.   In fact, I just played them back to back - and while I always knew the  original CD was somewhat lacking - when played side by side it really is  embarrassing.  The sound here is crisp - the drums have soul - and the  vocals are sweet (that's saying something for Dylan!)  So - for that reason  alone, the price is just outstanding.  If you like this album but  already have it on CD - don't hesitate - this is great - hear Street Legal  like never before.<br />Now on to the \\"Original packaging\\" aspect of the  release.  The sticker on the front of the CD makes it clear that the  packaging has now been fully restored.  Well crikey - that ain't saying  much.  The packaging sucks.  The original CD packaging was precisely the  same sans two black and white pictures which are so small on the reissue to  not matter at all.  This isn't a reason not to buy this version (of course)  but don't expect much.<br />Finally - Columbia are also remastering/reissuing  Duke Ellington's catalogue.  They have done such a great job with the  booklets for those reissues.  Interviews, essays, historical info (some as  many as 72 pages without extra cost.)  So why is it too much to expect the  same treatment on this album (and other Dylan albums?)  Heck - even the  lyrics would have been a welcome addition.  I mean saying they restored the  original packaging when the said packaging was horrible in the first place  is taking the pee a bit.  Still - that aside - if Columbia put out a  version with an excellent booklet they'd have won hands down.  Damn  -I  bought my copy of Desire in London and it had a great booklet of lyrics  etc.  Why do we get screwed in the US?  However. as it stands, this one is  a must have.<br />What a pity that the three current reissues of Dylan  material are this and two greatest hits collections.  I won't buy those no  matter what Columbia do.  Please.... How about a comparable job on Shot of  Love!
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds of Love is the most commercial Kate album.

0812931017|5.0|When I got this book I did not know what to expect. But the initial thoughts I had about Branson being an outright business genius were blown away. It is interesting to hear about his mistakes, his experiences and his  apporach to business.  His whole life story is interesting from the start  to where the book leaves off. I honestly found it hard to put down.  Branson's story is so different to that of other great business  personalities that it is refreshing. I await with anticipation the next  installment.
B00000HZFP|5.0|This is the best recording in the history of musical theater. John Cameron Mitchell guides us with his truthful voice into the Hedwig's world. He is an excellent storyteller, who shares the elements of Hedwig's story with  us: loneliness, abandonment, and complention, in a straighforward and  honest manner. Definatley litsen to this amazing piece of truth.
0385493800|5.0|The Testament is not another formula legal thriller.  Instead, it is an updated Pilgrim's Progress.  The deep questions of our souls that we try to silence with 90's style diversions, are openly confronted and explored in  Grisham's latest.  Some readers may be uncomfortable with this.  To those  who have done the same there will be instant recognition and a feeling of  camaraderie with an author who not only understands but also can  communicate these inner workings.  Hooray for Grisham - very few of us are  brave enough to voice our inner workings.

B00000JNJ1|5.0|Rod Stewart should have retired years ago...today he wouldn't know a good rock &amp; roll song if it bit him. But back in the day, Rod was one of the best. This disc is the testement to Rod when he was the Mod.<br />But the  Faces were far more than just Rod's backing band. Ron Wood slathered some  mean guitar licks, the like he hasn't played since joining that other band.  Ronnie Lane penned some sweet songs and (gasp) actually stole the mic from  Rod a few times. The music is raw, edgy &amp; loose; so loose it almost  feels like it could fall apart at any second like 5 drunkards walking into  a wall. But it holds together, and it rocks.<br />If you're a fan of the old  Stones, Black Crowes, early Aerosmith, the Replacements or the like, you  should own this. If you think Rod's heyday was the 80's, you should be  beaten about the head &amp; shoulders, given a bottle of bad whiskey &amp;  forced to listen to this. Sadly Rod hasn't sung like this in years, nor  will he ever again. Your eyes will be opened.<br />All rock &amp; roll should  be this good.

B00000J7J4|5.0|I love the older Santana, but I really think that this CD has hit it for the 90's sound.  It has some of the hottest artists co-starring with him, and the sound is fantaz!
B000002L9J|5.0|This album is the best of the 80's. Morrissey never sang a song with so intensity and pain as &quot; I Know It's Over&quot; again. But in songs such &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;, &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; and  &quot;Some Girls Are Bigger than Others&quot;, he showed a cynic and  british humor sense. The band is in its best here, especially Johnny Marr.
0140067477|1.0|I don't know if it's a flaw in Taoism or in Hoff's logic, but he  preaches the importance of appreciating things as they are and not struggling against them, while ignoring the fact that the nature of humanity is to  change things.  Humans struggle to become (or at least appear) other than  what they are, and this involves changing the self and the things around  oneself.  Hoff foolishly ignores this and reduces humanity to the level of  fish that are trying in vain to whistle.
0553284347|5.0|Eight years ago I found this book and it saved my life, my marriage and my children. This book began my journey of reclaiming my life. I am a male and had been a victim of sexual abuse. My life was living one moment to another  to just make a life. This book outlined what was really happening - a new  focus a new understanding! Once I understood who I was I began a new life  in God and Man. I strongly suggest this book for beginners.

0783216084|5.0|JAWS is Steven Spielberg's greatest achievment! The awesome suspence and the kind of &quot;don't do that, don't go in the water, SWIM AWAY!!!&quot; approch is equaled only by the great Alfred Hitchcock. The acting makes the  film seem so real and in-your-face. And one of the few movies of it's kind  that you enjoy even when the monster isn't on screen! The shark dosen't  even seem like a shark, but more of an emboydyment of everything evil, and  everything that we fear exsiting underwater. Live shark footage added  strength to the effects so sometimes you coudn't tell if you were seeing  special effects or something real. The book is great (and a classic in it's  own respect!) but not as good nor dramatic as it's cinematic counterpart.  The films screenwriters (Carl Gottlieb and original novelist Peter  Benchley) elimenated the subplots of the novel, which seriously detached  the reader from the basic storyline. Making the film much easier to follow  and enjoy.The music score is amazing! It's like you can't even imagine a  composer (John Williams) creating the simple classic notes from his own  mind. The reacently released Widescreen version is terrific! You'd be sick  if you knew what you were missing in the pan-scan version (I have both  versions on home video, and compare them frequently). The widescreen  version is digitally remastered in THX! It makes a lot of diffrence! Rent  it, buy it, whatever! Just see it!!!!!!!!!
B00000J6AG|4.0|if anybody that reviews this album has any respect for moby and his talent, then this album should never achieve less than four stars. yes, moby does stray from his more techno-oriented background, but i think he  really shines with this album. it is beautiful and fun and meaningful all  at once. he clearly could care less whether we like anything about him,  being his music, his views or his lifestyle. he states that in the liner  notes. this album is flawless. i think that he should be praised for this  album, if only for the magnificent sampling. but there is more to this  album than sampling, which is more than i can say for a lot of techno  artists/djs in the scene right now. moby clearly loves music, or he  wouldn't be so creative. give him a break, why should he stick to techno if  he doesn't want to. everything is wrong was very very right, and this album  is even more so. appreciate it.

0812550706|5.0|In response to many of the negative reviews I have read regarding &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, I wish to clarify one point: Card planned on writting an entire series from the beginning.  In &quot;Ender's Game&quot;  you are introduced to the characters, their flaws, their adversaries, and  their solution. The hard sci-fi and groundbreaking new ideas come later, in  &quot;Speaker of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, and &quot;Children  of the Mind&quot;.  So, if you decide to read the first book... by all  means read the entire series. You will be more enriched for the experience.

B000002UZ1|5.0|No, it's on the CD, but everybody has forgotten to talk about the best song on the CD. All you people out there who love the Beatles, and you love good guitar, listen to &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. In my  opinion, it is the best Beatles song, because I love their normal stuff,  but I also love awesome guitar, which most Beatles things don't have.
0553573403|4.0|I'm kind of finicky about giving five stars to every book as it seems everyone here does.  However, this is an excellent book (although not the &quot;best book I've ever read &lt;multiple exclamation points...must be  REALLY good&gt;&quot;).  Tyrion alone was worth the price I paid for the  book, although all the characters were just outstanding.  You might hate  them or love them, but you feel something for them.  The weakest point of  the book was &quot;the annoying evil&quot;, as my husband and I refer to  it.  Okay, okay, I know this is a fantasy novel and there has to be a  fantasy element, but it's the most boring part of the book.  I was far more  interested in all the political intrigue.  Luckily, the evil has mostly  lurked, although the third book is sure to feature it.  But that's a really  just a personal, minor point that in no way detracts from one of the better  books to come along in many a year.
B0000024T3|5.0|Remarkable albeit unexpected--these songs are pure early Streisand, and it's fun to think that this album was only four years before &quot;Stony End&quot; and then &quot;Barbra Joan Streisand&quot;--Barbra's entry into  70's rock.  Her metamorphosis as an artist is mind-boggling.  Never content  to sit on her laurels, this album demonstrates that even in her youth,  Barbra was struggling to push the artistic envelope and--lucky for us  all--her body of work has been the most dynamic in recorded history.  C'est  Bon!
0784011796|1.0|Not nearly as clever or deep as it thinks it is.  Silly, immature, rambling and overly impressed with itself, yet remarkable in the accuracy with which it has gauged the kind of loser sub-culture at which it is  aimed.  Grow up, everybody.  There is so much less here than meets the eye.   <br />It is dark depressing bubble gum.  Absolutely nothing of any substance  whatsoever.
0425170349|2.0|Like most of those who have slammed this book in their reviews, I was once a big Tom Clancy fan, however, his latest work is mortally wounded by Clancy's overly preachy undertones, uninspired action sequences and a  complete lack of development for both the good guys and the bad guys.<br />His  political views are pretty apparent, I would bet $200 he votes Republican.   Though one might call some of the fringe environmental issues debatable, I  don't think even the most right wing types out there view everyone who  cares about the environment as a completely insane wacko.  Those who like  to go into the woods and make bang bang with big guns like Clancy have to  admit that at least a passing concern for the environment is a must.  <br /> I  sometimes couldn't tell if I was reading a fiction novel or a ballistics  report from an ammunition manufacturer.  Also, as much as some of his more  testosterone supplied readers might like to read descriptions of 10mm  hollow point bullets entering bad guy's skulls, it takes away from the  usually accurate and realistic tone of his other works. Reading about  people's faces being turned into &quot;pink puffs of vapor&quot; might be  enthralling for weekend Navy SEALS, but anyone with any combat experience  dreads the thought of being put in any situation where such is necessary to  do to someone else. I don't mind a novel or even a movie using such  descriptions to enhance some sort of realism (i.e. Saving Private Ryan),  but anyone who enjoys such thoughts as much as Clancy apparently does (with  the sheer volume of text devoted to exploding craniums), scares me.   <br />Even the world's best counter terrorism units have amazingly high  failure rates in close quarters combat... which is why most scene  commanders heavily resist their usage, even under the most optimal  circumstances.  Rainbow seems to not have these problems at all. Other  complete lapses of tactical accuracy are shockingly bad compared to the  usually sharp knowledge Clancy displays in other books.  <br />As shallow as  the anti extreme environmentalist plot was, it is only aided by half baked  development of antagonists and protagonists which leave the reader only  really caring about one or two people at the most.  &quot;Ding&quot; has  got to be one of the worst nicknames in the history of writing. Back in the  cold war days, Clancy could deliver &quot;black and white&quot;  participants who's general thinking conformed to the two main real life  organizations who trained and paid them (the CIA and the KGB), however with  the demise of the Cold War, much more diversification is required, and I  don't think Clancy can deliver.<br />All in all, where the classic Clancy  novels got one thinking about the dreary outlook that the global political  stances adopted by DC and the Kremlin, or the middle east's effect on world  politics, Rainbow Six serves only as an &quot;Popcorn Novel.&quot;  Entertaining for those who don't know much about the technical aspects of  which Clancy writes, but not the sort of work that ignites the mind any  longer.
B000005J56|3.0|I was not familiar with this kind music and was very pleased with the documentary about the musicians.  I find that I was much more interested in the people than in the music.  As I play the CD, the music does not hold  the same appeal that it did when I could see the players in action.  I  probably would not recommend this to someone unless they listen to it  first.
6304504012|1.0|It's hard to take a film seriously when an obviously 37 year old actress is playing a fifteen year old in the opening scenes.

Even more  sad considering everything was lipsynched.

With that in mind,  their music is better than ever, and I hope they come out with a new album  very soon.  Ive always liked &quot;live&quot; Pink Floyd video's the best  because I love watching David Gilmour at his best HE IS GOD!!!!!!
0784010501|1.0|This films shows that Madonna is a talentless spoiled brat. Her singing is as hideous as her personality. Why anyone would watch this movie or listen to that voice is difficult to fathom.
0590353403|5.0|I am outraged at the type of reviews people are posting here.  Along with your basic &quot;THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER&quot; reviews, I have found three that i would like to complain about.  First, the one that said this  book lacks verisimilitude, a feeling of BEING THERE with the characters.   My opinion on that is that the person just wanted to show off their  bigheaded vocabulary.  Second, the review that said that JK is making it OK  to ridicule fat people and that the behaviour examples are horrible...  especially the part that said that Hermione wasn't accepted until she  started to lie and break rules.  Okay, my opinion on that review is: 1. The  Fat Lady is the TITLE of the painting.  And when the unpleasant and FAT  character was turned into a pig and only got the tail, it was because his  PERSONALITY was like a pig's. 2. Hermione doesn't WANT to break rules, but  sometimes you HAVE TO.  If Harry and Ron hadn't Hermione would be dead.  If  they all hadn't Voldemort would have taken over.   The last review said  that these books are glorified horror stories.  I get nightmares easily and  NOT ONE of these books has given me one no matter what time of night I read  it.  John Bellair's books can be glorified horror stories.  But NEVER HP! I  LOVE this book and anyone should read it.  parents kids aunts uncles  teachers grandparents stepmoms stepdads cousins... what ever! ANOTHER thing  on the #2 review.  The person said that he or she would NOT give it to her  children to read.  Well, better that kids be reading where the  &quot;horrific&quot; and &quot;bad behavior&quot; things are covered by  magic and a sense of &quot;this can't really happen&quot; then be off  shooting guns or something.  Or reading horribly violent books.<br />GREAT  BOOK - READ IT!
0780625129|5.0|It was a great and exciting movie, if you are looking for a good movie with some sadness in it this is the one for you...
0060392584|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It had a sense of humor. Twisted humor, in some instances, but humor nonetheless. In a way it was inspiring-I felt like putting together a band myself. I think he truly does have a message for  all us listeners. We can interpret it in any which way we want, and some  may find the bluntness he uses to express it insulting, but only a closed  mind can safely label Marilyn Manson a satanist or something of the sort  and have their conscience let them get away with it. Anyway, I recommend it  to anyone and send it off with five stars for my own personal seal of  approval!
B000000OSE|5.0|every guns-n-roses fan should have this album. it varies from the hard rock of &quot;right next door to hell&quot; to songs that toouch your heart like &quot;november rain&quot; &amp; &quot;don't cry&quot;. this album is  definately a masterpiece!
0780623134|5.0|I don't think if there's enough words i can use to describe how i feel after seeing the movie, i was stunned. I have so much more respect in Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman after this movie. There are not so many movies  out there can truly reveal the talent these actors have and certainly no  movies can touch and inspire us like Shawshank Redemption. Simply the best.
0783230710|5.0|The one thing about this movie that I found more thrilling in DTS was the beautifal score by James Horner. Absolutely breathtaking. And the sound effects are so crisp and clear, you'll definately be transported to the  moon and back in this inspiring tale of true heroism.
B000002A3T|5.0|No this isn't Dark Side or Wish you were Here. Instead it's Pink Floyd finally getting the monkey named Waters off their backs. This album (like most floyd albums) does have a concept. It's an album about lack of  communication. But it doesn't  cram it down your throat like the wall does.  This album is not as good as the wall (the only album better than the wall  is Dark Side of the Moon) but it is no slacker. Marooned is probably the  best instrumental I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. The Division Bell  is a very reflective album. There are several refrences to Waters, Barrett,  and a song Wright seems to be singing about himself....&quot;I murmured a  vow of silence and now I don't even hear when I think aloud....I'm creeping  back to life...&quot; There will always be skeptics of Floyd without Roger.  But compare this album to Water's &quot;Amused to Death&quot; or any of his  solo stuff. Musically it's a tour-de-force with the greatest guitarist ever  steering Pink Floyd towards &quot;the endless river forever and  ever...&quot; High Hopes is the best Floyd album ender since Eclipse. A  must have for any fan of music.
B000002TPS|4.0|More irregular than &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;, nevertheless this CD is very good, mainly tha classic &quot;A TOut Le MOnde&quot;, a master-piece!
B000002U82|5.0|Quite simply, it's the greatest Lp ever created. The best album ever, by the best band ever. Period. If I could give it a couple extra stars I would. It's definite must for anyone who enjoys music of any genre. I am no  critic, nor do I enjoy playing one. But there is absolutley nothing to top  this masterpiece, nothing. Although Floyd have come close on a couple of  occasions with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;The Division  Bell&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot;,and &quot;The  Wall&quot;. Dark Side marked  the first actual &quot;concept&quot; record of Floyd's career. It does have  a unifying theme throughout (the pressures of life which can cause madness  a reference to Barrett perhaps...) but it doesn't beat you over the head  with (much like their 1979 epic &quot;The Wall&quot;) but it makes you  think. And this record, along with their other work, changed my life. Time  and Brain Damage are the highlights, but the album is perfect and well  rounded.
B000002JS8|5.0|Why this album has all its reviews five-star? Because it is a five-star album!!!! It's pure rock'n'roll / hard, great riffs, great AC/DC stuff, Bon Scott at his best. Buy it now if you don't have it!
B000002NIW|5.0|This is the Deftones best cd in my opinion. The best songs are My own summer(shove it), Around the fur, rickets, lotion, and headup. The other tracks are great also. This is a must buy for any deftone fan.
B000002UKS|5.0|It's amazing how, in this era of radio-rap music, a drummer (ex-Nirvana DAve Grohl) begins to also play guitar, makes a band, calls it &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; and records one of the most heavy rocking album of  the nineties!!!! It's very, very good! You go form one song to another  without getting tired!! Great&quot;
B00000JMQD|5.0|This is a trippy film and every time I watch it I'm thrown back to my childhood. The late 70's and into the 80's was a crazy time for children's films. 'Willy Wonka', 'Neverending Story', 'Young Sherlock Holmes', and  'Oz' are all wacky movies that I watched as a kid and was affected by. They  also have staying power. I can watch them and enjoy them even now. Unlike  the crap these days that panders down to kids, these movies are ones even  adults can appriciate. Watch this. It'll trip you out! Children of the 80's  unite!
0425170055|3.0|Rainbow 6 is pleasant to read and interesting. The military are too idolized and idealized but we've come to expect that from Clancy. However, although he strains for a pretend objectivism, his distate and contempt for  ecologists is a little too obvious. The suspense goes nicely up but you  lose interest after the hospital crisis and the ending is disappointing.  And there is something definitely spooky about the young hero already  planning to make a Soldier/killing machine out of his just newly born son,  wether you're pro-military or not.
B000002AGE|5.0|When this first came out in the 70's, I was into  mostly rock (Sabbath, Cooper) and a little pop (Joni Mitchell, Melanie). What a great introduction to a wonderful world! Not sure how I stumbled on to it, but  I'm elated that there is finally a CD version. The band is energetic and  imaginative in their compositions. Glorious! Nothing like widening one's  horizons. Even if jazz isn't your #1, I hope you check this out.
B000059TPN|1.0|A Criterion edition of THIS? Michael Bay's &#34;The Rock&#34; (1996) ranks among the worst blockbusters produced by a major Hollywood studio. With bombastic Bay at the helm, you get the usual choppy editing, botched action sequences and dispirited tone. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris go through the motions for a big paycheck. The result is cinematic junk food — all schlock and no style.
B00000J2SR|5.0|Unfortunately the last album from a great band, BENT OUT OF SHAPE is great standard rock with amazing vocals by Joe Lynn Turner. It may be a bit more mainstream than their earlier works but this album still has the  progressive edge that Richie Blackmore is known for.
6304224702|4.0|I enjoyed this movie except for the fact that there were so many &quot;previews&quot; before hand that the entire movie could not be put on the tape.  The gaps were very obvious to me.  I really enjoyed Grant.  This  was the first time I had seen him in any movie.  If the entire movie had  been put on tape, I would have given it 5 stars.
B00000JHAU|5.0|exquisite, understated, beautiful
6305078564|5.0|Our family watched the original A&amp;E broadcast and were thoroughly pleased.  We thought/think that this Pride and Prejudice is a timeless and classical production in itself. Wrote A&amp;E and told them so.  We bought  the six-part VHS release and wore it out replaying it.  Bought a dual-tray  DVD player all the better to get and show the DVD version of the A&amp;E  production seamlessly and in better clarity.  Alas, the greater the  expectation the greater the disappointment.<br />The DVD quality is no better  than the video though I'm certain it will last longer.  The greater  disappointment is that the long playing characteristic of the DVD is  totally negated. The DVD is still divided into six sections each with its  own interruption and interminable credits listings.  It makes viewing this  exquisite movie much the more tedious because of the interruptions every 50  minutes.  <br />We are not happy with the DVD set-up though the production is  outstanding.
068484267X|5.0|Not only did Frank McCourt tell his sad tale of his difficult life, but he was able to smile and laugh about his many struggles he had to overcome.  His memoir helped me put my own life into perspective and made me realize  that humor and positivity can help anyone through their struggles.
0783225733|5.0|A great movie that is why iam buying i
B000002U9Y|5.0|In Saucer, Roger started writing and the band picked up Gilmore.  Barrett was only a part-time writer at this moment and only wrote Jugband Blues, which was written in Dec. 1967.  Yet played on three of the seven songs.   The actual music is transitionall, as well, with the long title cut making  a foundation to their older, long music.  The album is filled with  wonderful, sometimes trippy music, but always orginal.
630463949X|5.0|The sound is INCREDIBLE!  This is what I use to show off my Home Theater.  We need more concerts on DVD!
0792151720|2.0|Although I did like this film the first couple of times I saw it. Upon a few more viewings, it fades and I realized that the acting wasnt all that good and Leo is so annoying. If you want  real films of epic proportions,  see Lawrence of Arabia, 2001:A Space Odyssey, Schindlers List, or The  Godfather, or the cream of the crop, Star Wars.
0812589041|5.0|OK, I realize I'm only going to be the 700-something review but this book deserves 5 stars!  Ender's Game is amazing and although the genius kids at the Battle School are kind of psychotic, they make the book really  interesting.  I didn't like Ender's character that much in this book though  ... he was a little too violent but you have to respect a guy who can kill  two punks with his bare hands.  The only thing about him that was really  normal was his attachment to Valentine.  I hated Ender's brother, Peter.   Graff basically summed him up when he said Peter had &quot;the soul of a  jackal.&quot;  The parts about the Battle School are the best sections of  the book because that's when they go in-depth about the training and the  real genius of the battle school kids.  Of course, Ender was the best of  all of them but I also liked Bean and Dink.  I've read all the sequels to  this book and can't wait for Ender's Shadow to come out!!!
0671578278|5.0|I've been chomping at the bit to finish this book since Baen books started posting chapters.  I got it yesterday courtesy of a friend, and was up till late last night finishing it.<br />Very funny, rather touching at points.   Also a little thought provoking, especially when Bujold starts to  extrapolate on the impact readily available genetic engineering might have  on a closed and traditionally rigid society like Barrayar.  All in all, a  very good, fun read.<br />What next, Ms Bujold?
B00000IZOR|4.0|It is so wonderful to see a childhood favorite of mine now being enjoyed by my own child. It is a toy modeled from everyday life that a child can use to play grown-up.  A phone of their own to call friends and family  whenever they want.  Always and forever a favorite.
B000000WF0|5.0|Excellent.  I love every song.  Definately listen to this with headphones.  Lots of textures and surprises as you listen closer.  I just hope the band will get back together!<br />&quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; and  &quot;Space and Time&quot; are my favorites.  Thanks, guys, for the best  music I've heard in a long, long time...
0780625129|5.0|His role in this film is Oscar worthy. A very powerful drama demonstrating how some people really feel about racism. Norton was perfect for the role as a leader which was splendidly acted. Great story with a deep message of  hatred and how wrong these feelings are. The film shows life's lessons on  what comes around goes around. One lesson to be learned is that violence  and hatred will come back to haunt you. Norton Jr. trying to turn his  brother's life around was a turning point in the film with a sad ending.  THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE BY ANYBODY!!

B0000024SI|5.0|I've been familiar with this recording for almost 20 years and I have to say that it is still the single greatest rock album ever, bar none.  Dylan was a mere 24 years old when he wrote and recorded the material for this  album, and yet he created something so everlasting, so revolutionary that I  cannot help but be in awe of his achievment.  Entire books could be written  about the lyrical and musical implications of this record (if one has not  already done so).  I mean, maybe I'm fawning over Mr. Zimmerman a bit too  much, but this recording leaves me speechless- after all, he had just  released another bombshell (&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;) just  months before.  Certainly Dylan was riding a creative peak, and yes, he was  motivated to bring his music to a new (rock) audience, but could anyone  have imagined that it would have come to THIS?  I just can't go into  individual songs and what they mean to me, or how they transformed music  forever.  Dylan demanded from his audience and from himself that nothing  would ever be the same again- and we believed him, and loved him more.
B000002LGQ|5.0|MADONNA HAS REALLY OUT-DID HERSELF THIS TIME! LIKE A PRAYER IS AND WAS THE BEST ALBUM OF THE 80'S!

B000006NL3|4.0|This is truly a historic document.  No secret why this album went unnoticed in 1967/68- the music, or rather the NOISE is just too intense to swallow.  It takes a little time to adjust yourself, but if your willing,  you won't regret it.   This is music that assaults the listener with a  blunt edge- &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;abrasive&quot; do not fully describe  the intensity involved.  &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, the closer of the set,  marches valiantly until it speeds through a most ugly and disturbing realm.   Just when you think you've had enough, it gives you more until you are  sick or wounded.  Reed (guitar) and Cale (organ) engage each other  ferociously, until the final distorted-filled note spews/vomits/gurgles to  signal the end of this madness.  Tucker and Morrison keep pace admist the  chaos.  Simply indescribable.  The methedrine must have been good.  Of the  rest, &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot;, with its ridiculous  feedback-laden guitar solo, demolishes all in its presence.  &quot;The  Gift&quot; is a rather macabre excursion that entertains, but does not bear  many repeated plays, so I give it 4 and a half instead of 5 stars.
0195067142|5.0|The clarity, honesty, and maturity of the text make this a classic. Interesting that like many of the soldiers in Ambrose's &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, Mr. Sledge also went into education after the war...
6304765231|4.0|I do not read comics so I have nver even seen a Crow comic book.  I first heard of this movie when Brandon Lee's death was in the news.  I was sort of sickened that they would even attempt to finish this movie without  him.<br />So I didn't jump the gun and see this movie in the theatres until  very late.  To my surprise it was a great movie that had an excellent cast,  and an excellent soundtrack.  <br />Brandon Lee's scenes are moving, perhaps  more so when in the back of your mind you know this was his last film.   After seeing the finished product I feel it was well done in good  taste.<br />The DVD has nothing extra at all.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Music just like vintage wine. Not for kids,but for those over 30
6305075468|4.0|This is the first known Dracula story put on film.  A silent film, it is not for mainstream audiences anymore, but for those that are either interest in film history, or vampire in film history.<br />There are tons of  extras here.  The commentary track is pretty informative.<br />One thing I  have noticed on these reviews here is that Amazon.com has integrated the  reviews of the VHS release of this movie, which had a Type O Negative soundtrack.  Please be aware that this DVD has no such soundtrack.  It is the original.  <br />Overall a good DVD since I am one of those whom likes to follow vampires in film and in literature.
B00000JPH5|3.0|It was really strange but has some good acters and good people. I really liked the worm.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|this cd's the worst one yet. its not even real music. they only have one good song from Smash.If I could give it no stars thats what I would do. go buy some real music.
B000002I2G|5.0|This album is good. The Doors when they were making this album was trying the brassy 60's style that was popular at the time. I'm okay with this album it has classics like Wild Child, The Soft Parade, Shaman's Blues and  of course the hit off the album Touch Me. Also the soft ballad of Wisful  Sinful is a great deep moving song from The Doors that you really never  here off their other albums. Buy all The Doors albums. One of the best  bands of all time!
B00000DHRX|5.0|I have been a Big George Michael Fan since I was a small child. At that time he was with the group Wham.  Despite what the media and press say, I still look at him in the same manner a human.  My favorite track on the  album is &quot;Fastlove&quot;  I can relate to what he's going thru. No  matter where I am and no matter where I go, I have his music blasting thru  the speakers.  As for those who have negative things to say about him,   he's famous and you're not.  What can I say &quot;The guy is extremely  talented.
630018403X|5.0|After this movie many have tried to copy it or make a better film about teen angst and they have failed. This movie is a instant classic and will be continued to be watched for years to come. The lines in this film are  the best. Like does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe? watch this  movie you won't be sorry.

0385493800|4.0|While I really enjoyed this book, I would have enjoyed it slightly more if it had been writen by a different author.  It was a wonderfull book about values in life and money, but it lacked the legal suspense that I read John  Grisham for.  I had expected more of a legal aspect.  I also was surprised  that the will was revealed that early in the plot, because I had expected  that it would have been concealed until later, to add suspense. Still, it  was worth it, and I didn't put it down until I finished it
B00000JCOV|5.0|listen......when I first saw these guys I though, yeah right.....ICP wannabees....but.......these guys are without a doubt the hardest band I've ever heard.  The only thing that comes close hardness wise is  like...fearfactory..and they don't even compare.  They are like korn, exept  like 10 times harder and meaner.  they have like..3 drummers, so you  totally get blown away.  My head starting spinning like the girl on the  excorcist.  You won't be dissapointed.  If you like korn, bizkit, coal  chamber, ect.....you aint heard nothing yet.  GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   It's harder than ****.
0425170349|5.0|This book is definatly one of Tom Clancy's best so far, and was the first one of him that I read, instantly hooking me as a Tom Clancy fan.  He shows readers many aspects and elements of terrorism that most (I hope! lol) of  us don't get involved with, in a realistic way.     Unfortunatly, the first  time I read it, it wasn't until after I got past the first scene that I  started to understand what was happening.  But after I finished it, I went  back and read it again.  That time it made perfect sense.  While rather  confusing, it made me want to read more, because I was dropped into action  on the first couple pages.  If it was dry and boring, I might have put it  down, and read something else.     In regards to som negative reviews of  this book, I think that some things that are lacked wouldn't be appreciated  in this type of book.  Long descriptions, too much character development,  and too many plotlines would all take away from the action in this novel.   If you spent all the time on that, it would be boring and uninteresting.     Now, I am not saying that Rainbow 6 has none of those, but it doesn't have  as many, so as to enhance the action of the novel.     I highly recommend  this novel for all Clancy fans, and even if you are not, it still makes a  great read.
B00000IOSU|5.0|It's amazing how just about every song in the album sounds better in live than in the studio. Sarah fully displays her true talent as a performer and a singer in Mirrorball. She injects new life and energy to most of the  songs in the album, the songs sound much brighter and deeper than in her  previous albums.
6304196938|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film Alfred Hitchcock did.  It has almost every element a movie can have, and a diverse set of characters and locations.  It is suspense the whole way through, even the 6th time seeing  it.

0393317552|4.0|A think this is an excellent book that provides a very thoughtful analysis of what drives development in human history.<br />To 'A Reader' who said that &quot;It proves the Bell Curve to be totally false&quot; - that's not the  point of the book.  The conclusion is that the differences in development  between societies was not driven by differences in intelligence.  Societies  still MAY or MAY NOT have differences in intelligence.<br />It still MAY have  happened that different groups developed differing intelligence levels -  maybe Native Australians are more intelligent than Europeans, or maybe they  are not.  That's best left to the empirical testing of statisticians with  all their flaws.<br />All that you can hope to get out of the book, besides a  good read and some fascinating history is that you can't say  &quot;Aboriginals are stupid because they were still living like savages  when whites arrived&quot;.<br />DON'T READ TOO MUCH INTO THIS BOOK.
1559272627|5.0|This book is poetry in motion. Pick it up, read a chapter and let it soak into your being for days or a week. Something to savor and covet! Kabat-Zinn has collected wisdom through the ages and presented it in a  simple, logical and comprehensive manner so that you know, they are all  saying the same thing. If we had but ears to hear! I have probably given  thirty copies of this book to friends, perhaps the highest compliment I can  give it.
0792156684|5.0|A brilliant film. Disapointed the dvd release has no extras.<br />barr
0060977493|2.0|Roy certainly knows how to write elegantly, and the opening pages of the book are certainly full of promise.  However later in the  book, phrase after phrase echoes the same metaphors, and while this may be  &quot;hypnotic&quot; for some, I found it made me fall asleep. Also,  there's no prizes for guessing the ending.  But these should not be looked  upon as flaws per se, but as the hallmarks of an inexperienced  novelist.<br />Its a pity Roy has given up writing, as it was only her first  novel, and I think she knows this work is not Booker material.  I feel it  is a tragedy for someone with obviously so much talent to be  put in such  an unenviable situation. Indeed sometimes winning is losing. Yes, it  could've been a great book, if it had been her third or fourth.Giving the  Booker to such a fledgling novelist was an act bordering on malice, as it  forced her to be judged alongside veterans such as Carey and other big name  winners. These players have had many novels published, some certainly  lesser works than &quot;The God of Small Things.&quot; We may see another  work from her in the future, but somehow I doubt it!
0671578278|5.0|A CIVIL CAMPAIGN is the latest from Lois McMaster Bujold.  This review is based on the first nine chapters posted online by Baen Books.  A CIVIL CAMPAIGN essentially continues where KOMARR leaves off.  Miles is plotting  desperately to woo and marry the woman of his dreams.  Complicating life is  the return to Barrayar of his clone brother, Mark, with yet another get  rich scheme.  Set against a background of social upheaval, the numerous  plots twist and turn unpredicatably up to this point.  I don't know the  ending but I'm sure looking forward to finding out!
6304586426|5.0|You people are mad out there..giving such a bad review on this great movie.  What I want to reitererated here is..this is one of the all time favorites which can make you feel good after watching it. And I totally  agree with you guys, how I wished love could be so magical and  wonderful........to be able with someone you really really love.  Whatever  it is, the movie is GREAT !!!  And it's even better ending with such a nice  theme (Nothing's gonna stop us now).
0783229011|5.0|arguabley, This is the best Family movie perhaps of all time. It's values and production perfect, as well as the story. A movie the whole family will enjoy from the youngest kids to Grandpa.  &quot;that 'ill do pig that 'ill  do&quot;
B000002UJQ|5.0|Right. Where to begin? I heard Creep on the Radiohead a couple of times and thought, hey yeah, good song, wonder who it's by. Radiohead? Oh, right. And then never did anything about it. I then met 1997's rave reveiws and  thought, oh another mainstream band, pity, and forgot about them. Until  1998, when O.K. Computer was on a 2 for 22 pounds offer and I thought hey,  yeah why not? I never looked back. This is simply one of the most, if not  the most fantastic albums ever written. It is, as I have seen others write,  a truely personal album, it's not back ground music, it's in your sole, I  carry it around with me everyday in my head because it is so totally  addictive. Pablo Honey and The Bends are both very good albums, but I've  never heard anything that can give me the emotional rush of O.K. Computer.  I've had the album for 2 years, and have only just stopped listening to it  everyday! Every time I hear it it makes me feel like I'm listening to it  for the first time because it just never fails to hit that certain spot  right in the middle of my heart. Buy it. Love it. Never be without it.  There are no words that can ever give it's magicical,slightly sinister  charm justice
0800136586|5.0|I thought that Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett were absolutely wonderful portraying their parts. I felt moved throughout the movie with every song.
6302732875|5.0|The acting alone is reason enough to watch this movie. I'll confess, I bought this movie because Kevin Spacey is in it and I ADORE his work. I wish he would make a hundred movies! He is joy to watch. I have also always  loved Al Pacino -- he is amazing and he doesn't skip a beat in this movie.  But the one who really pulled it off was Jack Lemmon. I don't know if he  got it or not ... but he deserved an oscar for his work here. He played his  part to perfection! Sit back and enjoy watching the masters at work.
0671578278|5.0|&quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; is another masterpiece from Lois McMaster Bujold.  In fact, I believe that it is the finest thing she has ever done.  In addition, I believe (pending re-reading) that it is one of the two or  three finest books I have ever read.  <br />I neither cry nor laugh out loud  when reading.  This book had me doing both within the span of 3 pages.<br />If  &quot;A Civil Campaign&quot; does not win this year's Hugo Award, I will be  shocked and stunned.  Buy this book!  Buy two copies and give one to  someone who has never read any Science Fiction.  It has everything.  A  great story, deep understanding of human nature, humor, drama.  Just buy  it!
B00000AFDW|5.0|I thought that KISS sucked because all they sung about was love and that it was not exactly considered metal but hell, i took the risk of buying this album and it is NOT a dissappointment at all! The heaviest song is  &quot;Within&quot; which kicks ass. So dont think that your taking a risk  if you are planning to buy this album because it is the best of KISS and it  kicks major ass!!!
0684833395|5.0|This is is funniest book I am working on finishing.  It is also frightening when I sit back and think about it.  It is like.. I laughed at death and destruction, people actually getting blown up hahahahahahaha.   Every page makes me laugh so hard I can never get to the end, because I  keep on flipping back.  For example, the fish dream section, I read that  about 30 times and I can practically recite it now.  I can recite a lot of  it actually.  Anyways, just read this book.  There are a lot of big words.   My favorite is concupiscent among others..... hehehe
0385043805|5.0|How sad is it that by current standards, Ms. Du Maurier's manuscript would never have made it past the Reader's desk at an editor's office?  Ms. Du Maurier introduces her characters at a  pace that today would be considered  slow and unmarketable.  But this is one of THE classics, filled with  mystery, suspense--one of the true thrillers.  And all of this without  blood, lacerations and decomposed corpses in the first chapter.  I remember  reading and seeing the movie years ago as a teen, and gripping the edge of  my seat.  Now, as a mystery author, I could only wish to write a clever and  exciting story such as this!  Editors and publishers in the large houses  should re-read this and remember what writing a thrilling mystery is about.
6300182266|4.0|I watched the series when I was a kid.  If you want a taste of your youth, this is one to watch with YOUR OWN KIDS.  Unlike many things these days, this one is suitable for all ages.   It was fun to watch again.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Sarah is a master.  Each of these beautiful songs touches my heart, and several of the songs even brought tears to my eyes.  She has such a way of reaching out with her voice and lyrics, and pulling your soul into hers.  I  am out to finish my collection with everything she has made, that is  available to purchase.
6305470448|5.0|This picture was absolutely deserving of best picture.  The academy overlooked the easy choice of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and went out on a limb.  This movie is artistic, the acting is terrific (especially  Paltrow, playing three different roles), the costumes, the score, the list  is endless.  Sure the history majors can point out the flaws, but that's  what makes this movie so great, it shows us Shakespeare in a different  light.  He is human, not some recluse who spits out sonnets.  But a man who  is truly inspired by life and love.  This movie is my all-time favorite, a  movie I love to watch on a Sunday curled up on the couch with my loved  ones.
6305169187|1.0|I watched &quot;Deep Impact&quot; before seeing this movie and was very disappointed by &quot;Armageddon&quot;. The makers of this film seemed to think all they had to do was have everyone in the cast continually shout at  each other and show us lots bright flashes accompanied by loud bangs. I  promise you this actually makes for a very boring and frustrating  experience considering the potential for such a brilliant subject. Not only  is the movie difficult to accept as pure entertainment, but anyone with a  scientific interest will find many of the special effects unacceptable- For  Example the Space Shuttle manouvering in space as if it were an aircraft  within the Earths Atmosphere; and the Asteriod on which for part of the  time gravity was very low being followed by a scene where it was apparently  close to Earth Normal.   Sorry, but even one star is being generous!
0783235666|5.0|Hitchcok masters the art of horror, not by using gore, but by using morbid suspense and anticipation.
6305499365|4.0|I've been waiting for this to come out on video.  I saw it twice the weekend it came out because I knew it wouldn't be in the theaters long.  The critics didn't seem to like it, but they're all idiots anyway, and most  of them have probably never had a real job so they just can't identify.   Mike Judge has an eye for all the nuances of office life - he's a lot more  savy than that jerk who does Dilbert, which is just the same joke rehashed  over and over.  After I saw this film, I had a hard time not re-enacting  all the funniest bits for my friends who hadn't seen it - but I tried to  resist so that I wouldn't spoil it for them when it came out on video.  The  reason I don't give it five stars is that, even though I loved it, it was  pretty lightweight and I couldn't justify to myself giving it the same  rating I would give, say, &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;
6305470464|5.0|This movie is excellent!  I love how the story came together in the end.  The actors are wonderful at what they do and it definitely shows in this movie.  It made me laugh.  It made me cry. It made me rent it twice.   <br />Tawny :)
B00000K2SC|5.0|i counldn't have believed it if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes. the matrix it's the best film that i've ever seen. i loved the plot and the special effects and the stars as well for me it was well acted and well  made. believe me this movie its a must see.
B00000JMOF|5.0|This classic Karloff vehicle has never looked better than on DVD. A crisp transfer with great sound and the restored scenes make it a joy to watch. What really makes this DVD is all the extras. A photo gallery of posters  and stills and a trailer are just the tip of the iceberg. Audio commentary  puts a new slant on the proceedings. A documentary by the ultimate horror  historian, David Skal, gives more background and visuals on the making of  this film. The real gem is a vintage short Universal film called  &quot;BOO!&quot; which takes scenes from Nosferatu and Frankenstein while  giving a comedic voice over-this is the kind of thing you rarely get to  see. I hope Universal puts this much care into their other upcoming classic  monster DVD releases!
B000000OSG|4.0|I would have to call myself one of the biggest GNR fans ever, and I think that this is an amazing album, though it doesn't have the raw edge that Appetite had. What UYI2 does have is much more variety in the songs. Some  are heavy like You Could Be Mine, and some are very sweet, like Don't Cry.  Civil War's lyrics are beautifull to say the least. I would highly  recommend this.
B000005J56|5.0|Cooder brings out authentic cuban music from the roots. Good sound, very well recorded, good selections of tracks. This is a CD to be in hands of people enjoy good cuban music.
B000002C2E|5.0|Bob Dylan here creates an album of astonshing beauty, depth, and wisdom.  Clearly an inspired work, it is a gift we could never have expected or hoped for.  Oh Mercy, as good as it is, is weak in comparison.  I would not  start here as a new Dylan fan, but work your way towards this jewel.  When  you find it, you will never forget the sounds and messages on this  immensely important achievment.
6305428220|5.0|The Faculty was one of best films I,ve seen in a long while . It was scary , funny, has good effects and was enjoyable to watch . I would watch this over and over because I liked it that much . It had some good acting and a  good storyline that was directed well . I would give this a top notch film  . I recomend it .
1878424319|5.0|In reading numerous books on spirituality and religious beliefs, I find this book very refreshing and uplifting. I have used the agreements in my life and it has made a tremendous difference.  I now give this book out as  gifts to my friends.
6305513406|5.0|The digital enhancement and remastering is outstanding.  As most of us have done, I've seen these episodes many times before...but not like this.  The picture clarity is crystal clear and the colors are sharp and vivid.  I  wasn't around at the time, but I imagine this looks even better now than  when it was originally broadcast.  It certainly sounds better, since  digital stereo didn't exist in 1966!
6305069611|5.0|An underrated film by Nic Roeg in which David Bowie plays 'himself' to a tee! Although not a patch on Walter Tevis' original novel, this 70s adaptation of a story about the human condition is compelling to say the  least. On repeated viewing it becomes apparent that Thomas Jerome Newton is  far more human than the humans surrounding him. Probably Bowie's finest  moment on celuloid to date and certainly one of Roeg's too. A very  interesting flourish.
B00000JBCP|5.0|The unplugged songs all sound great, and remind me of the concerts where they sound even better. This is the best rock band around, and they'll be around for a lot longer. Each of the memebers of the band bring great  things to the music, and when they play together live it is so good that  there are no words to describe it. Mana rules.
B000003S1A|5.0|Whether you love or hate this album, there's nothing else like it in rock (or jazz or anything, for that matter) history. Incredibly disciplined; virtuoso playing--from four individuals, and virtuoso ensemble playing.  Words will not describe what you'll hear: a unique guitar sound, poetic (if  superficial and facetious) lyrics, a strange '80s sensibility. Wow!
6301934229|4.0|THE HITCHER came out several years before THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the latter of course being much better-known.  The psychotic hitch-hiker Rutger Hauer portrays in THE HITCHER will make you lose just as much sleep at  Anthony Hopkins did in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  THE HITCHER dares to risk  upsetting the audience with the tractor-trailer scene, so you've been  warned.  Up until that moment, the suspense makes THE HITCHER well worth  viewing; after that moment, it's up to you.
0393039765|1.0|Perhaps I was expecting too much from this novel after reading all the glowing reviews.  Hopefully the movie adaptation will live up to the hype.  A few articles made much of the fact that Palahniuk wrote parts of the  novel while underneath trucks he was working on.  I can believe it.   Hopefully, his other novel, Survivor , will be a better read.
0062502174|5.0|Some of the moments in the book can uplift you in ways you never thought possible. It teaches you to believe in the signs of the world, to follow them in order to get to your personal treasure: to loose the fear of the  unknown, of loosing what you've become attached to.
6305079250|5.0|There really is only one reason to watch this film and that is Fellini's &quot;Toby Dammit&quot;. Terence Stamp takes the title role of an actor arriving in Italy to appear is some kind of weird religious western. He is  at the end of his tether and all seems alien and disorentated to him. The  Edgar Allen Poe story from which this segment is adapted from is called  &quot;Never wager your head to the Devil&quot; and thats exactly what he  does! All with the usual Fellini touch of class. Excellent.
B00000J7S8|5.0|Been listening to Jazz for over 45 years and being floored by a performer is now a rare occurrence.  Krall's &quot;Under My Skin&quot; rivals Sinatra's.  If you buy one album this year, make it this one.
B000001FRY|4.0|If you consider that the band was just 20 years old, this album must have 5 stars. It's amazing for a debut! The best albums of the early U2 years.
0425152251|3.0|The only way I can fault this work is through the connecting story.  It's so weak that I can't understand why the author bothered.  Nancy Drew meets Plato is the only way I describe it.  Still, it is a good way to introduce  philosophy to the initiated (including me).  I just wish I didn't have to  deal with that interfering narrator!
B00000AFGM|3.0|For a long time I resisted this performer. In fact the first time I ever saw him was on the cover of his New book. I couldn't look at it, and to this day still can not look at the photo as it appears on the front. It  scares me. I promised after thumbing through a few pages of that book, I  would never buy any of his music, art or books. But I got sucked in. He is  a poser and admits that. He has mimicked David Bowie, and many other  original rock musicians. His name isn't even original and either is his  music. But I love his passion. I cannot resist his voice and demeanor, his  blatant histrionics and the ways he expresses himself. Agian, he is an  entertainer for adults, not children. I still cannot look at his face on  the cover of that book though.<br />Kindly, Sera
B000002KE2|5.0|When you first get into music as a little kid, usually you get turned onto something from a specific sound you dig and you're prone to pick up on music that sounds similiar to what turned you on.  Usually if asked why you  like what you listen to, you pretty much only have &quot;Cause it sounds  cool&quot; to work with.<br />As a kid, heavy music was my turn on.  I liked  heavy, crunchy, aggressive, and dark music.   So much so, I picked up the  guitar.  <br />But, at 14, everything changed when &quot;Volume 4&quot; hit my  cd player (a'ight, so I'm not that old, were you listening to anything THIS  cool at that age?).  Forget me even giving you a reason why this record  deserves to be in your collection.  Grab it.  &quot;Volume 4&quot; speaks  for itself.  &quot;Snowblind&quot; is the earliest favorite song I ever  had.  <br />Furthermore, if you're interested in checking out Sabbath, you  can't go wrong w/ &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;,  &quot;Master of Reality&quot;, &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, and  &quot;Sabotage&quot;.  Everyone of them is A-grade heavy music.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a great album, and like a great wine it comes better with time. Maybe &quot;Acrobat&quot; could be the weakest song, but it's just because the others are just amazing.
B00000K0DV|3.0|A great film to add to your horror collection, destined to have a cult collectible status like its now deleted private release laser disc counterpart. By Fulci a great horror master. The story follows a sick  serial killers who speaks like a duck, in order to keep an alias, his  victims are women who he savages with very sharp blade's starting at there  groin and folowing up through there torso. A very sick film, but a must for  any horror fan...
B000002I53|5.0|Exelent! This is a great introduction to Coltrane work, especially for those who don't like radical free jazz. My Favourite things is one of those musical gems that we want to hear forever. Anyway, I think &quot;A love  Supreme&quot; is Coltrane's best.
B000002KIK|3.0|I chose to review this particular BS disc because I think it gets unfairly criticized.  While it is true Technical Ecstasy lives up to its poor reputation, this is actually an excellent disc.  Never Say Die, Junior's  Eyes and A Hard Road are fine rockers.  Unfortunately it's sandwiched  between the pathetic Tech. Ecs. and Ozzy leaving.  In fact I probably would  have given it 4 stars if I didn't have to compare it to Paranoid or Master  of Reality.  This beats Heaven and Hell as the best BS disc after the  classic first six. Buy it!
B000001FS3|4.0|It's a great album, but the sound is very influneced by american music. I'd like more their european influenced albums like Atchung Baby. Anyway, is a great record.
B00000IQUT|5.0|This one, along with Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer, is one of the most provocative cinematic experiences I have undergone.  Revile it for its crudity and flinch at its relentless violence, but you'd have to admit this  film succeeds all the way in provoking some kind of response from its  audience.<br />Personally I find I Spit on Your Grave much less exploitative  than it could have been.  Firstly, take into account that the entire story  is filmed from a neutral perspective while privileging the point of view of  Jennifer.  Secondly, note its subtle but deeply angered treatment at how a  good-hearted, friendly woman is destroyed, reborn as a sadistic avenger  lacking in heart and painfully unaware of what she's become.  The final  shot is simple brilliance, a more apt observation on Jennifer's character  change and saying much more than a direct, moralizing title card could have  (eg. Howard Hawks' Scarface).<br />Finally, this film's most commendable (and  perhaps contentious) point is its treatment of the men, the perpetrators of  the original crime.  Although animalistic in their brutality and at times  grotesquely macho, the men's overall portrayal does not relegate them to  pure villainy.  We see moments of vulnerability, humanity (Stanley's  relationship to Johnny is especially fascinating, thanks to Aron Tabor's  multilayered performance) and even sympathy.  None of which excuses them  from their crime, as the film watches their humiliation and destruction  with as unflinching an eye as it had Jennifer's suffering at their  hands.<br />This is essential viewing for anybody interested in feminism in  film, and the rape-revenge genre.  (Both The Accused and the lesser-known  French drama L'Amour Viole/The Rape of Love borrowed liberally from I Spit  on Your Grave's stance on male bonding and gang rape.)  People interested  in analyzing this film can also refer to Carol Clover's Men, Women and  Chain Saws, which contains one of the few fair-minded assessments of this  film untainted by the controversy of the film's social context.<br />Once  you're prepared for the violence and extreme human behaviour in this film,  you'll find much to think about.
6303433766|5.0|&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is a very beautiful, often very funny, but ultimately very sad movie.  Peter Jackson does a marvelous job directing it, and Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey (in their film debuts) give  amazing portrayals of Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker.  This is one of my  very favourite films of all time, and one that I have made many friends sit  through.  (I also made my mother sit through it, and although she liked it,  it was probably not the best film for a daughter to make her mom watch.)   Now,Peter Jackson's helming &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and Kate Winslet  has had &quot;Titanic&quot; and 2 Oscar nom.'s... let's see Melanie Lynskey  star in a big film!
B000005RFM|5.0|Sabotage is where Black Sabbath reaches its peak in terms of power, nuance, subtlety, variety and performance.<br />No surprise that this album came after Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, the album on which Black Sabbath began  to explore beyond loud metal guitars.  The best tracks on Sabotage succeed  beyond any other Sabbath opus based on non-metal elements:  The synthesized  strangeness of &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot;, combined with the  eerie backing vocals; the hard-hitting &quot;Megalomania&quot; (one of the  strongest 10-minute songs I can think of), where occasional touches of  grand piano toughen up the mix; the Russian chants of  &quot;Supertzar&quot;; the Jimmy Page-flavoured instrumental &quot;Don't  Start (Too Late)&quot;.<br />Ozzy Osbourne's singing doesn't get much better  than on this album, and Iommi's rhythm guitar work is unparalleled in  aggressive power on Sabotage.<br />Though Black Sabbath and Paranoid were the  more evil albums (Paranoid, especially, emanates a pure unholy radiance  thanks to perverted songs and odd songwriting incompetence), Sabotage is  Black Sabbath's pinnacle.  Forget the overrated Master of Reality (boring,  one-note metal, seriously dated) and the generic post-Ozzy years.  Go with  Sabotage and Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.
0790736233|5.0|I first saw &quot;Contact&quot; on opening weekend in the theaters, mostly because it's what my friends wanted to see. (I was very burned out on blockbuster sci-fi at the time).  But I fell in love w/ this movie from the  opening scene, in space (see the Amazon review).  This is a  thought-provoking movie, w/ a powerful story.  yes, there's the occasional  corny line, and it tends to meander a bit, but it still never felt too long  for me.  Instead, I left the theater feeling awed, and every time I watch  this movie, this weird, wonderful feeling comes back to me.  I don't know  of many movies that make me feel the way &quot;Contact&quot; does.  My  companions and I were still discussing this film 2 hours after first seeing  it.  Jodie Foster is her usual awesome self, and kudos for the casting of  Jenna Malone as her younger self.  Malone reminds me of Foster in most of  her work, not just because of a physical resemblance, but for the rare  intelligence in her performances.  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie,  do.  You may feel differently about it than I do, but it is one to make you  think.

B000002AVF|5.0|I think that &quot;Daydream&quot; is both the best album ever made and the best album Mariah has ever made. My personal favorite songs are &quot;When I Saw You&quot;,&quot;Forever&quot;,and the best,&quot;Melt Away&quot;. The  reason I like this album so much is it's total spin into the R&amp;B  status. I didn't really like R&amp;B much at first but after I heard this  album I LOVED R&amp;B. The R&amp;B is definintely Mariah's style of music.  Yeah,the pop style was ok but here it's better. But on her next album  &quot;Butterfly&quot; she kinda went too far in it. It's all right but it  just sorta gets on your nerves. Out of all the albums Mariah has made  &quot;Daydream&quot; has to be the best.The songs such as  &quot;Fantasy&quot;,&quot;One Sweet Day&quot; and &quot;When I Saw  You&quot; get your attention. &quot;Fantasy&quot; because it's got the  dance upbeat tempo.&quot;One Sweet Day&quot; because it makes you think of  that special person in your life. and &quot;When I saw You&quot; makes you  think of your first love.The worst song on this album to me is &quot;I Am  Free&quot;. Now I know she could have left that out! The other songs are  ok.Like &quot;Long Ago&quot; I like it for it's loungey beat.  &quot;Forever&quot; for it's 60's style feel.&quot;Underneath The  Stars&quot; for your feeling of being underneath the stars. &quot;Looking  In&quot; would have to be the most emotional song on this whole album  because it gives you a feeling that you've lost your own identity. Overall  &quot;Daydream&quot; is Mariah's best yet!!!!!!
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against the Machine's self-titled album is their best and way better than Evil Empire. It has the best combination of songs I've ever heard on a CD. The best of the best songs on the album are Killing in the Name,  Bombtrack, Wake up, and Take the Power Back
B000002HMH|4.0|First let me say, I own all of Metallica's major studio releases (KEA, RTL, MoP,...AJFA, Metallica, Load, ReLoad, Garage Inc.), and I like each and every one of them.  <br />While I would love Metallica to return to their  days of MoP or ...And Justice for All, this album is a collection of very  good songs.  James' lyrics, contrary to what some unattentive people would  have you believe, are quite strong.  He has gone from broad social  commentary, to a more personal, individual lyric.  <br />While I'm not a fan  of the wah peddle, the sound is interesting.  I would have to describe this  more as a drums/bass album, over the rhythm/lead guitar albums of the past.   <br />This is not mainstream music, frankly, I don't know where these people  are from to claim it is.  They obviously have no concept of what  mainstream/pop is.  <br />Keep a listen for &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; and  &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, not only the best songs on the album, but some  of the best songs Metallica has produced.  <br />Metallica will be okay, their  Woodstock show proved that they can still play their classics (Creeping  Death was flawless) and their two new songs, &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; and  &quot;Minus Human&quot; are very heavy, in the vein of the black album.   <br />Bottomline, this is an album of experimentation, if you're not open  minded musically, don't bother, otherwise, give it a try.
B00000J7A2|5.0|This is truly the year of the Beef in terms of post-music-career commercial output.  This is a fun CD of early Beefheart with good notes to provide background.  CHECK OUT THE MINI-REVIEW/RECOMMENDATION IN THIS  WEEK'S fortune MAGAZINE!!  (Further proof it is a slow year in the music  biz.)  The only thing missing is the bumper sticker from the original issue  vinyl.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is great! I've seen this film 3 times and I never get tired of it. With Reeves as the main charter he learns the world is not real, and he must free mankind!

0684833395|5.0|One of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read.  Heller's twisted logic is difficult at times, but it reflects the even more confused, insane logic of the book's very subject matter, WAR.  The book is worth it for the  memorable characters whom Heller has so vividly created.
B000002UWF|5.0|this album will never get old.  keely smith is just as hip as louis, sam and the band.  if you want to know wat hip is, just listen to sam butera on there'll be no next time, with louis prima adding humor.  this is it!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|Note that I said most important, not best (everyone knows Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon is the best album ever made). It's not even the best Beatles album. But historically, it's the most important record ever. A day  in the life is one of the most gorgeous songs ever recorded. I'm listening  to the album in it's entirety right now,as I tend to do about twice a  month. And there is some fantastic work here. Sure they had better albums  already in Rubber Soul and Revolver, and would follow with The White Album  and Abbey Road but none would catch the spirit that Sgt. Pepper did. This  vibe just pours from my speakers whenever it's in. It's an indescribable  feeling. John Lennon himself once said he was scared about releasing it.  Thinking it was to much for Joe Average record buyer to enjoy. It's a very  special album that belongs in the hearts, minds, and record collection of  everyone on the planet. I still think that there is some amazing power in  this recording. This album also inspired Syd Barrett (founder  vocalist,writer for Pink Floyd) who was recording Pink Floyd's debut Lp  &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; next door at Abbey Road. Played back  to back, these two records are the perfect time capsule for swinging London  in 67. I am only a mere twenty years old, but I know genius. This album  oozes with it. Totally brillaint. It's an experience. Find out for  yourself.
B00000JGOH|5.0|The Film - I first saw this movie in the states and couldn't wait for it to come out in the U.K  I thought with such a fine movie the DVD would be special. Unfortunately I was wrong...<br />DVD Menus - The menus are  functional, nothing more. I don't like the two screen chapter search page,  they aren't animated and theres no sound. See Rambo : First Blood, for a  really good chapter search!<br />DVD Quality - The sound and picture are both  good.<br />DVD Extras - Nothing special, Theatrical trailer, reccomendations.  Shakespearian facts.<br />DVD Overall - An Excellent movie, let down  considerably by poor DVD backup. There's no imagination in the menus, no  real interesting extras.<br />Why are so many film companies willing to do the  bear minimum with their DVD releases ? Especially when they have so much  scope.(see Blade)<br />Still a really good movie though! The 5 stars are for  the film, not the DVD itself.
0790739909|5.0|Meg Ryan, always perfect, creates a vigil of epic permanence in this sentimental drama of one that doesn't believe so much so she makes an Angel fall in love with her. Cage, in a role as magical as Moonstruck, is simply  irresistible in this film as Seth &quot;Plate&quot;. He is a guardian angel  that finds untimely, or maybe timely, romance with the incredibly poised  Ryan. In fact, I found the duo better than the Hanks-Ryan pairing in You've  Got Mail. Believable, magical, surreal, and Angelic! Like Ghost, it makes  you believe in the power of Love than really does transcend all  things!<br />Felecia Constance Rowe Teardrop Films(R)

6304813759|5.0|Because I always seem to be a couple years behind, I just saw this movie. Oh my god, I thought I would split a gut from laughing. It even made me cry a few times. It is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. How wonderful that someone set out to tell a story, and ended up entertaining us all to the extent that this film did. There are almost too many standout scenes to mention, but let me try a few. The scene on the street where Gaz is trying to get Nathan back in the car, and says \\"I love ya, ya bugger\\". The look on Lomper's face when the other band members start playing the stripper theme music. Gaz's first attempt at stripping in the headlights of the car, with change flying out of his coat pockets, trying to get his t-shirt off with his cigarette still in his mouth. It's such a great movie on so many levels. You never forget that these men are living through a real-life nightmare that many of us have experienced ourselves. You feel their desperation, their emasculation, their insecurities, their panic, as if it were happening to you. But because these people seem so real to you, you'll also feel their triumphs. I didn't have as much trouble as I expected to with the accents, but the second time around was definitely clearer. The actual strip show scene is priceless, pay close attention to the looks on the guys faces. They had a great time making this movie, I bet. One final thought, watch for the scene on the hill with Gaz, Dave, and Lomper. It's too sweet to be real.
6304044836|1.0|I like most movies, and don't tend to be picky, but...why did they even bother to remake the original? Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart certainly don't need updated versions. Julia Ormond is lovely, but she cannot act.  Perhaps the director knew this; there are about a million close-ups of her  face, with no dialogue. But a lot of people seemed to love this movie, so  maybe I missed something. I can't imagine what.
6303168507|5.0|Thought provoking and heart rending and much deserving of the Best Picture Academy award.Its also a film I could only watch through once, so real was its depiction of death and the cheapness of life in those horrible  conditions and during that terrible time. The grainy b/w film with splashes  of red also made a visual impact that was unexpected.Let us not forget  and... ...No sequels ...please.
0792156684|5.0|James Cameron risked everything to bring meaning to this terrible tragedy. While there will always be critics for and againts what he captured on the big screen, try to imagine the sheer horror felt by those on board during  that cold dark night in 1912. Thats what Mr. Cameron did his best to convey  to movie goers all over the world. It doesn't matter that everyone knows  how the movie ends.  TITANIC is a 3 1/2 hour time capsule that will forever  stir imagination and tug at the hearts of those who, if only for a brief  moment in time,  try to imagine what the experience was REALLY like.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix is a must see movie for many reasons. Keanu Reeves outdoes himself in this one, as does Laurence Fishburne. But the one we really need to pay attention to in the future is Carrie Anne Moss. Her portrayal of  Trinity was both strong and vulnerable at the same time. The brothers have  done it again. The FX were superior and didn't overtake the movie. Watching  some parts of the movie I found myself holding my breath or gripping the  arm rests! I'm actually going to see the movie for the 10th time this  evening and I'm looking forward to it as much as I did the 1st time. I  can't wait! If you have a chance to buy this movie, please do so. I promise  that you won't be disappointed. I'm acutally going to buy the DVD--and I  don't even own a DVD player yet! I live in Seattle and we still have the  Matrix playing in a couple of theaters. And the movie is still packing  people in on the weekends. This movie is FANTASTIC! A TRIUMPH!
B000002C1Z|5.0|Animals is truly an unbelieveable cd. Who else but pink floyd could put togeather 3 10 min+ songs and make them enjoyable. They have a great flow to there music and some powerfull guitar riffs. The more i listen the more  i think that this may be the best band ever.
0780626478|4.0|Adam is a human time capsule. Raise him in an isolated 60's world (35 years in a fall out shelter) then send him out into the cynical 90s and you have an interesting culture clash. The sweet innocence with which Adam  views the world is wonderfully contrasted by Alicia Silverstones cynical  90s woman, and both are balanced with Dave Foley's terrific Jiminy Cricket  imitation with a twist. Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek are a hoot with  their roles as Adam's parents! The very best parts of the entire film are  the moments of discovery, beginning with the first time 35 year old Adam  sees the sky, this beautiful blue and white covering we all take for  granted. The simple excitement and delight is infectious. Leaving the  theatre, I looked up at the sky with new appreciation. This same delight is  found whenever he encounters a new experience, from seeing a child, to  seeing the ocean. <br />With all this there is the overwhelming assurance that  we are watching an actor who is still growing and turning in better and  better performances each time he steps before a camera. I hope he has a  cabinet already for the little golden statues he will be collecting over  the coming years!<br />WELL worth the time to watch (over and over)
B00000J6AG|5.0|His name is not Moby for nothing. Underlying the irony of &quot;Play&quot; Moby knows he is being hunted by Ahab.  Like few people he agonizes between the ties of the body and the call of heaven, always trying to pull off a  reconciliation.  We are angels with one wing always searching, searching  for that other half so we can fly. But creatures with one wing can only fly  in a circle. Hence the deep melancholy in many of the cuts. Even on the  cover he is trying to leave the earth but by the end of this work he stands  mute on the back cover.  Then again i could be wrong, what do you think JD?
B000001G5H|2.0|When one thinks of Pollini, flawless technique is usually what comes to mind, and rightly so. Mr. Pollini, it is generally agreed, overcomes with seemingly incredible ease the many and varied technical difficulties which  Chopin's Etudes present even to the virtuoso pianist. Yet, when it comes to  playing Chopin's music, there is one technical difficulty which Mr.  Pollini, judging from this 1972 recording, never masters. When playing  Chopin, one must be able to transform the essentially percussive action of  the fingers' striking of the keys into a kind of pianistic lyricism, which  in turn serves as the foundation for any and all subsequent phrasing. If a  pianist cannot make the piano sing, then Chopin is not for him. Mr. Pollini  is no exception. Accordingly, though he has, over the years, improved  somewhat in this regard (as his more recent recordings of the Polonaises  and Preludes convincingly suggest), his Etudes recording serve only to  transmogrify Chopin, that giant of the romantic era, into a pathetic  caricature of the inimitable Prokofiev, who, quite unlike Chopin, conceived  the piano primarily as a percussion instrument, its lyrical capabilities  taking a decisive 'backseat' (To his credit, Mr. Pollini is a superb  interpreter of Prokofiev). Etudes are indeed designed to challenge one's  technical skills. But Chopin's Etudes outshine all others because they  require more than mere techincal mastery of the notes. Mr. Pollini, as this  recording plainly shows, never transcends the material dimension. For while  he unerringly transmits all the right notes, his interpretation remains  completely opaque, failing utterly to rise to the ethereal heights of  Elyseum, perhaps because Mr. Pollini deliberately ignores the spirituality  necesary to grasp the more luminous, indeed more spiritual, dimension of  Chopin's music (Mt. 11:15). Does anyone succeed where Mr. Pollini fails?  Absolutely. Chopinophiles may reap much more delight from the recordings of  Ashkenazy (especially his earlier 1960 version if they are lucky enough to  find it), Simon, and Binns than they ever will from Mr. Pollini's. But  there is yet another. According to the International Piano Quarterly  (Summer 1999), wherein the reader may find a helpful overview of ALL the  Etudes recordings of the century, the &quot;compelling first choice&quot;  went to that of relatively little known Cuban-American pianist Juana Zayas.  Having often listened to this recording since its LP release in 1983, and  having compared it closely with many other versions (including Mr.  Pollini's), I wholeheartedly agree with IPQ. I shall even go so far as to  declare that Ms. Zayas's recording (available from Music &amp; Arts CD891)  is vastly superior to all other versions, certainly leaving Mr. Pollini's  in the proverbial outer darkness. To those, then, who, unfamiliar with Mr.  Pollini's version, wish to be enlightened from the start, I recommend Ms.  Zayas's luciferous recording. To those who have already come to appreciate  Mr. Pollini's recording, may I suggest that comparing it with Ms. Zayas's  will easily demonstrate which is the more dazzling.
6305470464|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and was knocked off my feet.  The acting is so strong throughout, but Ryan Phillippe in particular blew me away.  I have never before been so moved by a performance (Well, except for  everything Kevin Spacey has ever done).  He truly is a rising star.
B000001Y5J|4.0|but this does come within spitting distance.  It isn't NIN most thoughtful work, it's too pent-up and vomited back out to be, but that's fine by me when the result sounds this good.  Subject matter (bitching about record  labels aside) is true to form and lends itself to serious empathy - I don't  care how many people get on the &quot;angster than thou/this isn't real  industrial&quot; soapbox and start boring the rest of us NIN fans to tears  - this is a GREAT album.  Continuity with it's precursor AND originality, a  defining moment for the genre, and one of the all-time killer dancefloor  tracks in 'Wish'.  Why don't you own it already?
B000000OUJ|5.0|...and just as hardcore.  Liquid Swords contains tracks with the most interesting intros to every song.  Most intros are lines from Shaolin movies. RZA, not surprisingly though, puts together some phat beats to go  along with GZA's phat lyrics. If you are a wu fan and do not own this you  are missing out.
0780624890|5.0|Blade is a great, dark, fast paced movie with non stop action.  It never stops coming.  Anybody that likes all those action movies will love it.
6300183971|5.0|I read most of the reviews. I understand that the film is not perfect, that the book is much better and that the screenplay seens a lot confusing. However if you really like science fiction you should admire it like  something really unusual. Lynch takes us to an amazing new universe. Have  you ever seen something like Dune before? I have not!  I still think that  in many aspects this film is beyond its time, like 2001 Space Odissey (Ok  this one is the perfect masterpiece of all time, maybe i should mention  Solaris as well). The screenplay is difficult, but thanks to that it  allowed me to watch it many times, and i still get amazed about the story  and all the brilliant art involving this complex film. Just to mention  &quot;the great names&quot;  Max Von Sydon, Silvana Mangano, Dean Stockwell  and Linda Hunt are brilliant, even Kyle is nice (but Sting i have to admit  that his is not convincing as a bad guy). Maybe the end could be better,  but Sting again is not playing well (&quot;I am not here, I did not say  this&quot;). The soundtrack is perfect for a science fiction. I wish that  David Lynch could be allowed to do his director`s cut. I would like to  thank Frank Herbert, Lynch, Rambaldi, Dino de Laurentis and all the actors  and actress for this outstanding tour the force.  When i watch Dune I can  travel/dream without moving/sleeping! That`s all about cinema isn`t it?  &quot; Father, father...the sleeper has awaken&quot;.
B000002UB3|4.0|Abbey Road can at time wreak of McCartneyesque excess, but the energy and urgency in the band, coupled with enough winning songs, allows the record to succeed.  The best moments of this album are Lennon's and Harrison's.   George especially hits his songwriting stride.   This is his best  contribution of songs to any Beatle album, with the possible exception of  &quot;Revolver&quot;.  This indeed was a portent to the creative explosion  that would become ex-Beatle Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.   Lennon's contributions are understated in the extreme. If you don't believe  me, check out the lyrics to &quot;I Want You&quot;.  Lennon is saying it  all by not saying anything.  This lyrical hook allows the music to ooze  freely around his vocal, with the effect at times sounding more like jazz  than rock 'n roll.  &quot;Come Together&quot;, in juxtaposition to the  &quot;magmum opus&quot; of side B, rocks simply and solidly with Lennon  (very aware that this would be the band's last hurrah) metaphorically  tipping his cap to Chuck Berry and the other great rockers who made the  Beatles possible.  Even though Paul was the principal architect on the  connected side of this record, its best moments are not his. George and  John rocking out on &quot;The End&quot; take first prize there.  While  Harrison and Lennon score with every composition, McCartney's songwriting  is uneven.  &quot;Because&quot; is a first-rate arrangement with gorgeous  harmonies.  &quot;Bathroom&quot; and &quot;Darling&quot; rock competently,  but without the muted flair of the Lennon rockers.  &quot;Maxwell&quot; and  &quot;Majesty&quot; are an insult.  Ringo chimes in with &quot;Octopus's  Garden&quot; for all you kiddies out there.  Thanks Ritchie.  If you only  want to buy one Beatle album, buy &quot;Revolver&quot;, but Abbey Road is a  significant rock `n roll document, and a worthwhile investment.  Even with  some obvious fluff, its 17 tracks give you an awful lot for your  entertainment dollar.
B000009QOC|5.0|Some albums are to be listened to without distraction. This is one. If you are ready (or think you are) for the cosmic flood gates to open and pour all of your demons upon you this is the evocation. Glenn leaves his  humanity behind as he takes through his hells to make them heavens. If you  really want to know god you must accept, embrace and bathe in the primal  darkness of eternity. This is not for the faint of heart. The lord of the  left-hand path, vamamarga, the dark angel, Danzig, takes the initiate on an  eternal adventure through the power behind the cosmos. If you were  wondering what happened to musical geniuses of classical caliber, look no  further. &quot;Lucifuge&quot;, the &quot;Flying (Bleeding) Light&quot;, is  enough illumination to see what is going on in the dark reaches of space,  both within and beyond. Don't take this one lightly or half-hearted. Let it  take you so deep within you find yourself on the other side of the  infinite. And it's a long way back.

It's classic Carlos, with incredible  collaborations from start to finish.  &quot;Smooth&quot; with Rob Thomas is  just a classic song, &quot;El Farol&quot; feels like nostalgic Santana  music.  I just feel great whenever I play this CD.

B00000K19E|2.0|I was expecting a lot more from this movie. No doubt, the sound and effects are top-notch, but I thought we were to the point that good Science Fiction needs a great plotline with good character development. This wasn't  it. I was expecting twist after twist of confusion and conspiracy, but you  know what's going on about 20 minutes in. Check out Blade Runner for  futuristic landscapes and Total Recall for twists and turns that keep you  thinking &quot;What is reality here?&quot; If you want the latest special  effects in a Mortal Kombat setting, The Matrix is it.

B000001DQG|5.0|Cliche on &quot;Caribou&quot; is it was a rush job. But, we're talking about Elton John here. He wrote double album classic &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; in a weekend, and smash hit &quot;Sad Songs Say So  Much&quot; in a reported three minutes. On &quot;Caribou&quot; &quot;The  Bitch Is Back&quot; is a rocking, shaker; &quot;Pinky&quot; a beautiful  ballad; &quot;Dixie Lilly&quot; is a catchy country tune, &quot;I've Seen  The Saucers&quot; examines UFO scares, &quot;Ticking&quot; about a teen who  loses his mind and goes on a shooting rampage; and of course &quot;Don't  Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot; - an all time classic. The other tunes are  fun rockers all mixed up unexpectedly in brilliant Elton John style.  Unbelievable vocal range of the young Captain Fantastic, and entertaining  lyrics from Bernie Taupin.
6303109950|5.0|Quite simply the best western I've ever seen!! Kurt Russell is outstanding as Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday. The film has immortal lines such as Wyatt Earp:\\"Damn right your'e scared I can see it in your eyes\\" and \\" You tell them I'm coming back and hell's coming with me, you hear me?...hell's coming with me\\" <BR>Doc Holliday : \\"Oh Johnny I apoligise, I forget you were there.... you may go now!! \\"Why Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave\\" MAGNIFICENT!! I urge everybody to see this film.
B000002VCW|5.0|Al Stewart is the best writer in music (period). Year Of The Cat matches his often historical lyrics with wonderful tunes as good an anything ever recorded. A rare match. One of the best albums/cds ever. A learning,  moving, picturesque trip through the world of Al Stewart. His best work.  Writing from the song &quot;On The Border&quot; reads - The fishing boats  go out across the evening water/Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish  border/The wind whips up the waves so loud/The ghost moon sails among the  clouds/Turns the rifles into silver on the border. - If you can appreciate  lyrics like that you'll get a good fill in Year Of The Cat. Intellectual  words, mixed with the amazing guitar playing of both Al and the great Peter  White.
6303269826|5.0|I think that this is a great movie.And anyone who likes cowboys or great lawmen (Wyatt Earp ext.) should see this film. It's no doubt my favorite movie. And something else that makes it good is the fact that it's based on  the life of Wyatt Earp himself. Kevin Costner played the role of Wyatt Earp  with an uncante skill. I love this film and would recomend it to anyone!
B000001DQI|5.0|Variety and raw talent to the point of ridiculous. Whirlwind of dark instumental magic with Funeral For A Friend. Fun upbeat classics like &quot;BA, BA, BA, Bennie and the Jets.&quot; Ever-lasting love songs like  Candle In The Wind and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. Nasty biting rockers like  Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting and Your Sister Can't Twist...(still  can't believe someone hasn't been remade it into a hit single). Songs about  lesbians, hookers, gangsters,  cowboys, and Songs with NO Titles at all;  covering country, rock, pop, classical, and raggie. Bernie Taupin's lyrics  at the top of their game. Elton John's vocals still young, natural and  gifted - hitting an unbelievable range. Brilliant piece of work only made  more amazing when considering it's a double album and by all reports  written by &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; in a weekend. Often overlooked,  but like one line in Dirty Little Girl - &quot;That you have to clean the  oyster to find the pearl.&quot;

All I want to say is that their music is still  relevant today as it was back then.  In my opinion, their music was a  precursor to what is called &quot;electronica&quot; today.  In fact, it's  very comparable!  Why else is &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; still being  played after all these years?

0767819462|5.0|This movie had a great cast that were all right for the parts and the story was amazing. This film is based on a true story and is really moving.The woman who wrote the script (Gigi Levance) was the stepmom in  real life except she changed the names so that the real mother wouldn't  know it was about them. It was a very happy and sad movie that I loved very  much.
B000002I27|5.0|Strange Days, the follow-up to The Doors' electrifying debut album, is seen by some as similar sounding, but not quite as good.  Others see it as just as good, or even better.  In any event, the similarity in tone can be explained by the fact that many of the songs were written during the same period as those on the eponymous debut, inspired by Morrison's acid-induced excesses.  But altho they sometimes rely on the same chord progressions and nightworld organ and guitar licks of the earlier-released numbers, the songs of Strange Days are nevertheless distinct, with their own form and definition and, of course, verselines and lyrics.  The excellent tunes were carefully crafted by producer Paul Rothchild, tightly woven by his meticulous perfectionism into structured, no-dross masterpieces.  The songs are more repetitive, more limited in musical form and soloing, less spontaneous and free-flowing.  But as a recording work, Strange Days is an utterly amazing achievement, a monument in rock history.<br />The one atypical song on the album is Robbie Krieger's \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" prevented by censors (for nothing resembling a good reason) from climbing higher on the AM charts, and perhaps from reaching #1.  It is hard blues, driving powerfully forward, interspersed by an intense, compact harpsichord solo by Ray in triplicate motif.  One of the group's best songs ever, it satisfies those who want a piece of raw-charged rock from The Doors but feel they do not get it enough.  The record's other AM hit was \\"People Are Strange,\\" Morrison's negative statement about the feelings of lonely rejection.<br />The title cut sets the tone of the album, with its eerie organ and guitar conjuring up images of a haunted house (and actually, worse), where \\"strange eyes fill strange rooms\\" and voices \\"signal their tired end.\\"  The morbid side is also well-represented in Jim's high-school poem \\"Horse Latitudes,\\" given expression only in sound effects.  It is about, uh, throwing horses overboard from ships in the ocean doldrums in days of yore, in order to lighten the cargo.<br />Strange Days also contains \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" the first song Morrison ever wrote, on the Venice (Cal.) Beach with Ray standing by.  It is a somewhat spooky rocker calling on the girl to follow Morrison into dark adventure: \\"swim to the moon,\\" \\"climb through the tide.\\"  However, it has a terrific guitar solo by Robbie in the straight blues/rock vein.  \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" and \\"Unhappy Girl\\" are also seductive, still more darkly so.  The former features Robbie's haunting high-pitched twangs, a la Santana (later), but climaxing in that rising, rushing Doors style.  \\"Unhappy Girl,\\" sort of a forgotten track, is one of The Doors' (and Rothchild's) most remarkable accomplishments in the studio.  Using backward recording of Ray's organ, in minor-chord medieval style, and beautiful, piercing slide guitar by Robbie, sort of like Duane Allman later did on \\"Layla,\\" it presents a visual image of a girl alone, \\"locked in a prison of [her] own device.\\"  Jim sings, ever so sensuously:<br />And you can't believe<BR>What it does to me<BR>See you<BR>Crying<br />The effect is one of ineffable passion, and compelling beauty.  As there is in \\"I Can't See You Face in My Mind,\\" on which Rothchild slows down the tempo of the raw version performed by The Doors in those LA clubs in their early days.  The mood is subdued, highlighted by Ray's soft, dry organ and Robbie's dark lullaby guitar licks.  Equally or more prominent are the chimes of the marimba employed by Ray, in the signature and the verseline.  John Densmore's cymbal hits are recorded backward.  Morrison is reaching out behind an artifical mask:  \\"I can't seem to find the right lie.\\"<br />Another sort of forgotten, but powerful, evocative, and climactic, number is \\"My Eyes Have Seen You.\\"  In no other of their markedly theatrical songs did The Doors achieve such authentic musical visualization of Jim's lyrics.  He wrote this song from aVenice rooftop, hence \\"television skies.\\"  The hypnotic bass and harpsichord and Robbie's vibrating, centripetal guitar charges combine to allow Jim to \\"photograph your soul.\\"<br />Jim Morrison was the first performer to bring Antonin Artaud's \\"Theater of Cruelty\\" to the rock stage, and if not the only one, he was certainly the one to do so most prominently.  This is displayed most in \\"When the Music's Over,\\" the finale and the most interesting of The Doors' more-than-eight-minute tracks.  Robbie provides a neat acid-rock guitar solo, and Ray blasts away with dynamic intensity following Jim's \\"we want the world\\" line, but the bulk of this drama consists of Jim's spoken word poetry/exhortations:  social commentary, negativism and rebellion, morbid images, violence and terror, and [freedom?].  As the Doors can be, it gets repetitive (OK, verbose too), but if you listen to Morrison and like it, it doesn't matter.  As Artaud desired to do, Morrison wanted to involve the audience directly in the anguish and the disturbing but desired revelations, and the song became quite a concert spectacle.<br />The latter part of Strange Days supersedes that of The Doors' debut album, making it about equal in stature.  But those who insist the debut is the one must still acknowledge that Strange Days is the most archetypal Doors, the darkest and most sensuous, repetitiveness notwithstanding.
0792151712|4.0|This film had a wonderful cast and beautiful sets. Every where on the ship was just beautiful. I think that it got a little stupid after a while but I think that the movie was very good and everyone tried their hardest.
6300248569|5.0|Mr. Rintoul and Ms. Garvie are Darcy and Elizabeth!!   Although this production does stray from the book in a few key areas where the A &amp; E prodcution does not, the choice of performers and their subsequent  performances more than adequately atone for these small divergences.  I was  absolutely entranced by both David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie.  Excellent  choices and an overall excellent production.
0792837614|5.0|This has wonderful dancing and the cast has great actors and dancers. Natalie is amazing, there are not enough words to describe her.
630528069X|2.0|I thougth the movie was highly overrated.  Here are the worst things about the movie: 1)  Bruce Willis is in it. 2)  It made Bruce Willis famous. 3)  It's too long. 4)  It's so predictable. 5)  Bruce Willis tries to act (I  think; It's hard to tell)
0780627024|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and the cast was perfect for the parts. I could sit down and watched it again if I found the time. I am usually critical of movies and always find some fault but this film I didn't find  one fault.
B00000JPH5|5.0|The whole movie enchanted me, esp. David Bowie-- the first time I saw it, when I was like 6-7 yrs. old!  The best part is towards the end when she's climbing the illusional stairs...A definite for fantasy-lovers, and always  a classic in my book--right up there with the movie, Legend (w/ Tom  Cruise)!  Watch it; you'll LUV it!!!!!!  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU  for bringing back this awesome flick! --&gt;k.A.m. ;)
6305127646|5.0|This is the greatest movie in the entire world.  I've seen it about 100 times, at least.  I love it.  This is Val Kilmer's best preformance yet.
B000009ED0|3.0|Musically, this album is excellent.  Kid Rock delivers funky beats and original tunes, and the first time i listened to the album all the way through, although the volume was low, i was very impressed.  Unfortunately,  on closer review, i was unable to overlook the truly obnoxious and sexist  lyrics which permeate many of the songs on this album.  Multiple references  to bitches, ho's, pussy, and the Kid's dick detract from the music and from  my ability to take this kid seriously.  I realize that this is fashionable  these days among male hip-hop artists, but it has never been attractive.   Most distressing, however, is the song &quot;Black Chick, White Guy&quot;  near the end of the album.  As i listened to the story unfold, i was  intrigued because it sounded at first as if he was on the verge of having  an actual insight into the realities of race, gender and class.... but  oops, i was mistaken.  In the end, the &quot;slut&quot; is righteously  &quot;kicked to the curb&quot; by the white guy who is the hero of the  song.  This is doubly ironic when one considers the refrain which he  repeats throughout:  &quot;they don't know the half of it.&quot;  Makes you  wonder who the hell this spoiled white boy is who thinks he knows the half  of what it's like to grow up poor, black and female.  This is not a song i  will listen to again.  However, if you are able to tolerate rather  adolescent, sexist, and frivolous lyrics, this album is otherwise very  enjoyable.
0425170349|1.0|I have eagerly awaited each of Tom Clancy's new books since Red Storm Rising.  Each has been worse than the previous.  This book has hit rock bottom.  This book has a dumb plot and is rounded out by dumb characters.   I'm ashamed to say that I wasted around $6 and numerous hours reading this  dumb book.
6305291489|5.0|Don't pass it up.  You will regret it for life
0688170528|5.0|This was my first read of this author.  Although the book was a definite page-turner, the plot was multi-layered and the characters were well developed and remained true throughout the book.<br />Ms. Picoult has an  uncanny, accurate way of knowing just how her varied characters think and  feel.  Her portrayal of the teenagers caused me to revisit that time in my  own life, and their interactions with family and each other was right on.   The same is true with the adult relationships.  She accurately portrayed  the subtleties of married life and the threads of &quot;what might be&quot;  between married couples.<br />All of this and a great courtroom drama.  I had  to force myself to not read ahead or skip any part of the lines.  It was  worth holding back.
0393312836|2.0|Utterly devoid of any formal or artistic redeeming qualities. A trivial exercise in giving vent to base, animalisitic urges. Totally complicit in the violence it portrays.
6305014140|5.0|It combines the technical details of good quality anime with the level of gore usually associated with a slasher flick.  Wouldn't let my daughter watch it but I enjoy seeing it from time to time.

B000001EQT|5.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  Morrissey got me into the New York Dolls.  I'd always loved David Bowie, but it was &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; that really got me into glam rock.  This album is superb... want to know more  about glam's beginnings -- get this!
0441172717|2.0|too long and sluggish. for pot heads and geek
B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah Brightman continues to excel as an artist and a storyteller.  On Eden, she expands her vocal range into a Baroque, New Age theme that is truly an extraordinary listening experience.  The title track is truly  enhanced by the background Monks.  On this CD I have no favorites.  They  are all favorites.  This is the first album that I've purchased in my  lifetime that I can honestly say is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL from beginning to  end.<br />*****

0783228317|5.0|Fear and Loathing makes the use of drugs absolutely unnecessary! You get stoned by only watching this film and if you have ever had any acid-trips in your life you will definetely get an enormous feeling of deja-vu when  stumbling through Las Vegas together with Raul Duke! This is much more fun  and a lot easier than any psychadelic experience in your life!    BUT  REMEMBER: IT IS JUST A MOVIE and DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!
0060931671|1.0|Horrifically perverse and nihilistic. The anguished, incoherent screams of a soulless predator caught in the trap of its own existence. Should never have seen the light of day.
B00000I8NC|5.0|i never really listen to this kind of music.  I usually listen to radiohead and other modern bands.  But this band has got me hooked.  The breath-taking complexities of the songs all lead up to a climactic finish.  The songs are very moving and powerful.  Listen to this very loud!
0783230664|5.0|It has been called the &quot;Citizen Kane of talking pig pictures&quot;, but it is much more entertaining and original that that.  It exists on many levels (like Gulliver's Travels), and all of them are very good, and  perhaps great. The DTS version has great sound.
B000000W5N|5.0|Along with Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed and Exile On Main Street, this is arguably the greatest album ever by the world's greatest rock 'n roll band.  This is the post-60's peace and love, nasty early 70's hard core drug  inspired kick ass Stones at their pinnacle. Played out classics include  &quot;Brown Sugar,&quot; &quot;Bitch&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses,&quot; but  this album's deeper cuts are the true gems.  <br />I dare you to keep the hair  on your head from standing on end as you hear the opening chords to the  epic &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot; at full volume.  Forget heavy  metal - it just doesn't get any raunchier than this, or any better, as  Keith and Mick Taylor go at it with a vengeance.  Billy Preston guest stars  with his classic afro organ sound on the bittersweet &quot;I Got the  Blues.&quot;  Then hold on to your hats, turn down the lights and  contemplate the mysteries of the Holy Trinity of &quot;Sister  Morphine,&quot; &quot;Dead Flowers&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Mile,&quot; an  incredible sequence of Mick, Keith, Mick Talyor and Ry Cooder genius that  will leave you crying for more.  Memorable and twisted lyrics, haunting  guitars, classic Mick vocals and just pure greatness.  These drug drenched  masterpieces, not for the faint-hearted, could easily have provided an  Abbey Road-like crescendo to the Stones' career.  Fortunately for us, Keith  somehow survived and the Stones went on to record  &quot;Exile,&quot; their  last truly great album.<br />Warning: in a lame crowd, this is an instant  party killer.  <br />As a final note, the original vinyl album cover, designed  by Andy Warhol, has a real zipper and is a collector's item.
6304458908|5.0|Not too many comedies these days keep me laughing but this one is one of the best.  So very, very, funny.
6300247120|5.0|This has to be one of the coolest, most fascinating movies about growing up ever made.  I forced so many friends, some 20 years ago, to see this movie, because it was about getting older, loving your parents, loving your  Dad, especially, and just about getting over your childhood dreams, which  seemed reachable at the time. It remains, a terrific film, one that I would  recommend to anyone who needs to bond with a loved one.
6305513406|3.0|The audio and video are crisp.  The reds (like Scottys shirt) are a little oversaturated in &quot;The Corbomite Manuver&quot;.<br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio sparingly uses the rear channels, but when it does it sounds really  artificial.  Oh, well what do you want out of a 30 year old TV program.   I'm sure it is the best that could be done.<br />So far this is the best video  representation of the original Star Trek series.  And for all it's faults  is still a good value.
B00000JG41|5.0|Well, Mr. Bungle has done it again.  This time they delve into the 'pop' side of music and end up with some pretty interesting stuff.  Mr. Bungle still continue to be pioneers in the music industry, this time pulling from  influences such as  The Beach Boys,  Slayer, Jazz, John Zorn, Frank  Zappa....and the result is hilarious.  This is one of the cheesiest albums  I have ever heard, AND one of the best.  This album is a must have.  Buy it  now....
B00000I1OY|5.0|This movie is so complex and dynamic, that I'd need years to think about it to give it a proper review.  All I can say at the moment is that it is simply fascinating.
B000003B6J|5.0|Back in the day when Eazy was alive and NWA was still togeter.I miss those days.5 stars one of raps best albums. RIP Eazy E
0792139771|5.0|This movie is one of the five best movies I have ever seen in my entire life (the other four being Amadeus, The Natural, The Last of the Mohicans (1992 version) and Blade Runner. Braveheart is an instant classic, and a  must have for anyone's video collection. Two items to note as you're  reading the other reviews: 1) By Mel Gibson's own admission, Braveheart has  no political agenda--he never wanted to be the poster boy for modern-day  Scotland's freedom. 2) Braveheart is not homophobic. That accusation is the  most blatantly self-serving, knee-jerk thoughtless reaction anyone could  possibly have to this stirring epic. Buy this film...NOW!
6304711891|4.0|I thought this was a terrific movie, excellent performances by 3 superb stars...however, the movie is loaded with profanity that goes overboard, there was no need to use constant profanity to move the movie along.It  would have been just as good without  the excessive 4 letter words!
6303997198|5.0|I am not a big Clint fan, and I think that helped me buy into this film.  (Some Clint fans are unable to get over his &quot;western&quot; image.) This movie is one of my all-time favorites, and makes me cry every time I  watch it!  The scene when she is running through the house as he is pulling  away... and the scene when she has her hand on the trucks door handle....  oh my GOD... what would any of us really do to follow our heart... even  though our feet are grounded... I do not believe in infidelity... but this  movie really makes me wonder what I would do if I thought I was with Mr.  Right, and the real Mr. Right came along!  A must see for anyone who can  look past the infidelity, and look into their hearts and lives!
0393307050|5.0|To all those who rate this book, series or author as less than five stars, it's OK, my Mom doesn't get them either.  But I have read the entire series over and over, and cannot stop.  The cover art hangs on my walls.  I've  read Forrester, Lambden, Cornwall and a host of other series chronicling  the lives of military officers, but none has ever taken me there like  O'Brian.  I am a military officer, and his insight into leadership,  character and duty is without equal.  The language is incredible, like  listening to voices straight from the 19th century, with the waves crashing  in the background.  If I had read these in college, my military history  senior thesis would have been on Trafalgar and not the Golan Heights.  I  inflicted the series on my father, and he has now caught up, and like me is  eagerly awaiting more.   To those who do get it, I wish you the joy of it;  to those who do not, my condolences.  Just don't spoil it for the rest of  us.
630280082X|5.0|buy this video for the music, we've watched the &quot;cuttin' heads&quot; scene in this movie a hundred times...
6304578458|5.0|I have never laughed so hard as when I watched this movie!  The scene when he returns to the office and his secretary (Joan Cusack) uses the intercom from 10 feet away...great stuff!  Watch this movie several times, because  you will always pick up little nuances you missed the last time.  Notice  how the music in his car carries over to the music playing in the  convenience store, but in elevator style!  Suttle touches that make this  movie great!  And what a great romantic pair Driver and Cusack make..bestow  my heart!
B00000K19E|5.0|I'ts not often you get to see a movie that hits you HARD from the opening scenes and doesn't let up until it's over. What I liked about this movie was the fact that the plot isn't clear to the viewer for some time. That  should be annoying, but it's not. The special effects and the way the story  unfolds holds your interest in an unbreakable grip. And as the plot become  clear, well, to borrow a line from the movie: &quot;Buckle your seat belt  Dorothy, cause Kansas is going bye-bye!
0684867621|2.0|I thought the writing itself was very, very good.  But although the little girl seems to be a cute kid ...... where's the rest of the story?  In the end, there just wasn't any point to the whole experience - and certainly no  reason to read it.
0684874350|5.0|This is not a book I normally would have read, but a friend pushed it on me.  I didn't expect much, but I was quickly brought into an unimaginably bleak world.  Exquisitly written, Angela's Ashes portrays life of the poor  in Ireland that, at least at that time, rivaled the poverty of the  so-called third world. McCourt has a fine sense of language; you can almost  hear the brogue in your head as you read.  If anyone asked me if this was  worth a read, I would only respond, &quot;'Tis.&quot;
B0000027RL|5.0|Nirvana offered the hype and the mania, but Pearl Jam offered the music and the intelligence.<br />Credit Eddie Vedder for being one modern songwriter who's able to write story songs with force and conviction.  His use of  imagery, metaphor, and language both vernacular and elevated provides the  ideological balance that the furious, exotically tinged music (mostly  courtesy of rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament) needs.   Such was Nirvana's weakness -- repetitive guitar riffery coupled with  mostly meaningless lyrics.  Pearl Jam, however, pays as much attention to  head as to heart, and the sincerity of the songwriting and performances  stands up to repeated listens much better than Nirvana's self-limiting  irony.<br />Signature guitar song &quot;Alive&quot;, the richly sung  &quot;Garden&quot; and aggression incarnate &quot;Once&quot; are quite  simply three of the best rock songs of the decade.  Added to substantial  hit &quot;Jeremy&quot;, explosive &quot;Porch&quot;, the mythical Led  Zeppelin-flavoured &quot;Oceans&quot; and the metaphysical narrative  &quot;Black&quot; (reminiscent of Blue Oyster Cult's &quot;(Don't Fear) The  Reaper&quot; in terms of the world it evokes) which blends Browning's  &quot;Andrea del Sarto&quot; with the psychosexual frustration of D.H.  Lawrence, and you have one of the penultimate rock albums of the decade.
0451191153|2.0|It is ironic that Rand's philosophy, that so strongly contests the possibility that people are in some way shaped by their environment, is itself in fact obviously the product of Rand's (understandable) reaction to  the Bolshevist Revolution she experienced.  <br />Objectivism by itself is an  internally consistent philosophy.  However, it seems that most who call  themselves \\"objectivists\\" are in fact, not.  Take for example those who  have written positive reviews of this book.  The central aim of Objectivism  is to seal yourself away from the concerns of others: objectivists should  not care what other people think.  Acts of charity are taboo, as they  \\"degrade both the giver and recipient.\\"  What then, is the goal of  objectivists who need to express themselves in forums such as these?  They  should not need to seek approval for themselves or Rand according to their  own philosophy, and \\"enlightening\\" others is something that one like Howard  Roark would never concern himself with: it is too close to charity.<br />I  also take issue with Objectivism itself.  Question the ends that such a  philosophy implies.  What is inherently wrong with a charitable act?  Take  for instance the following scenario:<br />While about on a walk, one sees a  child teetering on the brink of a well, about to fall in.  One such as  myself would naturally seize the child to prevent her from perishing.   However, according to Objectivism, one should allow the child to fall to  her death, both for fear of dirtying one's suit, and because the charity of  such an act would be degrading to both involved.<br />I give The Fountainhead  two stars because I thank it for spurring my own thoughts, while  recognizing such thoughts to be nothing other than the page-by-page attempt  to keep from putting the book down.  Read it so you can criticize it.
B000001Y5X|4.0|This cd is a masterpiece, along with every other thing Manson has done. He is a true artist.

6301404440|5.0|Zany, irreverent, and smart!  Along with the Back to the Future Trilogy and Death Becomes Her, this stands as one of the greatest films by director Robert Zemeckis.  Roger Rabbit has more depth of character than expected.   Christopher Lloyd offers a chilling portrait of cold-blooded justice gone  insane, while Bob Hoskins offers a great straight-(hu)man performance  opposite Roger.  A pure joy to watch.  Dump Gump and cut off Contact, this  is Zemeckis at top form.
6302814634|4.0|Joel shumacher is not a great director but 'The Lost Boys'is a pretty good horror movie and certainly his best realisation. A film dedicated to youth, with a good casting, an original story, nice scenes and a lot of humour !  This is what 'The Lost Boys' are... a 80's pop corn movie at the top, and  an intelligent horror film. Waiting for a remake with better FX... as each  cult movie deserve it !
6303921248|5.0|Despite the fact that this is a made-for-tv movie it is still one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Pride and Prejudice is my favorite Jane Austen novel so I was expecting to find problems with this movie. (Movies  hardly ever do the book justice).  But what a surprise!  I was completely  blown away by this film!!        I couldn't believe how closely it followed  the novel.  I first saw this movie when I rented it and watched the whole  thing in ONE DAY!!  And then, over the next two nights I watched it all  over again!  The casting could not possibly have been any better!  The  portrayals of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy were wonderful!  I am  absolutely in love with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy (who wouldn't be?).   Jennifer Ehle is totally amazing and manages to capture all the wit  intelligence that Jane Austen intended.         Some might say that six  hours is a little long but I would have to disagree.  Any shorter and you  would lose parts of the novel.  Imagine my amazement when, after I finished  watching it the first time I went back to look through the novel and found  that whole dialogues were used almost word for word in the movie just as  Jane Austen had written them!!!          I just ordered this from  Amazon.com and I can't wait until it comes. But it's going to be a X-mas  gift and I don't know if I can wait until then.  This film deserves a lot  more than just 5 stars! The acting, music, costuming, and settings were  perfect!  I highly recommend it!!!!!!!
B000003NA4|5.0|Received Love Scenes CD last week and haven't stopped playing it. Diana's sultry style is mesmerizing. In &quot;Peel Me A Grape&quot;, her voice conveys far more sex appeal than Mae West ever did with the same line.  Diana is so easy to listen to -- but watch out -- she's definitely  addictive.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I like every one of the songs, which can be unusual with most CD's. I especially like Anytime, Anywhere - Un Jour Il Viendra - and Nella Fantasia. She has a lovely voice; I look forward to her next CD.
B000000HZT|4.0|Tony Banks was not the flashiest or technically most accomplished rock keyboardist ever, but he definitely was one of the most influential. His main problem as a solo artist is that Tony Banks=Genesis=Tony Banks:  without belittling the contributions of Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Steve  Hackett, Mike Rutherford, ... Tony's keyboards (and his nearly  impressionistic composition and particularly harmonization styles --- I was  not surprised to learn that he enjoys listening to Debussy and Ravel) have  perhaps been the single most defining musical element in Genesis. <br />As a  result, when the poor fellow gets to do a solo album, he is always trying  not to sound like Genesis, and ends up doing stuff that, well, really isn't  him. A Curious Feeling suffers least from that problem, and is highly  listenable if you like sweeping textures, haunting melodies, non-obvious  harmonies and surprising modulations. The instrumentals (particularly the  first two) are out of this world  --- some of the vocal tracks could have  done with a better vocalist.<br />Being, by all accounts, a highly introverted  and almost painfully shy person, his complicated, highly introspective and  evocative lyrics are what Mr. Banks bares his soul in (well, in an  understated English way). When you have Peter Gabriel or Phil Collins  singing them, the result is unadulterated magic. The singer on this album  (Kim Beacon from String Driven Thing), however, is okay but nothing  special. As a result, I gave the album 4 stars but not 5.
B000001XN2|4.0|When I bought this set on DG label, I was seeking to buy an EMI set of Franco Corelli. Because at that time in Corea it was said the EMI set would not be released more. I've selected this set since all the five  protagonists are great and amazing singers of our century(Corelli, Price,  Simionato, Bastianini, and Zaccaria)! Though this live performance was  recorded regretfully in mono, you can feel excited and vivid as if you'd be  now in Saltzburg Festival. But sadly this recording doesn't have Leonora's  cabaletta (in 4 act)&quot;Tu vedrai che amore in terra&quot; and Corelli's  singing &quot;Di quella pira&quot; has been downed half-note.

B000002KIE|5.0|I can't let a one star review be the first one listed.<br />I first heard this album in 1979 on the recommendation of a friend.  Boston, Foreigner, Styx, Kansas, Journey - these were the bands that dominated radio at that  time.  Faceless, corporate rock had taken over the market.  Rock and roll  was so boring it was easy to see why disco had become so popular.<br />The Sex  Pistols were like a hurricane obliterating the faceless bands constructed  by the marketing departments on Madison Avenue and in Hollywood like tin  shacks.  The Pistols may have been the creation of a different kind of  marketing plan, but this plan was born on the streets and was the  antithesis of the conventional wisdom of the time.<br />The energy of this  album was mesmerizing and it still sounds exciting 20 years later.  Music  is not about finesse or how many chords can be fit in one song - it's about  emotion, something that was terribly lacking in the music of that  time.<br />Look through the other reviews on this site.  Most reviews are  either one star or five stars.  Either you get it or you don't.  There is  no in-between.
0553266306|5.0|It keep me reading and rereading for years and I always wonder whether it is true or not.Still the details are accurate and very informative.The book expose many information on how to make forged identity cards. I am also  interested in the characther of the killer since he is very obsessed with  perfection but at last were killed by a mediocre but patient policeman.It  goes to show that however smart you are,the steady routine work by a  patient man or woman can beat you.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I bought one her albums by accident onetime, thinking that she was another artist. When I listened to the album, I became spellbound with her voice. Since then, she has became my favorite singer. Every time I bye one of  albums, she amazes me with her voice, she never let's me down. Eden was  breath taking, listened to it for hours when I bought it. She really does  have a voice of an angel. I am glad I bought her album by mistake
6305426651|5.0|This movie portrays the war in a comic way, to prevent a young boy to realize what's going on. The reality is so true, it is almost a tear-jerker, save for the comedy of Roberto Benigni. This is possibly the  number-one movie of all time.
B000002KKC|5.0|Following RUMORS is a hard thing to do, and Lindsey Buckingham decided to take the band in the complete opposite direction w/ &quot;TUSK&quot;.  Once again BUckingham HOGS the whole album leaving little room for the most  talented member, Nicks to shine...though she manages to create some of her  best work that she ever did w/ Fleetwood Mac. &quot;Storms&quot;,  &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;beautiful child&quot; are  undoubtedly the greatest tracks on the album but of course Buckingham and  McVie have their moments...it's a great album all together with just a few  too much LIndsey and not enough of the girls.
6300216209|5.0|Never bought a movie before:  I'm just waiting for this film to appear on DVD before I buy because I know I'm gonna be watching this over and over and over again.<br />Haven't seen any movies more than 2 times:  Watch this  one for about 7 times after one rental.  More if I didn't have to return  the freaking film.<br />  Never shed a tear for any movie: well maybe just one  ... I take that back, just 2 or a little more.<br />  Unlike some story where  u have to wait till the end before you see some chemistry between the two  main characters (er ... like &quot;Till there was you,&quot;) the story  begin out pretty halarious.<br />  Many memorable scenes but I like most:   -  music background with scenes of the two lover playing in the snow.   Nostalgic scene espcially since the story begins out with the main  character reflecting back.
6304493681|5.0|This movie was stylish and engrossing. The first since Akira to actually be on, and actually above, the level of 'true sci-fi classic'. As anime I put it with Akira but for sheer cinematic quality, visual flare, creative  content and the more generic quality on 'entertainment value' it ranks with  Blade Runner, 12 monkeys and other leaders of the genre. I'm overjoyed with  owning the movie itself but all of the extra things included on the DVD  make this a first-class edition to anyones DVD library.

B000005J56|5.0|It seems there is a great surge of interest in Cuba these days among so-called elightened North Americans, but the wary observer of history knows there is inevitably a price to be paid and that price will be paid by  Cubans.  Ry Cooder did well to find these incredible artists in the nick of  time before they die.  This was the music of my  mother's era in Havana and  it continually brings inconsolable tears to have this past paraded before  our eyes.  This music, honed out of the daily struggles of poor Cubans  living during alternating fascist (30's) &amp; all too brief  psuedo-democratic glitches (the 40's &amp; 50's), reminds that the human  spirit can survive anything, including 40 years of Communism.  Cubans have  a sense of humor and a 'joie d'vie' that transcends the imposition of any  and all political systems. They are supreme survivors.  Remember that,  America!  Ry Cooder did well to find these phenomenal human beings and  artists. However,one is troubled by the spectre of slick American  capitalism at its worst, Ry not-so-subtley bleeding the buck while at the  same time posing as the facilitator...a cultural cancer we Americans since  the days of George Washington's brother (read your Cuban history!) refuse  to learn to extract from our genes.  Three Cheers for the Buena Vista  Social Club and a Bronx cheer for Hawaiian guitar slide effects in that  pristine setting.  That stuff just ain't Cubano,Ry.  You should have  exercised better taste.  BVSC-5 stars; Cooder as archeologist-4 stars;  Coooder as musician- 2 stars.
6300213714|5.0|I first saw this film 18 years ago and it's still as enjoyable today! Well acted and brilliant location choices.You can really feel the claustrophobia in the underground scenes.

I can!!
B00000IQBL|5.0|This was a great movie.  It is one of the only Vietnam movie that include real events like the Tet Offensive (1968).  The best part of the movie is that you are seeing through the eyes of a soldier in the war.  A must see  for anyone who likes war movies or stanley Kubrick.

6305531374|3.0|This Movie is the Better of the Halloween sequels. This movie is also by far very short. Which in my opinion is very disappointing. The movie is okay. Well filmed. Well directed I suppose. Wonderful acting. Plot is okay.  the thing about this movie that Kevin Williamson wrote this movie to ignore  every other movie except Halloweens 1 and 2. Which was stupid. I think he  may have ruined the series by doing that. This movie doesn't dig deeper  into the rage which drives Michael but instead has him and Laurie fighting  it out. This movie does have one suspenseful moment. ONE. The rest you can  pretty much guess what will happen. The plot has a relatively low death  count. which is strange for a sequel. Very strange for a Halloween sequel.  The movie is okay if you enjoy the other Halloween movies. But in the  future with the scripting of Halloween 8 under way I do hope they keep  Kevin Williamson has far away as possible from Halloween 8.
B000000OSW|5.0|Musically, &quot;US&quot; doesn't really break any new ground for Gabriel, but he enters new territory with some deeply confessional lyrics. Earlier in his carreer, Gabriel gave us tales of dejeted and sometimes monstrous characters. On &quot;US&quot;, he gives us more of a look into his personality. &quot;Love To Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Blood Of Eden&quot; are among the best ballads he's penned yet. This album did not fare so well on the charts as compared to &quot;SO&quot; but overall, I feel it's a stronger effort. His output has been slow since the mid 80's. He's been working on an upcomming release for many years along with many side projects. It would not surprise me if he gives up touring now that he's entered his 50's. If he tours again, don't miss him. He puts on one of the finest live performances you'll ever see.

I love King's older stuff and I loved this book, too.  He proves  that you don't have to have goblin's and deamons jumping out and drinking  human blood every other page in order to ratchet up the reader's fear.  Patricia's desperation and degeneration as the days of her trek continue  were very believeable and very frightening. The one thing I didn't  particulary like was the &quot;God of the Lost&quot;.  It felt as though he  just through this supernatural element in as a bone to all those people he  knew were going to be whining because it wasn't another &quot;Salem's  Lot&quot;.  All in all a good book and a scary read.
0812505085|5.0|How can you even review the ultimate pirate book of all time?  I read it when I was 9 and loved it.  I read it again when I was 34 and loved it again!  (Actually, I read it several times between, as well.)  Long John  Silver is arguably one of the most Macchiavellian characters you will ever  find between the covers of a book.  (I'm mainly reviewing it to raise the  average rating.  Anyone who thinks this book is boring has to have a screw  loose!)  From the arrival of the mysterious Billy Bones, to the attack on  the inn, to the sea voyage, to the mutiny, to the battle for the island, to  the treasure hunt, even to the final fate of John Silver, this book is a  stunning rollercoaster of suspense and adventure!  I'd give it ten stars if  I could. <br />Here's a bit of information you other readers might enjoy:  the  meaning of the pirates' song--<br />Fifteen men on a dead man's chest Yo ho ho  and a bottle of rum!<br />The real-life pirate, Edward Teach (Blackbeard the  Pirate) once marooned 15 of his men on a small island named Dead Man's  Chest.  He put them ashore with no weapons, equipment or supplies--just a  bottle of rum.

0140430350|4.0|Hmmm, somehow, I feel that when Thackeray abuses Amelia as bland and soppy, he is only playing devil's advocate, and she is really his idea of the perfect woman.  Becky Sharp grabbed me from the beginning with her  rebellious spirit, and I think it is only pure Victorianism that she ends  up....well, the way the novel ends, she's obviously on her way down.   <br />But as for the novel in general, it's a soap opera that keeps you  tearing your hair out, because everytime you are waiting with your jaw  hanging to find out what happens to character A, Thackeray suddenly  switches to the storyline with character B, or off on one of his little  side discussions of his club buddies or something.  There's no better way  to maintain suspense!  The many humorous bits, especially Jos Sedley :o) ,  add to the books considerable charm.  <br />Boring?  Never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

6300215741|4.0|Delightful little Hitchcock movie and one of Grace Kellys last prior to her marriage.Filmed entirely on location in Monaco.Also starring Cary Grant in one of his more athletically challenging roles. Great scene at the start  where John Robie escorts a supposedly frigid Frances Stevens to her hotel  room and she thanks him with a long open mouthed kiss. Jessie Royce Landis  gets all the good lines as Kellys wealthy but down-to-earth alcoholic  mama.&quot;...do you mind if I have you investigated Mr Robie,youre just  too good to be true...&quot; Besides all the quick dialogue theres some  great photography of the riviera in the mid 1950's before the serious  tourist dollars moved in.A shady place for shady characters Somerset  Maugham used to say and it was here also that Grace Kelly was introduced to  the young Prince Rainier who was smitten...the rest is history. Not one of  the masters best efforts but a fun movie all the same.
0792151712|5.0|Just for sheer effort this movie deserves five stars.Though the purists and critics may split hairs and nitpick about the various performances it is still a magnificent recreation of one of the most tragic and historical  events this century,excluding both world wars. Kate Winslett was marvelous  and Leonardo was...adequate in their roles.For me their chemistry on screen  was believable and worked well.Enough said. Though time is always the true  test of a films success I have no doubt that Titanic will pass that test in  20,30 or 40 years time.As for the real Titanic I hope people have more  respect and leave it where it is. James Cameron you deserved that bonus.
0451452739|4.0|First, let me recommend watching the movie before reading the book.  The book is much more powerful after you have tried to puzzle the meaning of the monolith for yourself.  Then, if you did not understand the movie, or  want clarification on certain points, this book is the place to turn.   It  answered my two main questions:  &quot;What did the story of HAL 9000 have  to do with the story of the monolith?&quot; and &quot;What did the ending  mean?&quot;<br />Unless you are a fan of the old school of &quot;hard&quot;  science fiction, you'll probably be annoyed by Clarke's overly-expository  writing style and obsessive devotion to scientific accuracy.  This story  was obviously written when the science was much more important than the  fiction.  At times, it reads like an astronomy textbook.   But, in the end,  all your questions from the movie will be answered.  If you like the  answers, you'll like the book.   If you enjoyed &quot;figuring out&quot;  the movie, the book will spoil the mystery for you.<br />In the final  analysis, this novel deserves high marks because without it the classic  film would never have been made, or at least would have turned out much  differently.  In his companion book &quot;The Lost Worlds of 2001,&quot;  Clarke describes how the movie and novel were developed simultaneously with  feedback in both directions.  Clarke would write a chunk of the story,  Kubrick would film it, then Clarke would revise what he had written to  parallel the movie.  Both Clarke and Kubrick wanted the movie and the novel  to be viewed as one collaborative effort, even though there are some minor  discrepancies between the two.  The story was originally inspired by  Clarke's much older short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This is without a doubt the most beautiful music I've ever experienced.  I heard Secret Garden for the first time recently on a KOCE (public television) fund raising broadcast and was entranced.  I immediately made a  pledge to KOCE and received Dawn of a New Century.  I then purchased their  other two CD's and this one is my favorite. There's a very spiritual  feeling about their music...perhaps it resonates with my Irish soul.  Whatever the reason, it's simply wonderful. I plan to buy copies for all of  my friends.
B000000W6F|5.0|I was in a record store in Boise, ID back in 1992, looking for something to buy, and all the CDs that I was interested in were out of stock. All the while, there was this music playing on the store's sound system that,  around the time &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; came up, had really gotten inside  me. I started paying attention to it, and when the songs &quot;Crush&quot;,  &quot;Suffer&quot; and &quot;Snail&quot; played, I was mesmerized. This is  one that stands the test of time. With apologies to all the diehard Pumpkin  fans out there, I like everything they've done since this album, but  nothing compares to &quot;Gish&quot; in the way it lifts me and carries me  to another place. Drifting from one song to the next, the album holds  together as one master work, painting an elaborate, psychedelic picture. I  think it is one of the best rock albums of all time.

0140434135|5.0|I used to love Gothic novels. I collected out-of-print Victoria Holt paperbacks, I had stuffed animals named after characters in Charlotte and Emily Bronte novels, but ever since I've read Northanger Abbey, I can't  read a Gothic novel with a straight face. Jane Austen does a marvelous job  of sending up convoluted scary novels (and melodrama in general) in this  book, and creates her most masculine and fascinating hero, Henry  Tilney.<br />Don't think that Catherine Morland, the heroine, is just a naive  kid. Her naivete is a necessary component of the novel, as it allows her to  see the wider world with fresh eyes, provide a foil to the more worldly  characters, and ultimately capture the heart of the hero. <br />And then  there's Henry...he teases, he teaches, he forgives Catherine's regrettable  fancies, knowing that he had a hand in encouraging them. He's witty, he's  charming, he's kind of a slob, and he wears his greatcoats so well!<br />As in  all her novels, Jane Austen provides a great host of hilarious supporting  characters, in particular John and Isabella Thorpe and Mrs. Allen. I defy  anyone not to laugh at John Thorpe's nonsensical and contradictory  comments. One wonders how many such &quot;rattles&quot; wearied Miss  Austen's attention to provide such a character study.<br />Great writing,  great story, great characters...come to Northanger Abbey with a sense of  humor and you will not be disappointed.
B000009VOL|5.0|I don't often write little music reviews, but Cat Power is an exception. This is a great album. It is the sort of album to which you can turn the lights off and just listen to the rain.

0553288105|5.0|I have been a fan of Asimov's fiction as well as his science essays since childhood.  I've read his Foundation novels, Robot novels, and various unrelated fiction and factual material.  While most of his works have  usually appealed to me, I can say with little reservation that &quot;The  Gods Themselves&quot; is my favorite Asimov novel - and certainly earns a  prominent spot in my personal &quot;Top 10&quot;.<br />One of the things I  like about this novel is the way the Friedrich von Schiller quotation  &quot;Against stupidity, the [very] Gods themselves contend in vain&quot;  is worked into the story.  The three phrases that make up this quote -  &quot;Against Stupidity...&quot;, &quot;...The Gods Themselves...&quot;,  and &quot;...Contend In Vain?&quot; are used as chapter titles - and,  what's more, these titles are quite appropos to the theme of each  chapter.<br />One of the most enjoyable parts of the novel is the second  chapter, which portrays a most unusual, and wholly believable and  consistent alien race.  Science fiction authors often struggle with the  difficulty of portraying an alien race that is different enough from humans  to be believable as aliens, yet similar enough to make their motives and  culture graspable by a human reader.  Asimov succeeds brilliantly in this  task, something I can say for only a few other SF titles.<br />At the risk of  sounding PC, I was also pleased that Asimov introduced a strong female  supporting character, something not usually found in most of his works.   The &quot;Selene&quot; character introduced in the third chapter is  reminescent of the strong female leads found in many Heinlien novels.<br />Any  fan of Asimov's works - or, for that matter, any fan of good science  fiction should add this book to their essential collection.  There is a  good reason why this novel was awarded both the Hugo and Nebula awards  after it's initial publication.  Unlike many modern winners of these  awards, &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; is both a good AND entertaining  story.  It's clever and stylish enough to appeal to the &quot;artsy&quot;  types that issue such awards, while being entertaining enough to appeal to  the meat-and-potatoes reader.
6304039506|5.0|This is my absolute favorite film of all time. Every time I watch Streetcar, the fantastic performances completely blow me away. To say this is a stellar cast is a vast understatement! Marlon Brando is VERY sexy and  VERY brilliant, and definitely should have won best actor!<br />The storyline  is haunting and incredibly beautiful. Whenever I watch Streetcar I become  entirely enraptured, and cannot tear myself away from the screen. A  definite must-own!!!
B000002C1X|5.0|What a mesmerizing album.  Of course, it is an essential album for anyone's music collection.<br />Seems like I have heard it a million times, but I still listen to it from start to finish every couple of months.

B000000HU1|4.0|This is the third and final release of  Gong's legendary &quot;Radio Gnome Trilogy&quot;, which tells about the crazy life on &quot;Planet Gong&quot;. Listening to this album you will notice that Gong have anticipated many of  today's trance/techno- and ambient-sounds, especially on &quot;A sprinkling  of clouds&quot;. Remember that this record is over 25 years old now! But I  think, &quot;You&quot; is no easy listening and because of the slightly  dissonant sound it might be suitable for advanced listeners only. And it  contains some lenghty parts, especially the last two tracks. Nevertheless,  this is a great record. There's even a remix album available, called  &quot;You Remixed&quot;, which contains remixes from the likes of The Orb,  The Shamen and System 7. This shows what a big influence this album had on  today's dance scene.
6302906636|2.0|I am a fan of the Highlander:The Series t.v. show.So,I thought this movie would interest me.However,I found the plotline confusing and the camera work horrible.I hated the bad guy because the scenes he was in were  pictured so confusingly that I became extremly irritated.I also think that  the acting on the part of Christopher Lambert could have used a lot more  work.To me,this film conplicates things for the series.If you want to see  Highlander at its' best,watch the t.v. show.
B000002IOW|3.0|This album marked Rush's turn from performing high-technical soundscapes to playing more accessible, straightahead rock songs. Although I appreciate their &quot;new&quot; direction, I think Rush have lost their musical edge  with this album. This is a safe mainstream rock affair with some good songs  but also a fair amount of filler tracks. I prefer the following album  &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;, which provides a similar sound, but the  melodies are brighter, the rhythms are funkier and the songs are more  diverse.
0684830515|1.0|Several self-centered ugly Americans get drunk repeatedly in Parisian and Spanish locales.  This novel maybe might have been 2 good short stories, one about fly fishing in Spain, one about the running of the bulls and the  bullfight--those parts were lovely, but the characters and plot were boring  and pointless, and worse, ugly.  Perhaps the novel had more of a shock  value in 1927 with the descriptions of promiscuity by an English lady and  the drunkenness of the characters, but unfortunately all of our cities,d  suburbs, TV sets and movies  are filled with adolescents doing the same  things.  The later works and the Nick Adams stories are so much better than  this.  I was very disappointed.
034538072X|5.0|I am amazed at the amount of information given in this book without reading a textbook.

The book is too big and murky for a graduate student to wade through on his own and much of the bulk of the book is unusable in a  typical first-year micro course.

You could also read all of Judge, et al, or you could read all of Blanchard  and Fisher...but you could have done 100 things more useful in becoming a  good economist an a successful graduate student.<br />Now that I have finished  the program, when I need a definition or an explanation, I almost always  reach for Varian.

B0000028RR|5.0|RaTM self titled debut has to to be one of the best album of this decade. Zach De La Rocha is a very gifted song writer and combined with the best gutarist of this generation - Tom Morello - this album is a rock/rap  classic. Rage is the only band that actually saying something worth  listening to. You may not agree with their politics but at least they are  saying something other than doing it all for the &quot;Nookie&quot; or  boasting of their  supposed virtuality (whilst in fact many of these bands  are very much powerless.) I mean, how many musical groups post a book list  on their web page with authors varying from Karl Marx to Henry Miller to  James Baldwin?  And for all of you who say that Zach is not much of a  rapper, I begged you to purchase Lyrict Lounge Volume 1 and listen to the  sound C.I.A (Disc 2, track 10) where you can hear his flow.

B0000021RL|5.0|Chicago VII has long been my favourite album (of any artist), but frustratingly fails to get a nod from the Rock literati in their endless &quot;greatest albums ever&quot; listings.<br />While its complex fusion of  gospel/jazz/rock may not be as immediately rewarding as, say, Chicago V,  and may require several plays for its riches to be fully appreciated, this  album embodies the &quot;spirit&quot; of Rock as much as any of its  contemporaries. <br />The essence of its greatness lies in the juxtaposition  of its &quot;difficult&quot; songs with its more radio-friendly tracks to  create an eclectic, yet &quot;whole-of-sound&quot; atmosphere. <br />The  opening instrumental numbers set the scene for this experimental approach,  with the gaelic-tinged &quot;Prelude to Aire&quot; and &quot;Aire&quot;  creating a base upon which the group segues into a more hard-core jazz/rock  sound, followed by an equally complex but mellower &quot;cool-jazz&quot;  set comprising &quot;Happy Man&quot;, the jaunty instrumental  &quot;Mongonucleosis&quot; and two stunning improvisational numbers in  &quot;Song of the Evergreen&quot; and &quot;Byblos&quot;. <br />Underlying  this complex soundscape is a sense of playfulness which has always been at  the core of the group's playing, exmplified here by &quot;Call On Me&quot;  and &quot;Women Don't Want To Love Me&quot; (!).<br />This album represented a  watershed in Chicago's career as it began to reinvent itself as a more  mass-market band (intentionally or otherwise), by softening its original  brash, brassy sound to encompass the mellower Rock sounds FM radio wanted  to play. While greater chart and concert successes would follow, Chicago  VII represents the apex of a band unique in the Rock maelstrom.

Despite two years of  relative inactivity recording-wise, once Elvis returned to the studio in  March and April of 1960, the years slipped away to reveal that white kid,  circa 1954-55, who really could shout the blues.<br />&quot;Reconsider  Baby&quot; and &quot;Like A Baby&quot; stand out as the prime examples of  what Sam Phillips had nurtured long ago in that little studio in Memphis.  This album represents a return (albeit, short-lived) to past glories; when  the music mattered.
B000003JA7|5.0|Incredibly musical album.A greate treat for the mind.Very few bands are capable of producing anything like this.Ian has yet again shown us as to why Tull is so unique in it's sound,lyrics and attitutude.Only he can come  out with an album with such musical mastery.I must buy if you love music at  all.
6305428557|5.0|A great test of whether you have subtle taste and real humorous mind: after the first 10 minutes into the movie - once you adjust your ear to the music-like accent and figure out what's going on - you will smile all the  way to the end. A fantastic comedy for suited mind.
B00000018N|5.0|What is striking about this CD is the deapth of lyrics.It truly is mind bogling.And ofcourse the music as always is a class aprt.I highly recomend this album to anyone who's got anything to do with classic rock.All Tull  fans would already have it ofcourse.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I bought this cd not knowing much except that I liked one of the songs on the album.  I am so glad I bought it and I went straight out and bought another by her.  I am normally a country/western fan, but for some reason  this has a universal appeal, even to an &quot;oldie&quot; like me.
B00000J2KT|5.0|I've seen a lot of comments from people trying to say that there are movies superior to this one. As a vetern of this war, I can say with some authority that this one very accurate film, well acted and staged. I never  thought that I'd enjoy watching a film on this topic. But I find I never  tire of seening this film  This is not to say that there aren't other films  of this calibre, ie. Saving Private Ryan, Hamburger Hill, Pork Chop Hill,  All Quiet on the Western Front, Sahara, etc.,etc.,etc. Quite simply these  are all great films and trying to say one is greater then the other is an  exercise in futility. We all have favorite films, but we need to be able to  recognise when more then one film excels
0688091717|5.0|This Character and book demonstrate the most important message and that is to accept all that you are, especially if you don ot neatly fit into a &quot;typical&quot; category!  I love Elmer and can't wait to give it to my  nephews and nieces.
0385493800|4.0|An avid Grisham fan, I was totally disappointed by the Street Lawyer, which I found so bad that I put it down after 100 pages.  So it was nice to see that he's come back somewhat with the Testament.  No, it's not great  literature, deep or meaningful; but if you want a good story, you'll  probably like this book.
0780623134|5.0|Maltin missed the boat on this one. His last sentence should have read &quot; ...Darabont adapted and IMPROVED King's novella...&quot;. Every change from the book's content made this movie better than the book, and  that is rare. This movie should have won the Oscar, but an awkward title  and the Gump express were too much to overcome.
B0000033PB|1.0|I am a huge ELP fan, but there's a limit, and this is past that limit. (In the Hot Seat, the follow-up, is even worse.) Greg Lake's once awesomely beautiful and powerful voice is a ruin. It's shot; it's gone.  The amazing  classically-inspired construction of their earlier songs is gone, too.  Instead we get horrible, cheesy MOR ballads.  They can still play, but  music this ordinary isn't worth playing.  This isn't ELP; this is a ghastly  OAP stage band, three guys who happen to have the same names. The real ELP  died no later than the much (and on the whole justly) maligned &quot;Love  Beach&quot;. And even &quot;Love Beach&quot; had a few sparks left (the  Rodrigo cover, bits of &quot;Officer and Gentleman&quot;) of a once huge  talent. But here the fire is out.  I love ELP, but I love truth more.  <br />Laon
0515123447|3.0|Jack Reacher is great but the plot lets him down badly. The book seems well researched but the plot is painfully predictable. I read in avid anticipation of a plot twist that never happened. As for the handling of  the relationship between the key characters at the end - simply awful!
1558807381|5.0|Incredible sets and effects (which actually seem MORE impressive now, next to the you-know-it's-not-real CGI of ID4 or Godzilla), and a director who knew how to show Tim Curry off (He really IS the devil).<br />No-one seemed to  realise at the time, but Ridley Scott had done the ultimate frightner film  (Alien), the ultimate Sci-Fi film (Blade Runner), and so as a follow up he  did the ultimate fantasy film - Legend.<br />After watching the English  version (with John Williams soundtrack instead of T. Dream) for a few years  after its' release, we managed to end up with an American one.<br />Well, I  was blown away. The music makes such a difference to the film. Add to that,  Darkness seems to be in the film much more, at the expense of scenes with  the Swap Monster (&quot;Come to Meg, juicy boy&quot;). If you're looking  for the English version, only do so out of curiosity - It's not as good as  the original. The differences between the two are staggering - almost every  scene is a second take, or with different (sometimes entirely new)  characters. For instance, Mia Sara turned out to be a Princess in the  English version - in the US, she isn't, and all the characters' speech is  adjusted accordingly.<br />In an ideal world they'll do a special DVD version  with both edits making a longer film and keeping the T. Dream  soundtrack.<br />Hey, a guy can dream, can't he?
B000001DZM|5.0|What can I say?  I love this thing!  Maybe its because I have been looking for a CD with a lot of songs within my singing range, or maybe I just like that &quot;I Don't Care if The Sun Don't Shine&quot; song.  I don't like  ABBA though.. Mind you I didn't grow up with disco either.  I wasnt even  born yet! (I'm 17)  A must-have for those nights alone with your hairbrush  microphone!  Guy Pierce is amazing!  I'll admit, the movies better than the  music. Caio!
6302902010|5.0|captd@gdi.net from Orlando Florida ,  I Too want the original version of Porgie &amp; Bess in 1959.  It's all good, I also think they should make more movies about musicians life story like the 5 heartbeats, temptations,  jacksons etc. I'll buy them all. I'm also a Dee Jay.
B0000033P0|5.0|A simply brilliant album. The &quot;Tarkus&quot; suite is one of the most high-energy 20 minutes in music. Not in rock, or in prog-rock, but in music. <br />For that suite, I'd rate this as my personal favourite ELP album.  The songs that followed (on side 2 on the vinyl version) are more  inconsistent but also contain moments of excellence - especially  &quot;Hymn&quot; and &quot;Bitches Crystal&quot;. <br />The Greg Lake  contributions to Tarkus are some of his best work ever. And for all that  people think of ELP as a keyboard band, when Greg Lake is good, the band is  good. When he's off (as in &quot;Love Beach&quot; and anything produced  during the cash-in 90's revival) the band is horrible.   <br />&quot;Battlefield&quot;, the last of the vocal sections in  &quot;Tarkus&quot;, is outstanding; the best section of the best thing they  ever did. Lake's final &quot;Let there be no sorrow, be no pain&quot; works  for me: awesome, actually moving, brilliant at every level. <br />Even the  electric guitar playing's pretty good, though I prefer Lake's soloing on  the &quot;Welcome back my friends&quot; live version, where he plays some  damned impressive rock guitar, something I didn't realise he could do.   <br />I've highlighted Lake only because he sometimes doesn't get enough  credit. I'm a fan of each of these three musicians. Each was simply the  best around at what they were doing. <br />Side two is more hit and miss,  though there are more hits than misses. &quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; is the  best of their comic songs by a fair margin, and *short*. And the silly  throwaway song at the end, &quot;Are you ready, Eddie&quot;, in honour of  their sound engineer, is actually a good song.  <br />But the  &quot;Tarkus&quot; suite is one wild, exuberant ride, musically absolutely  unique (I can't think of anything else like it; though some other ELP comes  close), and consistently brilliant. <br />ELP are starting to influence other  musicians only now, long after theystopped. (They stopped in 1976 at the  latest - product from the 90s reformed ELP can be safely ignored.) It's the  critics who sneered at ELP twenty years ago who look silly now. <br />This is  one of the greatest rock outfits ever at the absolute peak of their  creativity. <br />A classic. <br />Laon
0790734850|4.0|Actually, I'd rate this movie 4 and a half stars if I could. It's got so many things going for it. Riveting storyline, great atmosphere, excellent performances from the entire cast, first-rate directing, explosive finale .  . . then Detective Bud White gets shot 3 times at virtually point-blank  range. He's a dead man, right? No. As the movie ends, we see him blissfully  riding into the sunset, so to speak, with Kim Basinger in yet another  textbook Hollywood happy ending. That's what costs the movie half a star in  my book.
B00000JZIK|5.0|While some will criticize this film as too contrived, I must extend the comment of the reviewer from the Big Easy from best ending ever, to the best screenplay I have seen.  If you haven't seen this film, you must!
0694003611|5.0|I have read this book over and over to my two children and they both still love it! My 3 year old can almost quote it word for word.  My 5 year old is reading books and it all started with Goodnight Moon.
0871137380|5.0|A book too difficult to put down. The QRF/RANGERS/DELTA FORCE are to be lauded for their bravery, as a disaster was just &quot;around the corner&quot;. As many VIETNAM VETS will agree, American soldiers are too  often over confident in their skills/expertise, while lacking respect for  their &quot;enemy&quot;. That's evident in BLACK HAWK DOWN. <br />A must book  to read for military personnel.  After finishing the book, I mailed it to  my son, a RANGER LT.
6300214753|5.0|This movie is a classic. It should become a rite of passage into adulthood. I really connected with Cameron--I'm a coward when it comes to facing my parents. Ferris, Sloan and Cameron are the pictures of regular  teenagers(minus the ridiculous clothing and antics).Adults should watch it,  to see first hand the pressures they put upon us, if they forget so easily  what it was like for them. Any-hoo, watch the movie, change the universe.
6303421563|5.0|&quot;The Professional&quot; is a thoroughly professional production in every respect.  Great directing, superb casting, absorbing and original story, splendid photography and musical score - plenty of believable tense  situations. Oldman is out of this world as the mad, drug-sodden corrupt  cop. High-class violence all the way. Don't miss this one!
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is probably by far one of the best albums I have heard in years.  It can be listened to from start to finish and still leave you wanting  more.  She will make your thoughts soar.
0380789019|5.0|This book takes the reader into the fantastical world of London Below--the underground world that is very wonderful and frightening. I picked this book up on a whim, and now I can't quit thinking about it.  The characters  are intriguing, yet mysterious.  We never know quite everything, which  leaves it open for numerous sequels.  I can't wait.  Very good work, Neil!
630157401X|4.0|Okay, Raiders and Crusade are very much alike movies. Here are the similarities, and the differences.<br />1. both movies contain NAZI's<br />2. Sallah is in it.<br />3. Marcus Brody is in it.<br />4. Marcus walks into Indy's  classroom when he is finishing a lesson.<br />5. The end doesn't conclude with  a giant fight.<br />6. The artifacts are both mentioned in the bible.<br />7.  Their is a Nazi convoy. ( Raiders had a convoy of A Motorbike, a guncar, a  Nazi truck, and a lead car. Crusade had a car, an army tank, a truck  containing Nazi's, another car containing NAZI's, and a Limosioune.)<br />8.  Indy used a horse to attempt to intercept the convoy.<br />9. The letters that  introduce the title had the same font, style, and color.<br />10. The  artifacts both kill the villain.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bend is such a great cd, if you like Pablo Honey or OK Computer or the Verve you'll love this cd, its an essential for anyone's collection.
