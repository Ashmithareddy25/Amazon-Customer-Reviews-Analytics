B000B8QG4A|4.0|I did want to see a little more about the story behind the story, but overall it gave me a great look at the creative forces behind the movie.  What a sweet story in the end, and the quality was great.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Just when i thought my favorite album \\"one day remains\\" could not be chased, this album certainly comes close.    slightly heavier than alter bridges debut album, the songs are still powerful and amazing, although my favourites would still lie on the first album
0099771810|2.0|I just finished this.  To me it started quite badly, too much dialog by a person not really connected to the plot.    Then it kicks off properly after about 80 pages or so and focuses on the main character the Swede.    Some of the insights into the Swede were interesting but there are loose ends and long generally dull sections particularly towards the end.    It is one big post mortem really, even within the context of the story, the story itself is imaginary.  Just a bit of nothing really.    It kinda of is worth reading, the psychology is very detailed, and some times I felt like I was reading a new level of novel.  But overall to me it didn't quite do it.      I guess it was just too subtle for me... or was it 'silk so fine human eyes cannot see it...'
B000UFAURI|2.0|Oh god        you listen to pretender and thing wow        the foo fighters we love are back, and the first 4 or 5 songs on the album you thing not bad but yeah decent start        and it all goes downhill from there        why would you add some random acoustic instrumental in there?  WHY        i just got bored. i mean very bored.
068987474X|2.0|If you are with a guy for a long time and you want to get married and he doesn't, leave the relationship.  Simple as that! I think this book is good for... and I've even recommended to someone who has low self esteem.  However, I don't entirely agree with everything.      I think you could miss out on an opportunity with a great guy if you follow it to a T.  We are talking about men and they are not perfect!  I've found guys who start a relationship \\"being way into me\\" often lose interest a few short months later.  Yet the guys who hold back, don't call me as much as I'd like end up being really into me, they just didn't want to scare me away.      So read the book but take it with a grain of salt.  All people are different and have different habits.  For instance, a guy may follow the rules and be all into you yet he's a heavy gambler, a loser and drinker and he's into you for a free ride.  Meanwhile you meet a man who doesn't always call you and breaks dates on occasion but he's truly a good guy.  This book will lead you to the drunken loser.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|4 good songs, suprisingly sounding like their old stuff        the rapping has nothing to it like the old albums and they became big for what they do (did)      and that was absolutely brilliant rap metal        not some crappy bollocks playing with a keyboard and singing depressing meaningless songs
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce is getting older, but more reflective in his words and music.  This is the best music he has done in many years.  It is his \\"Born to Run\\" of his later years.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|fantastic album by the hardcore punk band who are only improving with every album they create      a fantastic mix of punk songs with everyone being different and excellent at the same time.    no bad song on the album
0441172717|5.0|People have watched the poorly conveyed movie, and that keeps them from reading this fine sci-fi book, which is a darn shame. The movie-only folks said, 'What was THAT all about?!?' Well, when they read this excellent book, they'll know!<br /><br />I'm not a huge sci-fi fan (see my listmania book lists), but I found this entire series quite refreshing and well-done.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book (and the subsequent ones), to any fan of fiction, and particularly to sci-fi enthusiasts.
B000002GKT|5.0|Intense, lurid, boogiefied, and at time even borderline psychedelic.  Humble Pie took 1 original, 5 covers, and 1 song which they credited to Ida Cox but has nothing in common with the credited song, and through ripped through them with all the power, intensity and emotion they had for some of the best 73 minutes of rock and heavy blues I have ever heard!  The thing I love the most is that they had the ability to make the cover song completly their own. I have heard allot of versions of Willie Dixon's I'm Ready, none was energeic as this one. Steve Marriot is awsome on vocals. There's no frills and thrills here, just solid, pure rock with all the sleazy attitude expected from a hard rock show.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I don't know how else to contact Amazon to correct a huge problem in regard to the LOTR films, but they BADLY need to separate the reviews on the various editions of these films (e.g., the widescreen, the full-screen, and the Special Extended Edition version).<br /><br />The Special Extended Editions are BY FAR the superior choices for anyone wishing to watch these great films and they're well-worth the money, but a LOT of folks don't know about them. With the additional footage, the movies make infinitely more sense, especially to anyone who has never previously read the Trilogy. All three LOTRs films are available in this format, plus, each film is on two discs, due to the added footage. In addition to that, each one is presented in a nice cardboard case, has an informational booklet included, and offers two ADDITIONAL discs which are \\"special features\\" sort of information. This is essentially a \\"collectors' edition\\" but, as I have mentioned, the movie itself (for more casual viewers as well as for fans) greatly benefits from the additional film footage.<br /><br />So, since once you've reviewed ANY version of LOTRs, one cannot review any other version (Amazon software sees this as a second review of the same product by the same person!), I am placing this information here to the prospective benefit of other Amazon customers (and victims!) *.*<br /><br />Now, on to the story:<br /><br />This is the second entry in the film-trilogy of The Lord of Rings. I'm rating each one separately to yield a more honest opinion of the entire series. I'm rating 'The Fellowship of the Ring' 4-stars, this one 5-stars, and, 'The Return of the King' 4-stars.<br /><br />The film is a fantasy, fairy-tale sort of movie, to inform the uninitiated. The first of the three films tells of Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit of the Shire, and his quest, (along with a 'fellowship' of comrades), to save Middle Earth by destroying the ancient Ring of Power, which is in his possession. He can only do this by traveling to the Land of Mordor (a VERY nasty place) and tossing the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, whence the ring was originally forged by an evil wizard, Sauron, (who is still evil and still around, and who is seeking to locate his lost magical Ring of Power big-time).<br /><br />In this entry, we find that Sauron (of Mordor) and another now-evil wizard, Saruman, (of Isengard) have teamed up to fight the remaining non-evil entities in an all-out power-grab for Middle Earth. Mordor and Isengard each boast a huge heavy-metal-type 'tower', hence the movie title. Of course, Frodo's difficult quest continues throughout the movie.<br /><br />The fellowship, having gotten split at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring' now run into all manner of obstacles. Agendas also become mixed and there is much in-fighting amongst the various regional rulers which complicates defeating their common enemies, Sauron and Saruman. As a consequence of all this action, there is a LOT of jumping around in the film from place to place -- BUT, the director pulled off a coup: this story remains coherent, and pretty much stands on its own as a film. I would have thought this impossible and I wondered how they would ever do it successfully. But they did and I'm quite happy about it.<br /><br />Now, the CINEMATOGRAPHY in all three of these films will knock you out -- superbly contrived, second to none. The COLOR SATURATION will bowl you over as well. The script and STORYLINE are not at all hokey and come off as quite coherent, which would have been a very difficult task as readers of the book(s) are well-aware.<br /><br />I much appreciated the fact that the story remains close to the book(s), with few cuts and/or ommissions. Of course, this has made for a lengthy film, but one which will not bore you at all.<br /><br />My final critique of the film is that the same primary theme composition is used for all three films -- man, I got REALLY tired of that filmscore, even though other facetsof it are brilliant. It's the up-front french horn one that I'm speaking of.<br /><br />In the end, this is a very fine film, not necessarily for smaller kids, but A-O-K for teens. A last comment, don't waste time or money watching the FULL-SCREEN edition -- I've watched it that way (all three films) and you lose 2-stars when you do! This one MUST be viewed in widescreen only!.     In the end, this is a very fine film, not necessarily for smaller kids, but A-O-K for teens. A last comment, don't waste time or money watching the FULL-SCREEN edition -- I've watched it that way (all three films) and you lose 2-stars when you do! This one MUST be viewed in widescreen only!
B0002IQHZM|3.0|Classic Donovan is just brilliant.  If you can catch him live (he's still out there), he's just great.  This cd, errr, don't think so.  Don is working too hard with limited materal.
1594200823|3.0|I certainly doubt that most people never realized or for that matter never even thought to realize how many ingredients are in a Chicken McNugget! I have to say that this book really is nothing new. We all know what foods are bad for us and what foods are good. Pollan just took a journalistic researchers approach on a subject that is so trendy these days. Hell it was trendy when everyone and there mum's were gorging themselves on Chinese food buffet's and then blaming it on the overuse of MSG. Food companies have been coming up with clever ways on how to make food tase better and last longer for decades. This book just outlines them and breaks them down for people who seem to have the time to read an entire book but are just too busy to read a nutritional chart on the back of Potato chip bag. Unless you are curious about mass production of food, want to know the difference between small business organic and big business organic, or just want to know how many ingredients are in a McNugget? I will save you some time and money: Pay Attention!  Read the list of ingredients and nutritional information on the back of food products that the FDA has so tediously placed for us consumers, get to know your local merchants, say hello to your local farmers, basically know where your food comes from. If you have time to read such a lengthy book then you should have time to figure out what you are putting into your body. I gave this book 3 stars because it was researched meticulously well and it was also well written. I also respect the fact that the authour just gives us the information without bias. It is refreshing not to have such a hot topic \\"shoved down our throats\\" so to speak.
1402573723|3.0|I'm not the biggest fan of the novel: it works better in theory than as literature for me.  Still, you might get another \\"read\\" through if you have this well read version in your car.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|It seems that James Blunt's experiences as a solider are everything to his music.  No matter what he is singing about there is an image of war or a feeling of loss based upon the things he saw while over seas.  This man is working out a lot of psychological scars in his music and it produces some hauntingly beautiful prose.  Track three, \\"I'll Take Everything,\\" has a great beat with the saddest lyrics I have hard since I was an angst ridden teen listening to The Smiths.  He has the same talent as Morrissey for creating up beat music that sucks you in and lyrics that rip your heart out.  If you don't listen to what the singer is saying don't try this album, it isn't the music that matters here as much as the story Blunt has to tell.  I'm not saying the rhythmus and melodies aren't good, they are, it just takes a back seat (in my mind) to the lyrics.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I just made a copy of this for a (younger) friend who had never heard King Crimson.  I remember the first night they came out as the opening act at the Fillmore East.  Can't say I remember much else about that night except thinking that the world of music had changed.  When I was listening to this the other night, I had the same reaction.  This is one of the tipping points in popular music: it's harsh, noisy, melodic, meditative, cacophonic, and just spectacular.  It's a must have, a must listen to, and one of the best albums of all time.  Amazing after all these years.
B000W0DFDM|3.0|Many instances described in the book are the obvious for the experienced lover.  I believe the book is more geared for the in-experienced lover for having a serious relationship with the opposite sex.  It's kind of boring for the experienced one.  Just my opinion....?
1596912375|3.0|Strange book indeed. And not necessarily strange in a good way. But it is about the young woman/old woman Eva Delectorskaya/Sally Gilmartin and her daughter Ruth Gilmartin. Eva/Sally was a British spy during the Second World War, taught and trained by the enigmatic Lucas Romer, with whom she also has a steaming love affair, mainly during their stay in America in the beginning of the 1940'es, before Pearl Habor.<br />The story moves back and forth between Eva's spying-days in the 1940'es and the present day, which in this book is the 1970'es. Eva/Sally, the former master-spy, has become and older lady, and some things which happened during the war is still gnawing at her soul. She manipulates her twenty-something daughter Ruth to dig a little in the story and the history, without telling Ruth exactly what it is she wants her to find.<br />Very slowly the story unfolds, and I had a hard time following. Maybe because I am definitely not an expert in neither the Second World War nor spying and spies.<br />I discovered that the author comes highly acclaimed and has written several works. It took me months to finish Restless, but it wasn't exactly a bad book, and it wasn't exactly boring. I just didn't get half of it, and had to read other books in between. The writing style and the character-development is excellent, but there are definitely som loose ends, which has nothing to do with understanding the book or not. I do not know if I should recommend this book or not.
B000UX6THK|5.0|At long last, Twin Peaks in released in FULL on dvd to the public! My only complaints? I think Fire Walk With Me should have been included in this set. Also, the episodes are listed strangely on the discs.  They are all there, but the discs are misleading.      Overall, I was overjoyed to receive my Gold Box in the mail the other day!
B00012FXAE|5.0|I have been using my VHS tapes to watch my  one of my favorite movies-\\"Aliens\\"  I did a side by side test of vhs vs dvd and I am amazed by the difference. It's like seeing it for the first time.  However there is so much extra info in this set it's almost scary
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|WARNING! I'm one of \\"those people\\" that believe that the Super Bowl must be fixed because there's just way too much money at stake.<br /><br />Given this, I believe Britney's 2007 addiction, rehab, head shaving, child custody battling, MTV VMA breathless and intoxicated performance were all put in play by a PR manager that truly understands the maxim \\"there's no such thing as bad publicity\\". Let's face it, Anna Nicole Smith's massive value in pop culture land was premised on exactly this type of behavior, and she wasn't hawking an album. Need more proof? How about Paris and her CD?<br /><br />Nuff said about dat. The album is interesting as it tries top establish an asynchronous dialogue between Britney, you and the papparazi. The songs are decently produced and heavily remixed.<br /><br />My prediction is that #5 (Heaven...) will play well in the clubs and will become the hitter after a few weeks of play. It's got a good mix of Kylie Minogue dance beat and great backgrounds.<br /><br />Love her or hate her, she's going to pull down $10M from this easy. How you doin?
B000059TEQ|5.0|The movie Love Story is indeed all about love. The bantering between the two stars in their relationship keeps the story light until the final stages. Highly recommend this movie, but not if you have lost a loved one recently; the emotions will all flood back.
0596007124|5.0|I've got a number of years of software development under my belt. Like most of my colleagues I use design patterns on a daily basis, yet sometimes struggle to identify them by names defined in GOF book, which I've read years ago.  I decided to refresh my memory by reading another book on patterns.  While GOF book covers more patterns, it's not as nearly as much fun to read as Head First Design Patterns. Head First book is simply brilliant! It took me through my early days experience of creating stupid solutions and refactoring them into something nice and elegant. I wish I had this book back then :)  The book is structured very well, with hands-on examples understandable by anybody who can read code.  Bottom line:  - I definitely recommend this book to any junior developer who wants to get familiar with Design Patterns  - Experienced developers will skip quite a few pages (like I did), yet it's still a good read. Most of the time you'll be thinking \\"a-ha, so this stuff I did yesterday is called Facade!\\". Knowing the names of patterns saves time in communicating ideas with colleagues. So go and get this book, it's worth it.
0143038419|2.0|I don't know if this is a widespread production glitch with this title,but some pages are repeated in 10-20 page chunks. Toward the end entire chapters are missing.      Perfectly interesting story, but a severely defective product makes it unreadable.
B000RIWAYY|4.0|A guitar album which was both groundbreaking and unprecedented (and has since become legendary), \\"Surfing With The Alien\\" is an absolute classic. With this 20th anniversary remastered release, not much is changed- it still sounds fantastic, but oddly enough, I actually prefer the original production. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the remastered production seems a bit dry or sterile compared to the original release....<br /><br />The real treat here for Satch fans is the addition of a bonus DVD with a fantastic early European gig in which a virtually unknown guitarists and band pull of a fantastic virtuoso performance despite a million setbacks (being \\"bumped\\" from a 12:00 time slot to 4:00 a.m., having to cut half of their set-list, jet-lag and fatigue- the accompanying notes from Satriani are both amusing and interesting to read) as well as videos for a couple of classic songs and a hilarious commentary from Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel. The real treat for long time fans such as myself is seeing Joe in all his funky late-eighties neo-Hendrix glory (weird outfits, hair, and all) and wielding his old self-decorated Ibanez guitars that he used to cut his first three albums....a fun and nostalgic experience. The only reason I knocked a star off is because I prefer the \\"old\\" mix of \\"Surfing\\"....other than that it's an excellent reissue....I may be nitpicking; can I give it 4 and a half stars?
1931382794|5.0|Simply the most comprhensive book out there on the subject.  A little biased in favor of \\"TrainingPeaks\\" software but still very, very good.  If you are looking for simple answers about training effectively you might want to look elsewhere.  Training with power takes a little thought and consideration.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|yeah, i get what most people are writing here that dylan does dylan best.  sure, i agree.  but these covers are amazing!    i think there's three songs on all these that i skip, and they're the same ones i skip when dylan sings 'em.    i've been listening to this nonstop for days.  i already liked a lot of these artists but even the people i've never heard of are outstanding.  i honestly don't understand how someone could give this soundtrack a negative review.  i pass on all the praise i can for this album.  it's incredible!  just listen to the few songs that have been posted on myspace for free- they will convince you.    buy!  and i've heard the movie is unbelievable.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Wonderful vehicle for Annie Lennox's beautiful voice.  Mature and soulful.  I love it.
B000UR366S|5.0|Joni does not disappoint on this album.  A beautiful commentary on our world and how precious it is.  Joni has always been one of the best \\"message songwriters\\" of the 20th and 21st centuries.  She certainly lives up to all that has been said of her (and more!) over the last 40 (can it really be that many!!??) years.  I loved that the album began with an instrumental that she couldn't get out of her head after meditating with nature one relaxing, beautiful day.  Joni never ceases to touch and amaze me.
B000XPOB0M|2.0|The movie soundtrack is very noisy and disturbing. It remains quiet and then every few minutes it will just get loud. It has too many flashbacks flash forwards and dream sequences to keep track of. We had rented the movie on tivo via unbox but we deleted it in half an hour. Good that we rented with the 99 cent special deal otherwise this would have been a waste of 3-4 dollars and half an hour.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I cannot believe that the government is allowing this collection of Seinfeld episodes to be sold.    When \\"The Puerto Rican Day\\" was first shown on television, it was appropriately met with outrage. Thereafter, it was pulled from syndication in deference to the tender sensitivities of Puerto Ricans, of which I consider myself one in communal spirit. The air- and cable-waves were cleansed, and years unfolded, allowing us all to forget the dark, dark day in America when such an offense aired to our collective shame. Sure, like most Americans I would have preferred a public apology from the President of the United States, reparations from Mr. Seinfeld et al, and the bestowal of statehood upon that poor, abused Commonwealth. None of that was to be, though, and the enlightened and politically correct among us would have to be content with the knowledge that never again would a human being be allowed to look upon this terrible, terrible sitcom episode.    Until now. What could possibly explain the episode's inclusion in this collection? Who knows what result awaits this country, what conflagrations will threaten the nation's peace as Puerto Ricans rise up and assert their birthright - a life free from ridicule from sitcom writers? I suggest we all pray for men's souls as the darkness descends.
0838577016|3.0|Kandel is an outstanding Nobel laureate. Unfortunately, his capabilities as a writer don't match his capabilities as a researcher.<br /><br />Now, I am a medical student, and used this book for neurophysiology. The book is big and blabby, in that concepts aren't very clear and they sure aren't summarized. There is a lot of material pertaining to experiments on animals (mainly rats, cats, and monkeys) which are then generalized to humans, following the classical behavioral and developmental neuroscience models.<br /><br />If you need or expect to deepen your understanding of molecular and cognitive neuroscience by using this book, run away. Furthermore, when it comes to the specific topics, the sensory system and apparatuses are done very well, but this is not the case for the motor system (very very very confused!), let alone the so called \\"superior functions\\" (cognitive functions are described poorly, with a pour-pourri of \\"maybe this\\" and \\"maybe that\\"). It's also a good starter for CNS ion channels, but as I said it's just a starter.<br /><br />If you are a medical student, read the sensory system and do the rest elsewhere. If you are a cognitive or molecular neuroscientist, just run. If you are a behavioral neuroscientist, this might be a good intro to the topic.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Four stars for the fact that I'm still watching. It's currently mid-way through its US run on BBC America.<br /><br />I have to say I was really excited about Torchwood when I heard it was going to be shown in the US. I fell in love with the character of Captain Jack on Doctor Who and I think Russell T. Davies has done an absolutely phenomenal job in resurrecting the Doctor, so I was expecting more of the same greatness. But the first episode was quite a jolt - and not necessarily in a good way; but I haven't tuned out in the hopes the episodes would get better - and there have been a couple that I did enjoy quite a bit - \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\" is a particular favorite. I really appreciated the subject matter as death and whether or not there is an afterlife is a question I ponder often. Their answer to it in this episode is more than a little chilling.<br /><br />My one complaint with the series is the sex. Now, I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination and I do believe that when well placed, sex can add to and enhance the story. But some of the instances in Torchwood are truly cringe-worthy and actually detract from the story. Take \\"Cyberwoman\\" for example. Who is gonna sit there and make out when you're being hunted by a killing machine? There are other instances throughout the series that have left me scratching my head, wondering, \\"what was the point of that?\\"<br /><br />That's my major beef with it; however, I haven't turned off the telly yet and I have seen some improvement as the series progresses. And to be quite honest, there's a zinger at the end of Doctor Who: Series Three that will probably compel me to tune into Torchwood: Series Two. But as stands right now, I'm still undecided on whether or not I will add the DVDs to my collection.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Just recieved my album yesterday and could not stop listening to it. I think this is a great cd and if people would stop worrying about what goes on in her personal life, and concentrate on the music then this will sell even more next week. Timbaland's protege' Danja killed this album and really made it better. The Pharell produced track \\"Why Should I be sad\\" is a great song to end the album with. My personal five favs are:    Why Should I Be Sad  Radar  Get naked (I Got A Plan)  Toy Soldier  Hot as Ice
038572179X|4.0|\\"Atonement\\" is set in England back in 1935. The novel is divided into four separate parts. The first part details a domestic crisis in the Tallis household. Thirteen-year-old Briony witnesses an encounter between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the neighbor boy. A crime is committed later that same evening, and Briony points the finger at the wrong man. The second part of the book follows Robbie's stint as a member of the British Army during World War II. In the third part of the book, five years have passed since that fateful night when Briony made her false accusation. She is now an eighteen-year-old nurse and is determined to find a way to set things right, but that may not even be possible. The last portion of the book is set in 1999, and one of the main characters of the story reflects back on her life and what has become of it.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book that engrossed me from the very beginning. Author Ian McEwan has a very distinct writing style, and although I enjoy it, he really tends to pile on the details, even when such vivid descriptions aren't absolutely necessary. I enjoyed all of the book except for Part II, which is basically made up of Robbie's war stories. Those pages were well-written but mostly uninteresting to me, and I thought they went on for way too long. It took me a long time to finish reading \\"Atonement,\\" and I thought it was a very unique and provocative book. Certain portions could have been condensed, though, and I hope the upcoming film adaptation does a better job of sorting the story out.
B000002BUY|5.0|As many others have said this is loved by the true hardcore incubus fans. While \\"certain shade of green\\" is a great song, The one i'm partial to is track no.11 \\"3 o'clock\\". Either way this CD is my personal favorite, and probably will always be. But if your just getting into Incubus this is Definately worth a listen. To me this covers multiple genres of music and scales the list of must have C.D's.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I guarantee you won't be disappointed in this movie.  Highly Recommended.  One of Dinsney's best ever.
B000QUCNOK|3.0|I read Suskind's work as an undergraduate ... and its details are still grotesquely etched on my brain. I cannot say that I \\"liked\\" the novel, but I was engrossed enough to complete it. Fast-forward a decade ... and the same applies to Tykwer's film-adaptation.     Within the first few seconds, I felt a visceral repulsion to the film (as the viewer is expected to). The quick-cuts of the putrid marketplace creates revulsion and distance ... which is why many viewers here expressed a sense of \\"not caring about the characters\\" (this is valid). Likewise, Tykwer (true to Suskind) resists romanticizing Paris ... few directors are this straight-forward. The place is revealed as filthy, with a near-tangible stench (this is why we see members of aristocracy holding scented handkerchiefs under their noses). Even the long-shots of the city show stained, unappealing building facades. Who knew an artist could create a visual so fetid that the viewer can actual smell it?! Brilliance.    Hoffman is convincing is his role as an aging perfumer. His portrayal of Giuseppe Baldini is as amusing as it is compelling. Likewise, Alan Rickman's \\"Richis\\" may be the character with whom the viewer can align her/himself. He is the voice of reason ... all of his \\"paranoid\\" obsessions are completely justified ... but no one will listen. His frustration is ours. Still, this is not enough to forge a connection between the film and the viewer. We find ourselves not caring when his beautiful daughter is being hunted for her scent. (And there is an attempt at garnering emotion ... evident in the delicate replacing of the flower on her mother's grave).     This is a film with no catharsis (which is fine), but couple that with its dreary setting and vulgar displays, and the film becomes impossible to \\"like.\\" This does not mean the film fails to intrigue, it simply means that a viewer may walk-away feeling empty. And, perhaps worse, wondering why the film was created at all. And, yes, it is true that Kubrick was intrigued by the text, but found it \\"unfilmable.\\" I wonder what spurred Tykwer to tackle the text a master found \\"unfilmable\\"? One is forced to assume hubris was at work here ... and this gamble was not a (TECHNICALLY) successful one. The budget for this work was a staggering $65,800,000 and was an epic, box-office failure. In fact, I have never before or after read such a vehement review from the much esteemed Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper: \\"Hated this movie. Hated it\\" (his literal words). Still, consider the equally (perhaps even more) esteemed Ebert who found it \\"brave\\" (to paraphrase). I think it may be JUST that polarizing.    My middle-of-the-road review is both an acknowledgment of the film's artistic merits and a recognition of its tendency to evince viewer-apathy (including mine).     If you have an interest in seeing Suskind's work on-screen buy this film. If you were a huge fan of \\"Lola Rennt\\" ([[ASIN:B000021Y77 Run Lola Run]]) then buy this film. However, if you are entering this work \\"blind\\" ... you may wish to rent it first.
B00005JLO2|2.0|When a film maker is given a novel that lays bare the soul of a sensitive man who loves deeply and cares for his friends, a novel that examines courage and the necessity to face the fears that are within almost any sentient being. One would expect a rich experience in return. Add to those elements a breathtaking setting, the pomp and beauty of this era of the British Empire and a cast of very capable actors, how can you miss? I really don't know, but miss they did. My guess is that you burden your audience with wooden dialogue and political statements that have very little to do with the main plot. Dismiss as unecessary the sacrifices of the minor characters, remove Feversham's search for himself before he embarks upon his mission to reclaim his honor and there you have it. A movie that perhaps untethered to the novel might have stood a better chance on its' own merits. The cinematography is gorgeous and the costuming impressive. Unfortunately reading the novel beforehand has doomed me to an almost Ishtar level of discomfort. Since I have enjoyed this cast and knowing the level of craftsmanship available to the film maker as well as the deep drama that is the treasure of Mason's novel I was left feeling empty. Perhaps the 1939 version would better satisfy.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a fantastic game. My 8 year old was able to pick up on the strategy pretty quickly and we've played this many times and it never gets dull for the adult or the kids. Worth every cent.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|It would be easy to roll your eyes at this CD and say, \\"God, not another ZZ Top Best-Of collection.  Why bother?\\"  That was pretty much what I thought, until I heard this album.<br /><br />Hearing Disc 1 is like hearing ZZ Top anew.  This was the first time I had ever heard the ORIGINAL mixes of their pre-Eliminator material, and what a difference it makes.  The soulless 80's drum machines and re-recorded guitar and vocal parts that they released in the 80's are gone, leaving the original gritty blues-rock sensibilities that are at the core of this band's best music.  These songs leave you feeling dirty and smelling of motor oil, cattle and cigarette smoke.  (Conversely, the Six-Pack remixes felt more like someone's slick penthouse cocaine party.)  It's the way the songs were meant to sound, and it's a pleasure to rediscover classic tracks that I had only previously heard in their inferior 6-Pack remixed form.<br /><br />I have less to say about Disc 2.  It covers their career from Eliminator onwards, and the post-Eliminator material (about half the disc) doesn't stand up too well to what came before it.  The real reason to pick up this album is for the original mixes on Disc 1, and those are well worth the purchase price.
0316010669|5.0|I really love how he writes. I have read all but one of his books and I would suggest his books to everyone who is studding sociology, or economics. He puts things together that are interconnected, but that I didn't realize were so connected. His books really opened my eyes to several things in this world. In other words... GOOD BOOK!
0062502182|1.0|The story in this is really a very sweet one, with a boy and his adventures.  But I was irritated by the mish-mash of religious references that contradicted each other.  For example it talks about evolution over millions of years, then talks about man being created on the sixth day of creation.  It talks about heaven, but then mentions previous lives.  Then you get Allah as the way to heaven, then the Son of God (Jesus).  It refers to animistic spirituality as well!  Hate to tell you, but not all religions can be right, and puting them all in one basket does not make a book profound, it just makes it a confusing mess.  I wanted to like this book for the story, but found its \\"wisdom\\" to be sorely lacking.
B00005OM4K|4.0|What a collection this is.  Almost every song that this group did in its various incarnations through to the hard hitting and very melodic Creedence signature tunes.  I have listened to every album in the set and marvelled at the various changes this group had in its way up the musical ladder of success.  They are awesome and still rock. The quality is also very good and is not a cheap imitation of what was.  If you have the money available buy this set and give yourself a treat.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Monsters Inc. had much potential and could have been better in the hands of someone like Tim Burton, or even someone imitating his style. As it was this movie was merely \\"all right\\" and isn't one that will endear itself to too many people. Who knew, though, that all those closet monsters and below-bed beings worked for a good cause? And who says the movies have nothing to teach us?
B000HIVOFU|4.0|I am not sure if the title of this album is literally correct but it is very very good.  The recording exemplifies the typical quality of this recording company and the artists are excellent.  From this album I have since purchased several other albums by artists featured on this album based on the performances I heard.  Very nice album.  Seriously worth a listen.
0525950079|3.0|I remember \\"Pillars\\" fondly and I have enjoyed most of Mr. Follett's stories for their tightly drawn plots, sympthetic characters and light-handed irony.    There is much to enjoy in this book, too, but to find it I had to wade through pages of ancillary subplots and a neverending parade of characters who I could never keep straight.      Still, it's Follett and worth the read, particularly for the history and the well done descriptions of grubby 14th Century life.    The book would have been much improved and certainly easier to enjoy with a small forest of familty trees and an illustrated map of Kingsbridge.  Perhaps the paperback edition can rectify that oversight.
B000TUXL2A|4.0|I am a great fan of Mark Knopfler and his music and on my first listen to his new album I must confess that I was not impressed.  Having listened to it now a few more times I am starting to change my mind. I now hear more of the musicianship of Knopfler and his skill with molding language into musical poetry.  This is not the boppy music of Dire Straits if that is what you might be looking for but it is a delight to listen to.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This magical recording of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison is a warts and all live recording in front of several hundred plus prisoners in January 1968. The atmosphere is electric, with frequent shouts and spontaneous applause and whistles from the crowd. Even some of the official prison announcements are left in the recordings.<br /><br />Highlights are many as Cash has chosen his set carefully with the audience in mind. So '25 minutes to go' (a reference to the electric chair), 'Cocaine Blues' and his own 'Fulsom Prison Blues' are all brilliant performances.<br /><br />I first heard Johnny Cash through his later American recordings. These are great albums but on the last three or four his voice getting weaker after each album. The difference in his voice here is pretty startling and he puts it to great use.<br /><br />The CD is very well packaged with interesting sleeve notes by Cash, written in 1999 and also by Steve Earle. There are also plenty of stills from the show itself.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Did anyone think that Burial's sophomore CD could top his self-titled epic from 2006? I did not, but this does. For dubstep fans you are all ready all over this. For those wondered what Massive Attack would sound like in 2020? This is it. Nothing sounds this next-level, dark and beautiful. Burial delivers huge.
0399226907|5.0|This board book is smaller than the typical copy you might find (about 7x4\\"), but is otherwise just as cute. It is easy for babies and mommies to handle, and is practically babyproof with its wipeable surfaces and thick board pages.
B0002SROT0|5.0|There's something different about Elliott Smith's music and I think I figured out what it is.  Most songs on the radio have pretty simple tunes and I find I usually can start anticipating the tune and humming along the first time I hear it.  But with Elliott's songs I think the melodies are much more complex so they take a few listens to get used to.  But once you do, they are amazing!  Every album of his I've listened to so far has been the same story.  The first time through I feel underwhelmed--like I'm not sure what I just listened to.  After about the third time through I really start to catch on and then each subsequent listen just keeps getting better and better.  I love almost every song on this album now!  So for those of you who think you don't care much for his music, please give it a few listens before you make up your mind.  Maybe the reason he's not as popular as he should be is people don't take the time necessary to really absorb his music.  Elliott was a genius and I hope someday he'll get the recognition he deserves.
0689835604|4.0|This book is adorable, and perfect for moms and babies to handle. It is slightly larger than a typical board book, but not too big for little ones to get there hands around. However, there are flaps to lift to display hidden images that are of thinner material than the book itself, so there is the possibility of kids tearing the flaps if they are fidgeting with them. Otherwise, totally worthwhile.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I really expected an album that was going to just plain suck to be honest. I have never owned one Britney Spears CD in my life but after hearing Gimme More on the Radio for the past month or so I decided to pick up this CD. I was very impressed particularly with \\"Piece of Me\\" and I don't think she could have done a better job. She has transformed from soft late 90's pop to the hip-hop pop that is popular today in the same way that Justin Timberlake has. With this I realize that she does in fact have a chance to bounce back more than ever. I admit her personal choices are not the greatest, but for someone here for the music, the CD is amazing.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|I can't say this is not a CD full of great Van-songs but I am bothered (especially on the 3 disc import version of this CD) by his insistence on putting songs on that are not necessarily hits or favorites but carry the message of his born again self. They are preaching and unfair to include on a set that is supposed to be a \\"best of.\\" There would be nothing wrong with putting out a collection of these songs but then we would know what we were getting.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|Great movie. I bought it at best buy which was definetly the best choice cause the third disc is great. I always would prefer if the casing wasn't slime cases but no important.I love everything about the doc. band members talking about everything that made them what they are also the non members (eddie vedder awesome). I wish though that the clips from concerts they showed was the whole song . better than the kids are alright..... don't know.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is amazing. I never heard of Firefly when it was originally on. A friend showed me the first show on his computer he downloaded, and OMG awesome. I can't believe a show like this was canceled so quick. I'm still not sure what channel it was ever on. Amazing show tho. REALLY well done.
B000W07EKW|3.0|My review mostly relates to the 3rd installment, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum.\\" I rate that movie only one star. However, because this set includes the much better \\"Bourne Supremacy,\\" I'll average the rating out to three stars.    Bourne Ultimatum (movie #3) is similar to Bourne Identity (movie #1) in that it exists simply for the sake of the action. There's hardly any literary content at all. It's just a straightforward plot that moves the action along. It's like so many other action movies. Sure the production is impressive with explosions, stunts, car chases, fighting, etc, but as far as dialog, motivations, characters, plot twists, or anything else clever, that's all been carefully stripped out. That doesn't cut it for me and I rate this movie low. I like the Bourne Supremacy (movie #2) the best. That one has more story.     Other reviewers here agree with me on the above points, but I disagree with them on the excellence of the action. I don't think it's all that great as I'll explain below along with my low opinions on the lack of story. I agree with another reviewer here that my review on the literary merit of the movie is a waste of time. The movie is about action and that's it. Critiquing its literary merits is like critiquing the safeness of a motorcycle. It's simply not about that.     Anyway....   The girl in this movie hardly speaks at all. She just walks around looking dumb and worried. If the girl was paid by the line, they paid her about $50 for her \\"role.\\" Her close-ups become comical because repeatedly they cut to her, she looks worriedly into the camera, and then doesn't speak.     As many others have pointed out, the shaky camera work is annoying/nauseating/amateurish direction. I really hated it and it really did make me sick.     The story has a long, straightforward build up to an ultra-lame, straightforward conclusion, which makes me feel like I wasted my time. What's the big deal about his training anyway...you just need to train him as a sniper, which is no big deal, and then you're done. What Jason does is not that different than any other soldier, especially a sniper. Much more interesting was Bridget Fonda in \\"Point of No Return\\" and her cycle of training, initiation, and wanting out.     Again in the \\"unintentionally funny\\" department, we get comedy/spoof/\\"so bad it's funny\\" like running commentary:   \\"He's looking right at her!\\"   \\"He drove off the roof!\\"   As if we, the audience, couldn't see that he just drove off the roof. Actually this comedy material was some of the best fun this movie has to offer.     Jason takes the unneeded/indefensible risk of calling the CIA security down on him before he even cracks the safe. No trained burglar would do that. He just needed to hang up the phone as soon as the guy answered and said his name. And if cracking the safe was that easy the CIA wouldn't be using that safe. How did Jason know that the spook used his name as the safe voice password? He could have used any phrase. Ludicrous.     During the chase where the assassin chases the girl, Jason repeatedly jumps through the windows. Once is enough, twice is repetitious, thrice is an eye roll. He did it, like, six times. Severe lack of imagination on the part of the movie makers. Plus, that assassin must be a super blood hound to be able to track the girl from the street as she runs around on the rooftops.     Grade (for Bourne Ultimatum): Waste of time.
1594489505|4.0|This is the story of two women in Afghanistan and their intersecting lives. It seeks to capture a glimpse of what life for women was like there from the 1960s to the present. The glimpse isn't pretty. One reviewer expressed it this way: \\"Hosseini's depiction of Mariam and Laila's plight would seem cartoonishly crude if it were not, by all accounts, a sadly accurate version of what many Afghan women have experienced\\" [1].     As in [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]], Hosseini knows how to tell a compelling story. I couldn't put the book down and read it in about two days. I missed my subway stop on the way to work as I read, I read it while I walked down the street, it's a true page-turner. Also like The Kite Runner (but even more obviously so here), Hosseini brings the story full circle and ties up every loose end, leaving something of a contrived feeling.    That said, as the New York Times review put it, \\"Mr. Hosseini's instinctive storytelling skills...[mow] down the reader's objections through sheer momentum and will. He succeeds in making the emotional reality of Mariam and Laila's lives tangible to us, and by conjuring their day-to-day routines, he is able to give us a sense of what daily life was like in Kabul -- both before and during the harsh reign of the Taliban.... In the end it is these glimpses of daily life in Afghanistan -- a country known to most Americans only through news accounts of war and terrorism -- that make this novel, like `The Kite Runner,' so stirring, and that distract attention from its myriad flaws\\" [2].    I found the story to be just as compelling as The Kite Runner but the subject matter here was of even greater interest. Hosseini successfully gives a window on a place few Americans know much about and does so in the context of a compulsively engaging tale.    Note on content: the book has some war and domestic violence and a couple of sexual scenes. None of these are fun, but each plays an important role in demonstrating relationships in this society. I did not find them excessive (just real).    (For an interesting but in no way as engaging non-fiction account of family life in Afghanistan, read [[ASIN:0316159417 The Bookseller of Kabul]].)

B000V6I7WG|5.0|I don't want to ruin anything, but yes this movie is twisted. However, This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen, even though it's foreign. Quentin Tarintino cried when he saw this. So cmon, buy it! Bluray ftw!
B0007ZIYM4|5.0|This is a unique, clear and memorable rendition of the well-known \\"Four Seasons\\" Concertos as composed by Antonio Vivaldi.  The light, clear and harmonious presentation of these famous Concertos make this particular recording stand out.  There is a timeless and enduring feel to this recording.<br /><br />I have listened to many recordings of these Concertos and, in my opinion, this recording stands out distinctly from all others in a positive manner.<br /><br />I recommend this for everyone who enjoys the \\"Four Seasons\\".
B000Y44LBG|5.0|Well you've got a powerful lot of talent collaborating on this film and this time out it really pays off.  I don't think there's a better screenwriter than Steve Zaillian, who has an amazing range of superior work to his credit, and he comes through again, getting to the guts of a complex and morally ambiguous story. Putting this difficult work in the hands of an accomplished technician like Ridley Scott was likewise fortunate, for although Ridley's work is always slick and professional the foundations of some of his films have sometimes been a tad shallow. Here he has some real tough stuff to work with, and his craft enables a large story to be told well.  I can't find fault with either script or execution, and found this nearly 3 hour epic moved nimbly and was thoroughly engrossing as well as entertaining.    And then you get two heavyweights in the leads with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe doing fine work in what are essentially two different movies that tell parallel stories until their final convergence in the last third or so of the film.  And they are great stories of the cop and the gangster, paradoxical and ironic in their depiction of the two men's contrasting values and lives.  They are aided and abetted with strong performances in all the supporting roles.    Denzel's Frank Lucas is a charismatic, pragmatic, and ultimately ambiguous figure.  A man capable of anything in the name of business, in this instance the business of heroin trafficking in Harlem of the 60's and 70's. Trusting no one else, he brings his North Carolina family into this world, and his personal life is kept immaculate, natty, ordered and even loving.  He is by turns a cool and enigmatic charmer, and a wily and thoroughly ruthless and violent criminal.  Nobody can play that kind of character combining the steely gaze of the calculating manipulator with the suddenly disarming killer smile better than Denzel Washington and he is terrific.    Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts is an obsessively honest cop alienated within a New York police force of that era rife with corruption.  The flow of money and the moral ambiguity has reached the point where even the famous French Connection dope has been stolen out of impoundment and re-sold to the dealers.  Richie's personal life is a disaster when we first meet him, and his stubborn and rigorously solitary ways have alienated his wife as well as his cop peers.  A seemingly hopelessly stalled career as a cop is resuscitated when he is selected to lead his own hand-picked crew to specialize in going after big time dope dealers, a move that will eventually put him on a collision course with Denzel's Frank Lucas.  Crowe finds not only the ornery tenacity of a man who cannot compromise his principles, but also the difficulty of life around and with such an individual, and the price he pays for his rigor.    Fine work all around, beautifully filmed, with a vibrant and exciting pace and exceptionally fine story-telling in enabling the audience to follow these two diverse and complicated threads.  This film takes its place with the best of the genre, and there are echoes and recognition and respect paid to those great films like Goodfellows and most especially The French Connection.  This has some of that same gritty contrast of the scruffy cops versus the good-life criminals, and an inside look at the casual cruelty and violence that buys that \\"good life\\".  And there is a fine and ironic coda to the whole story that is a satisfying final comment on moral ambiguity.  Well worthwhile.
0385495323|5.0|\\"The Code Book\\" is a highly readable, engaging and informative book on cryptology (the science of code-making and code-breaking).  The book covers the evolution of secrecy across time and addresses the current state of this science.<br /><br />For those interested in codes in general, this is a staple book...highly recommended.
B000X3KZVI|5.0|I was at the 1st Adventures of Mimi concert she did in the U.S., which was in Miami, FL. I believe it was the only concert where she performed \\"Breakdown.\\" I was disappointed however, that she did not sing \\"Vision of Love\\" but it was still a great concert nontheless. The place was PACKED and the crowd was crazy over her. I enjoyed it so much, it definitely was a memory to cherish. I even purchased the limited edition canvas art they were selling, for almost $500, thats how much I love Mimi! I can't wait till her new album comes out in Feb, and I will definitely be in attendance at her next concert! BUY THE DVD YOU WILL LOVE IT!
0452284392|4.0|\\"Linked\\" provides a good overview of the nature and importance of networks.  As the world grows increasingly connected via the internet, the importance of networks as a topic has grown more visible in the public eye.<br /><br />Networks extend well beyond the internet...while the author discusses the internet extensively in this book, other types of networks are covered as well.  In fact, it is networks in general that are highlighted in this well-written and engaging book.<br /><br />Well worth a read for those with an interest in the nature and power of networks.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This documentary displays some of the most vivid landscapes and animals you will ever see. Watching it in HD makes a big difference, I would recommend this over the regular DVD anyday.
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins presents a compelling, and well-researched, set of thoughts and models in \\"Good to Great\\".  This is a book for more than just individuals engaged in \\"business\\"...it offers models that stimulate thought and highlight the importance of people in making the jump from simply good to just plain great.<br /><br />What I really like about this book is how the models and thoughts put forth are based upon evidence.  Evidence...and the statistics that often flow from such evidence...can be seen in a variety of ways, but Collins provides a clear presentation of how he and his team arrived at their conclusions.<br /><br />This is a book for those interested in a thorough set of thoughts and models on how to move from good to great.
0143038583|5.0|Mr. Pollan has written an important and relevant book. Read this, and you'll never have the same attitude about what you eat. As a nation, we have been sold a bill of goods on \\"industrial farming\\", so called. Mr. Pollan tracks the circuitous route of food from farm to plate---and that route will surprise many---it surprised me. ADM and Cargill provide cheap food, but at what cost? The national obesity epidemic can be related directly to \\"food\\" choices many make---most all of it based on corn.  This book convinced me to buy from local producers ONLY. It revealed that some big name \\"organic\\" producers are nothing but industrial producers cloaked as organic.   This is a seminal work and a must read.
B000B19BCG|5.0|This has become my favorite Supergrass CD.  It certainly has the best production values and clearly shows how the band has grown as musicians.  If you only know Supergrass from \\"I Should Coco\\" (great album), you wouldn't think it's the same band.  This is definitely more mellow than their previous releases, particularly St. Petersburg and Tales of Endurance, but the title track shows off a harder edge.  The collection has a certain mood to it - the kind of disc to listen to on a long drive at night or a lazy Sunday afternoon at home.  If you have the chance, see them live - I saw them play these songs before I got the album and they're better than ever.
B000UAE7RW|5.0|So, if you own the previous edition is it worth the double dip? Yes and no. If you're a casual fan, then no. If you're devotee of this masterpiece then I would say yes if only for the new transfer and extras.<br /><br />The original DVD had a decent transfer and a featurette that included interviews with Robert Evans, Roman Polanski, and Robert Towne. While only running 12 minutes, it was a pretty good trip down memory lane. These new extras bring back all three men and Jack Nicholson for brand new interviews. This new disc also has an improved transfer that is a noticeable improvement over the previous edition.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown: The Beginning and The End\\" is a 20-minute retrospective look at the genesis of the film with Evans, Nicholson, Polanski and Towne talking about how they got involved with the project. Towne talks about several things that inspired his script and how his friendship with Nicholson informed the character of Gittes.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown: Filming\\" is a 25-minute examination of the principal photography. Polanski says that Evans gave him complete creative freedom. However, they clashed over the look of the film. Evans wanted it to look like The Godfather films while Polanski wanted it to resemble a Raymond Chandler detective novel. All four men recount some fascinating filming anecdotes.<br /><br />\\"Chinatown: Legacy\\" is a ten-minute look at how the film was initially received by test audiences. Polanski realized that the film's music had to be changed and Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to compose a score in only nine days! The studio felt that the film was \\"too intellectual\\" and the critics loved it. Chinatown went on to be nominated for 11 Academy Awards but only won one for Towne's screenplay.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer.
0767836286|5.0|Arlington road is an excellent thriller. Suspens never stops until the very end that is just amazing.    After watching Arlington Road you might think differently about this quotation :  \\"Freedom is just a hallucination created by a pathological lack of paranoia.\\"    Anyway, without any hesitation I give 5 stars to this excellent movie.
B000002P6R|2.0|At the time (1981), the Who could have delivered a good hard rock album, but missed the opportunity to show that they were still a force to be reckoned with in the studio. The songs were from Townshend's last good songwriting period (i.e. - \\"Empty Glass\\"), but the arrangements were too light [i.e. - weak]. They seem more appropriate for an early 80's Genesis album rather than a Who album.      I remember being glad they were still touring and making music in the early 80s, but looking back now, I wish they had called it quits after Moon died. \\"Who Are You\\" and \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" would have been respectable final statements for the band. At least better than this album and the one after it.
0783222149|4.0|Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon put the \\"wild\\" in Curtis Hanson's 'The River Wild\\".The plot is terribly formulaic,but it is the depth of the acting that takes this fodder and turns it into something exciting and nail-biting.Streep and Bacon go head to head down the river gorge locking wits and butting brains with enough action/adventure shots and a riveting Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack to keep one's attention and heart racing.This film is to be enjoyed for it's outstanding cinematography,smart editing, but not for some of the corny story lines that are presented.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|. . . they released the original song order for this album. It only took 23 years, but it was worth the wait. I remember this when it was first released. I was immediately drawn-in by the melding of an orchestra with the standard rock elements. Gilmour's solos are some of the best he's done, but there are far too few of them. As much as I am tired of hearing him say that Waters was doing it all wrong back then, I agree that some of these songs could have used more input from the rest of the band. But hey, they weren't exactly writing anything better (ex - \\"About Face\\").     Gilmour should be grateful he had Waters to provide some depth of concept to the Floyd's work. Otherwise, we would have ended up with several \\"Division Bell\\" albums instead of \\"Dark Side\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\",  \\"Animals\\", and \\"The Wall\\". Waters may have been a lot of things, but he was good at what he did [i.e. - lead].
B00006G8G1|5.0|If you even remotely like Iron Maiden, you have to own this.  I've had it for a few weeks now and I cannot stop watching it.  This is Maiden at their best, in front of 250,000 hard-core fans.  Buy it; you will not be disappointed.
B000002P2W|4.0|Daltrey's voice at it's peak. I wonder why they never played Slip Kid live? A great song, with all the Who elements on display. \\"Success Story\\" still gives me a headache when I hear it. Something about the melody sounds grating, almost out of tune. Who fans must have been confused when this came out and there were no synthesizers on it, especially after \\"Quadrophenia\\".
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Wow. That's what I thought when I finished listening to the CD. I've liked Britney since I was in the 8th grade, when \\"..Baby One More Time\\" came out. I bought the album the second day that it was out, and soon stocked up on her singles and imports. I was delighted when \\"Oops\\" came out. I liked it a lot. By the time her third album came out, I had lost interest, mainly because I was caught up in high school sports and homework, it wasn't that I didn't like Britney anymore. I bought \\"In the Zone\\" when it came out in 2003, and had renewed interest. \\"Blackout\\" is the first Britney album since Zone that I bought, and all I can say is... wow. The critics were right. It really is good. While I will admit that I agree with people say that there's a lot of tweaking, I don't care. I'm not listening to the CD for her deep songwriting skills or how she can shred a guitar; I'm listening to it because I like the songs, period. Melody, beat.. some good songs to dance to. My favorites on the album are \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Heaven on Earth\\". It's one of those CDs where you can listen to it through and through, not have to skip through any crappy songs or god-awful interludes (why do they do that!?!?!!!) My point is, that this CD is awesome. I've had it for two days and have nearly every song memorized. I've been playing it non-stop in the office. Get it!

0618680004|5.0|For the past few days this has been my night-time reading.  I've slept like a baby; reassured that there are at least some articulate, rational skeptics in a world.      I applaud the likes of Dawkins and Pinker to straddle the line between science & politics.      I did not find Dawkins' self-confident style annoying though I suspect that others will.  Whatever you believe, I have to believe that this book makes a significant contribution to a healthy debate in a pluralist society.
B000I2JKC4|5.0|I cannot explain why we still laugh at this movie after having watched it every Christmas Eve for the past 17 years, but we do.      Nothing beats Cousin Eddie drinking punch in his special outfit, Clark trying to get those lights to work, or the lovely gift Aunt Bethany brings to Christmas dinner.    You'll have Bing Crosby's \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" in your stuck in your head after watching \\"Christmas Vacation,\\" but that's okay because you'll still have a smile on your face.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen's music for years, so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but I think his current CD, \\"Magic\\" is a must-have for anyone whether you are a fan of Bruce Springsteen or not.  We just went to see him in St.Paul, Minnesota which really puts a lot of life into the words of his songs.  Buy and enjoy!!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My wife and I throughly enjoyed this movie.  While the movie does not have the detail included in the book, we felt the screenplay was written in such a way as to provide enough detail without boring the viewer.  You get sufficient insight into Jane's childhood to have the rest of the movie work well.  This version of Jane Eyre has the best acting, lighting, camera work, and costuming of all the versions we have watched.
B000TSIK14|5.0|This album is classic Scorpions, with a new edge to it.  The songs range from love to political, overall creating a great album!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Having Timothy Dalton's Rochester imprinted on my mind, I couldn't imagine another Rochester. I'd read the book a dozen times and always thought Dalton played the character perfectly UNTIL I watched this latest version.    I was initially troubled by the fact that this new Rochester came across as funny, talkative, flirtatious, passionate, vulnerable, dependent and all the things Rochester wasn't supposed to be. Or so I always thought.    And so I read the book again, many years since the last time. To my surprise, I discovered that he IS all that as well as enigmatic, brusque, morally challenged and depressing. Perhaps earlier I'd been overwhelmed by his darker qualities so much that I failed to see the other side of him. And perhaps, Timothy Dalton had portayed such aloofness, he branded Mr Rochester so decidedly.    Toby Stephens did such a fantastic job at bringing out all these qualities of Rochester in just 4 episodes. Had the script been plucked out of the book verbatim then we'd have had another 4 episodes and Rochester would have talked, begged and seduced endlessly. When I watched the Dalton version again, it was like watching a stage production although it didn't seem so before. This latest version was so beautifully done. And of course, the fact that Stephens looked so good in that hair and outfit helped the cause!    Ruth Wilson was the perfect Jane Eyre. Feisty, independent, strong, morally good and truly needed to love. She convincingly spoke her mind just as Jane does in the book. Other actresses in past film versions did not do nearly as well. Jane was always portrayed as meek, which made Rochester seem even more domineering. Jane is in fact someone Rochester is always debating with and whose company and counsel he relies on, so meek Jane is not. She is after all his equal in their eyes. Perfect casting for our Ms Eyre.    I'm not too bothered with certain interpretations that changed some scenes. I felt they worked within the context. For instancethe scene after the near wedding, it was a long one in the book and would have run too long in the film. Shortened, it showed a truly desperate Rochester, a very weak Jane with inner conflicts that she couldn't trust. It was the most passionate scene in the book. Kindness, love, anger, threat of violence, sadness, desperation, seduction and despair were all in that one scene. A little liberty in delivery didn't change the substance.    For the rest, they could've showed a little more of her childhood as it was those formative years that had built her character and personality which in turn shaped her life. And i wish they could have included the scene where he'd picked a flower for her the morning after she'd stayed up all night to look after the injured brother-in-law. This was one of the tell-tale signs missing from the film. These and the \\"flood\\" remark as he was rudely awakened by Jane. That was just funny.    Overall, I was most gratified, loved it so much I bought the UK version too for all the goodies that came with it.

0743487486|3.0|I think Alfie Kohn has done a tremendous amount of research and offers great ideas and much for parents to think about. However, I think he'd have a lot more success getting his ideas across and converting people to \\"unconditional parenting\\" behaviour if he toned down some of the sarcasm and condescension.  I felt as though Mr. Kohn wrote this book with the wrong audience in mind. It seemed his imagined audience consisted mainly of parents who have already adopted and agree with the unconditional parenting concepts. Instead, he should have more clearly kept in mind the parent who knows and has been using more \\"traditional\\" parenting techniques - people he hopes to convert to \\"unconditional parenting\\".  For example, on pg. 155, Mr. Kohn writes \\"At first, it can feel weird to hold back when you're used to offering these constant evaluations. (\\"Good drawing!\\" \\"Good drinking!\\" \\"Good drooling!\\")\\"  \\"Good drooling!\\"??? See, that feels to me like he thinks parents who haven't adopted his methods of unconditional parenting are so off-course that they actually praise their child's drooling. There are gems like this scattered throughout the book. It made it quite off-putting to read at times, and that much more difficult to remain open-minded to the otherwise good ideas he's relating.  So, to summarize, \\"Unconditional Parenting\\" has a lot of good ideas. It will make you think, evaluate how you are parenting and how you were parented as a child. You just have to set your ego aside and mentally edit out the condescension when it arises.
0240808452|5.0|I wanted to express my excitement for this book, this is the holy bible of figure drawing in my opinion, or for anyone who creates art for fun or for a living. I was inspired to write a review on this book, as I'm reading it for the third time.     There are so many horrible art books out there, such as the type that don't feed you ideas, inspiration, and build passion. This book does just that! FORCE is well written and it doesn't have that dated feeling that most art books have. The style described in this book is very applicable to cutting edge comics, cartoons, and design in general.     You get the sense that the author understands mental blocks and the visual comprehension that artists need to understand something. The book is full of visual examples that mesh together with the text seamlessly. Many art books are dribble and the correlation between text and visuals is a mess. You also wont find any filler information to add weight to the book, every page is full of worthy information that needs to be understood.    In essence FORCE will give you mental awareness of your subject and clarification to decisions you make when using your pencil. If you ever have found yourself wondering why your drawings aren't interesting enough or more importantly you can't break into the next level of your talents, this book will do that as well.
B00005JPLW|5.0|In my opinion, anything with Gerard Butler is worth watching but this is a great one. Husband likes it for the fight scenes and brief nudity. You know what I like it for.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|The album as a whole is something to be marvelled at. It is truly awesome, in every sense of the word. \\"Glosoli\\" might be my favorite Sigur song to date, and that is saying alot.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|The album \\"Magic\\" is a nice return to the more rock oriented songs that Bruce and the E Street Band rode to mass market appeal. It is not another \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Darkness\\", but so what? It is a collection of well written, well played, beautifully produced songs by one of the true legends of rock'n roll. The \\"hidden track\\" might be my favorite song on the album. \\"Magic\\" is a great addition to the Springsteen catalog. If you are a Bruce fan, you will not be disappointed. The more I listen, the more I like it.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|Called the \\"Season of Secrets\\" by the producers of the series, NCIS SEASON 4 actually turned out much more complicated than most of the actors, writers, directors, and fans wanted it to be.  For the first time, the series sought to build ongoing storylines that would elevate NCIS to a soap opera level that wasn't much appreciated.<br /><br />The season was too busy.  Too much plotting demanded watching every episode in sequence rather than casually dropping in for entertainment.  Even with devoted attendance instead of a casual approach, these extended storylines took far too long to develop.<br /><br />I got irritated and impatient with all the split plotlines and romances.  When I watch the crimes shows I keep up with, I depend on them to be entertaining and intriguing, but not to the point that I have to keep notes.  I didn't watch HEROES in its first season run for this very reason, and it's also why I abdicate 24.  I picked those shows up in DVD and squander weekends of marathon viewing on them.<br /><br />I watched episodes throughout season 4 of NCIS and enjoyed them on one hand, but I had some definite problems with them on the other.  It is somewhat better being able to sit down and watch them in sequence and fairly close together.  But the fact that the season ended on a cliffhanger is also disappointing.  Thankfully, season 5 returns to how the episodes were initially done.<br /><br />I don't mind the two- or three-episode arcs, but I want to be casually entertained, and not driven to fanaticism or desperation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, series creator and television guru Donald P. Bellisario is no longer attached to the series.  Mark Harmon and many others stood against Bellisario and basically took the show over.  Since NCIS is a hit and can't survive without the actors and actresses (who were being forced into 16-hours days much of the time, according to reports), their wants were attended to first.<br /><br />Mark Harmon stars as the abrasive and canny team leader, Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  Michael Weatherly plays fan-favorite Anthony DiNozzo, whose love of movies constantly shows in his reference throughout the series.  David McCallum portrays the team's forensic examiner, Dr. Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard.  Pauley Perrette stars as the wickedly wonderful and super-smart Abby Sciuto.  Sean Murray (Bellisario's real-life stepson) plays Timothy McGee.  Cote de Pablo plays ex-Israeli Mossad agent Ziva David.  Lauren Holly stars as the NCIS director, Jenny Shepard.<br /><br />The thing that I most love about the series is the characters.  They're all real to me, and the actors deliver a constant presentation of them.  I've never seen a false move.  Mark Harmon continues to amaze me.  I actually met him on the Fox Studios lot at one time, and he's just as generous in person as he is on the screen.  Truly great guy.<br /><br />But the other reasons to watch the show are the intriguing mysteries, consummate action, and a pace that is almost frenetic from beginning to end.  Tune in to an episode and you're going to get the same kind of investigative goodness fans of the show demand.<br /><br />As usual, the season begins by picking up the pieces of the cliffhanger from the season before.  At the end of the third season, Gibbs had quit the NCIS after a terrorist attack he warned them about went unheeded.<br />\\"Shalom\\" puts Ziva on the run after she's framed for murdering a high ranking government employee.  At this point Tony is in charge of the team.  They have to get Gibbs back, though, and the story wraps satisfactorily in \\"Escaped.\\"<br /><br />Cutting edge technology gets featured in \\"Singled Out,\\" and the subject matter involving a kidnapped Navy computer specialist allows McGee and Abby to thrive in their element while driving Gibbs crazy with their techno-babble.  Mike Franks, Gibbs's NCIS mentor, returns to the series in \\"Faking It\\" and fans get more background on what Gibbs was like when he was first starting out.  \\"Dead and Unburied\\" is a nifty little mystery.<br /><br />The pace picks up again with \\"Witch Hunt,\\" the series' first Halloween episode.  Some of the lines and the situations Gibbs and his team delivered and found themselves in left me laughing so hard I thought I was going to die.  This episode alone is priceless.  \\"Sandblast\\" brings Gibbs and Lt. Colonel Hollis Mann, Gibbs's present girlfriend, together on a case again, and it's always fun to watch these two work through things.  In a later episode, \\"Sharif Returns,\\" they get to finish the work they start here.<br /><br />\\"Once a Hero\\" centers on a decorated Marine, and fans of the show know that anything involving Marines is one of Gibbs's red flags.  He'll stop at nothing to do what he needs to do to take care of those people.  \\"Twisted Sister\\" brings McGee into conflict with himself over the NCIS and his sister.  \\"Smoked\\" puts Gibbs together with FBI agent Fornell in a search for a serial killer.  As fans know, there's a lot of history between Gibbs and Fornell, and not all of it is good.<br /><br />Science comes to the forefront again in \\"Driven,\\" and McGee and Abby are in artificial intelligence heaven as they try to figure out how a murder was done.  The murder of a Marine puts Gibbs at odds with a county sheriff in \\"Suspicion.\\"  Ducky moves into the spotlight in \\"Blowback\\" when he has to go undercover in a high-tech black market ring.  \\"Friends and Lovers\\" showcases a murder that turns intriguing, but it's Tony's undercover work that gets the lion's share of the attention.<br /><br />\\"Dead Man Walking\\" is a tug at the heartstrings as Ziva becomes involved with a dying Navy lieutenant.  This episode was almost too predictable, but still watchable.  \\"Skeletons\\" is the search for yet another serial killer (there are a lot of these in police shows of late).  \\"Iceman\\" is a straightforward mystery with the twist of the \\"dead\\" man coming back to life long enough to point in the direction of his murderer.<br /><br />\\"Grace Period\\" involves Special Agent Paula Cassidy, who's been something of a recurring character, in a terrorist chase.  \\"Cover Story\\" reveals that McGee is working on a new book (he writes fiction and his first book was a bestseller that allowed him to buy a sports car as well as other boy toys) and the murderer appears to be following some of his script.  \\"Brothers In Arms\\" advances one of the many subplots of the season when Jenny Shepard starts digging into her spy father's secrets.<br />\\"In The Dark\\" is a straightforward mystery again, but it's got some neat characterizations and twists.  \\"Trojan Horse\\" has a plot that reflects the title, and this one gets a little too convoluted.  \\"Angel of Death\\" brings in Shepard's father's past in a big way, and it sets up the season's cliffhanger.<br /><br />NCIS SEASON 4 is a must-buy for fans of the show who collect the episodes.  But it's a great place for viewers new to the show to begin.  With four years under its belt, NCIS has a lot of history, but you can catch up quickly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Season 4, even with all the complexity and one-hand-not-knowing-what-the-other-hand-is-doing machinations, but I'm glad Season 5 is returning to the standalone episodes and no ongoing plotlines.  These characters are some of the best on television, and the writers are really good.the series' first Halloween episode.

B000UVT3OI|5.0|I just bought this for 11.88 , has his best hits ever plus more than a memory ( great song ) plus it has 33 music video's . I cant think of anything that would make this a better deal. well worth the money!
B000059Z8J|5.0|I have seen Superman in all of its wonderful incarnations going back to the 1950's television series starring George Reeves, who for most of us back then, was the man of steel, until the year 1978.  I was in high school then, but could not wait to see Superman transformed onto the \\"Big Screen.\\"  I later toured Universal Studios to see how they made Superman fly - an amazing effect back then using a flat table, a wind machine and some carefully and strategic flying footage along with blue screen effect. A great film to see again and again...for which to date, I have seen at least a dozen times but never tire of seeing Christopher Reeves as the great man of steel, representing all that's good in man and mankind alike.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|Now I've gotten my friends and family hooked on this too. The first few eps are so-so, but after that they're almost all winners. It really has everything female fans could want: lots of action, two hot dudes, strong emotional plots. I'm not sure if it would be as entertaining for guys. Guess you could get more into the horror plots. Speaking of which, yes, it is scary. But I don't like horror movies, and I do like it. And a lot of episodes, especially those related to the larger plot arc, have less of a horror feel.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I can't believe that Ioan Gruffudd is not listed in the cast!  He brought the whole movie to life and was in just about every scene.  For those who have only seen him in Fantastic Four movies, this is a chance to see that he is far more than a cartoon superhero.  His Horatio Hornblower series character was kind of a swashbuckling 'superhero' too.  But in Amazing Grace we get to see another side of him.  He is the perfect Wilburforce.  He perseveres, he suffers, he wrecks his health, but he never stops believing that this inhumanity perpetrated by slavery must end.  All the casting is spot-on and makes you want to find other movies that these actors are in, to get to see more of them.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I don't care if you disagree with Gore's politics. I don't care if you hate him with a visceral and irrational passion. Do your grandkids a favor and watch this (or read the book) while pretending that you never heard of the 2000 election or the Clinton presidency. Just try to be objective for two hours.     Follow up the footnotes/endnotes. Look at the science and realize that it IS science, that the disagreements that are natural in science don't mess up the basic premise -- that the thin skin of air around this planet is getting really icky, and we've got a big bar bill to reckon up. And please realize that when two scientists disagree, that's a good thing, it's part of the process. When thousands of them agree and a couple dozen disagree, that's usually politics and that's not so good.     It's an excellent movie. It's not shrill, it's not a harangue, and it's pretty hopeful. We can fix this... we just have to get up and do it.

B00001PE4D|4.0|For a movie on a really tight budget, using (at the time) B list talent, this one's done well. Les Liaisons Dangereuse is the precursor text, and updating it to late 20th century Manhattan does not damage the story at all -- the societies (pre-Revolutionary France and modern urban-extravagant culture) are eerily similar.     The production values are high, the talent is well cast and works well within their roles, and the script is pretty solid. For a teen targeted puff piece of film, this one turned out to attract the attention of others.
0525950079|5.0|By far the best book i've read in a long, long time.  Wish I could find more books in similar genre.  Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke is one book you may like if you like this one and of course Pillars of the Earth was fantastic too.
B000059H98|4.0|There is no social redemption in Tank Girl. This movie will not make you a better person, it won't make you think, and you won't wake up two days later suddenly gifted with a deep and philosophical insight. But that's okay.     It's goofy. It's silly. It's not exactly high art. But sometimes you just want a movie where stuff explodes, bad guys and girls get their comeuppance, and kangaroos quote Kerouac and LA cops.
0805079831|5.0|Witnessing the arrogance of Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz, you had wonder where they got their certitude in the face of human suffering. In \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" Naomi Klein makes it clear: Studying with Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago, they were converted, absolutely, to the idea of free market capitalism. And these were only two of the Chicago Boys who spread mischief around the world. No pain, no gain as far as economies are concerned. The locals need to go on a budget while multinational corporations buy up the nation's assets, from hotels to public utilities. And, yes, according to Klein, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank, founded after World War II to restore wartorn economies, are in cahoots now to corporatize the world.    This book helped me make sense of the world we live in now. I read it over a couple of weeks because much of Klein's reporting (and she's an excellent journalist) was so dispiriting. She draws a web of commonalities between the Southern Cone of Latin America, Asia, the former Soviet Union and the Middle East and the debacle that resulted from Katrina, and it's a convincing argument. Time and again, she shows how corporatists have swooped in when an economy was hit with political and/or natural disaster.    Which is not to say that she's politically partisan about the United States. After throroughly excoriating the way the Iraq war was privitized and New Orleans' poor cheated and abandoned, she takes a few swipes at Bill Clinton for his insistence on free trade policies toward Asia's Tigers (remember when they were thriving?). Jeffrey Sachs, the economist who claims we can end poverty, was Harvard, not Chicago, and Klein is highly critical of his dealings in post-Soviet Russia.     I read this book with a highlighter, because there was so much I wanted to revisit. Other reviewers have claimed Klein is a conspiracy theorist, but I disagree. Her argument is not so much about collusion as it is about blind ideology. Free markets are good for us, say their proponents, although Klein produces much evidence is the contrary. Like any theorist, she conveniently ignores things that don't fit her model, i.e. the violence in Latin America that leftists too often rationalize. She's highly optimistic about current attempts in that region to marry democracy with a return to a mixed economy, rich with cooperatives.    As with any ground-breaking work, it's difficult to sum up this book. I missed Klein'd earlier book on branding, and I have every attention of reading it. In the meantime, I urge you to spend some time with \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\" Wherever you are, Milton Friedman, someone's out to get you.

B000UVT3OI|5.0|You have to really admire Garth's marketing skills.  This retirement thing is like he is just baiting the hook and we are the fish.  I don't mind either because the route that country music has taken is a turn for the worse.  Although there is some talent out there, they are just Nashville's puppets.  This latest ultimate hits package from Garth is awesome! You get over 2 hours of music and then another 2 hours of videos for a very reasonable price.  Also you get all of the lyrics to the songs, like we didn't know them already right? For the women, they can admire the many pictures of Garth inside.  2 CD's and 1 DVD for under $13.00.  Maybe if some other record labels would try this they would sell more CD's rather than people just stealing or buying just the songs that they want to hear off of the internet.  Keep up the good work Garth and I guarantee that when you do release a new studio album it will explode off of the shelves, but then you know this right?
B000OQF6N6|4.0|All I'm hearing about this album is Billy wanted money.  I don't know how many of you are true pumpkins fans, but i'm pretty sure they released a cd for free online to screw their record company Machina II ring any bells?    Billy is and always be the pumpkins so it sounds no different.  He did all the instruments for Siamese dreams which many argue is their best cd.  To stop the rambling though the cd is pretty good.  Yes, it is very different than prior works but still good in its own way.  I just recently saw the new lineup in concert and was impressed with the new material live.  Doomsday Clock, Thats the way my love is Tarantula and a couple more all sounded really good.  I recommend this cd if you a true fan and are willing to take it for what it is and not expect Melon collie and the infinite sadness or adore.
B000P2A256|5.0|yes, yes, i know the debut was better but i love this album........it's fresh and has a good mix of lyrical moods and a wide spectra of tempos. it's not a love at first listen album but it's a cult classic after a few. i think we need to accept that debuts come after 10 years of drafts and sophmore material is always playing catch up. i feel my money was well spent on this album.....it's a real keeper.
0553213105|5.0|Amended review (2015):<br /><br />I loved this book so much more the second time around.  Perhaps it is because I have become familiar with the film, but I was better able to appreciate  Austenâ€™s nuances and humor.  As before, Mrs. B and Lydia annoyed me to no end, but I found more hilarity in Mr. Collins, appreciation for Mr. Bennett, and disdain for Miss Bingley.  Iâ€™m so thrilled I read it again to as I now value this wonderful novel and can consider it a favorite.<br /><br />Original review (2007):<br /><br />I remember liking Sense and Sensibility in college, but I struggled through this one a bit.  It took me about half the book just to get used to the language, but once I did, it was mildly enjoyable.  The Bennet family drove me a little crazy, especially Mrs. Bennet and Lydia.  But I loved the evolution of Lizzy's feelings for Darcy and the conclusion of the &#34;happily ever after&#34; marriages.  I don't think I'm up for the challenge of Jane Austen again any time soon, but I'm glad I read this classic.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This animated adventure is a joy to watch for ANY age, and is sure to become a family favorite in your collection.<br /><br />How most animated films have a moral to thier story, this one is no different.<br />It is about a small rat with big dreams. He wants to become a Chef, and we get to follow him about in Paris as he sets out to pursue his dream.<br /><br />Being a Disney film, of course the artwork is flawless, in all of it's tiny detail, beautiful colors, and crystal clairity.<br />Your kids, (and YOU) will really enjoy this. The story is funny,cute, and it carries a great message of not giving up no matter how impossible your goals seem.<br /><br />This is sure to become a classic.
B00011RPB0|1.0|To cut to the chase, why wasn't the script written so Bill Murray was single, and Scarlett Johansson's husband was cheating on her, and the two fell in love?  This could have been a terrific love story.  On a side note, (A) Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson had chemistry, (B) the directing was very good, and (C) Scarlett Johansson is very beautiful and a wonderful actress.
B000URDEB0|4.0|I have to say that I didn't know much about Nightwish until recently, and I purchased Once a few months ago.  I really liked that album alot, and since I was going to see them in SF on November 2nd I went ahead and purchased their latest album as well.  O.K.; I know about the whole Tarja thing and how disappointing it was that she left, and when I compared the 2 albums I think I would have preferred the Tarja Nightwish, but let me tell you seeing them live has really changed my opinion!  They were extremely tight with the new singer and the music had focus and energy. The few \\"Tarja\\" songs that I recognized them playing had as much drive and energy as the originals;  I noticed no \\"falling flat\\" on the part of the new singer here.  In short I got a real kick out of seeing them live and I think people should give the new singer a chance.  I looked around at the crowd and did not see a single person who was the slightest bit bumming out on the \\"new\\" Nightwish.  To the contrary, they seemed to know each of the new songs by heart and were loving every second of it. Annette and the rest of the band were clearly having a great time and good rappor and it spilled out of their music.  Enjoyable live show and I highly recommend them.  I am going to give a more careful listen of the new album now.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Somewhere in the South of France, in a time not too distant from the present (in this film based on a book by Peter Mayle), an orphaned English lad (spiritedly portrayed by Freddie Highmore)and his wine-growing Uncle Henry(Albert Finney)share a special time at Henry's rustic cottage. It is here where young Max Skinner is given life lessons from  his Uncle, and he thrives in this environment.   Years later, we see a grown-up Max(Russell Crowe), a cold and ruthless stock market trader with an aggressive employee(Rafe Spall) trying to take his place, an elegantly comical secretary of Indian extraction named Gemma(Archie Panjabi), and a James-Bond-like wittiness and sophistication.    On the day Max Skinner becomes the toast of the London Stock Exchange, he receives word of Henry's death.    We are given glimpses of Max's life when he dines at a local restaurant--the women he's scored with, and the friend and advisor Charlie Willis(Tom Hollander) who wonders why he is less contemplative of Henry's loss, and more focused on his stock market victory.   Soon, he is off to France to return to the estate, La Siroque, for the first time since childhood with the intention of selling the property and hurrying back to London. But fate will soon intervene in unexpected ways.   Throughout the film, there are flashbacks of Max's time with his uncle, which will provide insight about the man Max is to become.   He proves to be a rather tempestuous guest in someone else's country, taunting the Tour de France trainees by whom he drives past by hollering Lance Armstrong's name as he gives them an obscene gesture.   He finds the property to be dilapidated, and the wine undrinkable, but schemes with Charlie to make the property appear marketable.   There are amusing scenes of Gemma paging her boss on his blackberry to his annoyance, and Crowe shows a little talent for physical comedy when a local waitress with the apt name of Fanny Chenal(Marion Cotillard), settles a score with him after he runs her off the road while she is on her bicycle.   But there is nothing in this alleged comedy that makes one laugh out loud. The puns are merely eyebrow cocking and smirk provoking, and I felt there was something about Max's being zapped in the pool scene that was a bit too contrived.   There are scenes of Max trying on his uncle's clothes, leading at one point to the obligatory cinematographic exploitation of the power and beauty of Crowe's glowing and fabulously rippling biceps.   The resident vigneron, Francis Duflot(Didion Bourdon), whom Max has known since childhood, is dismayed by Max's decision to sell La Siroque, and has periodic hostile confrontations with him. Duflot's sunny, effervescent wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier) serves as housekeeper, cook, and scorpion exterminator, and cannot hide her enthusiasm in seeing Max again. One moment I found particularly intriguing was the scene of her dancing to Henry's vinyl record featuring the song, \\"Wedding Samba\\" because my mother has played this tune frequently on the piano. The inclusion of this song in the film has been a pleasant surprise.   Amid the lovliness of the French countryside, a new issue arises. A young Californian woman named Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish) arrives at the estate claiming to be the out-of-wedlock daughter Henry never met.   The spitefully competitive Max tries to find a legal way to discredit Christie and her claim to the estate, and even ruins a lovely evening dinner at the Duflots with his inebriated announcement of his suspicions.But a poignant scene emerges when Max expresses regret over never telling Henry he had loved him. The dewy look flooding Crowe's aquamarine eyes at that moment says it all.   Back in London, suspension over illegal trading prolongs Max's time away from his job, and makes it a little easier for him to make some crucial life-altering decisions as he pursues Fanny.   The plot line is fairly predictable, featuring the fulfillment of Max's desirefor a tumble in the sack with Fanny, and the scene of his meeting with his boss, Sir Nigel (Kenneth Crahan), and the flashback of Max's childhood encounter with young Fanny(an already stunningly exotic Marine Casto, in a moment that ultimately proves the adage, \\"A man chases a girl until she catches him\\")help tie the story together. Max finds evidence to corroborate Christie's claim, and he pursues the things and people that he has learned to value most after nearly losing them. While Charlie Willis predicts Max's eventually becoming bored with life at the estate, the Provence sun shines favorably on our hero as we bid him au revoir.
B000ROALCG|5.0|Just saw the film and plan to buy the CD - the music was just super and loved Anthony's singing, acting and he should get an award for his portrayal of Levoe. It was such a surprise to see his interpretation of this role and acting abilities. J. Lo was great as always. She's a wonderful actress in anything she does. Would rate the film a 10 is I could but only allowed 5 stars here.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's \\"Babel\\" wrenches the viewer through a dizzying number of subplots all set in motion by a single act:  a gift of a hunting rifle by a Japanese businessman to his Moroccan hunting guide.  The common links between these various stories are (a) people do not listen to each other, and (b) our refusal to listen causes much of the pain in the world.    This a true ensemble piece, and even though big-name stars like Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett appear in the film, they do not dominate the story.  They do form a critical core for the film.  Pitt and Blanchett are married Californians on a bus trip across Morocco's sunblasted mountains, hoping to find some normalcy in a strained marriage.  At the movie's outset, they have not yet been successful.    On a parallel track, the hunting guide decides to sell the rifle he received from the businessman to a friend who needs the gun to protect his goat herds from jackals.  The friend has two young boys who tend the flock, and thanks to boys being boys, they end up taking shots at a tour bus as it drives by - not out of malice, but just to see if the bullets will go as far as advertised.    Unfortunately, one of the bullet strikes Blanchett in the shoulder, and she is bleeding profusely.  Pitt must struggle to save his wife's life miles from any hospital and in a land where few speak English and a Band-Aid is the high water mark of medical care.      Here is where Inarritu's theme of not listening takes off.  American authorities instantly proclaim the shooting as a terrorist attack.  This angers the Moroccans, who won't allow a helicopter in to rescue Blanchett.  A diplomatic standoff ensues.    At the same time, the Californians' nanny takes their two children - whom she loves and has raised as her own - to Mexico to attend her daughter's wedding.  She has begged for someone to watch the kids, but nobody helps her.  After the wedding, her drunken nephew refuses her admonitions to be careful when drivingacross the border, and an argument ensues with a border guard.  This argument involves a lot of shouting and impulsive action, but at the end the nanny and the two kids end up stranded in the merciless desert.    And finally, there is a very tough subplot involving the daughter of the Japanese businessman, who not only must struggle with being a teenager, but she is also a deaf-mute in a land that is not always that forgiving of medical impediments.      This is a movie that lacks a true villain, but the absence of a villain does not mean there are no victims and there is no suffering.  Indeed, \\"Babel\\" is one of the most painful movies I've ever had to watch.  Do not look for simple answers or tidy little summaries of all the subplots.  This is a difficult, wrenching film.    Many have compared this movie to \\"Syriana,\\" which also involved a convoluted plot and largely took place in the Middle East.  Do not confuse these two movies.  \\"Syriana\\" is a political tale.  \\"Babel\\" cares not a whit for politics except in the limited sense that our politics can serve as yet another layer of prejudice, a barrier to our understanding of our fellow man.  Inarritu's film says that we cannot forget that while we are talking about our own fears and prejudices, other people may be dying in front of us.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Easily one of the best revenge stories around.  And part of the Chan Wook Park Veangeance trilogy -- the most popular of the three in the trilogy and arguably the best (although Lady Vengeance gives it a run for its money).    About a man imprisoned for several years given freedom and little else.  He awakens with his life more or less ruined: a wife murdered and a child in foster care... but he's free, at least, right?    What is a man to do after that?  A bit of the old ultra... Vengeance, of course.  Throughout the movie he does whatever he can to figure out why he was and who imprisoned him -- Full of twists and satisfaction throughout.    If you can stand subtitles and enjoy a good bit of deserved vengeance then I'd say Oldboy is required watching.  It's definitely on it's way to becoming a classic in modern cinema.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Its ironic that I've only liked Penelope Cruz in Pedro Almodovar's movies. She has been there in so many of his films, even in his more obscure ones (\\"Live Flesh\\", for instance). However, this is his first film in which she plays the full-fledged leading  lady, and noticeably scored an Oscar Nomination for Best Actress.<br /><br />As in all Almodovar films, the subject matter is often controversial, but very realistic. Unlike more adventurous and whimsical films of his past (remember \\"Kika\\" and its unbelievable plot?), Almodovar chooses a more direct approach here - a natural progression from his stellar work on \\"Talk to Her\\". That said, this is definitely the most accessible Almodovar film, coming as it does after his child-abuse masterpiece \\"Bad Education\\".<br /><br />Penelope as Raimunda is a woman of many shades and colors. The bright hues of Spain saturate the DVD, and there are many standout sequences, especially when Raimunda works in the restaurant. Like everyone else, I was overwhelmed by Cruz's moving song  (while her mother secretly watches), but then quickly discovered that Cruz didn't sing this song at all! Needless to say, I downloaded the soundtrack anyway.<br /><br />Yes, this is about a family of sisters, and its amazing that Pedro understands women far more than men. In films where there is more of a male protagonist (such as \\"Matador\\" or even \\"Live Flesh\\"), I find that his characters become larger than life and rather dazed and confused. Here, since the entire star cast is women, the characters are very precisely etched, with every line in place. Simply amazing.<br /><br />Granted, this directors' work is an acquired taste - not many will find it accessible, and you obviously have to be a lover of foreign film to begin with. But I would suggest buying this DVD, and also rediscovering other films in Almodovar's superb back-catalog, especially the highly rated \\"All About My Mother\\". Even though the situations these characters face might be over the top and dramatic, you will relate to all of them.<br /><br />Five Stars.te to all of them.    Five Stars.

B0002DB52M|4.0|Lars Von Trier's \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" remains one of the Greatest Films ever made (its No. 3 on my All Time List), so it would have been hard to make anything remotely approaching that movies' greatness.<br /><br />\\"Dogville\\" is the first film in the 'Land of Opportunities' Trilogy by Lars Von Trier. The follow-up \\"Manderlay\\" answered a few questions raised by this movie, but this is a standalone experiment that often works. Is it a classic? By our standards, yes. By Trier's standards, he has done better in the past.<br /><br />The idea of setting the entire film on the soundstage with no props or external environment is something that works to great effect in the beginning, and then fast loses steam. The only thing that holds all of this together is the exciting performance by Nicole Kidman who OWNS her role here. She has never been better, and watch her here to understand how she remains an underrated actress (she is better here than she was in 'The Hours').<br /><br />Political consciousness and an Anti-American sentiment are obviously present throughout Lars' work, but the point is to understand it from a Scandinavian's perspective rather than call all his work 'anti-American'. On 'Dogville', he raises some interesting questions about privacy, revenge, and culpability, and I think he speaks to the entire world at large here, not just America. By transposing the 'them' vs 'us' aspect of society on a bare stage with fine actors in minimal clothing, this becomes a work of art. Pure transcendence.<br /><br />Make sure you're ready for a bit of experimental cinema if you want to enjoy this. I'd recommend buying this one, not renting it.
B000X3KZVI|5.0|I was actually at this concert in the seventh row...look for the little mexican guy in the red t-shirt dancing like a complete fool...LOL. This was my third time getting to see Mariah in concert...I also loved that Trey Lorenz and Boys II Men where both there live...that was awesome. If you are a Mariah fan you should definately buy this DVD...I know I am!!! Totally can't wait...woohoo!!!
B000N6TX1I|2.0|This is at best, a good book turned into a very slow, tepid, and clueless film. We are supposed to care that people can't get pregnant anymore, and then one woman emerges pregnant, and the entire film focusses on getting her to safety so that she can deliver her baby.<br /><br />On paper, this is interesting, and yes, I have to give credit to the director for making a deep, hued film of a certain texture. However, you cannot get past the very weak casting, as well as the extremely useless ending. I never once cared for any of these characters, and am I really the only person who cannot for the life of me understand all of these five star reviews?<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" is a very poor 'futuristic' drama. This is a movie that is definitely overrated, and I am sorry I wasted time on it. Next time, I'd trust my own judgement rather than these 5 star reviews on Amazon.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I wasn't a big Garth fan in the day...but I picked this up and what a ton of great songs are on the two music discs..wow!  The DVD is a real eye opener..I understand why this guy was so popular...he is a whirling dervish of a live enetertainer..truly magical and this is a ridiculously full package of songs and  DVD for under $15..any  ..ANY of the discs on their own would be worth that money ..all three terrific.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|And in many ways, its better than \\"Dune\\". As a huge science fiction fan, I often find myself snobbish toward less than stellar sci-fi movies, and to be honest, I thought \\"Firefly\\" at best was a good idea that wasn't given enough time to develop. Needless to say, \\"Serenity\\" came and blew everyone away.<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" will always be a very unique and rare film, because its a spectacular combination of special effects, interesting time/space ideas, and a story arc that happily concludes a cancelled TV Series. I doubt you're going to see anything that different for a while.<br /><br />So many science fiction films come and go (\\"Event Horizon\\" anyone?) but more than a year after release, \\"Serenity\\" continues to bring in new fans and win over more people to the science fiction genre. For that reason alone, this should get five stars.<br /><br />Buy this DVD. You will never have seen anything like it, and this is one movie you can watch again and again without getting bored. A true classic.
B000VUFJ4Q|1.0|What is with these record companies? Why do they release an album in the first place if they are going to release it again 6 months or a year later with extra tracks? save them for the next album! Do the expect people to buy it again? Then they wonder why people download music for free.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Long, boring, and incoherent, this is one of those 'global' film experiments that falls flat on its' face. I think Angelina Jolie is the only one that got it right on 'Beyond Borders', but this film takes Aussie Nicole Kidman and places her in the UN, where the poor thing is supposed to convince us that she can speak a variety of languages.<br /><br />The problem is, Nicole sounds like she's speaking Australian English even when shes speaking Swahili, which obviously isn't a good thing. The high power star cast does nothing to clarify the confusing, meandering plot, and by the time the end comes, you're left wondering why it is you're supposed to care. I had more fun watching the unintentionally hilarious 'Original Sin' starring Antonio Banderas.<br /><br />This film looks like it wanted an Oscar so badly, that they got the best director, and cinematographer to work on it. In the process, they forgot to concentrate on the script, and Nicole playing a South African who is 'patriotic' really got on my nerves. Why couldn't they cast a black actress in her role if they really cared? It would have made more sense. In the end, we get the feeling that this blonde, blue eyed beauty is some sort of Africa-loving philanthropist, and I didn't buy that.<br /><br />Next time, they should cast someone really good like Thandie Newton in a role like this, and respect the real crises that Africa is going through, instead of glossing it over and giving us guilt-ridden Caucasians in lead roles that so obviously belong to a black person.<br /><br />Even Two Stars is generous for this narcissistic mess.
0262731541|3.0|While I recommend it, I don't recommend you expect a real engineering reference or good reading cover-to-cover. It is somewhere in between and as such is not very good as either.<br /><br />The charts and plots are good so if you only want it for that it's a great compilation of other sources and references. The history of the bicycle and the HPV chapters are very interesting. The book is one of a very few like it so \\"one of the best\\" is not that great of a compliment.<br /><br />It is layed out and presented as an engineering reference type book on a specific topic (something like a Mark's for bikes) but it's nowhere near as consistent, rigorous, or detailed. A better description would be \\"musings on bicycle design and science\\" by someone who is genuinely very knowledgeable on the topic.<br /><br />My biggest problem is with the narrative. It has way too many opinions. Many are simply some ideas the author has about a particular design or test (there's no data in this area but one way to get some would be this...). It also has way too much anecdotal evidence which is (thankfully) usually presented as such. And worst of all there are many opinions that are generally made to sound like facts through casual use of expressions such as \\"future testing should...\\" \\"it is recommended\\" \\"conventional design practices\\" \\"according to some\\" and so on.<br /><br />To sum up if you are an engineer looking for an engineering reference you'll be disappointed. If you are a lay bike geek you'll probably find it too technical.

0446577391|4.0|Oliver Stone isn't who he seems to be, neither is Susan Hunter, or Harry Finn.  Their lives and the lives of those who know them are intertwined in a complex tale of treason, con games, and murder.     None stop excitement, twists, and intrigue keep this book moving at a pace that makes you want to stop so you can catch your breath, but don't.  You just might miss something, and you don't want to do that.       At the end of this book, you'll feel very differently about some of these characters than you did at the beginning.

B000F3UAFC|2.0|My cousin recommended this movie as being wonderful, so based upon that plus some of the previous Amazon reviews I got it.  Frankly, I found the movie somewhat boring, and was not impressed with the acting either.
0805079831|2.0|After No Logo, which I thought contained some timely and strong indictments of the influence of corporations on our public life, this is a disappointing book. Even though it makes some valid points, the conclusions are misleading; unfortunately Klein has let her hate of unfettered capitalism got in the way of what could have been a much more interesting volume.     As I see it, Klein essentially makes two points:   1) Transition to free-reign capitalism has often been undemocratically implemented in periods of turmoil. Klein is rather persuasive here, although in some cases the argument seems to overreach. However, this point is not so surprising in itself, because almost any extreme political-economic change involves chaotic and undemocratic circumstances. Her argument shows that capitalism and democracy are different things, but few people ever argued otherwise.  2) The ensuing `disaster capitalism' has been bad for the people of the countries involved. This is a claim about economic outcomes, and it seems that the only criterion used by Klein is whether 'evil' companies benefited. It is made clear that they did, and that then is the end of it. She never makes any serious attempts to analyse capitalist reforms. Instead, she chooses to lambast voucher systems for schools, without noticing that the Swedes who she hails as a having found a good middle way between capitalism and socialism, have been implementing such a system for years. I am not saying that capitalist shock treatment is a good thing, but again, more interesting accounts would also have noted that 'shock treated' Chile has been South-America most prosperous country for a long time and that Poland joined the EU less than 15 years after emerging bankrupt from communism.      These are interesting issues, but it is hard not to get annoyed by the way Klein treats them. The reason is that she does not try to give a careful balanced account of what happened and then shows that her conclusions follow, but rather tries to get rid of all nuances to make sure the reader understands who the evil people are.   It would be great if questions of political and economic transitions could be answered by pouring a bucket of vitriolic acid over Friedman and his followers. But this denies that there could have been any honest motivation behind capitalist reforms (to get an idea that there may have been, read another side to the Poland-story in Jeffrey Sachs' \\"The end of poverty\\"). Most of all, it's a pity that Klein does not employ her indisputable journalistic and research abilities in a more balanced way.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|I haven't read the book but Next is a strange film. Nicholas Cage acts well and when the film starts, it tends to draw your interest. If you're travelling on an airplane and switching between what to watch, Next is the movie you should stop at. Being 90 minutes, it doesn't hurt your clock. The best thing about the film is Nicholas Cage and the scenes involving him trying to make up his mind. The movie has no more than one central character. Sounds like a very difficult film to make, they've done an ok job. Don't hate your life when you watch the end though. Story? A man can see his own life two minutes into the future, there is no details as to how or why or his past (thankyou) and it NEXT just goes about it's business quite unselfconsciously.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Disclaimer- I have not seen the Big Top Edition, I have the 60th Anniversary edition.  This is a review of the film.<br /><br />It is amazing that this film was made 65 years ago.  This bright, crisp, colorful film with it's excellent soundtrack and music is just captivating.  My 3-year old is currently fixated with \\"Gumbo\\"-- meaning that this is the DVD that will be in the single disc rotation for the next couple weeks or so.<br /><br />Yes the crows are incredibly non-PC, and that is the one place where the film shows it's age-- but that just adds to the film now.  It isn't like a child would ever pick up on the racial overtones of the crows without a frame of reference.<br /><br />One sequence that is still freaking me out is the Pink Elephants on parade sequence.  I guess I am a little surprised this is from 1940; some of the things like the reference to Technicolor I would never have thought would be from the 40s.  And the morphing and dancing elephants sequence seemed like it would have belonged more in a 60s acid movie than in a 40s kids cartoon.  If the hippies had DVD they would have loved tripping out to that.<br /><br />But all in all this is a nearly perfect movie, but one that might get overlooked my many parents who are picking up Nemo, Cars, or Aladdin.  Don't overlook this movie.
B000VSBX34|5.0|The Beatles in HELP is over 40 years old..and it is as fresh as it was 40 years ago.<br /><br />This  two disk DVD  version is a classic film, restored to its glory that modern day marvels can do to film. This pre-MTV film stands as a great blend of music and comedy. The Beatles music in the film may seem new to the young ones. Nevertheless,  I would not be surprised if the HELP soundtrack goes back up the top 40 with the DVD release<br /><br />Richard Lester, who was director of the 1973/74 [[ASIN:B00006LPC5 The Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)]], moved the Beatles in this fast paced romp, like the Marx Brothers did 40 years before them. Lester did what was later done for TV with the MONKEES. MTV called Lester \\"The Father of MTV\\" due to the movie HELP...which he replied that he wanted a blood test<br /><br />The film looked like nonsense, but it has a thin plot about Ringo and a special ring. Leo (Rumpole of the Bailey, The Prisoner) McKern and Roy (Three Musketeers) Kinear ham it for the camera in this romp. This is a simple enjoyable film is one of these that  family can watch<br /><br />The two disk set also has a 16 page booklet with mostly pictures and very little text (if you are a film buff, I suggest you buy the deluxe HELP set with Richard Lester's annotated script book) . The booklet reminds me of a movie book, that was sold in the theaters when a large film was release..I have a few from Ben Hur and the Ten Commandments...BOY I AM DATING MYSELF NOW!<br /><br />What is missing for me is Lester or the remaining Beatles (Paul & Ringo) doing an audio commentary over the film. The second disk has a few documentaries, but no comments from neither Paul nor Ringo..and that is a shame!<br /><br />Now, what you all want to know is, IS IT WORTH IT?  YES, it is a still a grand piece of comedy and music that is timeless<br /><br />So you don't need HELP to get this film..Just order it and get the HELP you need!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Go ahead and buy it now.<br /><br />Did I ever see this movie when I was young?  It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.<br /><br />This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.<br /><br />As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his \\"disguise\\" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.<br /><br />All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.<br /><br />One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is \\"spotting\\" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.  (Holloway also was the stork in Dumbo 25 years earlier than Jungle Book).<br /><br />My daughter loves this movie and so do I.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|I previously owned a Bissel Go Vac and loved it. Eventually, the battery wouldn't hold enough of a charge so I had to look for a new cordless for quick clean-ups. I bought this and unfortunately it didn't fit the ticket.<br />Some good points: it is very lightweight, it moves very easily and gets close to edges. The battery holds a good charge and it doesn't need to stay plugged in so it can be stored anywhere.<br />The bad points: It has absolutely no suction. The vacuum works by rotating brushes, NOT suction power. Therefore, it leaves a lot behind. It was poor on flat surfaces as it kicked up more that it picked up. Additionally, if you tilted the head by accident, it would spit out anything that it had vacuumed up.<br />I would not recommend this product.<br />I have since purchased an Electrolux Pronto with a built in mini-vac and I really like it.<br />Needless to say, I've tried to sell my old Swivel at a really cheap price and no one is calling...
B000V6I7WG|5.0|If you're a type of person who loves it when a movie comes together in the end with a surprising twist this movie is for you.     I don't really want to give away too much but this movie is a little similar to Se7en. The beginning and the middle of the movie might not seem to make sense or seem like its dragging but the ending you will definitely tie up all loose ends and leave you shocked.
1594489505|5.0|After I finished reading The Kite Runner I had to pick this up.     This story is similar to The Kite Runner but the main focus is on two women.     Alot of it is depressing but it is a page turner.     I loved the story of Laila and Tariq.     I am thrilled with the happy ending in the book. I feel like Khaled only writes sad, sorrowful tales but at the end of this journey through his book I was happy with it all.    The book is really good but not as good as The Kite Runner.
076790592X|5.0|When I read this book, I was a young wife and mother bedridden with cancer.  I read it straight through, in between naps, and was touched by the story in a way words could never describe.  I feel sorry that some of the book's reviewers have missed the very point and purpose of the book and the story.  The author didn't \\"write about an old man who was dying\\"; the professor described the dying experience for us, through the author's pen.  Mitch Albom is a poet - an author whose words thoughtfully and humbly describe human thoughts and feelings, such that the reader actually experiences the emotions.  My eyes often welled up as I read words describing my very own feelings of fear and helplessness.  After I finished reading the last word of the last page, I immediately turned again to the beginning and started over.    Unlike Morrie, my health improved and I got better.  I've read this book four times now; its messages and lessons continue to focus, and it means more to me each time.  It is a treasure.   Mary
0143038419|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's book Eat Pray Love is outstanding ...inspirational, wise, humorous, touching.  It should be required reading for anyone seeking spritual inspiration........from cover to cover it's acconts of her inner and outer journey took me from laughter to tears to every emotion and every penetrating thought in between....  I've already given two books away as gifts and plan to order more to give away at Christmas.      Loretta Siani  Long Beach, CA

B000001FE0|5.0|Best remembered (and justifiably so) for disco anthems like \\"Stayin' Alive\\" and \\"Night Fever\\", The Bee Gees had actually been recording for at least a decade prior to that. This album is more of a pop-rock album, but with some unusual instrumentation and deep, dark, and profound subject matter not often found in mainstream music (even during that time). Songs like \\"Edison\\" and the title track are dark and haunting, while ones like \\"Melody Fair\\" and \\"Suddenly\\" are somewhat less lyrically profound, but all of the songs are extremely well-written and performed.
0143038419|4.0|I ordered the book after seeing Elizabeth Gilbert on the Oprah Show.  I am finding the book fasinating, however it does not keep ones attention like most of the books that Oprah has recommended.

0736063684|5.0|This is a great book for anyone with a basic knowledge of weight training.  It doesn't go into details of how to build a program, how much weight one should lift, how many reps vs. sets one should do, etc.  It is merely a book of strength training exercises broken down by muscle group.  It highlights which muscles are used per exercise, and goes into some detail about injuries one may incur while working various muscle groups.  I have been lifting for over two years now, and this book gave me a multitude of different exercises to shake up my routines.  It has a variety of types of equipment to use (free weights, cables, machines) which provides readers with many options based off what you like to do and what is available for you.  I thoroughly enjoy the cable exercises.  I hardly used cables before this book, but now they are some of my favorite exercises.  I have shown this book to fellow weight lifters, and everyone has liked it.  Some people have even ordered their own copy.  I have to mention that I am in the military, so many people around me value new training ideas.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|My apologies for the length.  Lots to say about my favorite artist in what probably will be my only review of any of his material (at least for a while).<br /><br />His only greatest hits compilation was \\"The Hits\\" from 1994.<br /><br />Since then, he has reached the 100 million units mark in the United States (the second of four acts to be certified at that mark and one of two solo artists, the other, of course, being Elvis Presley).  He has toured the world and performed in sold-out venues in over 20 countries.  He has broken more records than can be compiled in one list.  Now, finally, he has released a compilation that covers his entire career - to date, that is.  What a collection it is.<br /><br />For anyone who has forgotten why he remains one of the most popular artists in U.S. music history, one listen through the two-disc CD set should serve as a good reminder.  There are no weak tracks (not that there would be in a greatest-hits collection), including the new material.  His current single, \\"More Than a Memory,\\" is included along with three additional songs, all of which stand up well against songs that have had 15 years to mature.  While the current single is very good, perhaps my favorite of the new material is the bonus track, \\"Leave a Light On.\\"  Simple arrangement, dead-on vocals...Ultimate Garth.<br /><br />In case that was not enough, Garth throws in a companion DVD.  Think of it as the video version of the compilation, as every track from the CD version is presented in video - whether it is the original music video of the track or a special television performance.  Recall that Garth did not produce original music videos for all of his singles - oftentimes, his production team would release a concert performance or concert montage to serve as a music video for country music television.  Regardless, every single track has an accompanying video, which I found truly amazing.  There is a little duplication of effort here, though - you will find some of these same videos available in the second \\"Limited Series\\" box set as well as in the original video compilations from some 15 years ago.  You do, however, get brand new material, which I thought was really cool.  No \\"recording room\\" videos, either, with the new material - these are real music videos.  Don't miss the video for \\"Midnight Sun\\" - it is a riot.<br /><br />If you have not seen it yet, catch the current video for \\"More Than a Memory\\" circulating on country music television.  Amazing.  Simple.  Direct.  Dark.  Emotional.  The video matches the song brilliantly, and adds that \\"third dimension\\" that Garth always likes to put into his videos.<br /><br />All for about $12?  You can't beat it.<br /><br />One other thing.  In one of my Listmania lists, I talk about full-length albums.  To paraphrase, a good full-length album, to me, has a life of its own and is very much more than the sum of its parts.  You listen to it from front to back and hear something on top of the individual tracks - be it a story, a theme, or some other thread that holds the songs together.  These two CDs are just that.  The tracks are not presented in chronological order, as many would do.  The tracks are very specifically ordered, and makes for a front-to-back listen that is amazing.  Do me a favor - when you listen to it, do not pop it in the CD drive and hit \\"shuffle.\\"  Instead, listen to it as it was intended - from track 1 to track 34 (or 36, depending on how you count).  You'll love the collection even more.<br /><br />There is enough new stuff to make this a \\"must own\\" for Garth fans, no question.  For people who do not own any Garth material in their collections:  start here.  There is a lot of other stuff that you are missing, to be sure...but this should get you hooked!  :-)<br /><br />Five stars...no question...not just for the content, but additionally for the value.

1582406723|5.0|Kirkman and Moore created a groundbreaking comic book series with The Walking Dead. It's definitely heavily Romero based. It's basically the beginning of the world after the zombies finally take over. ANd the artwork is a beautifully drawn black and white. Definitely for the comic lover, Romero lover, horror lover, apocalyptic fiction lover, zombie lover, you get the point. This one is for more than the comic book geeks.
B000TGELLY|3.0|I love the new content is great, adds more to some of the characters. But damn...the score was...arg...messed up. They got rid a lot of the old tracks and just shuffled around some stuff. The editing was poor and nothing fit up anymore. They removed all the epic music at the epic moments...and replaced them with boring, mood music.    Speaking of replacing music, something that almost made me just stop watching the movie were 2 parts where the music was replaced by songs from completely different scores, from different movies, not by James Horner.    The first was the sparring scene between Achilles and Patroclus, the music sounds like it was taken right from \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" from the training montage. hmm....I love the music from the other version way better.    2nd part that was replaced by a different score from a different movie. The fight between Achilles and Hector. This was from \\"The Planet of the Apes\\" the newer version. The song sounds like the main titles track....and probably is.     The last part that really pissed me off, but was still music from Troy. The final scene where Achilles is trying down to the statue to save Briseis, they tossed the old music and crammed from other parts in the scene, killing the mood all together and making it so...boring because the music really carried that whole scene.    So in the end, the new content was nice, but the music just pissed me off to no end. I'll stick with the old version.
B00005QGAT|4.0|I didn't give Off The Wall 5 stars only because I know Michael Jackson wasn't as talented as people and the media made him out to be.   The artists that wrote, composed, produced, and played the music for MJ consisted of guys from Toto, Steely Dan, Louis Johnson from Brothers Johnson, Quincy Jones. MJ was a puppet in the music industry, and without the backup of real musicians, he would of been nothing.  Of The Wall is by far his best musical endeavor. It's a lot more raw, soulful, and funky than anything else he ever put out, including Thriller.  This is the only MJ cd worth owning as far as I'm concerned.  But I most certainly own all of Prince's cds, because Prince was (and still is) the REAL DEAL!
B000FVQLRA|4.0|A movie that makes you feel like you are realy living in 1940's poland because everything seems and feels authentic.  Admittedly, not as good a movie as Schindler's list or even Europa Europa.  But even though not as good, those movies felt like they were a bit over dramatized for effect (for a good purpose mind you).  If you are a history buff, or one that questions what actually happened during WWII, perhaps this film will help you get a clearer picture of what actually happened (yes I know this is just a movie, but it is based on a person's real life experiences).  I would like to see more movies like this.  Not only that of jewish experience during WWII, but also that of all participants of the war and done in a realistic manner, with real people's stories and experiences.
B000BFH2S2|4.0|Great CD/DVD!  Couldn't get enough, had to get me his other CDs and his most current one. Can't wait to get the next CD/DVD. Those are the best!!    My 8-year-old daughter loves his music as well and my husband admitted he enjoys his music too.    Everyone should be exposed to his style of music!!!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I've always loved the Eurythmics, and I really love \\"Walking on Broken Glass,\\" but I was never a fan of her solo albums as a whole.  Until now.  I was interested in the new album as first because of the title.  So I checked out the samples on Itunes, and the songs \\"Dark Road\\" and \\"Love Is Blind\\" sounded interesting to me; a very nice sound with nice vocals.  I took a chance and bought the whole album, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />These songs are the strongest she's ever done, in my opinion.  The samples don't do the songs justice.  There is a beautiful bridge in that song that really adds a punch to an already powerful message. \\"Love is Blind\\" reminds me of the \\"Be Yourself Tonight\\" era, but nicely updated for the 21st century.  I don't want to go song by song here because Songs of Mass Destruction has to be listened to as a whole, which is a nice thing in an age of singles-only CDs.  I will mention one track. \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" is Annie's best vocal on the album.  It sends chills down my spine every time I hear it.<br /><br />It was very wise that Annie worked with producer Glenn Ballard (Alanis Morrisette) because he adds a great pop sensibility to what I think is a deeply personal album.  I highly recommend this album.  Just pop it on and take the full ride.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|At a time when Roger was playing Bland, James Bland... the prospect of an unofficial Bond movie enticing Sean Connery to return to the role was mouthwateringly tantalizing.  And at the time it came out in 1983, the competition was one of Moore's weakest efforts, Octopussy, making the Bond versus Bond clash seem one sided in this movies favour. Never Say Never Again has a larger budget, stronger cast and is based on an Ian Fleming story.    Alas, the end result turns out to be not much better than a parody of the earlier Bonds, and despite a strong cast the script is so clunky and obvious that the wit and panache of Bond is missing.  Worse, the music is anachronistic and dated.  Of course, for legal reasons, they could not use John Barry's timeless themes, but all the more reason one would have thought to spend more time getting the score just right for the tone of the movie. Perhaps the most serious crime of all.. it is more than a bit dull.  You find yourself waiting for an action scene to come along, then when one comes along, you wish they would get it over with.  Aside from an effective bike-chasing-car scene, no other action scene resonates after the credits have rolled.  It's not all bad.. Kim Basinger is a lithe and lovely Bond girl, and Klaus Maria Brandauer is a deliciously quirky villain.  A few scenes hold up - the dance scene when Bond tells Domino her brother is dead, the fistfight at Shrublands with Pat Roach (from Auf Wiedersehen pet), and at least we don't have the dreadful speeded up boat scene from the otherwise far superior original, `Thunderball'.  Finally, with the `official' Bond movies so well digitally remastered and sound remixed, the very poor quality of the sound mix and blemished print are all the more obvious.  Sound is very boomy and with no surround mix - speech is muffled, and I had to turn up the volume much higher than usual to hear any detail.  Aside from one trailer, there are no extras.  The worst of Moore's Bond outings can still be enjoyed, even when the grin is mixed with a groan... here though, the grin has become a fixed grimace, and the pleasures are few and far between.  Connery's charisma pulls us through without feeling obliged to give up half way through - but the temptation is never far away.  Worth watching only for nostalgia's sake, to see Connery's Bond swansong.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Great album.  So nice to hear Bruce rocking with the E Street Band again.  He is really back on the top again!  SUPERB!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Of course Garth has had other hits packages but this one takes the cake, mostly due to the DVD with all his music videos, 33 of them. And at only $13, this is a very generous set. You are getting a lot of music including 4 new songs and his biggest hit yet, More than a Memory included. I'm sure he's going to sell millions of this ultimate set
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Although some may object to this album as not containing enough of the \\"rocking\\" sound that they have come to associate with Springsteen's forays with the E Street Band, this work still ranks as one of the artist's most listenable and fascinating projects.  Springsteen tones down the driving drums and guitars--you won't hear a \\"Jackson Cage\\" on this recording--so that most of the music has a blended, albeit melancholy tone.  In many ways, it recalls some of the music of the mid-sixties, with a more mature and resigned tone.  Standouts are \\"Girls in their Summer Clothes\\" and \\"Your own Worst Enemy.\\"  Springsteen's lyrics still carry their bite, though, especially in a line describing \\"the last one to die for a mistake\\", a clear evocation of the Iraq War.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|I missed Spiderman 3 at the theater and had to wait for the home video release. During that waiting period, I read many reviews and listened to the opinions of family and friends, most of which seemed to be negative or, at least \\"not as good as the first two\\".    I wasn't expecting too much when I popped the disc into the player, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the movie sport fantastic special effects and some well-choreographed fight scenes, the story had tremendous DEPTH.    Unlike many \\"superhero\\" films, the Spiderman series focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters rather than epic fight scenes and flashy costumes (although the Spiderman movies DO offer that as well - you get the best of both worlds). The character developement is what gives these films substance and makes them more than just eye-candy.    Brilliantly done.    I must say that I enjoyed this film more than Spiderman 2, but not as much as the first Spiderman. Yes, there were multiple plot threads and more than one \\"villain\\", but so what? The story comes together quite well in the end and left me wanting more.    I, for one, am looking forward to Spiderman 4.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles Live in Melbourne 2004 is an outstanding disc.  The sound quality 5.1 surround and picture DVD quality are stupendous.  For those few Eagles fans on here, if you do not have that disc from this 2004 concert, released in 2005, you really ought to get it.<br /><br />Unlike Hell Freezes Over from five years earlier, the Eagles have hit stride, and they are more forgiving in letting each member shine individually:<br />No More Cloudy Days (New Track), Hole In the World (new), You Belong to the City, Walk Away, Rocky Mountain Way, Sunset Grill, Life's Been Good, Dirty Laundry, are some of the tunes.  Joe Walsh really is a guitar God.  And it shows on this DVD.<br /><br />Also, it is after they kicked--for no good reason at all--original guitarist Don Felder out of the group. On this disc, a fellow that looks like a hatchet-faced greaseball in an oversize Texas roadsuit plays the lead guitar with gusto and vigor, note-for-note like Donnie Felder. And this is crucial as (trivia bomb) the Eagles feature two songs with the very uncommon guitar solo outtro (end of the song) with Life in The Fast Lane and Hotel California--check it out next time you listen to those cuts. The Eagles stil soar without Felder, and by tossing just a few sheckles into this studio journeyman's Fedora, the remaining Eagles split the cash cow in fewer pie pieces.  Ingenious.<br /><br />The Long Road to Eden, available only from the Walton family, is a sad countrified piece of grisle compared to this juicy concert from yesteryear. Got an Andy Jackson burning a hole in your pocket?  Go with Mebourne.
0385486804|2.0|I read \\"Into the Wild\\" only after I had seen Jon Krakauer, Sean Penn, the McCandless family, and Emile Hirsch on Oprah in September. I was intrigued enough to buy the book but ultimately disappointed and annoyed with Krakauer's interpretation of Chris McCandless' life.<br /><br />First of all, this book is not an objective retelling of a foolish young man's ultimately suicidal two-year journey across the American West, it's Krakauer's defense of it. Silly me was expecting to read a nonfiction, non-biased book written by a respectable journalist but instead got apotheosis of a spoiled deluded rich kid. Krakauer refuses to acknowledge a sneaking suspicion many of us have about McCandless- that he was mentally ill- by stating outright: \\"Chris McCandless wasn't mentally ill.\\" Well no crap. Krakauer himself sounds insane, as he peppers the book with accounts of his own idiotic solo ventures into the Alaskan wilderness. In fact, I think too much of the book is devoted to the author's stunts when he could have spent those pages evalutating the psychological factors that would drive McCandless (or himself) to such extremes. Sure, there are a few lines about troubles between fathers and sons, but many, many children have those same problems and just get over them. They don't run off into the woods and eat berries. Some distance between author and subject would have been preferrable.<br /><br />All in all, you're better off just seeing the movie, which at least draws attention to McCandless' \\"woodsman\\" deficiencies. It's clear that Krakauer doesn't see any problems at all with any of McCandless' behavior. In fact, he applauds it and chastises us for being so \\"comfortable\\" and \\"complacent.\\" Translation: \\"sane\\" and \\"thankful.\\"
0743289684|5.0|I just finished reading this book and found it to be very powerful.  I learned a great deal about the Muslim religion, the horrible treatment of women in that very violent culture, and that we should be very concerned about the future of the non-Muslim world, or the \\"infidels\\" to quote them.  I admire Ayaan Hirsi Ali's courage to speak out for the Muslim women being tortured and killed in the name of religion, and that in her view, Muslims are not peaceful.   I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to become more aware of what the Muslims do to their own and wish to do to the rest of the world.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Sort of.    First off, let me say that I am a HUGE Eagles fan. I have all of their CDs, DVDs, and I can play most of their songs on guitar. I loves me some Eagles.    This album has been on and off production since 2001 and I have been waiting eagerly for it since then. I must say that I was a bit disappointed on my first listen.    My first criticism is the overall slow pace of the album. Most of the songs are ballads. The Eagles are known for writing amazing ballads (\\"Desperado\\" and \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" to name 2 of my favorites), but the ones on \\"The Long Road\\" seem to all sound more or less the same. None of the compositions really stand out and are more or less forgettable. The only exception is the Frey-penned \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" - AMAZING song.    Second, the Eagles have been known to \\"rock out\\" with songs like \\"Life In the Fast Lane\\" and \\"Take It Easy\\", but the new album only has 2 or 3 \\"rockin'\\" songs (\\"How Long\\" and \\"Somebody\\"). Again, these songs are good, but they just don't seem to have the same classic feel as the band's 70s output.    Thirdly, some of the songs have programmed drum tacks rather than an actual drummer. In my opinion, that's cheating; especially from a band as talented and capable as The Eagles (Don Henley should be ashamed - he's an excellent drummer).    I must admit, though, that after 2 or 3 listenings to the album, it is starting to grow on me. I DO like the album, I just don't feel that it's as good as their classics from the 70s. Regardless, I'll keep listening and continue to be a fan.

1594489505|5.0|I must say that I was deeply moved by this latest work from Khalid Hosseini. Having previously read 'The Kite Runner' only the year before I believed that his latest endeavor could only be better and I was so glad to prove that. Mr. Hosseini has a gift for pulling the reader into the story and helping them to see with their minds eye the people and places in his stories. Feeling so much a part of the story it was hard at times to continue but I just could not put it down. Thank you Mr. Hosseini for helping me to learn of the people and places of this world. I will never forget these stories.
0525950079|3.0|It would not be unfair to say Ken Follett's writing is formulaic, and it would be fair to say he has a better formula than most.  The book is, in many ways, predictable, and you've seen all these characters before in other Follett novels, not just PILLARS OF THE EARTH.  Yet Follett kept me turning the pages, all 1014 of them.  This book is not great fiction, but it's a very enjoyable way to pass the time.

Not that he does anything completely left of center but they somehow feel different in spirit than the studio's regular output with the \\"Incredibles\\" being my favorite film they've done. Now comes \\"Ratatouille\\", Bird's follow-up to that superhero movie and Pixar's followup to the uncharacteristically-average \\"Cars\\". Since that film wasn't that well received, Ratatouille didn't look promising either until it became, deservingly, one of the best-reviewed films of the year.     Remy is a rat living in the French countryside with his family living off of garbage. But with a gift for smell and taste, Remy has more higher standards for the kind of food he eats. But when he's seperated from his family and finds himself under Paris' restaurant, Gusteau's, home of Remy's idol and with the motto \\"anyone can cook!\\", Remy feels right at home. That is of course if people can accept a rat in the kitchen, much less cooking their food. But with the help of socially inept and cooking-challenged Linguini, Remy and Linguini become friends and kitchen stars which attracts the attention of ambitious chef Skinner and harsh food critic Anton Ego.    Whereas the Incredibles was more action-packed than any other Pixar outing, Ratatouille almost has a more romantic comedy/buddy movie feel and it feels more unique than A Bug's Life or Finding Nemo. There isn't that one obvious comic relief character and the film doesn't end in a glorious action sequence so while the kids might find it too character-driven, adults might find it more delightful that the film speaks to the audience and not down at them with bad puns and pop culture references. From colorful characters and a lighthearted but not saccharine tone, the film seems quite at home with anyone.    It's kind of a cliche now to point out Pixar has become the best in computer animation. Whereas Dreamworks and the folks behind Robots and Ice Age do have impressive animation, at times there's things such as texture or subtleties that make them far behind. And it's fair to say Ratatouille is probably their most accomplished and it's all to do with character animation and nuances. Sure there's things like the slightly translucent flesh tone that the rat's ear has to the differences between wet fur, dry fur and whatnot but the characters feel more realistic. One of my favorite parts is when a character is about to slap another but stops and it's just as good an acting job as live-action. Then of course there's the food. Don't watch on an empty stomach.    If there's one knock, it's the special features. While they have double-dipped in the past, Monsters Inc. to the Incredibles were always filled with featurettes and documentaries about the making-of. But since Cars, the films seem light on anything. Sure we get the funny short \\"Lifted\\", a new short and whatnot but it's not as packed as I would like it to be. There's not even a commentary and as anyone who's heard Bird talk, he's a very...animated fellow (no pun intended) and to hear him talk about the film would've been welcome.     It might not have the wide-reaching appeal Toy Story has but for anyone looking for a great animated film, can't go wrong with this one.
B000VSBX34|5.0|The issue of aspect ratios will always be a problem with films produced between 1955 & 1990.  Unless they were produced in a real \\"widescreen\\" format such as Cinemascope, VistaVision, or other trademarked names, the movie is best seen in full frame 1:33-1 format.<br /><br />The Beatles Films A HARD DAY'S NIGHT & HELP were shot in a British theatrical format which is inbetween 1:33-1 and 1:85-1.  About 1:66-1, which means both U.S. screen formats will cut something off of the picture.<br /><br />I compared the old \\"Full Frame\\" 1:33-1 release of HELP to this new \\"Anamorphic\\" 1:85-1 release.  I must first say that all of the long shots benefit from the added picture to the sides on the widescreen version, and they feel better this way.  However the widescreen version tends to cut off the tops of peoples heads in the close-ups and the full frame version looks better.<br /><br />Overall the film looks superior in this newly re-mastered widescreen DVD, with the color correction & scratch removal.  The sound has been improved also (even though Laserdiscs have better sound reproduction).<br /><br />The old Criterion 2-disc Laserdisc does contain some bonus material that is not on this 2-disc DVD release.  But there is also much new bonus material on this release that was not on the old 2-disc Laserdisc release.<br />I will keep both versions. Hopefully someday someone will release the film in it's original 1:66-1 aspect ratio and give us the full picture!

The graphics are very detailed and the book incorporates training techniques as well as common injuries associated with certain techniques.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth Brooks has shipped over 123 million albums now and overtaken Elvis as the officially recognised best selling solo artist of all-time. A large percentage of these sales have been greatest hits releases which this new one also is. However, despite a few new songs you also get a set of videos for the songs a lot of which are new representing something worth having for all the Garth fans that have bought the previous \\"hits\\" releases. As for the music then there can be no question that it's worth the money if you don't have them as songs like \\"Friends in Low Places\\", \\"The Dance\\" and \\"If tomorrow never comes\\" are all-time classics. With Garth in semi-retirement it seems unlikely that we will get a new album full of new stuff anytime soon but this must mark the end of the \\"hits\\" releases as he's probably sold more \\"hits\\" albums than 90% of artists manage for original releases.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I have to be honest, when this movie first came out I was sick of all the hype.  Our child went to the theater to see this with her class so we never had to see it & I was glad.    When it came out on DVD I bought for our child because she liked it.  The family gathered to watch it one night (even though I really didn't want too).  It didn't take long before I was hooked!    This is a new tradition for us, just like Rudolf & Frosty.  They did an excellent job on it.  Every Thanksgiving we watch The Polar Express!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Fantastic movie and wonderful music. I honestly have no idea why this isn't more popular than it is. A friend of mine recommended this movie to me and had me listen to the sound track on his iPod, I loved it. I do not normally buy CD's as I never like every track and find it cheaper to buy the individual songs I want. This I had to own.
0446607274|5.0|This is another winner from Connelly. I have been reading through the Bosch books out of order and have enjoyed every one.  Each has its own rhthym and twists.  Angels Flight has the tension of Harry's marriage, the internal LAPD conflicts and racial tensions.  It remains suspenseful to the end.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Aside from a couple really cool songs like \\"Waiting on a miracle\\" I never knew much of this artist. For me, the rush of excitement came after renting the DVD \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm your man\\". Although the DVD was mostly full of musical fans doing horrendous covers, the glimpses gleamed of the monk-like Cohen were  enrapturing.<br /><br />The music on this CD is lovely, strengthened immensely by Sharon Robinson. The lyrics deeply (yet simply) encompass the silence for those of us without a personal god.<br /><br />\\"You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.\\"<br /><br />\\"So come, my friends, be not afraid.<br />We are so lightly here.<br />It is in love that we are made;<br />In love we disappear.<br />Though all the maps of blood and flesh<br />Are posted on the door,<br />There's no one who has told us yet<br />What Boogie Street is for.\\"
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|excellent cd, very high energy on some songs and others such as roadside are just chill enough to come down from the adrenaline rush u get from this album.. 2 thumbs up, they just keep getting better
0060763280|5.0|The book is powerful,that is why I purchased it.  It is simple and direct. This is my first purchase of this author, but I know I will buy more.
B000SFZ05C|3.0|Couldn't wait to buy this record.  Gave it a few listens waiting for it to grab me, but maybe only 2-3 songs on the \\"bonus\\" disc caught my attention.  Personally, I didn't think the recording or production was bad...just no gems like Wonderland, Peace Dog, Edie Chow...etc.      Ok album, but not a great one.  Still think The Cult is a GREAT band.
B000URDEB0|4.0|The first album with Annette Olzon as the lead singer, following Tarja Turunen's dismissal from Nightwish, this isn't a bad album. Anette sounds more like Sharon del Adel(Within Temptation) than Tarja, but that's not a very bad thing for these songs.    The first song: \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\". It is quite a masterpiece, and I can see why it would be Tuomas' favorite song. I did however, think the last three minutes or so were unnecessary, it would have been perfectly fine ending with the heartbeats.    Next there is \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\", my personal favorite on this CD. Then \\"Amaranth\\", which is a good one too. In fact, the first six songs are good, up to \\"Master Passion Greed\\". That song will probably alienate some fans, die to its completely different sound. It's a lot angrier than any other Nightwish song, and it only has Marco Hietala singing, instead of Annette. People who are into bands like Disturbed will like this song, but diehard Symphonic Metal fans may have a hard time warming up to this song. I personally like it, though.    After that, though, the songs \\"Sahara\\", \\"Whoever Brings the Night\\", and \\"For the Heart I Once Had\\" kinda put a kink in this CD, they're just not all that great to me.    From \\"The Islander\\" on, it gets good again. \\"The Last of the Wilds\\" is a very good instrumental piece, and the ending for \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\" seems rather drawn out. \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is a good song, although I'd rather they'd ended the CD on a faster track, but it still works.    So all in all, I like the album, and Anette is a good singer, but I prefer Century Child and Once to Dark Passion Play.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Disc one is one \\"we broke up/I'm miserable\\" song after another. Nicely produced, but it's very \\"Glenn Frey-ish\\" if you followed his solo work.    My choice cuts:    DISC ONE:    How Long? (J.D. Souther wrote it)  Busy Being Fabulous  What Do I Do With My Heart?  Guilty Of The Crime (Francis Miller/Jerry Williams wrote it)  I Don't Want To Hear Any More (Paul Carrack wrote it)  Waiting In The Weeds  No More Cloudy Days  You Are Not Alone     DISC TWO  Somebody (Jack Tempchin/John Brannen wrote it)  Frail Grasp On The Big Picture  Last Good Time In Town  Business As Usual    So I picked 12 songs out of 20...but the first song \\"No More Walks\\" isn't really a song; and \\"I Dreamed There Was No War\\" is a 1.30 min instrumental.    \\"Fast Company\\" is dreadful with a horribly arranged brass section; \\"Do Something\\" is mournful and dreary, and we had enough of that with the slow songs on disc one.  \\"You Are Not Alone\\" IS very sappy but Glenn sounds honest/earnest so I'll add it to my iPod.    I eagerly looked forward to the title track, but the lyrics (?) and the melody (?) simply aren't memorable and while it's great to hear Joe Walsh cut loose, a little, it is NOT an epic track like \\"Hotel California\\" and they were clearly trying to make it one. And as for a memorable political statement, \\"Frail Grasp\\" is pretty good but Henley is simply repeating himself from earlier years...and he has said it better before.    I think the best overall track is Joe Walsh's \\"Last Good Time\\" because it actually sounds like he wrote a song with a band and he is allowed to solo and noodle around a bit. It also doesn't sound like everything else, so it stands out on its own.    DISC TWO has a dreadful song, \\"I LOVE TO WATCH A WOMAN DANCE\\" that once again slows the CD into a slump, and \\"Center\\" and the wretched \\"It's Your World\\" end it on such a creative void that you wonder why it took them six years (!) and 5 other writers to make this.     I have my 12 songs listed above and it will make a niceEagles album. Of course, it's not a \\"classic\\" album -- those days are over -- and they really have nothing new to say, but it's nice to hear them together...but I seriously question their choice of material and the 2 CDs could easily have been one.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|As the product review shows, the crtiics and, indeed, most viewers did not 'get' The Good Shepherd.  Although realizing that it was a subdued and cerebral film, most who have watched it did not 'get' what the film was all about.  Let's take another look at what is a slightly flawed but essentially brilliant movie that might just be worth your money and time after all!<br /><br />What this film is not:  This film is not an espionage thriller.  This film is not a history of the CIA--that's the backdrop.<br /><br />What this film is:  The personality study and life history of one of the CIA's earliest employees, Edward Wilson (a fictitious character, played by Matt Damon, who shows surprising acting depth in the understated but intense character).  The film serially develops Wilson's web of loyalties and relationships, with the Yale professor he admires, with his wife (Angelina Jolie, miscast rather badly in one of the films few flaws), with Skull and Bones, and with his son.  He also has complex loyalties with a KGB rival and a defector.  Plus, there are CIA Founder Wild Bill Donovan (well-done by actor-director deNiro), Damon's supervisor (William Hurt) and his FBI liaison (Alec Baldwin).<br /><br />Each and every one of these institutions or characters comes forth at some point to test Damon's loyalties.  Will he compromise his country for an engaging KGB man who wants to do him \\"a very great favor?\\"  Will he put his love of family above his love of country?  Which comes first, Loyalty to Skull and Bonesmen or the Agency?  His boss or his integrity?<br /><br />Joe Pesce, in a cameo as a retired mob boss, tells Damon \\"We Italians, we have our food, our families, our church; what do YOU have?\\"<br /><br />Damon's reply tells the viewer why the film is titled as it is:  \\"I have the United States of America.\\"<br /><br />Watch carefully for the nuances of the gift shop scene with the KGB and you will unravel the last mysrey of a long, subtle, film that gets more engaging as it goes along.<br /><br />If the above sounds good, maybe this IS the film for you to buy and watch a few times to pull out the enjoyable nuances and delightfully light directorial touches.aybe this IS the film for you to buy and watch a few times to pull out the enjoyable nuances and delightfully light directorial touches.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Oh my! I cannot believe to see so many cry-babies in here who review the product even before it came out ranting about the price. Today is the release date (Nov. 6) and I bought the actual limited edition box set so here I am writing this review. All I can say is it is fantastic and worth every penny, with exceptionally high quality art work and design (coffee table size). I'm very happy with the purchase. Those who rant are just bitter and jealous because they cannot afford it, hahaha ;-) Stop crying your parents may get it for you as a Christmas present! Oh, by the way, the video transfer & extras of the new 2-disc special edition are identical to this deluxe box set (miraculous, I must say) but without the collectible stuff. You can take my word for it. Cheers! :-)
0316010669|4.0|It's rare indeed that objectivity is brought to bare on a subject as ethereal as intuition. Malcolm Gladwell seem to have made strides to build a bridge that focuses our attention on this phenomenon, and to outline a possible technique to making it a practical ability. 'Blink' is a 'must read' for anyone looking for a clearer understanding of that inner voice, that sometimes come to the forefront, and demands to be heard in one's decision making.
1401300529|5.0|This is the first book by Halberstam that I have read.  It certainly won't be the last.  His approach of mixing the big picture with the personal stories of the soldiers on the ground makes for a book that is difficult to put down.
0440418569|2.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books in the trilogy however \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" seemed to wander on and on.  In the end the author uses the book to promote his personal views of God and Christianity. I was dissappointed in this because I didn't expect to find anti-Catholic, atheistic views at the end of a children's book.  I expected something more along the lines of CS Lewis Narnia. Upon further investigation I found that Pullman detests the Naria series and seems to be the antithesis of CS Lewis. Pullman should have stuck to the fantasy aspect of his series and left his personal viewpoints at home.
6304711905|4.0|This version of the Earps and Holiday versus the Cowboys is an exciting and colorful tale with an outstanding cast ( meant a 5 star rating). Unlike the Costner film, this movie starts quickly with the Earp saga starting with their initial entry into Tombstone. The telling of the story is a somewhat compressed liberal historical interpretation but it is pretty factual with a large cast representing authentically the real life characters even as obscure as such as Earp's extended friends such as Turkey Creek Jack Johnson (Buck Taylor from Gunsmoke) and Texas Jack Vermlllion (Paul Sherayko) to the Clanton's cowboy pals such as Pony Deal (Forrie J. Smith) and Billy Claiborne (Wyatt Earp, a real descendant of the original). The dress and town scenes appear highly authentic and add to the reality feel of the film. The cast is extraordinary with Val Kilmer standing out in the cast that features Sam Elliott (Virgil) who has excellent scenes as the forceful older brother, Bill Paxton (Morgan), Powers Booth (Curley Bill), Michael Biehn (Ringo), Stephen Lang (Ike Clanton), Thomas Haden Church (Billy Clanton), Charlton Heston (rancher Henry Hooker) in a modest role and Billy Bob Thornton as a relatively obscure but well played ignorant Faro dealer. Kurt Russell does very well playing the lead. His character is in stark contrasts to Costner's who may reflect the truer character of Earp as a dour, matter of fact fellow but Russell's show's a tough but more up beat character that adds life to the film and story.  Kilmer is highly entertaining as the sickly yet eerily unpredictable Holiday, ready to enter a fray in spite of his weak physical condition with no fear of death. Kilmer's sudden and timely appearances add suspense to the story as he utters his classic line \\"I'm your huckleberry!\\"  The saloon conflict between Ringo, played by Biehn, and Holiday is one of the non-OK corral highlights of the film as the two almost come to shooting it out in the most famous scene in the film when they virtually mock each other classically (literally) during an aborted card game.  Stephen Lang is tremendous as the trouble making, despicable and cowardly Ike Clanton that acted as the incendiary to the real life conflict. Aside from the overbearing opening with the Cowboys in a gratuitous violent scene, the film is true to the real story. Curley Bill, in real life, was abusive with his guns and injurious to many individuals but at the same time a friend to others, including town folk who made money off the cowboys such as County Sheriff Behan (well played by John Tenny). These strange relationships between Cowboys who committed crimes and their economic ties to a number of people contributed to the divide in Tombstone well captured in this story (also depicted in the movie \\"High Noon\\"). The Earps in this movie have virtually been adopted by the real Tombstone today with a billboard advertisement that looks almost exactly like these Earps and the billboard appears to include Russell's actual face, front center amongst the other imitators. The walk of the Earps with Holiday is a classic movie poster that captures the authentic costume and steely eyed look of the four some and a copy is well worth hanging on the wall. Also notable in the film, is a brief appearance of Dana Delaney having a very sensual photograph taken that is suddenly interrupted. A real life photo of the same type of picture exists of Josephine Marcus although there is significant controversy whether it really is her or not but is certainly is a sexy picture for the time. Some other issues, Dana Delaney is a very attractive Josephine Marcus and is captivating but her Josephine has less of a past than her real counterpart. Also Harry Carey, Jr. plays Marshall Fred White but White was only 31, not the senior officer as portrayed by Carey. Also, the vengeance ride with Wyatt and friends has some truth to it, his brother Warren was actually with him, but it is not as long and murderous as it is depicted. However, the ambush scene with Earp going toe to toe with the cowboy leader is relatively accurate although not as depicted. Ringo's death is also a mystery today but some speculate that Earp and Holiday has something to do with it. I give the edge to this movie over Costner's due to this faster moving script, great cast and Kilmer versus Biehn action; however, seeing both allows for a nice contrast.s depicted.

B000VSBX34|5.0|Wow, I've watched Help on TV and for years on VHS and DVD.  Today was like a first viewing; I couldn't believe how emotional I got watching something for the 1,000th time!  Pure visual magesty, feels like you're in the room with them.  Audio is superp, I have 16 year old Bose 901s. How sharp?  I thought John was playing a 12 string acoustic during the opening \\"Help! scene\\".  The \\"Ticket To Ride\\" sequence, (my all time favorite Beatle song) is the reason director Dick Lester was proclaimed \\"The Father OF MTV\\".  Fun extras too, watch Paul forge a \\"George Harrsion\\" autograph on a poor little girl's leg cast, Ha!  And Neil Aspinall finally takes his hat off! What a great save for the day, lost my job yesterday.  My only complaint?  LET IT BE!!  LET IT BE??

B000031WBQ|5.0|What expression!  They just don't make them like this anymore.  Thanks so much for making this collection available on a CD.
B000W1V44I|5.0|well, they did it again. they're back w/the best album so far in 2007 in my opinion.     these guys have been together for 15 years and no matter how people dislike them, when it comes to longevity and endurence, they have surpassed many artists/bands. i don't think you can say such thing about anymore you hear on the radios these days. so they're at least respectable for making at least \\"decent\\" music -- something that is not oversexed and too studio synthesized. not to mention these guys can actually sing (not as good as say, elton john, but you get the idea).    that being said, let's comment on the album \\"unbreakable\\". released on the same day as britney spears's \\"blackout\\", i think this album deserves much more attention and credit than \\"blackout\\" (lol the name, what a coincidence...it's called \\"BLACKOUT\\").     while some of the songs on this album have an original danceable pop-music feel (i.e. panic, everything but mine, and treat me right), others have a rock and/or sappy-love-song edge to them. so it's a mix of different genres you're going to hear -- a reason you should give this LP a try. the guys are experimenting new things as they mature into their 30's and they're not afraid to put themselves out there and risk everything they've got, which is very respectable. not many bands/artists would have the guts to do that.    the only reason i'm giving this album a 4 1/2 star rating is because it could've been even better. i love all the ballads/power ballads on this album. however, there's a downside -- the uptempos are not as powerful. yes they're okay, but there's no way you can compare them to earlier songs such as larger than life or the call. but hey it was a good attempt!    last but not least, another reason that this album is worth a try is because of the fact that all of the remaining four sang in it -- this contradicts the so-called \\"boyband\\" theory. in addition, many of the songs are written and co-written by bsb and that makes them \\"personal\\".so what if the bsb are not \\"mainstream\\" anymore? i'd rather listen to them than any other crap i hear on radios nowadays. i have been a fan since i was in elementary school and still am one till this day. i'd say, \\"never stop making positive music because it's what the music industry today lacks!\\"    i recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good music

B000Q66PXE|3.0|I personally believe that these two seasons comprise one of the best shows in creation - second, very closely - to The Shield's creativity and rawness, especially for a cable television show.  I would give this show 5 stars easily but the pricing is obviously out of whack.  However, as an avid lover of history and the greatest world empire in human history - second only to America - we must learn to love the traits instilled by the very institution of Rome.  The price is too high in my opinion and I've already seen the show but I wish to add the DVD's to my collection.  Just as the bustling markets and trade of the Roman streets bartered an acceptable price, I too will wait for the price to drop yet voice my grievances.  However, for someone who has interest in history and incredible storyline and authenticity... it would definitely be a good gift item.  (Especially bought separately as it is cheaper.)      \\"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\\" - Marcus Aurelius

B000VS6R26|5.0|Im a big movie fan and collect movies as a hobbie and i have to say this is the best movie ever made. i truely think this is the best movie of all time! kate winslet did a wonderful perfomence in this movie! what makes this movie sooooooo good is the fact that it is like two movies in one. you have what is probly the most romantic love story ever and then you have a great disaster story to go along with it. what makes this movie evan better is the 3 disc collectors edition. when this movie first came out on DVD in 1999 i was disopointed that it had no special features. but this special edition has all the speacial features you could ever want. the best thing is that the movie has been digitally remastered. the picture quallty is like 20 times betta then the other DVD copy of the movie. I have been waiting for a 10th anniversary edition of this movie all year and i am so excited to see it. So dont listen to all the people bad mouthing the movie. take my word for it this movie is really good. it won lots of Academy awards and was a kiling at the box office so if you love movies like me this is a keeper!!!!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|There are many outstanding aspects about this film that contribute to place it among the best anime productions I have seen in my life. It all starts with the animation, since the attention to detail in Miyazaki's work is seldom experienced. I could not help gasping when in one of the scenes I saw the perfect reflection of Chihiro on the window of a train in which she was traveling. These are the kind of details that give the production a realism that is really hard to find. The second crucial element is the story itself, which is proof of a prodigious imagination, and which without a doubt can be experienced several times without generating boredom in the spectator. Finally, and maybe this is the most striking aspect of all, this is a movie that can be appreciated by audiences of all ages, because there is something to take away for everyone. I can only imagine how interesting it will be for my daughter to watch this film as a kid, teenager and adult, since there are things to discover at each level of maturity.<br /><br />Chihiro, the main protagonist of the story, is a ten-year-old girl who is moving with her parents to a new city. She is the typical kid nearing adolescence, and therefore, is unhappy with the world, her parents in particular, and shows no interest in anything. When looking for their new house, a wrong turn leads them to a mysterious place that looks like an abandoned theme park, but when night falls quicker than expected, Chihiro finds herself all alone in a world full of spirits. There are no words to describe the astounding magical world in which she is immersed, and the transformation the character undergoes is as mesmerizing as it is revealing.<br /><br />When a few years ago I watched [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]] I thought I had experienced Miyazaki at the top of his game, but this film gives it a run for its money. Bottom line is that both works should be required watching for every fan of the genre. People that are looking for an introduction to anime can find no better place to start than with \\"Spirited Away\\". The only drawback is that it will create a tough benchmark for future experiences to match.<br /><br />In terms of the Extras, the disc that has the film, also has a piece on the Art of Spirited Away, where Miyazaki shares some of the \\"secrets\\" behind his inspiration and peers and coworkers talk about the wonderful qualities of this magnificent director. In most cases I would say that the praise was scripted and disregard it as such, but in this case it really rings true, and it is entertaining and insightful to watch. This segment also includes commentary on the challenges faced with the translation, and on the steps that were put in place to conserve the original intent of the film. This is extremely important, especially in the anime / manga genre, where sadly, lousy translations that mangle the product are not uncommon.<br /><br />The Extras in the additional disc were not really worth watching, and I felt like they were there just as a way to make this a two-disc edition. Nevertheless, the rest of the product is so outstanding that I could not bring myself to lower my rating.anime can find no better place to start than with \\"Spirited Away\\".

In terms of the Extras, the disc that has the film, also has a piece on the Art of Spirited Away, where Miyazaki shares some of the \\"secrets\\" behind his inspiration and peers and coworkers talk about the wonderful qualities of this magnificent director. In most cases I would say that the praise was scripted and disregard it as such, but in this case it really rings true, and it is entertaining and insightful to watch. This segment also includes commentary on the challenges faced with the translation, and on the steps that were put in place to conserve the original intent of the film. This is extremely important, especially in the anime / manga genre, where sadly, lousy translations that mangle the product are not uncommon.     The Extras in the additional disc were not really worth watching, and I felt like they were there just as a way to make this a two-disc edition. Nevertheless, the rest of the product is so outstanding that I could not bring myself to lower my rating.

159102594X|4.0|I bought this after reading other reviews, and for once I am happy I did.  So, I won't repeat the summaries given by other reviewers.  No, it is not a pretty fantasy world, it's a world on the verge of total collapse.  No black and white, no good and bad, no hero on a quest, no pathetic maiden. Several story lines are started, characters and motivations are well established and we are well set up for the next installment.  What a relief that this author has not explained (using some tiresome cliched trick) the history, religion and economy of these warring nations.  What a treat!  We get to figure it out as we go along.  Lots of killing, cheating, lying, swearing, fear, and despite this, all of these characters still get up everyday and try to survive.  (without whining and sometimes without much hope)   And did I say that some of it was very funny?   It is part 1 of a trilogy, and does not stand alone (too many plot strands left floating in the breeze), but, for once, I didn't mind too much.  I even pre-ordered part II.
B000TGJ7ZY|2.0|The cover looks elegant, but the movie is a dull/disappointment. It appears to be a low budget video transfer.
0452284937|5.0|I enjoy historical novels and this one is especially entertaining.  Not only does it bring alive the time period but you really develop an affection for the characters.  I recommend this book not only for anyone who loves historical novels but also for young teen readers.  My daughter also enjoyed this book very much.
074356619X|5.0|I can't really express how great this book is. It has really helped my family and me tremendisly. It is so good I bought for everyone at my job and so did my mother. It is also a great holiday gift.I bought the CD because I travel to work everyday and and was able to listent to it going to and from work. Then I bought the hardcover for those who prefer reading. Hardcover is a little cheaper the CD. Also available is DVD. I haven't read book or saw DVD but I heard they are exact replicas of the CD.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I love music that makes you want to turn it and move around. But this CD by Corinne Bailey Rae is not that kind of cd. This cd is for days that you just want to relax and kick back. You will want to sing along with Corinne when you are feeling good. And when you are down you will enjoy just listening to her soulful voice. This is a good cd for anyone that enjoys easy going singing and simple but wonderful songs.
B000UR9T7I|5.0|I thought that Spider-man 3 was a tremendous comic book movie, Sure there are flaws; to many villians,not very plausible and maybe a bit to sentimental. Who ever stated that comic books are plausible? There is outstanding action all the actors are superb-Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) is a treasure. The special effects are outstanding and most of all the movie has HEART.    The BLU-RAY is a state of the art High Defintion presentation with exquisite picture and knock-out PCM sound. This is a must buy, now is the time to enter Blu-Ray High Definition!
B0009X7664|5.0|I've been intrigued by the idea of `To Kill a Mockingbird' for some time now.  Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.  It's hard to find this little treasure in any rental place, but recently our library received a copy and so I snatched it up the second it was available.  Now I must say that I have not read the novel yet.  It's on my VERY LONG LIST of `must reads' but I just have yet to reach it.  After watching this film though I may have to reach that book a little quicker than anticipated.<br /><br />I guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.  I was absorbed in this film from start to finish.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' broaches the subject of racism in the South during the depression but it's overlaying message of equality and acceptance are what we should all be taking away from this masterpiece.  The film revolves around a count case involving a black man accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch is the man selected to represent him.  The story is told through the eyes of Atticus' children, mostly his daughter Scout.  As Scout and her brother Jem battle their own quote-unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.  Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.<br /><br />`To Kill a Mockingbird' has been labeled a classic, and you don't call them classics for nothing.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.  The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.  I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.  Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.  He reacts as a father would, with subtleties when necessary as well as force.  His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.<br /><br />The two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.  For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.  Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).<br /><br />It was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.  He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.<br /><br />In the end I don't think there are enough good things to be said about `To Kill a Mockingbird'.  It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.  Don't wait any longer for `To Kill a Mockingbird' is one of those rare films that is actually WORTH the wait!hare of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This is an incredible album. Normally when I buy and album it's for three songs at most; I find it terribly hard to like most groups' offerings as a whole. Blackbird, however, is different.    For the first time in my 21 years of living I have no complaints about an album. Soul-grabbing lyrics, heavy drums and spectacular guitar riffs and solos mesh together to form perhaps one of the best rock albums of the last ten years. Fans of rock, hard rock, metal and so forth will all find something to like here. Songs \\"Ties That Bind\\", \\"Brand New Start\\", \\"Come to Life\\" and \\"One by One\\" are sure to become classics, and everything else to be found here will please all ears. You just can't go wrong with this offering.    Now the title song, \\"Blackbird\\". Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have the next great American rock ballad. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Freebird\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", pick the rock classic and this is right up there with them. A full 8 minutes long, the song moves from a somber acoustic guitar intro into a positively epic, heavy guitar-laden masterwork. Mark Tremonti's guitar prowess has been unleashed since Creed was disbanded; the two-part, 1 minute and 20 second guitar solo will have you reaching for a lighter. The solo and then the following climatic crescendo make you feel as though you should stand up and thrust your hands in the air, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Truly this is one of the great rock songs in recent memory and was certainly the right choice for the title track.    Alter Bridge's previous offering, \\"One Day Remains\\", was a wonderful debut album and landed them very quickly into the rock music scene. \\"Blackbird\\" breaks down all doors and screams at you to take notice; there's a new, wicked rock band in town, and you're welcomed to the party!    \\"Let the wind carry you home, Blackbird fly away! May you never be broken again!\\"
1416914285|5.0|If you are into vampires, werewolves, fairies, demons, and superhuman beings with unusual powers you'll absolutely love this book.  It was so good I stayed home a day of school just to finish it!  I literally couldn't put it down.  The story begins introducing a girl named Clarissa Fray who seems to be just an ordinary girl.  But after she witnesses a murder she finds out that the murderers are actually called shadowhunters.  They hunt demons and downworlders.  The most powerful Shadowhunter is Valentine.  A man who turned against his people and betrayed the very world he lived in. Now Clarissa's mom has been taken and her world is turned upside down. She has to befriend shadowhunters and downworlderes alike to save her mother!  The ending is great and unexpected!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Gloria Swanson makes `Sunset Boulevard' worth every second.  Her performance is brilliant, rich and iconic and so well fleshed out and poignant.  As Norma Desmond, Swanson sizzles with pure splendid charisma and commanding presence.  Swanson truly is the biggest draw to this film.  I have heard much about her Oscar nominated performance but seeing it for the first time is really beyond all expectations.  It is controlled and brilliantly constructed to steal the limelight from everyone else in the cast, which ironically was just what she needed to do.  Her character, the washed up actress Norma Desmond, is the only star in Hollywood in her own eyes and so playing her over the top and eccentric was just what Swanson needed to do, and she succeeded beautifully.<br /><br />The performances of William Holden, Erich von Stroheim and Nancy Olson are all fine as well, but this is Swanson's film and no one elses!<br /><br />The film follows equally washed up screenwriter Joe Gillis as he strives to make a living.  He's overdue on payments for his apartment and his car and the film opens with some men arriving to repossess his car.  Joe lies to get out of handing over the keys and in an attempt to conceal his car he parks it in what appears to be an abandoned garage.  The garage though belongs to screen-star Norma Desmond, an actress on the verge of her comeback (although she hates the term).  In fact she has written the screenplay that is going to bring her back to the top of the entertainment world and so she asks (or forces) Gillis to look it over, polish it up if you will.  Joe winds up living in her home, being her companion and in effect losing the life he had before all of this.  His newfound lifestyle is threatened when he sparks a relationship with the beautiful Betty Schaefer much to Norma's disapproval.  She wants Joe all to herself and she's willing to do everything in her power to make that happen.<br /><br />`Sunset Boulevard' beautifully exposes the ugly side of fame, the descent there of.  It captures the hysterical feeling of knowing you are no longer loved yet that unwillingness to let go of what you once felt.  Norma is obsessed with her past, relishing every moment she was Hollywood's `it' girl.  Her home, cluttered with pictures of her in her prime, her video library consisting of only her pictures, all of this a constant reminder of what she used to be.  The climax, especially the final frames, are just brilliantly done, for it's there we can see just how affected by her fall from grace Norma really was.<br /><br />Now, maybe it's because I just recently rewatched `Misery', or maybe it's because I am currently reading Stephen King's novel of the same name, but there is something about `Sunset Boulevard' that strikes me as very similar.  Norma Desmond's character is a far cry from Annie Wilkes but she is mentally unstable and demandingly selfish.  She may not use force but she elicits mental abuse in order to keep Joe confined to her company and her company alone and in the end it's her obsession with the man that drives her to harsh actions.  I know they are in no way the same but in some ways they are complementary.<br /><br />In the end `Sunset Boulevard' is a classic production, a brilliantly orchestrated masterclass of entertainment.  I would recommend this to just about anyone for, although it is an older film its values and message are still so common place today.  Just substitute the name `Norma Desmond' with any of today's `it' celebrities and you have a classic example of tomorrow's headlines.e of.

0671015206|1.0|Impossible to skim and even more agonizing to read.  Save money, don't spend more than you make, invest??? duh! say something worth the paper it was written on! tell me something worth the 30 minutes it took me to skim this book! Honestly,I'm young so I'm not a millionaire yet.  But I'm on the track I am going, I have a early retirement set.  But damn it, I love my Lexus.  I'm not willing to sacrifice my own safety so I can save some money.  I love designer products! I love going out and enjoying life!  Whats the point of money if your not going to enjoy it.  Do what your heart tells you is right and do what makes you happy.  But of course do it within your means.  Save enough for retirement.  Invest! Have a savings! Save enough for a rainy day!  But other than that if you have have enough money to buy a ferrari or a 2 million dollar house, or every toy out there, designer things, THEN DO IT! Just do it within your means!

I don´t need the DVD, I don´t need a Combo. Why?    Also, the HD-DVD side doesn´t include Spanish Subtitles.    That´s why the 1 star rating.

Wondering why the weather is crazy? wondering why there are weather records set every time you hear the forecast? There are reasons and Al gore is going to tell you about it.

B00004RD54|2.0|As a longtime fan of Lou Reed, one of the most puzzling things (for me at least) about his discography is the enduring popularity of this live album.  I guess I can see why people who don't really care for Reed might like this - as long as they have a taste for ultra-generic stadium rock.  But many supporters of this album seem be fans of Reed in general.  Funny, because the music found here is quite unlike most of his studio albums.  Recasting classic Velvet Underground songs isn't a horrible idea by any means, but making them sound like big brash hackwork IS a horrible idea.      Even [[ASIN:B00000739W Take No Prisoners (2-CD Set)]] - oft-criticized for the rambling quasi-comedy routines that extend the songs - is a far better document of Lou Reed live in the '70s than this.  The \\"Ecstacy\\" tour from 2000 was released as the [[ASIN:B000BI1YV0 Lou Reed - Live at Montreux, 2000]], which is phenomenal - really showcasing Lou's live sound.      I am in the extreme minority in disliking this album.  I gave it two stars because it is moderately interesting to hear Reed trying to be a loud arena rocker.
0060977493|5.0|This book is so entertaining and though you might be confused in the first chapter once you are done you will understand and realize how sad and beautiful this book is. It all becomes a great re-read. You will love Velutha, the Untouchable and the kids' innocence. Roy portrays love as an element that cannot be stopped by or should not be stopped because of the Indian caste-system.
0440238609|5.0|First, no, it is not anything like Harry Potter. It's much darker and more complex. If you're looking for more Potter, which are truly children's books, push on. Nor is it anything like the crudely sanctimonious, morally corrupt Narnia books. Secondly, artistic vision is so rare and precious that it is unreasonable and a great loss to insist that it must also toe the line of Christian indoctrination.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I really don't understand the negative reviews listed... Am a fan of the first 2 movies and I watched this movie for the first time over the past weekend and found it to be wonderful... great fun, great effects, great story. I think you have to take it for what it is and just sit back and enjoy it, not read so much into every detail, as it really is great film all round. I think the actors did a great job, and there was a lot of meaning to the story.. I mostly felt for Harry, and think James Franco did excellent in portraying him.. in all the films. Anyhow, I really liked this one :)
B000002TQV|5.0|Ask most Radiohead fans and they might tell you OK Computer is better, but if you've never listened to Radiohead before this is the place to start as its easily the most accessible of the post-Pablo Honey albums.  Thom Yorke's  voice alternates between anguished and wistful, and the band is tight, tight, tight.  You get radio-friendly acoustic gems like \\"High and Dry\\" along with guitar workouts like \\"Just\\", and just when you think the album is tailing off it closes with \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\", possibly the best song they ever recorded.  A tour de force and an absolute rock masterpiece.
B00005JPUL|2.0|This latest in the remake of the Body Snatchers theme is every bit as watered down and pointless as I'd been led to believe.  But I'm a die-hard zombie buff, a fan of movies that portray a world where mindless conformity is the real villain, and I couldn't stop myself from popping a copy in and sitting back to watch the devastation.<br /><br />For a story with so much symbolic possibility, \\"The Invasion\\" is surprisingly hollow.  Impatient to get to the creepy scenes where whole hordes of people stand emotionlessly on street corners, where crowds stare impassionately as \\"real\\" humans are dragged screaming into dark alleys and cop cars, the movie hustles the plot through the necessary set-up and straight into the gooey guts beyond.  You're not fifteen minutes into the film before a psychiatrist (Nicole Kidman, who is so distantly cold in the film, she seems like one of \\"them\\" long before anyone even knows \\"them\\" is a threat) is listening to a patient shakily describe her husband as \\"not my husband anymore.\\"  A little on the nose, don't you think?<br /><br />This kind of pushy terror doesn't really work so well, especially when what depth the movie does manage to muster is so awkward.  On the threshhold of the climax, Kidman's psychiatrist attends a fancy dinner and listens as several elderly men discuss politics and sociology.  A Russian fellow sitting next to her adamantly points out that being violent and illogical is what makes us human, and therefore should be embraced.  He might as well be wearing a name tag that says \\"HELLO!  I Am The Movie's Moral Mouthpiece.\\"<br /><br />And a weird moral it is.  After \\"them\\" inveigles its way into brains of most of the world, the televisions are aglow with reports of peace accords across the globe.  Old feuds are finally abolished, weapons are dismantled, walls are torn down.  Can't we all just get along?  Sure!  If we're all infected with the same mind-altering space-bug.  But we're not SUPPOSED to get along, you see, and that's why a world of mindless conformity is weird and wrong.  Right?  Right?  Someone please tell me if I'm right.<br /><br />The most pointed part of the story involves a rather silly twist about how the space-virus finally takes effect.  You can get the microbe inside of you, but you don't turn into one of \\"them\\" until you fall asleep.  Kidman's psychiatrist spends much of the movie trying to stay awake, desperately afraid that she'll nod off at any moment and then wake up someone else.  It's a neat little metaphor for our own world (the movie's way of saying \\"Wake up, people!\\") but it's also just as heavy-handed as anything else.  Ultimately, it becomes a sad command for the audience who, by the final neat-n-tidy scenes, may find themselves struggling to stay awake and wondering why they should.ess conformity is weird and wrong.

B000TEUSJU|4.0|Ahh, Caligula.  A very perplexing film.  For sheer shock value, films don't get much 'better' (better is a relative term, not necesarily to denote quality of work).  But this DVD set is great.<br /><br />Though there probably will never be an \\"approved\\" directors cut, the second disc of this DVD has something approximating Tinto Brass's vision of the film.  However, there are still plenty of obvious editing issues and overall it seems that due to rewrites and some other production issues, even this version is lacking. it's primary difference is that it drops the Bob Guccione \\"penthouse\\" sequences that feature the most explicit sexual scenes.  Brass's shots are pretty intense, though, and I would still imagine this film would earn an NC-17 rating, even in this form.<br /><br />There are tons of great extras, among them multiple commentary tracks (on the second disc) trailers and other new interviews in addition to deleted scenes (in their raw form, so it's kind of a bore to watch)  But I'd rather have too many extras than not enough.  And in general you come to appreciate this bizarre and troubled film.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|Repeating the storied history of this great band would be very redundant and unnecessary, as I'm sure everyone who is reading this knows of the unlikely circumstances that resulted in Down's revival. It's unfortunate that they had to reunite under these circumstances, but regardless, they have made a monster of an album with \\"Down III: Over The Under\\".    Despite being titled \\"Down III\\", this album does not necessarily pick up where Down II left off. There are certain songs that fit in very well with the rest of the Down catalog, such as \\"Three Suns And One Star\\", \\"N.O.D\\" and \\"His Majesty the Desert\\" (an ambient track not unlike \\"Jail\\") but on the whole, \\"Over The Under\\" is a completely different animal from it's predecessors.     To me, it somewhat feels like the \\"Southern-ness\\", of the music has been toned down to accomdadate more riffs that recall bands such as Black Sabbath (but there are still Southern-fried riffs to be heard). Phil's singing voice is a lot more clear this time around. He really _sings_ a lot more, instead of the raspy singing voice and half sing/half scream he used to use so often (both of which sounded good, though).     Standout tracks for me include the aforementioned \\"Three Suns And One Star\\", which certainly recalls \\"NOLA\\" and \\"A Bustle In Your Hedgerow\\", and \\"In The Thrall Of It All\\", a song that mixes Down's southern attitude with a Sabbath-y sounding riff to perfection, but songs like \\"Never Try\\" and \\"Nothing In Return\\" show the band treading unfamiliar ground, but with great results. The latter song reminds the listener more of Pink Floyd than anything else, and the former is a bluesy, mellowed out number, that may not have been heard before on the previous albums, but seems only natural.    It is worth mentioning that the production on this album is fantastic as well...just clear enough, but not overly polished, and doesn't take any of the edge away from the album. All in all, this is a very solid effort, and I look forward to hearing more from DOWN.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!<br /><br />I should start by admitting outright that I did enjoy many parts of the V for Vendetta movie (primarily those that remained truest to the source material), and by stating my agreement with other reviewers familiar with the [[ASIN:0930289528 graphic novel]] on which it was based that it is the best film adaptation of an Alan Moore work to date. In fact, had I never heard of the book, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more than I did (and I did appreciate it much more when I watched it for the second time on this DVD set). I am always impressed when any mainstream, major Hollywood studio produces something that encourages audiences to question authority, even when that message gets muddled by science fiction trappings, convoluted plots, and special effects. However, having read V for Vendetta several times, while I am willing to overlook some of the cinematic alterations made by the Wachowski brothers (creators of [[ASIN:B00000K19E The Matrix]]) as fairly harmless and perhaps even justifiable, there are two points in particular where I believe the film version totally undermines both the literary and political brilliance of the original story.<br /><br />The first point pertains to the portrayal of two of the story's central characters. By demonizing High Chancellor Adam Sutler, who came across as an almost laughable caricature of a raving, frothing-at-the-mouth tyrant, the movie completely robs the story of the psychological complexity found in the book. There, the party leader, Adam Susan, is motivated by an absolute devotion to his country, and an unfaltering conviction that fascism is the only way to save it from destruction. He sacrifices his own freedoms to serve his people (at least the white, straight, Christians among them) and is willing to tolerate dissenters like Inspector Finch as long as they continue to serve the needs of the State (something I could not imagine the hysterical egomaniac played by William Hurt doing). The villains are further vilified by the insertion of a cumbersome and confusing conspiracy plot into the story.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />It is eventually revealed that the ruling party orchestrated the nationwide plague that precipitated its rise to power years earlier. It was as if the Wachowskis were afraid their fascist state wouldn't be frightening enough to audiences if it was only responsible for killing civil liberties, so they had to pin the mass murder of 100,000 people on it as well. This changes the party leader from someone--right wing nut job though he may be--who heeds the call of his country in its time of need to pull it from the brink of the abyss, into someone who is motivated solely by the desire for power and a narcissistic need to have the world shaped in his image. This further casts the movie's High Chancellor as the most clich&eacute;d type of cartoonish supervillain. (It also further distances the story from reality and the kind of actual evil usually encountered in the world. Hitler did not have to orchestrate the economic collapse of pre-WWII Germany; he only had to exploit it.)<br /><br />And while the Wachowskis chose to demonize their movie's version of Moore's High Chancellor, they also decided to subtly humanize V. It seems as though they were trying to skew the character to play as more of a hero with audiences by making such changes from the book as narrowing the focus of V's vengeance to the party elite and those who personally wronged him, inventing a conscientious objection to killing their cronies (except when necessary), and having him anguish over his treatment of Evey and breaking down in sobs when she leaves him. Although less offensive to my intelligence than the over the top evil of Adam Sutler, this softening of the book's much more menacing and Machiavellian V nonetheless detracts from the brilliance and uniqueness of Alan Moore's story. The struggle between an all too human villain and a monstrous hero is much more thought-provoking than the black and white morality presented by the movie, which alleviates the audience from any need to question the rightness of V's tactics or feel pity for any of his victims. It is a credit to Alan Moore's writing that readers can still identify with and even like V despite some of his heinous behavior in the book--<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />most notably his torture of Evey, which somehow came across as much more brutal when presented by artist David Lloyd in the graphic novel.<br /><br />Secondly, however disappointed I was with the film adaptation's simplistic depiction of good and evil, what was even more tragic was its total failure to accurately convey the political ideology of its title character. I was horrified when the Old Bailey was blown up in the first 10 minutes of the film, and not just because V had inexplicably forgotten--despite his urging for us all to remember--that the target of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot had been Parliament. Even worse, I realized in that terrible moment that one of my two favorite scenes in the book had just been mercilessly obliterated. V's feigned conversation on the roof of the Old Bailey, in which he explains his reasons behind abandoning Justice for Anarchy, is one of the greatest monologues in graphic literature (despite some of the misogynistic terminology V employs) and makes it clear that V's goals are just as lofty as Adam Susan's (regardless of how one might feel about how either character goes about achieving them). Likewise my other favorite scene, V's address to the British nation via the State's own pirated airwaves, was transformed from a stinging indictment of political apathy and rousing appeal for personal responsibility, into an invocation of some unspecified type of democracy every bit as vague and uninspiring as any real presidential address. The choice presented to the audience of the film seems to be one between democracy and totalitarianism, which for most moviegoers means nothing more than preserving the status quo. In the book, which I consider the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism ever written (in comics or anywhere else), V presents readers with \\"another way\\" that offers \\"new life [and] hope reinstated.\\" In other words, V is offering society as a whole the same sort of transformation Evey underwent (in the book, not the movie), which is nothing less than a complete [[ASIN:1568382081 paradigm shift]].<br /><br />The final scene of the movie reminded my wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley's [[ASIN:143253811X \\"The Mask Of Anarchy\\"]], except without the sense of exhilaration. It's a shame the movie, unlike the book on which it was based, ultimately failed to evoke the same spirit as the closing lines of this poem:<br /><br />'And these words shall then become<br />Like Oppression's thundered doom<br />Ringing through each heart and brain,<br />Heard again - again - again -<br /><br />'Rise like Lions after slumber<br />In unvanquishable number -<br />Shake your chains to earth like dew<br />Which in sleep had fallen on you -<br />Ye are many - they are few.'thought-provoking than the black and white morality presented by the movie, which alleviates the audience from any need to question the rightness of V's tactics or feel pity for any of his victims.

1932100660|1.0|To understand Campbell and his group, GOOGLE  \\"PCRM and PETA.\\"  They are the same animal!  They are vegans promoting veganism. This is a sham.  Campbell would have you believe that all doctors and nutritionists promoting a healthy well-balanced diet including milk, eggs, lean meat, fish, poultry... are only buying into propaganda by the milk and beef lobbys in D.C.   This book spends little time on the China Study then leaps to conclusions that would have us eliminate milk/meat. It is a scary book, especially for growning children, unless you can get them to eat many, many cups of spinach a day.  He spends a lot of time defending that he is not a quack.  If he acts like one and sounds like one....
0618680004|1.0|For every belief system, there are fanatics, and I was disappointed to find that Dawkins is a fanatical atheist. He rails against religions with the same zeal that evangelical preachers rail against those outside of their flock. The only difference is that the book he thumps is \\"On The Origin Of Species...\\", his prophet, Darwin. And, just like any missionary greedy for converts, he speculates in a frighteningly dreamy way how ideal things would be if everyone believed what he believes. I do sympathize with the unbearable frustrations he and other atheists must face in this era when extremists and zealots seem to have the microphone, but \\"they started it\\" is a weak and sad reason for becoming that which you hate.    There are some very interesting and well-made arguments in this book, but they're drowned out by Richard Dawkins' own arrogance and venom. He seems to be in love with his own name and IQ in the way he constantly praises the irrefutable points he promises will come in future chapters, alludes to moments of brilliance included in his other books and drops the names of people more famous than him as a way to introduce quotes praising him that would be more appropriate on a dust jacket than in the middle of what's supposed to be a logical argument. Rather than simply making a clean and orderly argument for his case, he peppers his logic with an awkward frenzy of counterpoints to past and on-going disagreements he's had with people other than the reader.    What is the most distasteful is the condescending way he insists that the \\"educated elite\\" all are atheists, or if not, suggests they're conflicted and confused; the way he implies all other belief systems are for the weak minded. His \\"my way is the one and only truth, and anyone who thinks otherwise is dim or deluded\\" way of thinking is no different from that of any religion proclaiming to have the only truth, which makes it just as dangerous.    He argues that miracles are just things we don't have the science to explain yet, but that God cannot exist because our science doesn't allow for any such thing. In admitting we don't yet have a definitive library of science, the possibility must be allowed that we simply don't yet have the pieces of science that can include God. Dawkins praises the majesty and mystery of quantum-mechanics (one of my favorite playgrounds) but won't allow for for any kind of spiritual mystery. He brazenly proclaims he offers consciousness-raising arguments, while denying any kind of Universal Consciousness. If you're going to reference Schroedinger's Cat, doesn't it follow that God also is and is not until that moment we get to look into the unknown?    There are many arguments to be made in favor of atheism, and maybe now that he's vented his frustrations here, he can some day write a good book on the religion of science.
075640407X|1.0|900 page book. First in a series. Writes one a year. First book doesn't even get our 'hero' all the way to the present. Why should I waste any more time? Patrick is a wonderful writer, maybe even a great one. I think this is a case of too smart to have any common sense. Heck of an ego though. You need to be a lot better than this to keep me reading for three years. Do you know how many books I'll have read between now and next April when part two comes out? Do you seriously think I'm going to re-read the 900 pages of book one again so I can slide smoothly back into your world? What's going to happen is I am going to see that a new book is out, I'll curiously pick it up, remember how pissed I was AND that it will be another full year before the next one comes out and put it back on the shelf. Sorry bud, get an editor.  July 2010 update...looks like it's going to be four years actually....

B000AXSN5G|4.0|First off, I'm no Neil Young expert.  I'm simply someone who was introduced to Neil Young's music by a friend, some 15 years ago.  I don't own every Neil album- not even close.  But Young fascinates me, and when he releases the kind of album that I think I'll like, I buy it.         This doesn't strike me as the 3rd piece to a Harvest trilogy.  Neither did \\"Silver and Gold\\".  But this album comes closer to ranking with the 2  'Harvest' classics.  There's a lot more depth and added instrumentation to this album.         Some of the best: \\"No Wonder\\" is a powerful 911 song that even quotes Chris Rock, of all people.  \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth\\" is classic Neil, with brooding verses, and high intricate melodies that only Neil could reach in the chorus.  \\"This Old Guitar\\" is the best track on the album, and would've fit right in on \\"Harvest Moon\\".  It's in the \\"Hank to Hendrix\\" vein, and also features Emmylou Harris on harmony (oh, sweet Emmy).  The somber \\"When God Made Me\\" closes the album and includes a gospel chorus.         Two tracks, the title cut and \\"Far From Home\\", kind of threw me for a loop because they included horns.  At first, it seemed blasphemous.  Neil Young?  With horns?  But after a few listens, you realize it works, particularly on the bluesy, bouncy, title track.         The only thing I really don't like about the album is \\"He Was the King\\".  Do we really need to hear another song about Elvis?  It's carefree, fun, and actually not that bad.  It's just a personal pet peeve.  He wanted to throw something on here that wasn't so serious, but it just doesn't feel like it belongs.       All in all, a solid album that I won't hesitate to play.  Especially in October and November, when I get in my 'Neil' moods.:)

B000TEUSJU|5.0|It's about time!  A cleaned up version with all the extras.<br /><br />I give 5 stars for this release since it's clearly intended for people who are already familiar with the movie.  Haters go elsewhere to rant about bad the movie is.<br /><br />This edition is for those who want more of an over-the-top, surreal, gory, sexy, slutty version of Rome.  Everything else is just pale shadows.  You just know (or at least hope) the Romans were a lot more like the ones shown in this movie than any watered down version. ;-)

B00003CXC6|5.0|\\"Rashomon\\" is, without any hint of doubt, one of the world's greatest motion pictures. One can go on and endlessly extol the marvel that is Akira Kurosawa, his technical prowess, the unparalleled cinematography which is still ground-breaking after 50 or so years, the theatrical acting led by Toshiro Mifune that effortlessly heightens the dreamlike tone of the film, and the unsolvable mystery of the tale by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. Or you can forever discuss who among the characters is telling the truth.<br /><br />Technicals aside, critics have tried in vain to define what Kurosawa actually wanted to convey in this film. Can we define truth? Do we all see different sides of a story? Who is telling the truth? Some say that somewhere in the movie, there is a hint on what the truth was. Was there, in fact, a secret hidden in the movie? Outside of the most controversial films ever made, \\"Rashomon\\" provokes the mind of its viewers just by its  sheer 'complex simplicity'. And it is utterly frustrating to search for the truth in this film.<br /><br />Which is the main point-the truth, in its absolute purity, cannot be deciphered. We as human beings taint the truth with our own prejudices, concepts, and convictions. While this leads us to lose faith in man as the monk did, within us there is always that one little spark of hope that gives worth to a life filled with despair, deceit, and uncertainty.<br /><br />The ending was in fact leered at by critics, but why dwell on too much unresolvable gloom? This movie posed exactly that question.<br /><br />In short, you can enjoy \\"Rashomon\\" as a true perfection of a film, or as a philosophically enlightening parable.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Alter Bridge return with an even better album than their powerful debut! This disc is filled with great rock tunes played by a tight band and the ever impressive vocals of Myles Kennedy. On this new album guitarist Mark Tremonti is playing better than ever and achieves a nice wall of sound. His solos have also gained considerable improvement in style and sound. Despite Tremonti's increased presence, I really think that the highlight of this band is the intense vocals of Myles Kennedy. His dynamic voice is pure rock heaven and so enjoyable to listen to. Good solid production and a nice bonus track on the import version rounds out this great album. I think the only improvement could have been the flow of the album as I think the middle section is so strong that a bigger and more intense opening song would have been great. It feels like a long time since such a good rock band has been around and Alter Bridge is definitely one of the quality bands out there. Highly recommended to fans of original quality hard rock.
0380730367|5.0|Simply an excellent story.  Dennis Lehane is one of the best mystery authors today.  His writing is tight, has depth, has terrific character development, and best of all is pure fun and enjoyment.  The dynamic duo of private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro is a complex stew of raw emotions, intelligence, manic action and tender introspection.  Throw in the tough but gentle giant Bubba and you have a mixture to keep the reader engaged for many fun reading hours.  Mr. Lehane simply know how to write a great tale at ALL levels.  Prayers for Rain is the total package.  The plot is extremely complex at several different levels.  There is a lot going on but fortunately Mr. Lehane is masterful in keeping things straight and on an even keel.  The plot is multifaceted but generally it swirls around why an innocent, naive young woman committed suicide by jumping naked off a downtown Boston office building.  PI Kenzie becomes involved for altruistic reasons and as the plot unfolds more and more strange events happen.  As the story moves rapidly along Kenzie faces his own demons as he attempts to find out Why and Who the  dead young lady really is and why she died.  Reunited with his live-in partner, fellow PI Angela Gennaro, the story takes off on a roller coaster ride of raw emotions and intelligent super sleuthing.  Mafia Dons, ex-girl friends, hulking gentle giants, unethical psychoanalysts, sociopath killers, and a game of financial greed and you get the feel for Prayers for Rain.  It is really a thrill ride that a lesser skilled writer could not pull off.  Murder, mayhem, love, hate, money, and a few drinks;  what more could one ask for in a good murder mystery.    Violence, sex, and explicit language are woven throughout the book.  It is all extremely strong at times but also adds flavor and truth to this amazing yarn.  When you deal with the underbelly of society you must also expect to be exposed to the unpleasantness of life.  This book is not for thesqueamish so be forewarned.    Absolutely outstanding character development.  No more need be said.  Again a terrific read.  Can not be put down once you start so be ready.  A good choice for that long international flight.  Highly recommended.

B000W1V44I|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best CD's that the Backstreet Boys have ever released. Fabulous reviews would never do the album justice. Assuming you've never heard them before, their upbeat ballads and new sound will bring any boring day to life. It's a miraculous CD that must be heard! All fans and newcomers can appreciate their tunes! Words cannot express who utterly fabulous the Backstreet Boys have become. This CD will make them a legend of their time; it's quite remarkable!<br /><br />Don't let the singles that have released fool you; Backstreet Boys have released meaningful upbeat songs in this deluxe edition. This edition comes with a poster of the boys as well as two unreleased songs on the regular edition. Naturally, the boys are establishing not only their unfortunate break from Kevin Richardson, but they are also debuting the reinvention of their sound and vocals! Though the Backstreet Boys have a fully matured and bubbly CD, there are distinct pieces of songs that continue to identify the Backstreet Boys I have grown up listening to!<br /><br />From the passionate \\"Downpour,\\" to the commanding \\"Treat Me Right,\\" fans will be stupefied to hear the Backstreet Boys progress in this new album! I've had it for months and still listen to it avidly. None will be disappointed with the sound of the Backstreet Boys and I recommend this to newcomers and fans alike! The Backstreet Boys continue to prove why they are \\"Unbreakable\\" through this album filled with catchy tunes!

This flash is a substantial improvement over the on-board flash, and the ability to angle the flash 90 degrees will make serious improvements in your photos. This flash is small enough to easily travel with, and won't have you looking like someone with way too much equipment. For me, it's just right due to its simplicity and size. Also, the review at KenRockwell.com really convinced me to get this flash.

Now that its clicked I can say that its my favorite A7X album of all time.  A brilliant masterpiece!
0525950079|5.0|There are many themes explored in this book, the most obvious being that of sibling rivalry. There's the architect Merthin and his evil knight brother Ralph. Intelligent Caris and her petty sister Alice. Hard-working Gwenda and her sinister brother Philemon. Earl William and his corrupt brother, the Bishop. Wonderful Edmund and his selfish sister Petranilla. And then there's cousins, uncles, nephews, and sons.  Another theme explored is how reliance on faith instead of reason can hurt everybody. This is true today.  Finally, there is a lot of interesting information about medieval construction, be it bridges, towers, arches, or buildings. And as a doctor I enjoyed learning about medicine in the middle ages--especially the university-trained physicians knowing much less than the apothecaries, nurses, or barbers.  Yes, there are sex scenes (these may have been added at the behest of Erica Jong, one of the people thanked in the forward) but by no means do they constitute the majority of the book. They are actually a very small part.  One minor detail  that bothered me is the references to corn being grown. Corn, as we all know, did not arrive from the New World until the sixteenth century. Perhaps \\"corn\\" refers to another grain?  I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. If there seems to be a lot of characters, just wait, because when the Black Death arrives, the cast of characters shrinks very quickly!

1401300529|5.0|David Halberstam's first major publishing success was in 1972, with the publication of \\"The Best and the Brightest\\" - one of the best books on the Vietnam War.  The present work is very much informed by that earlier book, for it shows how domestic political considerations went into military decisions in Korea as they did in Vietman.  Halberstam conducted many interviews with regular soldiers: privates, sargeants, and lieutenants.  He is very sympathetic of the sacrifices they made.  As before, he denounces politicians and generals such as MacArthur who had many delusional notions about themselves and their abilities.<br /><br />The Korean War has been forgotten by most Americans, indeed many have probably not even heard of it.  Lasting from 1950 to 1953, it is often characterized by non-Koreans as simply a flare-up of a larger Cold War, but for the Koreans it was a civil war.  As Halberstam tells it, it occurred mostly from miscalculations by both sides.<br /><br />The first miscalculation was when Mao and Stalin decided to let the erratic and bullheaded Kim II Sung invade the South in an attempt to unite the two Koreans.  The only thing stopping him were some lightly armed South Korean and American troops under UN leadership.  The North Koreans had some easy victories capturing Seoul and pushing the South Korean and American troops south to the Pusan area.  (Halberstam's coverage of these battles is especially good.)<br /><br />Enter MacArthur at the battle of Inchon.  If there is a main character in this story it's MacArthur's, as the bulk of the book covers his entry into the war up to his unceremonious dismissal in the spring of 1951.  The last two years of the war in which the American forces were led by the brilliant General Mattherw Ridgeway are given less coverage.<br /><br />The one compliment that Halberstam has to concede to MacArthur was his landing at Inchon behind enemy lines.  This masterstroke turned the tide of the war.  MacArthur was already treated by many as a demigod in his seat of power in American-occupied Tokyo, but his success at Inchon made him even more irreproachable.  Halberstam exposes MacArthur as someone who made disasterous decisions based on doctored intelligence.  In October of 1950, as American troops were pushing the North Korean forces toward the Chinese border, MacArthur promised that the troops would be home by Christmas.  Instead the troops were stuck the entire winter in 30 below temperatures without the proper clothing or gear.  The scene in which frozen corpses were being fit into the back of a truck like a jig saw puzzle grapically illustrated the eponymous \\"coldest winter.\\"  MacArthur wanted to cross the Yalu River into China and risk World War III.  Bravery came easy to MacArthur, for he never spent an entire day in Korea.  It was as over-hyped as his famous return to the Phillipines during World War II.  Truman, however, did not want to risk World War III and decided to fire MacArthur.<br /><br />These tales of hubris, questionable intelligence, and military decisions based on domestic political considerations certainly resonate today with the war in Iraq.  But unlike Iraq or Vietnam, Halberstam considered the Korean War a worthy cause.  Given the fact that South Korea is a free and prosperous country, and that North Korean is an impoverished totalitarian state, we would have to agree.  South Koreans in the 1950's were very thankful for the sacrifices Americans made for their country.  Today, however, we are considered warmongers and considered the world's most dangerous country, whereas North Korea is looked upon as an eccentric and ineffectual cousin.  Which makes one wonder: who has changed more in the intervening years, America or South Korea?at of power in American-occupied Tokyo, but his success at Inchon made him even more irreproachable.

B000UVT3OI|2.0|I don't think I've ever seen any artist with so many greatest hits packages, all of which contain basically the same songs.  There's a reason why Garth won't sell the new songs on iTunes.  He wants you to pay $12 for 4 new songs.  All the other songs in the collection, you should already have, if not on his individual albums, than on at least a half dozen different greatest hits and box set packages.  Garth is now playing his fans for fools with all of this marketing garbage.  He is trying to fool us into thinking we're getting a lot of value in these different box sets/greatest hits packages.  Remember the Wal-Mart exclusive Lost Sessions disc in the box set from 2 years ago?  Yeah, we paid $25 for that one disc, but Garth's marketing team tried to make us think we were getting a great deal by throwing in all the old catalog as well..but we've already gotten the old catalog, several times over in various other marketing gimmicks such as this.  Granted, they did release Lost Sessions as a stand alone album, but it was several months later after they had milked all the people they could on the box set.  Mark it down right now.. anywhere from 3-6 months from now, you'll be able to buy the 4 new songs in this collection from iTunes.  Team Garth just doesn't want you to do it yet because they want you to pay what in essence is the full price of a CD for just these 4 new songs.  Garth, this song and dance is getting old.  Release a new standalone album with new material, instead of trying to get us to buy the same stuff we've been buying over the last 15 years.  I find that as I get older, I start losing respect for people that are always trying to pull marketing tricks on me.  Lets not go down this road again Garth.  I'm a huge fan and I've been with you since '89, but enough is enough.
B000W1V44I|5.0|This album is another awesome album from the Backstreet Boys. Even if you weren't a fan of their older style, you just might like their newer style. In my opinion this album is just about as good as \\"Never Gone\\" (which is my favorite album). Kevin is gone (at least for now) but they haven't lost anything in their music. This one is a little more upbeat than \\"Never Gone\\". People can say their day is over all they want, but the truth is, even though they're not hugely successful anymore, they're still putting out some great music that people are still willing to buy! I strongly recommend this album to any backstreet fan or anyone who liked \\"Never Gone\\" (if you don't have it, buy it too!)
B000URDEB0|5.0|Powerful symphonic, female-fronted metal - more varied in texture and tone than Evanescence or Lacuna Coil, overall a lot more musically interesting.  I definitely want to explore other Nightwish albums after discovering them through this recent release.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|First I will say that I've been a fan of Britney's music since day 1.  When this album first came out, I had to think hard about whether or not to buy it..I like \\"Gimme More\\" but thought the clips I heard on YouTube sounded 'rushed'. But about three days after its release, I gave in and bought it cause it was only $9.99 at circuit city. I was surprised by how good it is. It's pretty addicting actually..the key songs are \\"Gimme More\\", \\"Break the Ice\\"(lashing out at the media), \\"Radar\\",\\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\", and \\"Hot as Ice\\". This album definitely is quite a bit different than her others (which is another reason i was contemplating getting it) but still sounds like her at the same time. In my opinion her self titled album \\"britney\\" was her best album. This one isn't as good, but it's a cd worth buying or at least listening to. Better than \\"In the Zone\\" which had some not so great songs on it. Anyway, my point is it's pretty darn good and if you've been thinking about it...go for it. Chances are you won't be disappointed.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|It has been a long time since I've listened to a new Alan Parsons' album. The last one was [[ASIN:B000002VNU Try Anything Once]], and I figured he'd run out of creative gas. That particular CD has long since disappeared from my library, and the follow-ups never arrived. But the recent remaster/re-issues of the classic [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 I Robot]], [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]] and the deluxe [[ASIN:B000OFP8O4 Tales of Mystery and Imagination]] made me wonder what the old boy'd been up to.<br /><br />A perusal through the local indie records store AKA in Philly brought this out of the racks, so I picked it up. Popping it into the discman, I am surprised at just how much like the old APP \\"Return to Tunguska\\" sounds, complete with an ace solo from David Gilmour. While \\"More Lost Without You\\" isn't as good as any of the classic singles, it doesn't suck, either. But then comes a major belly-flop; allowing Crystal Method to re-imagine \\"Mammagamma.\\" While it is easy to conceive some of those Parsons electronic instrumentals (like \\"Sirius\\" or \\"I Robot's\\" title track) as being deep influences on the young CM'ers, it wasn't necessary.<br /><br />That same grievous error comes again when \\"A Recurring Dream Within a Dream\\" rehashes that song and \\"The Raven.\\" To say it comes up short is to be kind. On the other hand, \\"You Can Run\\" sounds good enough to have come from \\"Turn of a Friendly Card\\" or \\"Ammonia Avenue.\\" There are plenty of moments here that will remind you of the reasons you liked APP back in the day, but there are also those who will find this stroll into electronica turf both disturbing and unlistenable. While I wouldn't go that far, the superfluous remakes do it in for me. And I have never been fond of music that made itself dependent on too many sound effects (barking dogs, falling rain, baby noises)...so when John Cleese hammily concludes the CD as only he can by saying \\"now come along, sonny,\\" I tended to agree.<br /><br />My hope is that Parsons has this bug out of his system. It sounds great and fills your room with some great sound - but is instantly dated. And I need great music to go along with it. Here, that path is not validated.sounds great and fills your room with some great sound - but is instantly dated. And I need great music to go along with it. Here, that path is not validated.
B0000019PA|5.0|It's strange because I usually get tired of listening to the same song or album after the newness is gone, but ITAOTS just never gets old. After my first listen I was completely hooked and have since enjoyed Neutral Milk Hotel's other albums and unreleased songs. But I find that Aeroplane is the one in heavy rotation, and that it is the most theraputic and captivating. it is the sort of album that you want to recommend to everyone but don't because you fear that it will not have the same profound effect on them. If I had the energy to go into any sort of depth about the content I could write for pages, but because I lack the eloquence and insight of one Jeff Mangum, I prefer to let the music speak for itself.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is an excellent collection and makes a great gift for anybody, and I think in special for people who like or do any kind of scientific research. It is amazing how people can reach excellence in what they do and when they work in a team. It is also great to see that the American government invested  hard in the project. This is an example of how competition and cooperation drives excellence in science and technology. The must see in my opinion are Disc 1 part2, Disc 2 part5 and Disc 4 part10.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I went out and bought this CD, headed for the beach and sat and listened to both discs; IT IS FABULOUS!!  I forgot how much I have missed the Eagles!!! So go get this CD, sit back, relax and ENJOY!!!!!
0316067598|4.0|In \\"Lone Survivor\\" author Marcus Luttrell (with Patrick Robinson) relates in 390 pages the heroic stand at \\"Murphy's Ridge\\", near the hamlet of Sabray, Afghanistan in 2005. Out-gunned at approximately 30-1, Luttrell's SEAL team, commanded by Michael Murphy, battled Taliban and al Qaeda terrorist fighters to a standstill 4 times until all of the SEAL team members were dead except Luttrell. Badly wounded, his escape and evasion tactics to avoid capture or death were clear thinking and noteworthy.<br /><br />Mechanically, the narrative was a disaster. Clich&eacute;-ridden and clumsy, the early chapters relate Luttrell's childhood in East Texas and his SEAL training which civilians might find interesting, but veterans can skip on through it. As the reader approaches mid-way, Mr. Luttrell opines on several issues including the Left leaning Main Stream Media, the ridiculous Rules of Engagement for our fighters in the region and other geopolitical issues for which he is grossly under qualified. The fact that he is correct is not the subject at hand.<br /><br />Continuing, Luttrell related the incredible bravery of team leader Michael Murphy as he purposely exposed himself to get cell phone reception to call for assistance. A support and extraction team was swiftly sent to the area but the chopper was hit by rockets with the loss of all hands.<br /><br />Befriended by local Afghans, Luttrell  was finally rescued by Green Beret and Ranger search teams.<br /><br />For his uncommon valor, Murphy was posthumously awarded the War On Terror's first Metal of Honor. Three others, including Luttrell, received the Navy Cross, the nation's second highest combat award for Navy and Marine Corps personnel.<br /><br />Mechanics aside, this story and this book are important. It is unlikely the heroic sacrifices of these war-fighters would have ever been fully told without it. I'd rate it 4 and 1/2 stars and well worth the readers's time.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V for Vendetta is an excellent film from the Wachowski Brothers, and not your typical comic book film. What's immediately striking are the parallels the government propaganda and terror in the film have with certain western governments in the world today. It's an inspirational film, and gives some hope that people can unify in taking back their lives from lying, pathocratic government officials in a non-violent way. People shouldn't be afraid of their government...    A must watch for everyone!
0553381407|4.0|well written and insightful. i immediately thought of at least ten people who must read this.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|An out of the ordinary French film set in Paris and probably best viewed without much foreknowledge of the plot details.    The film follows Andre, a man deep in lies and financial debt, who meets a new and (on the surface) very different companion, Angela, who gradually opens his eyes to love and his real self.    It's sometimes thought provoking, beautifully shot in black and white, humorous, emotional, and a welcome breath of fresh air alongside the formulaic sequels out of Hollywood.
0790729407|2.0|I wanted this to be a great movie but it definitely fell short. Rather  than weaving an engrossing story I thought this was more of a series of  scenes strung together for historical accuracy.  Maybe it was the directing or maybe it was the way it was edited - it just seemed hollow.  The acting fell short for me as well, which is disappointing with such a great cast.  Too bad - lots of material to work with.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was the last animated pciture that Walt Disney worked before his death.  There are quite a few funny moments in the movie, especially the scenes with King Louie and Mowgli.  The vultures are also funny as they try to decide what they're going to do next.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews here. I am also a completely nutty Beatles fan and I would certainly buy anything that is worth buying, but this is too much of a price increase for a booklet of photos that have been published somewhere somehow through the years. I also agree that this booklet will be available some time soon in Ebay or similar places for a fraction of this extra value.  I will just buy the regular edition.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|A beautiful cast: Netrebko is a beauty inside and out and her voice shows it. Villazon is delightful, singing and acting seems natural. I have the Pavarotti  version, and although Luciano's voice is great, his presence is wooden. This DVD never lets you get out of the moment; a pleasure to own.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Its GnR and Panic! At The Disco and Nightmare Before Christmas and yet still its Avenged Sevenfold with an amazingly new sounding album unlike anything else before it. Its still heavy yet melodic and has great guest vocals and musicians such as Sebastian Bach. The album kicks off with a song the sounds like GNR's \\"My World\\" meets \\"Civil War\\" and then rips into a song that reminds you of Sevenfolds' second studio album, Waking the Fallen. The third song \\"Scream\\" sounds like the second single while the fifth song \\"Gunslinger\\" should of been their first single. It starts off as a slow cowboy-acoustic sounding set and then rips into this heavy metal song sounding much like their third studio album, city of evil. From then to the ninth track is nothing too too special (although still very good). The ninth track has Sebastian Bachs wails in the background with a Panic! at the disco soundtrack yet you can still hear the Rev working his magic too. Its a great track, and probablly one of my favorites.    Its tough to compare this to City of Evil, which commerically succeeded exceptionally well. This album is more of a underground great new sounding rock album that sets them apart from everyone else and lets you know they are not going anywhere!
1582701709|4.0|I have just purchased this book having seen it reduced in my local book store.  I was put off buying it before now because of the negative comments on this site.  However, I was drawn (haha) to the book and thought \\"oh buy it - it can't hurt!\\".  Well let me tell you - I am really, really enjoying it.  Now people seem to be offended by the 'get rich quick theme' they allegedly see in one of the chapters.  I think these critics are not looking at the books message as a whole and would rather nit-pick at what they see as an afront to their sensibilities!    The message I received from the book (and I am not yet finished reading it) is to have a positive outlook on life.  Stop being negative, stop telling yourself that you don't deserve something and just go ahead and ask for it.  I haven't received any miraculous lottery check in the mail and most likely I won't - but that's not the point!  Life is difficult enough and the stressors we put on ourselves can and should be taken away.  I like the point they made about starting off your day in a bad way by, for example, stubbing your toe.  Who of us have not done that same thing and thought we were doomed for the day?  I know I have.  The book tells us to change our attitude, or 'frequency', as they put it and restart our day with a positive attitude!    I could go on forever, but I just want people to take this book with a happy heart and see the positive message it is sending.  Don't get wrapped around the axel about money and all that - I don't know how to put it as eloquently as others have but I hope that this gives you a good opinion of the book - Give it a try - it's made me feel a lot more upbeat about things and given me hope that the world isn't out to get me and that I have a hand in the direction my life goes!    Enjoy!  Lolly.
B000Y179KO|2.0|I just wasn't impressed. No decent upbeat tunes...very political--almost annoyingly so (I can only handle so much--at least be a little more subtle about it). A little too cliche for me.     I bought one copy for me and a copy for my mother's birthday...and now I am going to get another gift for her. Perhaps my expectations were too high...you just can't top Hotel California. Plus, I think the album is lacking something without Don Felder.     Just my opinion though.
0525950079|1.0|Never received it in the mail.  Purchased at Walmart and will let you know later how it was.  I can't wait to start.  Loved the first book.
B000002IZM|5.0|A collage of dark and light with as much depth as the movie itself. Vangelis  fans alike, this is a must have, a classic.
068987474X|1.0|I have not read this book, but now I guess I have to.  Why? because my girlfriend (6 years) has and now she's acting differently towards me--maybe even seeing someone else at the behest of this book.      I can say this:  This author does not know every man's feelings in this world.  Do yourselves a favor ladies, don't take this book seriously.  Every PERSON in this world is different--man or woman.  I am already upset that I've been placed in some category of \\"men\\" that must behave in so or so fashion otherwise I'm not into her.  Think of it, I'm now researching this stupid book--because I am into her.    Life is not as black and white as this book seems to suggest.  Sure men like to pursue women, but don't women like to pursue men?  I know that I enjoy being pursued at times.  I think books like this are dangerous.  They put ideas into people who are vulnerable.  Let's face it--if you're reading it, there may be problems going on in your relationship--but those problems don't ALWAYS add up to \\"he's just not into you\\".      Sometimes I have not called a girl because I wasn't into her, sometimes I've not called a girl because I felt that playing it slow would be a better move and rushing things would scare her off.  How can the same action have completely different motives behind it and this book still have any value?       I think the author here is playing on the idea that if you're reading the book there must be a problem anyways...so leave.  And hey, maybe you should.  But don't just assume that your partner dosn't care and cut ties--just to avoid further pain or being dumped.      One thing that this book may have accomplished--I now think that she's just not that into me.  Is it true or did some stupid book make her think that I don't care?  Either way--the effect may be the same...a lost dream.
0307346617|3.0|I was so hyped for this book - I love this stuff! I'm also a huge fan of the Zombie Survival Guide. While the premise was promising, I found the execution lacking. I really wish the author would have done more linguistic research. When reading an interview of a someone from China, for example, I would try to picture a television interview with sub-titles. The problem is, the words used and the phrasing/cadence were all very much American - for ALL interviews; none of the text read as authentic to me and that really jarred me out of the writing. That and the fact that all American's sound like drunk Texans with the need to swear constantly put me off. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind swearing at all. It's just that I wanted more variety and real personality in the people being interviewed, but they all read like a slight variation of the same character.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I am totally in love with this CD.  I downloaded it to my ipod, and run on the treadmill.  It is perfect for keeping you going.  I personally love her song \\"Piece of Me\\".... Britney always has a \\"F**k You\\" song, and this is it.    Excellent job Britney~!
B000UNYK3A|5.0|I abhor the current trend of films that are labled \\"horror\\" films.  They are sadistic, in your face filming and editing, suspenseless, excessive gore replacing scares and desensitizing a viewer's reaction to violence.  These are the many reasons I avoided viewing HOSTEL.  After all, it seemed to be the film that started the trend.  Critics and the conservative crowd called it \\"torture porn\\".  I refused to give in to the tastes of the current movie-going crowd that spent their hard earned money on these abominations.  Give me Todd Browning's DRACULA, James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN, Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS, William Castle's HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, Roger Corman's THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH, Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY, Any HAMMER STUDIOS/AMICUS STUDIOS film, etc........  \\"Horror\\" films used to mean a menacing atmosphere, shadow and light, an air of tension, characters that you cared about, taking time to slowly let the \\"horror\\" reveal itself, etc...... They left you feeling unsettled, not nauseous.  Granted, I love William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST, Tobe Hopper's THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Richard Donner's THE OMEN, Brian DePalma's CARRIE, John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, Dario Argento's SUSPERIA, Ridley Scott's ALIEN, Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET - All prime examples of how \\"horror\\" started changing in the 1970's.  The blood quotient had increased and the intensity level had risen several notches, but all the \\"classic\\" elements were still there.  The violent and gory parts were inherent to the stories and served the plots and characters.  The recent \\"horror\\" films of the past few years, in my opinion, were worthless and an insult to the intellect of the lovers of \\"horror\\" movies.      I accidentally came across HOSTEL on cable right when it was just beginning to roll it's opening credits.  I decided to give it a shot.  Especially since I might have remotely misjudged it and it may have a few redeeming qualities.  Right from the beginning, I didn't see any erractic jump cuts and \\"attack your senses\\" filming.  It took the time to let the viewer get to know the three lead male characters and to have fun with them and laugh with them.  Their sex and drug adventures were real, believable, daring and dangerous.   I thought the commaraderie between the three actors was great and playful.  And when they started to disappear into thin air I started getting scared.  Real scared.  And by the time they arrived at the warehouse of torture you are too involved to look away.      Eli Roth did an excellent job of pacing the film, building the unbearable suspense and cutting away during alot of the torture scenes and not lingering on gore effects.  (Yes, the eyeball scene was the most excessive, but it's always good to have that \\"one scene\\" that everyone talks about afterwards.)  But when the last student captured manages to escape and tries to flee the facility and decides to go back to rescue the girl - I could barely catch my breath and my nerves were wrecked!   And the final \\"revenge\\" scene was the perfect plotline to satisfy all of our \\"primal survival\\" needs.   Eli Roth took all the \\"classic\\" elements from the 50's and 60's horror films and combined them with the intensity of 70's horror films and mixed in contemporary, modern characters and dialogue.  The result:  A modern-day hommage to the Italian horror movies from the 60's where a group of travelers would happen upon a castle where the scientists/doctor who lived there would trap them and torment/torture them.  (Usually so he can \\"borrow\\" their eyes, skin, limbs, etc.... to graft to his horribly mangled daughter.  Who may or may not be alive.)     In other words, I horribly misjudged HOSTEL.  And deprived myself of experiencing it in the theatre.  I have since gone out and bought the Director's Cut dvd and I have to say that I liked the unrated version more and definitely the original ending, not the alternate ending supplied on the dvd.  Luckily, the unrated version that I had seen is also available on the Director's Cut edition with the original ending. Picture and sound are top-notch.  Special Features are great and informative.    HOSTEL is a contemporary masterpiece of horror/suspense filming and I loved every minute of it.  It totally satisfied my need for scares!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf starring the hilarious Will Ferrel, James Caan, and Zooey Deschanel is a cute and funny holiday film. I wasn't expecting much before I watched it, but Elf is a gem from beginning to end. Ferrell's performance brings both wide-eyed innocence and hypersensitive drama to the extreme. Parts of this film are so silly but enjoyable. This is a new holiday classic, just as good as A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation. Elf will have you weeping like an infant from laughing so much. Defintely one to add to your holiday collection. Enjoy!
B000002I8H|5.0|I had never heard of this album before stumbling upon it on amazon. This is actually a very good CD. Sarah Vaughan and the altered arrangements actually work very well together, and the result is a funkier R&B sound than either Sarah or the Beatles have usually. I really dig this album. Give it a chance (check out the audio samples), a few friends I have shown it to really enjoyed it as well, even preferring a few of her versions to the originals! (sacrilege!)    Best tracks:    Get Back  And I Love Her  Eleanor Rigby  The Fool On The Hill  You Never Give Me Your Money  I Want You (She's So Heavy)  Blackbird
B000VNMMR0|4.0|This is easily one of the best movies of 2007.<br />Primarily because it is true to its original style of a DIY cop.<br />Secondly if you watch closely enough, you see the villain is not exactly a villain, but a kind of anti-hero.<br />A guy who tried to show Pentagon that their systems could be hacked.<br />But what did they do? Put a gun to his head...<br />I liked the villain until the time he robs Social Security.<br />(already the government and corporates are busy trying to rob social security from us, and now this...).
B0000AKCLS|5.0|I have all of Joe's CD's and I think this is the best of a very good bunch. It is probably the best blues album he has put out-he covers almost all the great blues musicians. His guitar playing is excellent though if you prefer more of a rock sound you might want to try his \\"You and Me\\" release.

1401300529|5.0|This last book of David Halberstam must be read - and read very carefully - on several levels. The first and truly outstanding level is as a history of certain combat operations in the first few months of the Korean War. Here Halberstam conducted extensive research and, more importantly, many interviews with survivors of the first horrible battles from June, 1950 through February, 1951. Only a few ground battles are described and little attention is paid to the air and naval combat operations and virtually none to the fantastic logistics that supported this unpopular war.<br /><br />  Halberstam is superb at weaving his interviews of aging survivors into a narrative of military mismanagement that still hasn't received the attention it deserves. The heart cries out to read of the miseries American troops were forced to endure in addition to the needless deaths and injuries caused by poor or nonexistent leadership, military or political.<br /><br />  If Halberstam had restricted himself just to this story, \\"The Coldest Winter\\" would be a classic war history.<br /><br />  But he didn't. Instead he broadened his scope to include General Douglas MacArthur. Once seen as an unassailable military icon, MacArthur's reputation has deservedly suffered over the years. While he was fully capable of occasional military genius, he was an egomaniac who believed himself to be the center of the Universe and progressively encroached on the political leadership of the nation. For this he was relieved of command by President Harry Truman in 1951.<br /><br />  The problem is that Halberstam appears to be trying to paint the Democratic Party of the time as something other than what they were: the losers in the budding Cold War. FDR had essentially given away Eastern Europe to the Soviets. Practically speaking he had little choice because the Soviets had troops on the ground, but hundreds of millions of innocents were meekly consigned to Soviet oppression. Truman ratified the Soviet conquest when he ascended to power. The Democratic administration was riddled with Communists, ranging from actual spies who were providing the Soviet Union with our most valuable secrets to mere hangers-on who truly believed that the Soviet Union was the worker's paradise that could be replicated in the US.<br /><br />  But Halberstam doesn't want to admit this.<br /><br />  Instead he tries to paint the Republican opposition as the evil enemy. It is true that the Republicans of the time had their share of characters who acted out of self-interest and aggrandizement, but Halberstam barely mentions the not insiginifcant number of Democrats who were their allies. For example, Halberstam rails against Joseph McCarthy, the perennial punching bag of the left-wing, without mentioning a single word about John F. Kennedy's close relationship with McCarthy. Halberstam doesn't attempt a complete whitewash, but the uninformed reader will definitely be mislead.<br /><br />  While Halberstam attempts to make Communist infiltration of the US government sound like a fairytale, he conveniently neglects to mention the Venona Project which clearly showed the truth of many of the allegations about Communist infiltration made at the time.<br /><br />  But Halberstam has a poltical purpose in mind here and it becomes more apparent when he keeps referring to Vietnam. Halberstam and Vietnam are closely related. Halberstam made his journalistic bones in Vietnam - and there are a number of people who believe Halberstam was a fabulist whose invented fictions led to the overthrow of the Diem government. (See [[ASIN:0521869110 Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954-1965]].)<br /><br />  Likewise Halberstam recyles disproven left-wing canards about the current administration.<br /><br />  Halberstam considered himself an intellectual, a man whose wisdom surpassed that of the masses. In many ways, he is a civilian MacArthur, a man whose self-concept was far removed from reality.<br /><br />  Halberstam was one of the originators of the so-called new journalism, which Russell Baker in the Afterword describes as \\"the use of fictional techniques to interest readers in complex matters that many might otherwise find forbiddingly tedious\\". As might be expected, the use of fictional techniques produced such journalistic luminaries as Stephen Glass, Janet Cook and Dan (\\"Fake, but accurate\\") Rather. It also produced David Halberstam whose technique Baker describes as remaining \\"faithful to the facts but not [encumbering] the story with constant explanations as to how the facts were obtained\\". In other words, using Halberstam's technique, you could lie in ways great and small.<br /><br /> Halberstam has written a powerful and moving book recounting eight critical months of the Korean War and a few of the many ground battles of that period. Had he stopped there, it would have been a classic. By layering on his personal poltical views, he makes the book less enjoyable, demanding of close scrutiny. For people who want military history, there are better choices. Those who know their history will find it easy to spot and dismiss Halberstam's excursions into political partisanship. Only those who don't know their history will be mislead by Halberstam.<br /><br />Jerrythe Afterword describes as \\"the use of fictional techniques to interest readers in complex matters that many might otherwise find forbiddingly tedious\\".

B000VBJEEG|4.0|First off, this review is for the movie, not the DVD.  I'm a little worried about the short list of extras for (this version of?) the DVD.  I own the Ratatouille PC game (which is too funny, especially if you suffer from underdeveloped hand-eye coordination like moi) and there are GREAT extras on that I still hope to see on the DVD.<br /><br />The animation and direction were fantastic.  Even if this kind of movie doesn't interest you, see Ratatouille somehow if only for three scenes: the 100 Rat Dash into the sewers, when Remy goes from the sewer to the rooftop, and Anton Ego's reaction to Remy's dish.<br /><br />As a rat-nut (pet rats are very clean, squishy, funny, and sweet - though they do keep you on your toes), I especially appreciated that the rats were fairly rat-like (for animated movies).  They didn't wear clothes or sing, they bit, they could only understand each other, they were nonchalant about thieving, and I think there's even a little night-shine in Remy's eyes in one scene.<br /><br />Also, as someone interested in art and creativity, I truly appreciated the movie's exploration of one being true to one's art, despite obstacles and public opinion and the difference between true art and pandering to the lowest common denominator.<br /><br />I've read some of the criticism and it seems to fall into three general categories:  I hated this movie b/c rats are gross, same fish out of water story in so many other animated features, and not funny enough.  First off, if you hate rats why would you see this and can't that be set aside to evaluate the other aspects of the movie?  Second, the fish out of water story is classic in all types of movies not just animated ones and you've gotta respect the stones on the folks who made their fish out of water a rat who likes to cook (given the animosity toward rats).  Finally, I would agree that there's a bit too much of Remy vs. rat-dad Django and Remy chatting with Gusteau (himself really), and these scenes aren't hilarous.  However, I'll take these scenes and the funny parts of Ratatouille over the constant, predictable, trite, cringe-worthy pop-culture jokes in other animated features.  I'm so relieved there was only one really obvious anti-French joke.<br /><br />I don't think this is the best Pixar feature, but I do think it's second only to The Incredibles.  I rank them this way b/c The Incredibles is more accessible (who wouldn't want to be a superhero?) and tighter in terms of plot.  Some of my favorite things in the world are cute, fuzzy rats, so how's that for objectivity?se scenes and the funny parts of Ratatouille over the constant, predictable, trite, cringe-worthy pop-culture jokes in other animated features.

B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|When i first heard \\"Tim Mcgraw\\" i really liked the song but wasn't enough to buy her album and become her fan but after \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" she really got me! i really can relate with some of her songs and that's the reason why she's making so much sucess...people can relate with her songs and she's trying with sucess be a good role model to her young fans and that makes me adimire her a lot...  She's so successful now that they have this wonderful idea and made this deluxe ediition, a class A deluxe ediition.  They puted 3 extra songs and a great compilation of videos that will make all the fans more than happy.  I give her label props because they did a great job here and made a perfect Christmas gift for all her fans, this is more than i could ask for and i'm even more fan than before, Taylor has great skills, not only singing but acting too, all her music videos are great and she's more talented and pretty than all these pop singers, that's for sure.  Highly recommend for all Taylor fans and for all the people who like Taylor and still didn't bought the album.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|The movie itself is great - quite worthy of the Pixar name.    But the DVD is lacking (yes, only one DVD).  \\"Lifted\\" is here along with another fun short titled \\"Your Friend, the Rat\\", and there are 3 deleted scenes, but that's it for the specials - no director commentary, nothing from the actors, nothing about life at Pixar, and there's not even a new trailer for Wall-E.

BLACKOUT is by far her best effort... very very grown up.  with the help of Danjahands (protege of Timbaland) pharrell williams and the backing vocals of keri hilson (of timbalands \\"the way i are\\") she came out with the hottest club LP madonna wish she had!      hands down my favourite track is 'hot as ice'.... she shows sass & class... crazy track heavy rotation in my ride....    my other favourite track is 'radar'... at first i thought she said operator.... LOL!!!! great dance track....    other bangers: 'gimme more' (without the performance), 'why should i be sad' with pharrell, 'piece of me', & \\"heaven on earth\\"... honestly i didnt hear a track that i didnt like... she came with it... and im surprised she had the time to do this LP at all....    i hope nobody gave up on britney and give her one more shot... especially her fans that gave up... i kno i was almost one of them but at the end of the day she was about the music and she does deliver....    5++++ stars out of 5: way to get the haters back BRIT!!!!!!

074325144X|5.0|There is a lot of 'fluff' in this book to make it as long as it is.. but once you wade through it.. you will discover a new way to run pain free.      I have been recovering from a knee injury for over 2 years where it really hurt to do just about anything to include sitting for long periods of time or even walking.  I am a very active person so I tried a couple of times to start jogging and other activities again but I was just in too much pain.  A friend of mine who is a marathon runner told me about this book and how it really helped with his knee pain.  I picked up the book, read it and did what the author suggested.      I AM AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE!!!  Within 2 weeks I was running 3 miles everyother day with NO PAIN!!! And if I start to notice some pain I actually look at what I am doing and it is either my posture changed or the position of my feet (pointing more out than straight)are the cause.  I adjust accordingly and the pain is gone.  Within 2 months I ran my first 10K in 45:40... Within 3 months I am running just about everyday.  My running schedule is now 4 miles, 4 miles, 10 miles, day off, 4 miles, 4 miles 10 miles day off (etc)...     Once you get to the technique that the author offers in this book you will see an amazing change.  I used to have to listen to music when I ran.. now I enjoy NOT listening to music.. 'listening to my body' respond to changes in my running and clearing my head...    I suggest this book to anyone who wants to run pain free and learn to enjoy running.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|It's unfortunate that good movies often receive bad reviews simply because they don't live up to the hype.  This was a good, fun movie.  Granted the original Matrix was much better but how much of that was its newness?  My only disappointment was that up to this point in the trilogy, every phenomenon had a scientifically plausible explanation.  That's why it's SCIENCE FICTION.  But when Neo gets to the real world and finds he can control the squiddies, that's no longer science - it's magic - and that's cheating.  It's no longer science fiction but fantasy.  Both are great genres, but you have to stick to one or the other.  Those are the rules.  If they had come up with a better explanation (like there are multiple layers of matrices) that would have been just fine by me.

B000WQW988|5.0|This performance cemented Nirvana's reputation as being more than just a band of the moment, it elevated Kurt Cobain to the pantheon of great musician/songwriters and convinced any naysayers that he truly was THE artist of his generation. Songs from Nevermind and In Utero like \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"Something In The Way,\\" stripped to their skeletal parts, revealed facets previously unnoticed, and a depth the studio versions failed to capture. Nirvana's Unplugged performance became the measuring stick against all other Unplugged performances, and nothing held a candle to it. It has become a moment in time for a generation, and it was no wonder that MTV replayed the performance ad infinitum when Kurt was found dead in his home several months later. It also happens to be the one performance that bears repeat viewing, which owes much to the careful orchestration of the set and song choices by Nirvana. From the start with a \\"ABOUT A GIRL\\" a song from the first Nirvana album, which Kurt states 'no one really knows this song,' to the cathartic final performance of \\"WHERE DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT\\" culminating in a primal scream, which still gives me chills when I see it.     I can't wait to see this again, and again...
0525950079|4.0|Follett's 'sequel' to his masterwork \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is a sprawling novel encompassing an amazing amount of momentous events that spiral around the many featured characters.  There are rich people and poor people, nobility and serfs, and clergy and secular.  And there are very few multi-faceted people among the lot of them! They're all either good, or bad.  And the bad people do lots of lieing.  Everyone engages in lots of sex, and somehow, almost none of the main characters succumb to the plague!<br /><br />The writing is mostly excellent, though Follett does get overlong in his descriptions of church sermons in the last third of the book, and battle scenes in the middle third.  There are many interesting facts about middle ages lifestyles, and many interesting storylines to follow.<br /><br />Recommended, but not if you're in rush.  This is over 1,000 pages long!
B00005JLIU|4.0|I cut my B-spoof teeth on this movie as a preteen...and learned to practice the obscure art of elevator dancing.<br /><br />Even though, as seen by countless other reviews ahead of mine, there are a few random musical bits thrown in for no reason...overall, the movie as a whole does a good job of presenting the audience with an \\"innocent\\" side of social satire.<br /><br />I was sitting at my desk singing \\"cheery bim-bim beery bim-bum bum beery bum beery bum I diddle-um\\"...the whole time I was typing this.  Evidently even the unneccessary parts can be important.

B00003CXD5|4.0|Take one down and out American in Mexico Fred C. Dobbs (played by Humphrey Bogart). Mix in a young drifter in the same boat (played by Tim Holt) and old codger of a gold prospector (played by Walter Huston) and put them on the trail of gold up in the hills and you have a classic story of greed, corruption and betrayal that can only be resolved one way. Right? Directed by John Huston (who plays a bit part as well) we have here an exploration of what the word gold has meant through out the ages in the dreams of humankind. You know that no good can come from this and in the end those riches will do more than one man in. Of course, Bogart is already familiar with what greed can do to the human spirit having played the gumshoe Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon where everyone was ready to cut each others throats for the damn bird. Be aware this Bogart role puts him down in the mud with the rest of us. But as almost always he carries off the role in fine fashion.
6300216047|3.0|This movie was hardly watchable, with being so boring and moronic. But, it had a few good lines in what apparently was a complicated and way out story line. The people who wrote this more than likely were on drugs, which explains it being made in 1968. I did watch the whole thing, which is more than I can say for about 80% of the movies put out today. The special effects deserve the highest rating and is why this movie is worth watching, and maybe again for that matter. Fonda was not great in one of her first pictures, the one thing you can say is she wasn't nervous, although I did find her annoying.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Another classic black and white Billy Wilder take on the foibles of human nature. This time it is an aging silent screen actress, played to a tee by Gloria Swanson, sitting alone out on the Boulevard still in disbelief that they added sound to the movies. She is still waiting for her big comeback. Enter one young aspiring Hollywood screen writer a little down on his luck, played here by a young William Holden (who also acts as narrator) in need of a big break or at least a little room rent. One knows with this improbable mix this tale cannot end well. Add in a superb performance by Eric Von Stroheim as the long suffering but devoted servant (and former husband) of the old silent screen queen and you know why this is one of the all time movie hits. One of the few films worth seeing more than once.
0765357151|4.0|In 1976, the pandemic plague devastated the earth.  Most people died while those who survived were biologically altered into nocturnal blood drinking in-humans.  That is everyone except for one remaining purebred; Robert Neville never changed as he apparently was immune to the plague.  He is the last surviving Homo sapiens, but the converted see him as being different as the monster tied to the dead legendary past who must die.  He endures his ordeal through alcohol, but his loneliness is driving him insane as each night he considers giving up until he meets his first non vampire friend since the disease, a dog fearful of him.<br /><br />This book actually contains a reprint of the 1954 classic novella I AM LEGEND in conjunction with an upcoming movie (note that Vincent Price starred in the 1960s film The Last Man on Earth based on this tale) and ten short stories that are entertaining and well written, but feel like padding to almost double the size of the book.  Readers will understand why some of the great horror writers like Stephen King consider this novella one of the best ever as it crosses science fiction with horror yet holds up well because the bottom line is this is a character study of the human need for companionship as well as a Frankenstein like question as to just who is the monster?<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0439954630|1.0|I read and absolutely loved The Golden Compass, found The Subtle Knife petulant and struggling to push an agenda but still somewhat enjoyable and was not even able to get more than few chapters in before the lack of the only character who thought anything through (Lyra) drove me stop caring about the book entirely. Lyra's uncle's childish temper-tantrum against God has grown to an astounding low level in this volume.<br /><br />My problem with this is not simply that he wants to kill God, it's that no one ever expresses a reason for wanting to do so.  Pullman's blind fury against C.S. Lewis and Christianity has goaded him to write a novel that cannot seem to bother with rational or contextual thinking.  All of the conservative Christians are jumping onto the bandwagon as to an atheist writing children's books, but I don't see that as the problem as much as an atheist writing children's books poorly and getting media attention from the people that don't want it to get attention because they have to make it a bigger deal than it is by boycotting it.
0446577391|5.0|With their recent escapades (see THE COLLECTORS and THE CAMEL CLUB), the DC based Camel Club members have gained some powerful friends who support the revealing of government official wrong doing and avarice; but also some equally powerful adversaries who prefer secrets remain that way.  However, the club's associates are like the Three Musketeers when it comes to protecting one another. When honorary assistant Annabelle Conroy get in trouble after conning about forty million dollars from Atlantic City casino king Jerry Bagger (started in THE COLLECTORS), the Camel Club protects her from him; he plans to do to her what he did to her mother, kill her.<br /><br />However, Camel Club leader Oliver Stone has a new greater threat to contend with.  Homeland Security Agent Harry Finn, a loving father and spouse and highly regarded patriot, is methodically killing the survivors of a CIA Cold War cell Triple 6 out of retaliation for arranging the death of his father, an alleged traitor Raymond Solomon.  Oliver when he was the late John Carr was part of that unit.  The other club members (Reuben Rhodes, Caleb Shaw, Milton Farb and honorary member Secret service Agent Alex Ford) are divided over whom they need to protect as both threats are deadly serious.<br /><br />The speed of this thriller is incredible as both subplots move out at an extraordinary pace yet the key players seem fully developed and plausible especially Harry and the Camel Club members.  Both Oliver and Annabelle recognize the problems they respectively face as each knows they are in trouble, but in some ways welcome the confrontation.  Underlying this strong thriller is a caution that government secrets are rarely security issues, but more likely the hiding of embarrassments usually caused by a lack of adequate checks and balances on arrogant imperial power.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000092Q4U|5.0|this album is unbelievable.  its a few notches above ashes of the wake and sacrament sucks anyway so...
0143034901|4.0|Allow me pause to vent, fellow reviewers:  Exactly what did you expect from a book with a Stephen king blurb across the cover? A new Cervantes, Joyce, Proust, Faulkner? Please.  I bought and read this book knowing full well that I was entering a realm that did not aspire to \\"high art\\" but was meant to pull me into a breathtaking, mesmerising story.  This feat Zafon accomplishes superlatively well, so much so that, having finished it, I feel haunted by wartime Barcelona and the characters who populate it in this book.<br /><br />Anybody reading this review will know the plot by now.  There's no point in my rehashing it. But I would like emphasize the facets that make this a great story rather than a merely good story:<br /><br />1. The Erotic, to which nobody seems to have given much heed.  Daniel's (and Julian's) growth through adolescence and the mysterious, beatific visions of women with whom both of them first fall in love are handled most elegantly here. - No, I'm not elevating Zafon to the rarified airs of Dante and his Beatrice or Petrarch and his Lara. - But without this element of poetic eroticism permeating it, the story would fall flat.<br /><br />2. The bibliophilic theme, which others have (inevitably) noticed.  If you have not felt at times as Daniel has, \\"...like someone who has escaped into the pages of a novel because those whom he needs to love seem nothing more than ghosts inhabiting the mind of a stranger\\" at least a few times in your life, then you will miss out on much of the story's allure<br /><br />3. The Stylism, which has been called everything from overwrought to self-indulgent.  It is.  It is also luscious and delightful.  What, again does one expect from a book of this sort?  Do readers deem that a Hemingway-like sparseness would actually make it better?  Au contraire, it would ruin it!<br /><br />In summation, a wonderful, gripping tale that leaves one reflecting upon many things, not the least that, \\"We humans are willing to believe anything rather than the truth.\\"

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I got the CD and I think her songs are great.  She definitely does not have any sappy songs on this album.  It's definitely a dance album. It doesn't matter what she does, in the end her music rocks.      She has this unique voice that people can't really imitate. Overall, I think this is one of the best albums she has.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold's statement that this album would be \\"harder\\" or \\"more metal\\" than \\"City of Evil\\" was a lie, but that is a good thing.  What they have composed is, quite possibly, the most innovative album since Kanye West's \\"College Dropout\\" and the most ambitious since Drive-By Truckers' \\"Southern Rock Opera.\\"  There is no single song that can be easily categorized into any common genre which the music industry currently uses; consequently, the album as a whole could easily be considered a mess (and is by many stupid critics).  Yet, the truth of the matter is that the album is a testament to the creative talents of M. Shadows and Sinister Gates.  They push the envelope with each song, and the result is a near-masterpiece, which is so different from \\"City of Evil\\" or \\"Waking the Fallen\\" that to compare it to them would be superfluous.<br />The album begins with two of the most typical A7X songs, \\"Critical Acclaim\\" and \\"Almost Easy,\\" though the Axl-like rant (see \\"Get in the Ring\\") on \\"Critical Acclaim\\" and nearly war-mongering lyrics are something new.  \\"Scream\\" is the third track and it begins the departure from the norm, but the true break from the metal-roots comes in track five - \\"Gunslinger,\\" another war-based track that starts off like a 80s Bon Jovi power ballad featuring the acoustic guitar, but then goes into a much more G n' R-like semi-fury.  Tracks six, seven, and eight are all fantastic and each different in its own way, but it's the final two songs that truly distinguish this album from any that you've heard.  The ninth song, \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" is a magnum opus of the Macbre, inspired by Browning's \\"Porphyria's Lover\\" and Poe's \\"Annabel Lee.\\"  The song sounds like something from a Tim Burton film - it is obvious that Danny Elfman (who does all the music for nearly every Burton film) was the inspiration.  It is an amazing eight-minutes song that is truly the \\"Evil Dead\\" of songs.  You gotta hear it to believe and appreciate it.  It will help to have the lyrics in front of you.  My personal favorite is the final track \\"Dear God,\\" which features the steel guitar....that's right, the steel guitar.  The track sounds like a Jason Isbell original and sounds fantastic.  The only possible letdown on this track is the barely passable lyrics.<br />This is one of the most creative albums that I have ever heard.  I have listened to it well over a dozen times since I got it, and I get a different experience through it each time.  Despite the critics' quick reaction, I do believe that this is an album that can stand the test of time.  It is a near-classic.ave the lyrics in front of you.

B000VS6P9Q|3.0|As a Dylan collector/completist, I disagree with those who believe \\"only Dylan does Dylan best.\\"  One measure of the greatness of Dylan's work is the extent to which it lends itself to interpretation.  This has led me to not only collect the work of the man himself, but also to amass a collection of nearly 900 cover versions of Dylan songs.  I was REALLY looking forward to this collection, but I'm sorry to say it is a major disappointment - which is hard to fathom given the level of talent involved.  There are a few high points here:  John Doe's \\"Pressing On\\" and \\"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine\\", Iron & Wine & Calexico's \\"Dark Eyes\\", Sufjan Steven's odd take on \\"Ring Them  Bells\\", and The Black Keys \\"The Wicked Messenger.\\"  Most of the rest is, quite simply, uninspired and (horrors!) boring.  Here's hoping the film is far better than its soundtrack.    An addendum:  I've now seen the movie and, unfortunately, have to place it in the same category as the soundtrack: a major disappointment.  If you love Dylan and you love art film, then you should see it - realizing it is a flawed but valiant attempt to capture the \\"thin wild mercury\\" of The Man. Otherwise, don't waste your time. The high point: Cate Blanchette is astounding - if the Academy Awards actually rewarded talent, they would simply hand her the best actress statuette today and forego the rest of the charade.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm a Bronte fan. The dark love stories and Byronic characters in their books are so compelling compared to Austen's characters and their simplified lives, although entertaining as they were. So North and South is appealing as it is neither Bronte nor Austen but lies somewhere in between.    It must be said that Elizabeth Gaskell and Charlotte Bronte were friends and Mrs Gaskell was also much respected by Charles Dickens. Her stories reflected realities of life at the time. This is a story for all ages, of love, prejudice, class struggle and loss in changing times.     While the film stands well on its own, there were a few decisions I thought were difficult to agree with completely.     First, the decision to make John Thornton appear brutal when he and Margaret Hale first met was quite harsh on the character. Thornton was a sensitive gentleman, no matter how hard he was on his workers. He was also a doting son, a responsible brother and a fair master who had had his fair share of hard times but had always returned with his integrity intact. However the film makers explained there was no better way to show why Margaret had disliked him so much from their first meeting. In the book, he was rather timid when they met.    Secondly, Mr Bell's and Thornton's relationship was not cold at all in the book. Thornton showed him kindness and it was Mr Bell from whom Thornton had learned of several important things including Mr Hale's passing. All this was due to their mutual respect which did not come across in the film.    Last but not least, the kiss. No, I have no problem with it except it had taken place at a train station in broad daylight in the Victorian era. Yes, surely they had kissed in the book (\\"...some time of delicious silence\\" didn't mean they were checking their mail quietly) but imagine how delicious it could have been had it been in private in each other's arms as it was in the book! And it would've still maintained Victorian decorum. Well, as least Victorian decorum away from public eyes.    Having said all that, Richard Armitage was perfect as Mr Thonton, from his oh so tall, dark and handsome looks that drove women to completely jam up BBC website to his John Thornton demeanour. Daniela Denby-Ashe was also every bit the Margaret Hale that had been written.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|One of the best Beatle albums -- this album goes perfect with the show in Las Vegas which was fantastic........... it is a must see!!!
B00082IJ08|5.0|Ok, so writing a review praising Demon Days seems almost redundant at this point, but it can't be helped.  This album is superb.  Demon Days has it all - catchy melodic lines, clever raps, beautifully layered synth instrumentation, dance-worthy beats, intelligent lyrics - what more could you ask for?  Each track is an innovative, genre-stradling work that stands alone nicely, but the album is best when taken in its entirety.      As you can probably ascertain from the other 300+ reviews, Demon Days has a bit of a somber streak, with lyrics that indict humanity's frailty and corruption.  I'm not going to go into the whole \\"it's an allegory for the Iraq War\\" theory - lyrical analysis is for English class, not Amazon reviews.  :P  Furthermore, this album retains its charm through multiple listens.  Even though I was a Gorillaz fan prior to Demon Days, I originally got this album for \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" and \\"Dare.\\"  Both songs are excellent, but I find that the songs I paid little attention to at the get go are now the tracks I enjoy most (Kids with Guns, Oh Green World, November has Come, etc.).  Like I said, it ages well.      So when it comes right down to it, who should buy Demon Days?      If the playlist on your MP3 player consists solely of top ten hits, then this album probably isn't for you.  However, if you enjoy an eclectic mix of music, appreciate songs with both a surface and a deeper meaning, and have a bit of a melancholy soul, by all means buy Demon Days.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Our favorite cuddly corn-fed agitprop filmmaker is back to stir up some doo-doo, spark national debate and make pinko-hatin' `murcan \\"patriots\\" twitch and shout.<br /><br />Moore grabs our attention right out of the gate with a real Bunuel moment. Over the opening credits, we are treated to shaky home video, depicting a man pulling up a flap of skin whilst patiently stitching up a gash on his knee with a needle and thread, as Moore deadpans in V.O. (with his cheerful Midwestern countenance) that the gentleman is an avid cyclist- and one of the millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance.<br /><br />Moore doesn't waste any time showing us the flipside of the issue-even those who are \\"lucky\\" enough to have health coverage often end up with the short end of the stick as well. A young woman, knocked unconscious in a high speed auto collision and rushed to the ER via ambulance, was later denied coverage for the ambulance ride by her insurance company because it was not \\"pre-approved\\". She ponders incredulously as to exactly how she was supposed to have facilitated \\"pre-approval\\" in such a scenario (so do we).<br /><br />The film proceeds to delve into some of some of the other complexities contributing to the overall ill health of our current system; such as the monopolistic power and greed of the pharmaceutical companies, the lobbyist graft, and (perhaps most depressing of all) the compassionless bureaucracy of a privatized health \\"coverage\\" system that focuses first and foremost on profit, rather than on actual individual need.<br /><br />Kind of a downer, eh? Well, this is a Michael Moore film, so he gives you plenty of opportunities to laugh through the tears.  Most of the levity occurs as Moore travels abroad to the socialized nations of Canada, Britain, France and Cuba to do a little comparison shopping for alternate health care systems.<br /><br />The classic Moore moment arrives as he sails into Guantanamo Bay with a megaphone and a boatload of financially tapped Ground Zero volunteer rescue worker veterans who are all suffering from serious respiratory illnesses. After learning that the Gitmo detainees all enjoy completely free, round the clock medical care on the taxpayer's nickel,he figures that the state of the art prison hospital wouldn't mind offering the same services to some genuine American heroes. Of course,the personnel manning the heavily armed U.S. military patrol boats in the bay fail to see his logic, and they are unceremoniously turned away.<br /><br />Undeterred, he decides to give the Cuban health care system a spin. They are welcomed unconditionally, and receive prompt and thorough care. Is it a propaganda move by the Cubans? Probably. Does Moore conveniently fail to mention the \\"minuses\\" of the Cuban health care system (or the Canadian,British and French systems for that matter)? Sure-but who cares? The \\"plusses\\" greatly outweigh the \\"minuses\\", especially when compared to the current health care mess in the U.S. (at least he's showing enough sack to step up and give us some alternatives).<br /><br />Moore makes his point quite succinctly-the need for health care is a basic human need. It should never hinge on economic, political or ideological factors. As one of his astute interviewees observes, it is a right, not a privilege.<br /><br />In fact, this may qualify as the least political of Moore's films to date. Consequently, it may disappoint or perplex those who usually anticipate that a Moore film will give them a vicarious \\"let's go stick it to The Man\\" thrill. Things are not so black and white this time out; the issue is too complex. I don't think there is any filmmaker out there who could sum it all up in less than 2 hours, but Moore has done an admirable job of scratching the surface, and most importantly, he manages to do so in an entertaining and engaging fashion.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|For the most part this is a really great album - with \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" alone being worth the price of the whole CD. It has to be one of the saddest, most beautiful songs I've heard in many many years. Such feeling, and great melodies in so many of the songs. I love Death Cab, and I've listened this over and over and over... you will too.
0618526412|4.0|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is an ideal book for teachers to educate their students on the influential effect of characterization and an author's ability to create tension and evoke sympathy in the reader. Carson McCullers' compelling mastery of characterization and manipulation of the reader's feelings create a world filled with loneliness and disappointment.    One instance where McCullers manipulates the reader's feelings occurs when different characters in the book visit Singer in his room. Four different characters, Dr. Copeland, Biff, Mick, and Jake discuss their problems with Singer in his room on a regular basis. The trouble is that they are not discussing, but merely telling Singer their problems. They use Singer as a sound board and he just nods serenely. They enjoy this time because they are allowed to speak their mind with no inhibitions and feel as though Singer genuinely agrees with them. In reality, they are deceiving themselves by projecting their imagination of how they want him to respond onto him. Unbeknownst to the reader, McCullers creates enough ambiguity in the reader's knowledge of each character that he begins to pass judgment on the characters according to how he wants them to be. This example provides educators an opportunity to demonstrate the author's ability to influence the reader's emotions by portraying certain events in such a way that they conflict with the reader's desires.  McCullers continues to use the reader's wants to force them to feel the characters' loneliness through John Singer's lack of response to his visitors. The audience wants Singer to respond to the people. The characters are crying out for help and Singer continues to sit and never replies. McCullers refuses to give the reader that satisfaction or else the reader's imagination could not fill in the holes of ambiguity. If Singer were to talk to the people and help them out with their problems, then the tension would relax and everything would work out in the end.The space and distance between the characters that interact on a daily basis create the loneliness both they and the reader feel. This helps students realize that authors intentionally illustrate characters and events in a very specific way in order to elicit certain emotions and expectations in the reader.   The reader's expectations are further heightened as McCuller provides situations in which the conflict could finally be resolved. One night, Singer meets three other mutes and begins to converse with him. This event provokes a sense of excitement in the reader because Singer may finally find someone in which he can relate. His loneliness may be resolved at last. But in the end something is amiss and Singer wants nothing to do with them. And so, the reader gets pulled in and then crushed. Likewise, both Jake Blout and Dr. Copeland live in this small town, love Communism and Marxism, and spend their lives fighting for it. They eventually run into each other and only need to share their thoughts to each other, but they miss the opportunity. They skip over the only person that could relate to their situation and continue to live their lives in sorrow and alone. Because all these experiences promote a sense of hopelessness and loss, students can easily see that authors carefully place situations throughout a book that tie back to a specific objective and feeling.   In addition to unresolved expectations, McCullers successfully uses characterization to elicit sympathy in the reader. For instance, the reader especially bonds with Mick because she is the closest to Singer and like a child. She is the musically talented struggling girl that the readers yearns to see succeed. The beautiful diction by which Mick speaks and the faith felt in her causes the reader to love her. Yet she is tainted. She smokes against the reader's will. She has one shot at a musical scholarship but loses it. There is one shot in the book for a true loving relationship to occur between Mick and Harry and it ends with a fumbling, inarticulate sexual intercourse. The great potential in Mick fails and the reader is left feeling lost and hopeless. Having the opportunity to seriously relate to characters lets the reader emotionally invest in the novel and form a deeper connection with the book, thus making it a better read and profound teaching tool.  Another instance of McCullers' effective use of characterization is seen in Dr. Copeland. Dr. Copeland is the epitome of a crushing figure. He is described as a wrinkled old black man that only wants to help save his people. He has this passion for Marxism and names his children after communist philosophers. Yet his children do not understand him and he cannot seem to get through to anyone he reaches out to. The reader experiences his extreme frustration as he witnesses his family being broken apart and is powerless to stop it. He is constantly attending to the sick while coughing and spitting into a handkerchief. The appeal to the reader's emotions leaves him feeling helpless as he watches Dr. Copeland get sicker and sicker and become a martyr for his people. As teachers and students read The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, they will notice they have developed a new sense of sympathy toward the characters and will regard the book on a more personal level.  Additionally, this novel exudes tension and loss that the reader can feel through McCullers' character Bubber. Bubber, later known as George, symbolizes the reader's relationship and experience with the novel. In the beginning, Bubber is an ignorant and innocent toddler that is merely starting his life in the community. Although he has been introduced to the harsh society, he later learns the true loneliness and cruelty of the world. When Bubber accidentally shoots Baby in the head, his whole world changes. He is loses his innocence and is no longer called Bubber, but his real name George. He has responsibilities and his family treats him as an adult. Comparatively, the reader begins the novel assuming it will be another happy ending story. Experiencing the events through the eyes of various characters exposes the reader to a realistic and depressing life. Therefore, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is unarguably an optimal instrument teachers can draw on to demonstrate the power characterization has on influencing the audience's feelings.   McCullers' extraordinary use of characterization and control of the reader's expectations allow her to create a society full of conflict and tension. She uses each character and his or her experiences to evoke a specific emotion in the reader. These skills collaborate together to form an effective novel that is a perfect tool for teachers to instruct their students in the great power of characterization while students can simultaneously enjoy an enthralling and thought-provoking book. It is greatly recommended for its usefulness in educating students in the power of both one author and one book's ability to instill a new sense of the need for acceptance, love, maturity, and understanding.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|This album stunned me the first time I listened to it.  I have been following Meat's recording career since I was 13 years old (when Bat Out of Hell 1 was released).  This new Bat has to rank as one of his best records ever...second only to the untoppable 1978 original.    Why then, did it get almost no radio airplay?  Why are sales nowhere near the heights of Bat II, released back in 1993?  I can only think this: like most things in life, sucess only comes from a perfect mixture of talent and fortunate timing.  When Bat II was released it was shortly after the classic Bat Out of Hell had its initial CD release, and was selling like crazy again.  This boosted popular interest in Meat Loaf right before the release of the sequel.  It was the perfect storm.    I enjoyed Bat II, but I really feel the new Bat III is superior.  The only stumble on the new album (my opinion) is the title track; it is just not the right style for Meat Loaf's vocals.      But after that...oh, my!  From the rocking \\"In the Land of the Pig, The Butcher is King\\", to the victorious \\"Alive!\\", to the poignant \\"If God Could Talk\\", to the heart-rending \\"The Future Ain't What it Used to Be\\" this record is a tour de force!      If you love Meat Loaf -- buy it.  If you have never heard a Meat Loaf album before, start here.  It's that good.
0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx has treated his fans and the memoir-consuming public to a real, live diary of a dope fiend.  The Heroin Diaries recounts a dark year in the life of the Motley Crue bandleader/bassist.  During 1987, the Crue was on top of the world with the Girls, Girls, Girls album release and world tour, but Nikki was hopelessly addicted to heroin (and coke, and pills, and casual sex), and living a caricature of the rock star lifestyle.  (In perhaps the lowest moment of the book, he steals the girlfriend of a member of his management team.  Well, he doesn't \\"steal\\" her.  He meets her, wows her with his rock star style, bends her over some equipment backstage, and moves on.  Without any regard for the relationship he just destroyed.)<br /><br />I had some hesitations about an art-style book written in diary form, with a smattering of lyrics and ink-blot-style illustrations.  I'm a huge fan of The Dirt, and at a quick glance, this appeared to be more of a vanity project.  Well, don't judge a book by its cover!  The Heroin Diaries does contain Nikki's insane drug-addled ramblings, but it is augmented by quotes from band members, ex-girlfriends, photographers, band management, family, and friends.  These are interspersed with the rather terse diary entries to provide perspective and context for Nikki's writings.  All the players are brutally honest about Nikki's (and their own) failings during the hedonistic days of Motley Crue.  (I now forgive the delay of the release of this book--I'm glad the authors and editors spent the time getting these quotes on the record.)  The reader is treated to an inside look at what it is like to have all the money in the world and not observe any of the limits of traditional society.<br /><br />Nikki and his band shared a love/hate relationship with the drug.  Nikki knew it inspired paranoia and ill health, but he craved the escape.  His bandmates disliked Nikki's strung-out flakiness, but they also needed the break from Nikki's intensity, and recording sessions were more pleasant when heroin took some of the edge off.  Nikki's drug dealer made a lot of money off the rock star, so he was always willing to make special deliveries or go out of his way to get back his customer when Nikki did a stint in rehab.<br /><br />The Heroin Diaries is a priceless piece of rock history (Nikki loved the as-yet-undiscovered Guns N' Roses and loathed the goody-two-shoes Whitesnake with their reliably decent performances).  During this time, Nikki bought out all his band's master tapes from his former record company, which was a musicians-rights coup that has hardly been rivaled in the ensuring two decades.  With a gag order on the specifics, he is only able to skirt around the issue, but this is just one of many accomplishments Nikki achieved while addicted to dope.  Who knows what he could have done off the stuff?  The book's architecture allows Nikki to step fully into the role of dope fiend, without preachy commentary and wisdom of hindsight, while his friends, family, and band provide the context and real-world perspective on his downward spiral.  Only at one point does Nikki interrupt his own writings with a note that he was obviously lying to himself and his diary about his relationship with heroin as he was about to embark on tour.<br /><br />This is drug-addition, rock star style, and recovery-memoir, rock star style.  It's a match made in rock n' roll heaven.  I'm glad Nikki is still here with us to share his story and keep making music.essions were more pleasant when heroin took some of the edge off.

However, I found India to be a bit slow; perhaps because I am not nor ever have been into the whole meditation thing.  The author has a great way of ingesting humor into her writing and I have identified with and enjoyed her style of writing.  This book will make great discussion for book club along with some good Italian food!

B000V8I2QU|2.0|I bought this CD in order to familiarize myself with the music before going to the concert.  I'm a bit disappointed in some of the songs.  I absolutely loved all of the songs on \\"The Rising\\".  The first 3 or 4 songs on this new CD are fine, but the rest of them sound very similar to each other and are quite dark and almost depressing.  It leaves me wanting to hear something more uplifting.  Also I find a lot of the songs on this album formulaic in that they all follow the same format of number of verses and choruses and repetition, repetition, repetition.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is Dylan in top form.  Brilliant lyrics.  You will laugh out loud at some songs, and cry at others.
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|Come on people!!!!  Mostly all of her songs have her voice distorted.  She doesn't even really sing in any of them.  I give the album 2 stars because there are a couple good songs.....but that's about it.  I think most of the people that buy her album are curious as to how it's going to sound.  I'm sad to say I actually paid money for it, because it was such a waste.  She needs to clean up her life and her image if she expects to get back into the pop scene.  I will say the girl can dance....but as far as the voice goes, she doesn't have it, and it shows in this particular album.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This well-directed film, Robert Altman's last, I believe, is rich and delightful in many ways. I almost feel that I am watching a documentary of the period between wars in the English country house. From the costumes to the cars and servants, the details are right on.<br />Maggie Smith and Derek Jacobi give remarkably fine perfomances. Actually, everyone does, even the funny almost over-the-top, Stephen Fry.<br /> I enjoyed seeing this DVD at a friend's house and I knew I wante to view it again and again. So I was happy to find it reasonably priced at Amazon.
B000GLKMD8|5.0|Living in the Material World is one of George Harrison's great albums. The album is full of spiritual songs reflecting George's quest for spirituality/ God. Before you turn away from this cd thinking it's going to be a bore, think again. The songs are terrific. \\"Give Me Love\\", \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World\\", \\"The Lord Loves The One That Loves The Lord\\", and the title track, \\"Living In The Material World\\" tell of George's earnest quest to seek and understand God as well as putting worldly things in perspective. On \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" George tells us of the battles he's had concerning drugs, fame, status, etc , and how God opened his eyes and reveiled Himself.  George once said that \\"...the things of this life can wait...the search for God can't.\\" This philosophy is very evident on this album. I esprcially liked the Beatles reference on 'Material world\\" where he says \\"...met my friends here in the material world/ John and Paul here in the material world/ though we started out quite poor, we got Richie on a tour...\\" As a side note, Ringo plays on this album. Apart from George giving us things spiritual to reflect on, he also humorously recalls the days of the Apple court battles in \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\". I like the line \\"...court receiver, laughs, and thrills/ but in the end we just pay those lawyers their bills...\\" The lyrics are great as is the music. Some of the contributing players here are:  Gary Wright, Nicky Hopkins, Jim Keltner and Ringo on drums, Klaus Voormann (old friend from their Hamburg days) on bass, and Jim Horn on sax and flutes. And, of course George on guitar. Not a bad line up. Living In The Material World is a must have for anyone into The Beatles or George as a solo artist.

Instead, I ended up laughing buckets. This is such a wonderful book. I highly recommend taking this journey with Elizabeth Gilbert.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Words are not enough to say how I feel about this CD.  Best ever and what a humble man who knows no bounds how far his gift rises to our souls.
B000002V0R|4.0|this is dave mustine #2 on charts cd more main stream like metallica did but with more bit in some songs.truely a solid cd but this lost momentium from rust in piece this is a very good cd butthey last I could tolerate high points skin o'my teeth, sweating bullets,this was my life,high speed dirt these sounded like the old megadeth the most but the other were less heavy and experimential some good some well not so good.dave quest for the gold was showing and his mental state was to.worth buying but not great. the remaster has a real good bonus track crown of worms on it.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I sold my previous two Twin Peaks dvd sets in order to buy this. Well worth it in my opinion. The bonus features are amazing. I've been spreading this out by watching one episode at a time.
B000OCXFCO|2.0|dave was great, megadeth had some good years of music but this cd sucks bad.dave should go shoot up some smack with his born again friends and call it a day!
B000TGCR3S|5.0|How do I put it simply? WOW! Anyone with an HDTV aught to experience this piece of thought provocative eye candy.    I broke down this review into two elements: 1) Blu-ray and 2) the movie.    1)  Visually speaking this movie is Beautiful and a \\"Must Have\\" if you want to show off your High Definition Entertainment center/system. The video is mastered in 1080p and simply looks beautiful on either LCD or Plasma via HDMI. The special features are also  in High Definition. I found the colour qualities to be extremely vibrant. In HD, depth of field is evident, noticeable and welcomed. Audio is 5.1 PCM uncompressed and nicely channelized, anyone with a good receiver and speakers system will, more likely than not, be very pleased. I found visitors, periodically turning their heads to their side expecting something to pop out of the wall.    2) I personally felt the story was very riveting. I felt connected to both mains, White and Black. Be warned, the story's presentation, on the surface, is a bit eclectic (Morphic Gen-X, to make up a term) but with some thought and explanation the film is extremely accessible, at least to anyone with a pulse. Even without explanation, I found the film thought provocative. Even my guy and gal friends, who aren't really into anime, were left with the proverbial, \\"Huh?\\" but at the same time were intrigued, \\"Wow\\"ed and couldn't stop talking about the film.    It's a great film, a nice Blu-Ray piece, and great Anime experience. Just my 2¢.
B000295V7G|5.0|this is probibly the best cd megadeth ever did!solid,heavy,impressive and the band was together (stoned but on the same page)this cd set the stage for megadeth to take the fight to dave's ex-band mates and take on the thrash world.the guitar work of mustine/poland could have tought kirk a thing or two in the fiture If they could have keep it together.dave and chris were fabulous the feed off each other and had a distinct style(refreshing)Gar was a excellent drummer and dave Jr was strong and decisive in his playing.the whole cd is high points no filler the fury ran wild but with boundries in the music.this cd is one of my favorites to this day of course megadeth after rust in pieces went to hell soon afterbut countdown was solid but not brutal thrash.this is one of the few cds of their's to definitly buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0805079831|5.0|A well researched, documented, reveting, and frightening clear analysis of the U.S. role in events leading our country and the world to where we are today.    I consider it the most important book written in my lifetime and I am 72 years old. This book shows where we are headed and that we are almost to the tipping point of total loss of our rights under the U. S. Constitution and our soveignty as a nation. The root cause of all is  the Milton Friedman economic theory, which is defended by powerful rich adherants and has been forced on the world like religious fanatics impose religion, inducing violence, extreme carnage, the suffering of people, plus wholesale destruction, such as and including the war in Iraq.    I ordered an extra book  that I gave to a friend and I intend to send one to my college age grandchildren. This book should be required study in high school and freshman college and economics courses.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|this was truely a great cd upon it release fury of thrash metal they had fresh blood marty friedmen,nick mensa and they were also uot to prove themselves to the world nick another drum tech worth his weight in gold and marty a solo musican and guitar shredder fit the mold well. this cd had so much in it sometimes you wondered if dave was paid buy the minutes on the cd or the riffs he could squeeze in one song. all in all a fast and technical cd  Marty and dave worked off each other like dave and chris many time you could have thought they were sparing(sometimes the solos were really out of place with lenght and ping ponging back and forth.nick did some real great drumming and has alot of energy and dave Jr. was showing threw the mix more. this cd showed the world megadeth was real taking a shot at the title and more than a one trick pony,they tried new and very originial structures in songs.high points holy wars,5 magics,tornado,take no prisoners,& rust in piece.My creation was on thr remasters and was a great song also. they should have taken the momentium from this cd and recorded something similar to this in stead of countdown and they could have showed up metallica by not following their lead but $$$$$$$$$$$.
B000026OW3|5.0|The first time I really remember hearing Chopin was watching the pianist and  I wondered what was this incredible music. While wandering through youtube, I found videos of this decrepit old looking man at a piano. Even though he looked like he could kick the bucket at any moment, the music he generated from his hands were like magic. I had to know who this pianist was and sure enough, it was Artur Rubinstein, the great Chopin master. I saw this sometime last year at almost 150 dollars and thought that it was a bit much for him (poor college student here). So when I came on and saw the price, immediately I bought it and have no regrets. I just wish I can play half as well as he does at 88 years old! In short, buy this set as you will not regret it. Sure it might sound a little crappy here and there, but blame the technology of the time, not the artist.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I've only ever paid for one other Britney album in my life and that was her \\"B in the Mix\\" album where all her top songs were techno-ed out. I loved it because I mostly only listen to dance/club music. When I had heard some of the leaked songs off of her new album \\"Blackout\\", I thought that I might just have to shell out 10 bucks and support some good dance music. This album is nothing like anything she has done before and like most people are saying, it is a VERY WELL produced album. The beats, mixes, and vocals come together excellently and it makes every single song on this album listen-able.<br /><br />Some GREAT songs that I JUST CAN'T stop listening to are:<br /><br />1. Gimme More- It's just flippin awesome!<br />2. Piece of Me- I love: \\"I'm Mrs. 'Oh My God that Britneys shameless'\\"<br />2. Break the Ice- I think this is my favorite! Beat is awesome, has that 'slave for you' panting lol<br />3. Get Naked- I could dance to this all night, produced by Danja (same as Gimme more)<br />4. Freakshow- HOTTTTT azz song! Encore!<br />5. Hot as Ice- This is a really cool song, its sound is unique and really fun!! One of my favvvvs.<br />6. Ooh Ooh Baby- Sexy track! Good sound and vocals!<br /><br />I really don't care to pay attention to Britney's personal life. I've honestly never really loved her or her music, although I did think she was an amazing dancer in the past and respected that. I just have to recognize good dance music when I hear it. If you like to dance/party/have fun, this album is for you. You really can just put this CD on and have a good time and let it play all the way through.<br /><br />I do have to wonder though, when Britney was going into the studio and laying down the vocals and listening to the finished tracks, how wasn't that enough to straighten her out? This is exciting stuff and I hope her next single and video are more like the Britney I hear on this CD!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|this cd has some great songs on it all around a very good cd 5/8 songs in my favorite zone is pretty good.I thought the song writing improved a bit the lryics were definitly venomious and the songs were pretty damn heavy but this was the begining of dave's reign of terror- no poland big mistake and gar was gone no good.considering this cd was recorded with a guitar treach who proibly didn't even like the music much and the gars drum tech it's pretty solid and technical for the best of it but it had some weak points instrumentals & good covers .I think the remaster is very good but they messed up 502.high points set the world afire,darkest hour,hook in mouth,liar excellent songs but still no peace sells follow up.but good enought to add to your collection.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I did not have very high expectations for this album. Often, 'old bands' or ' old reunited bands'  just sound old and outdated. I don't often get these. But this new release is quite something. Glenn Frey, Don Henley and Timothy B Schmidt still sound very terrific on vocals. Have been listening to them since 'Hotel California' days. Perhaps you won't find a 'New Kid In Town' or a 'Lying Eyes' in the 2-CD collection but 'What Do I do With My Heart' (Disc 1 Track 4) - my current favourite - comes close. I am also ordering another copy from UK - they got an additional track which sounds quite good. They have gained new respect from me and I am again a happy, albeit older, fan.
0553582038|2.0|As others have said, there was very little plot advancement, and way to much time spent on very minor characters.  With gaps of years between each volume, I've frankly forgotten most of the characters and events, and after \\"Feast for Crows\\" I realize I simply don't care about this story.    At this pace, it will be decades before the series is finished, if the publisher doesn't simply pull the plug.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I admit I won't really feelin his other 2 albums that much. They had too many skits and too amateur beats. He got better with each one though. College Dropout sounded like he made his beats by putting a microphone to a tape player and recording the beats off the tape and rapped on top of em. Late Registration he got alot better. It still wasn't convincing me to buy the album. NOW......    Graduation-  Every music artist has their 1 classic album. This is and probably will be Kanyes classic album for a long time. The beats are unbelievable. I dig how he mixes techno and middle eastern beats into his hip-hop flow. He stepped up his game on this. As for the battle between him and 50, I absolutely knew Kanye was gonna win because unlike 50, Kanye actually has talent.

B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I've been to her Birmingham concert on Nov. 26 2006, and I must say that this tour is awesome, it'a way better than the Stripped tour..The tracklist is like that:    1-) Intro: Back To Basics   2-) Ain't No Other Man   3-) Back In The Day   4-) Understand   5-) Come On Over   6-) Slow Down Baby   7-) Still Dirrty   8-) I Got Trouble   9-) Makes Me Wanna Pray   10-) What A Girl Wants   11-) Oh Mother   12-)Enter The Circus  13-) Welcome  14-) Dirrty  15-) Candyman  16-) Nasty Naughty Boy  17-) Hurt  18-) Lady Marmalade  19-) Encore: Thank You  20-) Beautiful  21-) Fighter    P.S I don't understand why they are releasing the show she did on Sydney, she was already pregnant and you can see her baby bump. It would be better if they release a show from USA, United Kingdom or Europe...
071563318X|5.0|Talk about a sleeper book.  This is one of the most practical and useful books that I have ever encountered.  It is, quite simply put, a step by step guide to surviving an attack by the undead.  Stressing preparation and a knowledge of the threat, the authors provide an ironclad scientific so even a layman can understand the cause of \\"zombieism.\\"  The nature of different attacks are described, methods for surviving these attacks and shopping lists are provided to ensure maximum readiness.  Perhaps the most overwhelming parts of the book is the detailed historical overview of all known zombie attacks.  It is shocking to learn how many there have been and how they have been pushed out of the mainstream.<br />If you have a family, if you have loved ones, if you just want to survive when the inevitable happens, BUY THIS BOOK!!!<br />Then again, it could all just be humor, but regardless, it is a super fun read!!!
B000VI04HK|3.0|I find it hard to believe that Peter, Mike, and Michael would actually sit down, watch this DVD, and pronounce it fit for human consumption.    As stated in other reviews, this IS virtually unwatchable.    And that's a shame, 'cause it's a wonderful rock show that sounds great, but looks awful.    Seriously, what could they be thinking when they okayed something that just looks like they set a couple of hyperactive kids loose in the production room, told them to push as many buttons as often as  possible, and then instructed the camera crew to just fudge with all the bells and whistles on their equipment, and, oh, every once in a while, for a second or two, show something IN FOCUS?    The concept of concert DVD's is a great one, and one that I've invested a lot of time and money in, as far as owning and watching. There are so many lessons to be learned from watching a Jonathan Demme or Martin Scorsese-shot show...watch The Last Waltz or Heart Of Gold to see what I mean. Why some of these directors find it necessary to give us something so muddied, something so out of sync with the original intent (which I would imagine would be a visual souvenir to go with the CD), is beyond me.    UNLESS...the original intent WAS this headache-causing, nausea-inducing mess.    Again, the music is great, performed well, and is a joy to listen to.    Sadly, the DVD drags the package down to the point where, after one aborted attempted viewing, it will probably never see my DVD player again, unless the government recruits me to torture suspected terrorists, in which case I would slip this in, turn the sound down, leave the room, and wait for the impending screamfest.    Three stars out of five for the music alone.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|We have small kids, so it's impossible for us to catch all shows when they initially air on the CW channel. We also often fail to record them for later viewing - so having the complete first and second season on DVD is our way to catch up on episodes we have missed whenever we want (or can for that matter) without commercial and kid interruption. If you are into spooky scenarios and catchy/snappy scripts, this set (and the first season) are a 'must see and own'.. Enjoy :)
0525950079|5.0|'World Without End' isn't quite as good as 'Pillars of the Earth,' but then what is? I can't take off a star, because this is still better than a lot of the stuff I have read lately. 'World' has the same masterful storyteller style as 'Pillars' and while it may not be as strong overall, in some ways, Follett hasn't let the end unravel, as some may feel it did with 'Pillars'. It could have used some more thorough editing for mistakes - a peripheral character's children become his grandchildren on second reference - but essentially it's all here...honest people who work hard and get nowhere, evil people who seem to advance and get ahead no matter what, and the deliciously satisfying twists of fate that right the wrongs. As the story takes place long after the events of 'Pillars,' both books can stand alone. A really fun read.   Also recommended [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].
0345910907|4.0|This book is a long and often times laborious read but it is well worth it for the historical perspective it gives you into the hardship of life in the first part of the last millennium.  The bottom line is the 14th century was an incredibly difficult period in human history and the overall misery index was in the red. The black plague swept the land and wars were fought amongst the rich to spread the blood of the poor. The average life expectancy was next to nothing and people who lived long often suffered greatly. The very few that lived in opulence did so at an incredible cost to the indentured population.<br /><br />This book makes our world here in the 21st century look soft and our lives to be happy carefree affairs. There was a time I used the book on tape version to listen to as I commuted back and forth from a high stress corporate job. It helped me to minimize my own plight from an internal standpoint. This is depressing stuff but it is well written.<br /><br />B. Tuchman is one of the more talented historians out there in terms of writing. She can really keep you drawn into her story, although the sheer details can be overwhelming. The facts are spelled out convincingly and things are described in such detail that you'll thank your deity that you don't live in the 14th century unless, that is, you're a Count, an Earl, a Duke, or a King-than things aren't that bad if you can deal with your conscience or lack there of as you spill the blood of the peasants. This book shows that at our very roots, we are a very rough beast indeed although we as humans tend to aggrandize ourselves-just look at Medieval Europe through the Distant Mirror and see for yourself....
B000TUXL2A|4.0|Being a guitar player myself I really appreciat how Mark Knopfler uses his guitar to make his music. His solos and accompanyment are always melodic and beautiful.     Mark seems to enjoy describing people and times in his work. This CD reminds me of his previous one Rag Pickers Dream. It has some of the same elements of story telling in both. If you liked Rag Pickers Dream you'll probably like this as much as I do.

B000I5Y9G8|5.0|Seen from Chameleon, Over might seem an odd affair: a concept album, if you will, about things coming to an end that is at once thematically coherent and stylistically diverse. Seen from Clutch, Over is a prescient work, setting loose level-cracking, small-ensemble ferocity typified by the guttering disdain of \\"Betrayed\\" with its poignant reference to Steinbeck's famous novella -- effectively recasting the context of the song. Seen from any angle, Over also intimates Hammill's impending middle-period transition from the rawly dramatic to a rehearsed sort of theatricality epitomized by the orchestral version of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", an Andrew Lloyd Weberish extravaganza that remains something of a one-off in the Hammill oeuvre. A somewhat spare sounding LP when first released (I've always wondered about what sort of monitors Hammill uses when mixing, most of his earlier releases feature an often annoying and hollowed-out 2kHz-ish peakiness) the re-mastering here retains that profoundly Eddie Awful sense of spectrum, no place more obvious than the newly eq'd bass of \\"Crying Wolf\\" which literally halos around, above and below -- without ever touching -- the fundamental, creating the sort of empty low end rumble reminiscent of Japanese crowd control technology.  But technical preferences are hardly the main issue. Over remains an important record, especially as one of the more curious and singular releases in the Hammill catalog -- a terrifying exploration of the self-delusion, bitterness, sorrow and acceptance typically accompanied by the closing of a door.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Yes, the two leads are handsome and they may attract young female viewers.  But this is not some beefcake sitcom. This is Supernatural, a very dark and often gloomy story of two brothers who cannot live a normal life because they must carry on their father's legacy of demon-hunting.  This has dogged them since they were young and watched their own  mother die from a demon attack.      What complicates matters is that the younger brother, Sam, has some psychic abilities which sometimes put him at risk.  Their father even told Dean that he might someday have to kill Sam to save him from himself and to protect others.  This leaves Dean with a sense of anxiety that never lets go.     What I really like is that many episodes do not have some happy resolution; instead, the two brothers are left brooding on the life they are forced to live and the complications of their relationship and knowledge of each other.  No wife or kids for these guys; they are stuck on an endless road trip, running from harm or trying to destroy demons before they attack someone else.      There are occasional lighthearted moments for comic relief--thank goodness.  Think of this as a cross between Buffy and the X-Files. In fact, many XF writers and producers now work on this show, and it has the same foreboding atmosphere and music.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I purchased this Bly-ray set in October and haven't had time to watch all the chapters yet. The chapters I have watched however deserves a great review. The first thing you notice about the show is how extremely well-produced it is. A lot has been filmed from the air, and this makes a lot of the scenes very impressing, e.g. the overhead shot of Angel falls. It's all recorded in full-HD, 1080p to be exact. Among the blu-ray productions I have seen, I consider Planet Earth and Casino Royale to be the best. I currently use a PS3 and Sony's VW-50 Pearl projector on 106\\" screen and it works beautifully. For those who use full-HD equipment and enjoy watching the wildlife, Planet Earth is a reference for probably a long time to come. It's not only beautiful to watch, it's a document of the amazing planet we all inhabit. Enjoy!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Just Eagles says it all.  This is a surround sound DVD and worth the money.  This was made at the end of their tour...and the DVD that was made at the start of the tour was better...but, it may be just me.  I like the Eagles coming or going.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As a new fan of the series (firefly) I would recommend one to watch the series before watching the movie (Serenity), which is what I did. This way you really get attached to the characters and get a real good background to why they act the way they do. I love the way they interact with each other and react to sticky situations, great actors and script writer. It makes for one intense movie! Also the movie does answer a few questions I had about the series, not thats its a spoiler but its fun not to know what is really going on when beginning the series, Whedon has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat in that respect. Either way, I really recommend this movie, definitely one of my favorites! Maybe if enough of us buys a copy they'll make a serenity two!

0316067598|1.0|The syntax in this book is so poor it would not pass freshman creatvie writing.  It is hard to tell how much of the story is truth and how much is fiction.  The author is constantly \\"guessing\\" or saying \\"probably\\" which later he turns into a \\"fact\\".  SEAL training is rigoruous but to send four guys including one two big for a mountain operation into Taliban area witbout even a smidgen of the language at their command is ridiculous planning. With all of their so called superior intel, they didn't know how to get from 1 to 2 to 3.  They made enough noise to wake the dead and any sleeping Taliban. Noise carries long distances in the mountains as the villagers tried to make Luttrell understand There was no need for the goat herders to announce the presence of the SEAL Team. They announced themselves.      The gratuitous \\"hells\\" and \\"damns\\" add nothing to the story and the braggadocio is typical of \\"bring it on\\" mentality.  We have learned nothing from the Viet Nam war in how to out think the enemy.  We continue to think that fire power and name calling will win the day.    The Rules of Engagement are enforced by the Millitary not liberal politicians.  The military investgates and where necessary prosecute based on the evidence not on the word of the liberal media or politicians,  In this case the SEALS should have had standing orders on how to deal with civilians they should have expected to encounter in this operation.  Or the SEALS could have tied and gagged the herders long enough to end the operation and to escape to safety rather than to return to the previous spot where they were trapped.    As a book this is a scar on both the milltary and the publishing industry.  If you want military heroism and good literature read \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young\\"  or Ghost Soldiers\\"

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sure, like all of Michael Moore's films this movie is more editorial than documentry. It's trying to make a very specific point (the American health care system is seriously broken), and pulls out all the stops to do so. It does so with all the usual wit and humor of Michael Moore, which to my mind is a good thing.<br /><br />The movie focuses on various middle-class people who generally thought they had decent medical coverage. They usually thought this right up to the point where they needed it and then... pft. They find out they aren't covered for things, or that stuff they weren't aware they had are listed as pre-existing conditions. They aren't eligable for certain treatments. They have large co-pays and deductables. They can't see the doctors they want to do. The doctors can't give them the treatment they want to give them because the patients can't afford it, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />Part of the problem with the American health care system, and something that's made plain in the movie, is that it's being run by for-profit insurance companies that have a vested interest in making sure they pay for as little as they possibly can. They want to maximize profits, after all, and I can't blame them for that.<br /><br />There are flaws in the movie. The health care systems in France, Canada and England are painted with too-rosy pictures and nothing showing their flaws. Cuba's health care is presented as magnificent while their human rights issues are glossed-over or ignored (though one can make the point that this movie isn't focusing on human rights, just health care). Some of the problems that do exist with socalized medicine are not addressed.<br /><br />That said, when I think of this problem, I think about my sister and her family. She has a husband and they have four kids. She works and he works. If, god forbid, one of their children got, say, leukemia, then likely one of them would have to quit their job to take care of the kid. Probably the one with the crappier health coverage. That means their income decreases dramatically. Stress goes up. Resentment towards the child due to the incredibly high medical costs can't help but form, irrational though that would be. The parents fight over money. Next thing you know, the $[...] medical bills have sent the family into bankruptcy. They lose their home and have to move into a small apartment. But, hey, in the end, since we do have the best medical care money can buy, at least the daughter is ok.<br /><br />Until the relapse. Or until the working parent gets injured. Or until one of the other kids gets sick. Etc. All those things are horrible enough, but the is the only \\"real\\" country where you have to choose between money and medicine and that's just bad. How does our contry benefit from people being made bankrupt by medical bills?<br /><br />The DVD release contains about 80 minutes of footage not seen in the theatrical version. Of note particularly is the segment on Norway. You know, I can't help but think that perhaps if we had minimum security prisons like the ones they show in the movie, instead of the crappy minimum security ones we have here, our crime right might nose down a bit. There could be something to this whole \\"treat people like people\\" thing, and focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />The message I come away with from this movie is the following: socialized medicine/universal health care is not perfect. Far from it. But it is better than what we have now, and there's no reason we can't do it better than the other countries that have it do. After all, not too horribly long ago we fought the Germans, Italians and the Japanese all at basically the same time. We've gone to the Moon. We have TiVo. Any country that can do all these things can and should have a better health care system than what we have now.<br /><br />See this movie. Even if you don't like Michael Moore, see it (he's not on screen much anyhow). Seeit, and then do something about it.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|What a concert! I have viewed this DVD at least 5 times from the day I bought it, and I have listened to it so many times that I stopped counting.  Domingo at 65 (This was taped in 2006) is still singing and how!  and Netrebko and Villazon are incredible, but let's not forget the orchestra!  The program selection was just great and the direction of the production was such that it really gave you a feeling of almost being there, especially during the encore pieces, you could be moved along with the adoring audience. Buy it and enjoy!  This is a DVD to treasure and be played over and over in the years to come.
B000J103PC|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but it really is great. All of the actors are really good, and even though I don't care much for fashion, I really enjoyed watching this!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I sat and watched the movie the same day it arrived...my children and I used to sit and watch it...now they are grown with children of their own, but I still love to watch it!  Excellent condition and service...thanks for making me smile!
009917961X|2.0|The book's plot is utterly predictable. Rudy'll win his case. This you'll know since the first chapter so I ain't telling anything important because the good guys'll win and the bad guys'll loose. Rudy's biography is long and boring. I'm sure that JG can write overly better than this.
0143038419|5.0|Gilbert is on a hero's journey.  Almost broken by a debilitating break-up she is determined to walk through the pain and find meaning in her life and she is one of the rare ones who isn't just talking the talk.  I lived vicariously through her on every page as she tasted the exquisite food of Italy, sat through the excruciating pain of meditating for hours in one position and finally gave in to the love of a man who really saw her and loved her anyway. She is funny and I laughed out loud at the same time that I was admiring her perfect choice of words to describe the many details that make up a moment. I wished I were with her, sweating in stillness to break through to a higher spiritual plane. Now, having imagined Bali through her telling of life there, the island's promise beckons me with the come hither whisper of warm breezes.     By the end of the book, I sighed that in another lifetime, without the ties of the life I chose, I would have walked her walk. For now, traveling the pages of Elizabeth Gilbert's book will have to be enough for me. I closed its covers knowing that I will read it again, which is the highest compliment I can pay to any author.  I want to be wrapped in the arms of her language, experience again the seamless flow of words that made me laugh, cry and believe.
B00005JOHC|4.0|I didn't start watching this show till January of 2006, so I'm glad I got this DVD set to catch up on it. I think the episodes are absolutely hilarous, with the odd-couple mismatch of Charlie and Alan and their adventures with Jake. The comedy is impressive in this collection. The actors really work well together.
B000Y179KO|2.0|this double cd is a big disappointment ! i am \\"trying to like it\\" - i am a big Eagles fan and have all their cds, but what's with this one ?<br /><br />1- there is no album theme...it is a compilation of songs by Eagles members, placed on two cds . it is like the time when they had their solo carrier. same stuff but labeled under Eagles.  They could have easily made one cd with maybe 8 to 10 songs and keep some continuity in the music style...<br /><br />2- of course few songs stand out (out of 20 !!!) ,  but there is no creativity at all !!<br /><br />\\"no more walks in the wood\\" is another \\"seven bridges road\\"<br />\\"how long\\" looks like \\"already gone\\",<br />\\"long road out of eden\\" like \\"hotel california\\"...<br /><br />the slow songs by Glen Frey (\\"you are not alone\\", \\"no more cloudy days\\", \\"I love to watch a woman dance\\", \\"it is your world now\\" , oh my god !! they are the worse.<br />the lyrics are so predictable and repetitive. They are very boring...<br /><br />the one by Timothy Schmidt \\" I don't want to hear any more\\" , his voice seems like a girl !<br /><br />3- there is no genuine guitar playing. of course, the felder effect is missing , big time !! a lot of created sounds, synthesizer and fake instruments ...that is sad, their music is becoming too commercial.<br /><br />The song \\"what do I do with my heart\\" is a catastrophe...how can they tolerate all that crapy music playing in it?? I can easily reproduce it with one button on my keyboard!!<br /><br />It is sad that after all this waiting, this is what they brought us... from the musicians that wrote \\"desperado\\", \\"lying eyes\\", \\"tequila sunrise\\", \\"last resort\\", \\"take it to the limit\\", \\"peaceful easy feeling\\", \\"learn to be still\\", \\"new kid in town\\", \\"love will keep us alive\\"....to name few,<br />I don't think any of the song on this album will stand the test of time (except maybe the album title) -<br /><br />I don't understand how Eagles fan have been giving 4 or 5 stars on this album??? what is left for albums like \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" , \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Long Run\\", \\"Desperado'\\"... ???
B00006FDCD|1.0|ow ow ow ow ow!!<br /><br />This one really hurt me.  Just read the book and made the mistake of watching this movie.  Way too expository and all the actors give career worst performances.  Hated how a cool novel became The Big Chill of horror movies.  I mean I could have done without the bike scene, the Chinese dinner montage, the huggy moments.  I mean it was really off in tone from the novel.  And then there was the exposition.  It was some of the clunkiest I've ever seen.  And that ending?  Oh goodness!  Here's how you defeat \\"The Eater of Worlds\\", you stomp a mudhole in its deadlights.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Why they didn't get the turtle who puked out the Universe in it is beyond me.  Why the heck not at that point?  Couldn't have been made worse.
B000002PCS|5.0|In the Fall of 1980 my wife and I went to the theatre to see Somewhere in Time. I had no idea what the movie was about, but my wife was raving about it. This movie haunted me to the point where I went back and saw it another two times.  I also had no idea who Jane Seymour was or Christopher Reeves for that matter.  Just the idea of someone going back in time to find a true love was intirguing to me. It was also 1912 and the Hotel and the Island took on a personality of itself.   Everything about the movie was romantic. i still dont know if he gave the watch to her of if she gave it to him.  This movie in my mind is my favorite romance of all time.    This movie has the classic \\"Love at first sight\\" which, along with the method of time travel was a little hard to get by.  The key to this movie is to take it at face value and do not pick apart the flaws that it might have.  Jane Seymmour is perfect for the role and this is the performance of her life.  The ending will make you cry. You will not regret seeing this movie..
B0009IW88A|4.0|After reading the on going debate between previous films' and Batman Begins' soundtracks, and then listening to this soundtrack for almost four weeks in a row, I decided to give my own contribution to the debate.    Yes, it is different from the previous movies, but it is also supposed to be different. As it was Nolan's intention to approach the idea of Batman differently, with realistic approach, so did Zimmer and Howard do with Batman's music. If you are looking for some fast tempoed, \\"Elfmanish\\" witty and picturesque music, this is not the right soundtrack for you. But if you instead enjoy far reaching musical landscapes that set up the moods, themes and atmospheres, this might be a soundtrack for you.    Yet, to name Batman Begins soundtrack as a pure mood record would be a simple underestimation. For the soundtrack have subtle and almost ingenious ideas that open very slowly. It has no particular Grand Batman Theme, but various little thematic scenes that are modified and played repeatedly through the tracks (named after bats). In a way the record in itself is the main theme that grows and develops. The four or five distinctive themes together build up the final main theme and varies it through out the whole record. The fact is highlighted by the fact that middle tracks' \\"Barbastella, Artibeus, Tadarida, Macrotus, Antrozous and Nycteris\\", which first letters form up a name \\"Batman\\".    The style in some parts appear similar with Blade Runner and modern classical music, as well as both Zimmer's and Howard's most noted works (such as Gladiator or The Village), but blends them nicely together. The varied themes and their futuristic, bit scary soundworld creates a record that stands out in itself, even without the movie. Partially for this reason I believe Zimmer's and Howard's composing work avoids the one rather poignant problem that plagues most of the film scores: it stands time.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I loved this album. I am sure a lot of those pansy people who think just becuase you have your music vidios out there means you're a sell out, what they don't get is that that means that you're sucsessful! I am not a screaming music fan, but i absolutly love Avenged Sevenfold. My first Avenged song was Bat country. And I fell in love with it and then found their previous albums. I was not worried about whether or not I would like this albim, i was compleetly confident I would love it, and of course I do. Their first song critical acclaim is amazing, it was like they took the thoughts right out of my head as a proud republican! and the sonds just go on sounding amazing. I can't choose a favorite song from any of their albums becuase they are all fantastic. M.I.A was a real highlight on City of Evil among others. On this one i really can't pick a favorite. To me, this album almost tops City Of Evil. They better be around for years to come becuase they are by far my favorite band!
B000OONTFU|4.0|Hi World, as with a few of the people that have orded this, the first copy i recieved had trouble playing the second disk and sometimes the third, it kept saying cant read disk.     Amazon were quick to replace it as they sent me a second copy and it arrived in half the time i waited for the orriginal, outstanding service Amazon, thank you very much.     the second copy i recieved has not faulted yet, although i have not sat down and watched all the movies from start to end yet i have just put them in the player to see if they worked.     the picture quality is truely amazing and the sound too, once you change it to TrueHD, if you leave it on the default it sounds pretty lousy.     If anyone likes watching all the behind the sceens and extras on DVD's i would highly recommend getting this pack as there is 6 or so disks with extras, if you already have the orriginal 10 disk set i would probably only get the 3 movie set instead of the ultimate as all the extras are in SD.     dont be deterred by some of these peoples comments saying they cant get it to work as it seems to only be with a handfull of packs which Amazon are quick at replacing.     Happy Viewing ALL (Go HD DVD, keep the special features coming, those people out there with Blue ray only enjoy just your Movie.)
B000056TKC|5.0|I know 7 performances of this piece but this one is the best one i ever heard. Fricsay's version is very clean and attractive even if the third part is longer than usual. In the performance there's no dark parts. All soloists are very good singers and they made their job wonderful. Who wants to listen and understand this great piece i recommend this cd without paying attention at the cost. 25.99.
B000MV9026|1.0|Who knows what the writers were thinking with this one.  the plot, the story, whatever is so convoluted, so packed with \\"messages\\" and such a downer to watch you'll want to jump off a cliff.  I think Al Gore was a ghost writer.  Mostly boring, a few amusing parts, WAY too heavy handed.  There is no joy in this movie whatsoever.  Don't bother.  Your kids will be bored after 5 minutes and you'll be running for the shotgun if you are forced to watch the whole thing!
B0000041TD|5.0|This is the best recording made of this opera.  I recommend it for any opera fan!!!  Fantastic!!!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|This is very well constructed and, unlike a lot of plush/beanie/stuffed figures, it actually looks very much like the cartoon character it's meant to represent. *meow*
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|I hated this movie, loved the 1st but hated this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled so much during the fights you couldn't tell what was going on, & it's an action movie which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action. plus the final fight was a car chase, how stupid is that? I was hoping to see some premium assassin on assassin fighting but instead I get a car chase with horrible camera movement
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This set is amazingly good.  Two CDs and one DVD.  Each performance is a gem.  You really couldn't ask for more.  Thanks Garth.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I actually sat down and listened to this album the other day before purchasing it (August 2013). It was my second purchase of Britney (after about 10 years when I first got \\"...Baby One More Time\\". I don't know what I was thinking though! I do like some of Brit's early music and actually called myself a fan back then. Then she went full on dance pop and kinda lost me (save for a few catchy singles). This album is a letdown though. Tracks 1-5 are pretty good. Tracks 6-11 are merely filler. The last track is solid. Honestly I don't understand how that could happen? I'm being truthful here. Tracks 6-11 have very little spark about them. I don't EVER wanna purchase a CD like this again. I don't know...I must have been in a dance trance when I was listening to it on Spotify.<br /><br />Overall, it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />P.S. I am actually very sorry about the sorry excuse for a review I put up about this CD initially. I also said I didn't like it back then but I also put Brit on blast and wasn't very nice about Britney's life around that time. It was kind of odd that I would write something so mean :(, but I do apologize. I have the utmost sympathy for people with mental illnesses.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Put on this CD instead if you want some atmosphere.  The smooth  renditions delivered with feeling (attitude) might even settle your nerves after a hectic day.  Of course it helps if you enjoy the lyrics of a few oldies.  This collection benefits from a terrific backup band - just listen to each instrument's \\"audition\\" (especially the bass) and see if you don't agree. Listen closely and you'll hear the nuances in timbre of Krall's vocals depending on the mood she wants to convey.  A talented singer and a great collection!
B0000028P8|5.0|EMOTIONS -- ****<br /><br />IF IT'S OVER -- ****<br /><br />SOMEDAY -- This live version kicks the ass of the original version! I don't even like the original that much, but this one is very, very lively and makes you want to sing with the lovely Mariah here. Probably the best revision here. *****<br /><br />VISION OF LOVE -- Not that different from the original, except some of the notes are more stressed and the background singers can be heard even better. *****<br /><br />MAKE IT HAPPEN -- This one is super-great. Very upbeat and inspirational like it's supposed to be. Probably better than the original. **** 1/2<br /><br />I'LL BE THERE (Feat. TREY LORENZ) -- This used to be my favorite song on here, but not so much anymore. I still love its innocence, but there are just better songs to be found. **** 1/4<br /><br />CAN'T LET GO -- One of the better tracks presents and a very fine way to end such a good album. **** 1/2<br /><br />Yes, I was the one who made that 3-star review about this under a different account, but I've totally changed my mind about this disc and I'm glad. Something told me to put this album on my iPod Touch today because I have all of Mariah's albums on it (save for all of [[ASIN:B00005MAWM Glitter]] and [[ASIN:B0042AEOG0 Merry Christmas II You]], Mariah's second holiday disc). I like all the songs now and I'm proud to up the rating from a 3 to a 4 point something.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />Mariah is the best! I know she's probably not the top singer in history, but she's my favorite and I guess that's all that matters. This live collection of songs proves that and more! I wonder if she could pull off another one, one of these days...
0060853980|2.0|I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, but this may be my least favorite work of his.  This is because GOOD OMENS is written as a pure farce, where all the characters act in a silly and unbelievable manner.  This novel features a very large cast of characters, and almost none of them are fully developed.  As a result, I didn't find this novel particularly engaging.<br /><br />GOOD OMENS is very funny in spots, but I think the authors are more interested in being clever than telling a good story.  That's okay for a piece of short fiction, but the cleverness wears thin in a 400-page novel.  I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but got tired of it after the first hundred pages.  Many compare this book to HITCHHIKER's GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, but keep in mind that this novel is over twice as long as HITCHHIKER.<br /><br />If you've never read Gaiman before, my advice is to read NEVERWHERE or STARDUST first.  Those novels will give you a better sense of his enormous talent.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Man this movie sucks. The acting is bad. The heroes are boring and undeveloped. It seems like a directing class  school project. Watch it on cable but dont clutter up your dvd collection with this garbage.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|I am a long lisner of Dream Theater from WDADU. but the day has come when kevin leave the band. that time everymember of DT feel lost. but it's not important thing. but after that time DT's music start lost groove feel and as a status of technician. Speedy soloing is not being today in DT. also the power of song materials. so why have to changed their music ? the core is Kevin Moore keyboardist. Kevin always write song as a dynamic rythm and lyrics like poet. this main power lead DT to commercial success. If there are no Kevin Moore, DT will dead meat band also. so becoming more Awake or Images And Words, The Kevin Moore have to be back!    and this album is like 8varium, it's not progressive metal. just a underrated grade B band. so now Jordan is going to fired from DT.    I hope this change will save DT. I just say directly because I love DT.
0061547832|4.0|This book is for everyone and  whether you  have  reached  the pinnacle of success, your  a  top CEO who wants to go to another level  or those just  starting out  and want to fast track your success -  everyone can learn something  let alone pass it on to others.    I read a lot of so called `success books'  as I  consult  and coach  many high profiles from Fortune 500 CEO's                                  to`A' list Celebrities from London to  Hollywood   and from working with these people  I have noticed  a very common theme about  success....it can be boiled  down to  its all about  inner attitude traits and developing  certain  qualities that make them who they are  and thus who they  become including those that lose everything and have the ability to  get back up and start all over from scratch.    I am originally from England travelling all over the world etc, with my work and I have had very positive feedback from numerous top Company CEO's in London etc and small business owners where I have done talks and consultany work and the census is they are really impressed with this book and overall content and Trumps wisdom.    Love him or maybe loathe him,  Donald Trump has nailed a great \\"how to\\" Success Book he's captured  vital and important distinctions  very elegantly  in this great book, wonderfully and artfully explained it through  out  let alone  so much more great concepts and ideas and  how too's and  great gems to actually take away!    Infact I  borrowed some concepts from this fab book  in a recent high profile coaching session  and talk with major executives already at the top of their field  and got a standing ovation and lucrative contract  to  coach people  in some of these approaches!     Bottom line Great book and  well  laid out, terrific metaphors and  related stories  and an  easy read with good humor sprinkled throughout and  good substance overall  and well thought out -the book title says it all!    Enjoy!!
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in years. I am not a Leo DeCaprio fan, but he was great in this. This is the best film I have seen since I saw \\"Constant Gardener\\". Djimon Hounsou was excellent in this film also.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I really love these, I use them for everything from editing music to playing Half Life 2, they have great response through all the ranges, even good bass, which is abnormal for Studio phones, but nice! 2 of the best features of these are the self adjusting headband (makes them very comfortable), and the removable cord (allowing you to upgrade your cord, get a curly cord, or a higher grade cable). I don't get sweaty ears wearing these, which is what I usually hate when vinyl covered ear pads, and they are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time without taking them off-I've had them on for 6 hours or more some times. the cord is nice and nice, overall these were exactly what I was looking for in my headphone purchase.
B000UX6THK|5.0|There's hardly anything at all to say about Twin Peaks that hasn't already been said since the show's premiere and demise; both of which occured in what seems like an eternity ago.  For those unfamiliar with the cult show from David Lynch and Mark Frost, Twin Peaks is the story of murdered homecoming queen Laura Palmer (the gorgeous Sheryl Lee), whose body is discovered washed ashore and wrapped in plastic.  FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Lynch favorite Kyle MacLachlan) is assigned to the case, and what follows is a dizzying, mistifying trip that literally must be seen to be believed.  Featuring an incredibly oddball cast of characters and a dark, sinister tone that underlines the series from beginning to end, Twin Peaks still ranks today as one of the most original, and influential, shows to ever grace network television.  There's no easy answers to be found, and there are plenty of confusing moments, but in the end, everything comes together in an incredibly strange way that is simply beautiful; even if the ending of the series is left unresolved (but picked up upon in the feature film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, released after the series' demise from New Line, and hence is not featured in this set).  Everyone that populates Twin Peaks leaves their mark, especially MacLachlan as the black coffee and cherry pie loving fed; while the rest of the cast includes Michael Ontkean as Sheriff Harry S. Truman, and features familiar faces like Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Ray Wise, Joan Chen, Lynch favorite Jack \\"Eraserhead\\" Nance, Miguel Ferrer, a young Heather Graham, Billy Zane, Michael J. Anderson, a pre X-Files David Duchovny (as a trannie FBI Agent no less), and even Lynch himself.  This Definitive Gold Box Edition collects both seasons of the series and a horde of extras (although none of the ones included with the single released second season), as well as Lynch's breathtaking pilot.  The first season is by far the better of the two, with the second season making the big revelation that will either have you with your jaw hanging to the floor or swearing at your television.  Either way you look at it, whether you are a new to town or a returning visitor, Twin Peaks will astound you like no modern network TV show can ever hope to do today.  If you doubt these words, or the words of the other reviews here, take a trip to Twin Peaks and see for yourself.king the big revelation that will either have you with your jaw hanging to the floor or swearing at your television.

B000028U0Y|5.0|My oldest memories of Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison (1968) are as a kid, watching my dad and his buddies standing around our '65 Ford Galaxie 500 (390 cu.in./4 bbl.) talking shop, drinking Budweiser in cans and listening to At Folsom Prison on the car's 8-track tape player. Those guys didn't really care much about the Beatles, the Stones, Woodstock or Haight-Ashbury. They made an honest living, provided for their families, looked out for their neighbors and LOVED Johnny Cash. I still think about those days and those hard working men when I listen to this album today. Most of those guys, including the legend who was providing the soundtrack, are dead now. The memories and the music still remain.<br /><br />At Folsom Prison is a great way to listen to Johnny Cash. He's clearly in his element and right at home with this crowd. He gives them the best he's got.<br /><br />His soon-to-be bride, June Carter (they were married a few months after this concert), makes an appearance to sing a duet with Johnny on their hit single Jackson.<br /><br />Cash's long-time guitarist, Luther Perkins, is in the band, and his brother Carl Perkins (Blue Suede Shoes) plays guitar on the album, too. The famous Statler Brothers provide the backing vocals.<br /><br />The album's opener, Folsom Prison Blues, is obviously a popular song with California's Folsom Prison inmates, and the line, \\"I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die\\" gets an enthusiastic response. The album features several prison songs, such as Cocaine Blues, I Got Stripes, The Wall and 25 Minutes To Go. Good choices for this appreciative audience, and you can feel the connection Johnny makes with them through his music.<br /><br />Dark As A Dungeon, I Still Miss Someone and Lefty Frizell's haunting Long Black Veil slow things down and create a somber and mournful mood.<br /><br />There are moments of fun and celebration with Orange Blossom Special, Dirty Old Egg Suckin' Dog and Flushed From The Bathroom Of Your Heart.<br /><br />Johnny Cash is in top form on At Folsom Prison, and he tears through these songs with zeal and spirit. He's in a great mood, too, as he cracks a few jokes here and there.<br /><br />Appropriately, Johnny ends the show with Greystone Chapel, a song written by Glen Sherley, a Folsom Prison inmate doing life for armed robbery, and in the audience that night.<br /><br />There's a Greystone chapel here at Folsom<br />A house of worship in this den of sin<br />You wouldn't think God had a place at Folsom<br />But He's saved the soul of many lost men<br /><br />Johnny Cash At Folsom Prison is a great album, a real classic from an American legend.

B000002IPZ|4.0|Testament's \\"Souls of Black\\" had songs that were relatively familiar in sound to their 3 albums that preceded this CD. But I don't know what it is exactly, but it sounds different at the same time. Perhaps it's more melodic like in \\"Practice What You Preach\\" but containing more fast thrash like elements in \\"The Legacy\\"? That's what I seem to hear on this record. It's fairly progressive though, but it's definitely Testament and not bad. They even have an excellent ballad like song \\"The Legacy\\" which I think is the best song on this album. Songwriting on this album is a little less in quality compared to their older works, but nonetheless this is a pretty solid album.
0446691437|4.0|This book is inspiring, especially so if you happen to be an aspiring writer or other artist. The ideas are expressed in a motivational yet practical way, and I loved the conciseness.    You have to love someone who has a viewpoint, and delivers it without pause or doubt. Steven says something here, and as I read I got the genuine feeling that he 'needed' to say it, to get it out there. In my view, that's what makes an author interesting.    While I did not share some of the author's perspectives, I really didn't mind due to his unassuming and authentic way of expressing himself.    If I could speak to the minority of people reading this review who are aspiring writers, but haven't been published yet. Read this book. You WILL wind up recommending it to others, it's that good.

B000UX6THK|5.0|Diddo to all that has been said about this release. It is awesome indeed. I was surprised by all of the quality bonus materials included. My only gripe is that the Log Lady introductions are poor quality compared to the retouched video and remixed 5.1 sound. I love how 'A Slice Of Lynch' is done  in true Twin Peaks style.

While it may be argued that one might as well buy the originals one cannot overlook the fact the both the movie and this CD will introduce many to the works and life of Hector Lavoe who would have otherwise not even know of his existence.  Get this CD and the originals both on sale on Amazon!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you like Battlestar Galactica you will love this series even more!  It is a high quality production.  The cast is incredibly talented and the script has been refreshingly witty and clever.  I wish there were more episodes.    LOVE IT!!!!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|this movie has graphically brought to life what really happened on that fatefull day, in an eliquent and poinant way for all generations to remember.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|I'm going to start by saying that the main gripe I have with all three films is how EVERY SINGLE female in the films is extremely attractive, and how the camera loves showing close ups of them screaming in the most random and pointless ways. What, so if we don't live in New York, we don't have any prayer of knowing what hot women really are? Wow, guess our lives suck! Why are the female scientists conducting the experiment Sandman-to-be \\"stumbles\\" upon so hot? Give us a break already, you are trying way too hard Sam and it just makes you looks idiotic! Anyway, the film is way too long at 2 hours and 20 minutes for the ADD-laden and exhausted from being overworked and having too many children American audiences of nowadays, so they should have trimmed it by, oh, 45 minutes and saved themselves $100 million in budget anyway. The action sequences are way, way over the top and blindingly fast at times, thank the maker they just don't have the annoying \\"oontz-oontz-oontz\\" techno music of The Matrix films. Three villains in one film? Three words, Sam; BATMAN & ROBIN.    Sam just loves showing how \\"diverse\\" New York really is, I think these films have more Asians in them than any film made in an Asian country! Oh Sam, you're so cute for a Democrat! Please go sing in a Southern Baptist church with a faux accent like Hillary! Why did you make Peter emo, Sam, when he turned \\"dark\\"? Would you have done the same two years from now when emo inevitably crashes and burns like all other great American trends and nobody admits to adhering to it anymore? I doubt it! Boy, Harry Osborne sure can take a lot of beatings over and over again and not end up dead for a guy with no powers, just fancy equipment! Villains should be evil, Sam. Not guilt-ridden (you are a Democrat, aren't you!), not having any hidden agendas, not just \\"needing a chance\\". Make them detestable and ruthless instead of neo-hippies with muscles.    Speaking of, Topher Grace was a horrible choice. Sure, he's recognizable and I suppose attractive to females, but he's skinny. And too boyish. You needed someone with a bodybuilder physique and a bit more dynamic. You might have to look beyond Hollywood for this, but it's not impossible. They got more than enough massive Caucasian dudes to star in 300, for crying out loud! It's entertaining. It's long, has some absolutely deplorable dialogue (gee, here's Aunt May in another scene, what liberal parables will she dish out this time?), and is WAAAAAAAY too MTV-poppy like its predecessors, but hey, it's another film with a classic superhero. It's not Superman Reuturns bad, and it's not Batman Begins great. I'll put it smack-dab in the middle. 3 out 5. I'm feeling charitable today!
B00006JDU9|5.0|The entire Star wars saga is a truely timeless classic that people will be watching for generations.
B000VPUIA6|3.0|You'd think that with all of the awesome material available to Apple Corp. that they wouldn't be able to screw up products. Unfortunately, here's another bad Apple product. No matter how big of a fan you are, this massive DVDs/books/pictures set is not worth as much as it costs. I could maybe see $50. I stupidly paid $127 with tax at Best Buy, and I regret it.    The packaging isn't even that nice once you open it up. There's weird, pointless paper wrapped around the books that is just waiting to be ripped to shreds, because any time you want to access the DVDs, you have to open the picture book (which is inside the paper). Who thought this made sense? To top it off, the cheap foam circles holding the DVDs in fell off the book within hours of purchase.     The remastered DVD and music is pretty good, and worth the wait. The film still isn't perfect though, IMO. The sound is better than the film remaster. Hopefully that means it will be even harder for Apple to mess up the album remasters...whenever they finally come out.
B00005JMXX|5.0|This a great futeristic movie that is haunting to watch because of it's close parallel to our real situation in this world today.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|This set is awesome, the musical content, book, design all rock!!! Another awesome release from the best thrash metal band ever.  MEGADETH!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I really don't like John Mayer's typical sound that much. Something about his studio recordings is a turn-off. But THIS recording is an excellent addition to any rock'n'roller's collection. Stevie Ray Vaughn-ish sound and excellent musicians = a very good live recording. Highly, highly recommended.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Along with the fantastic release of Cars on Blu-ray comes Ratatouille, one of my most-loved releases of the year.  For some reason, this movie was one of the more overlooked Pixar releases yet.  If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on a beautiful, lush visual experience and a heartwarming and funny story.  Just all around movie magic.    Disney's building a reputation of being the leader in quality Blu-ray releases.  They're of the first studios to embrace the more advanced Java-based features of Blu-ray.  Ratatouille is no exception.  Given a relatively barebones treatment on DVD, the Blu-ray disc has all the extensive goodies you'd expect from a special edition DVD.  At first glace, it seems like the feature list is the same, save for a game and something called Cine-explore.  Cine-explore is where all the goodies are hidden.  A fun little feature that allows you to seamlessly branch out to small featurettes and deleted scenes that become available during the course of the movie.  If you want to cut to the chase, you can access every featurette directly from the special features menu.  And there's a LOT of material there.    From a technical perspective, the disc is brilliant.  A perfect video transfer lets you enjoy the beautiful art of Pixar in full HD resolution.  Absolutely no artifacting, compression issues, noise, or anything of the sort.  This is a pure digital transfer.  Definitely reference material.  And the same goes for the audio.  It gets a great treatment, and is a great way to demo your system.  This movie was made for Blu-ray.    Disney's hit it out of the park with this one, and it's wonderful to see Pixar's work get the treatment it deserves.  If you have a Blu-ray player of any sort, this is a must-own.
B00005JPLW|5.0|this is a great movie.based on actual events,this movie is approximately correct(there were 300 or so spartans,but they were joined by other greek supporters which brought the numbers to around 1000-1500...still,considering they fought against 150-200,000 persians,this still a monumental achievement).the photography/cinematography is outstanding...incredible battle scenes...the scenes almost look like ballet...incredible to watch...
0307277887|4.0|This was a very clever book.  It was very insightful as to the view of a sociopathic mind.  I thought it was very interesting the way the author tied in past events to create a personality unlike no other we see today.  Definately an interesting read.
B0000057C5|5.0|Please people when you hear the song \\"Du Hast\\" IT DOES NOT MEAN \\"You Hate\\" instead it means \\"You Have\\"! And majority of Ignorant people would know that if they would take a little bit of GERMAN (since thats the language they speak), instead of relying on people to tell them false translations. So next time you want to listen to Rammstein, do yourself and the true Rammstein's fan, take a German Class!
0805028846|1.0|I was so disappointed when I got this book.  I had expected to have step by step instructions for the cards pictured, but there are only basic techniques for making cards.  Nothing to really make one of the cards shown.  Very disappointing and a waste of time and money.  If you are like me and wanting a real \\"how to\\" book with patterns and direct instruction, look elsewhere.
B000Y179KO|1.0|AFTER ALL THESE YEARS THIS IS ALL THEY CAN COME UP WITH ? I JUST READ THAT THEY BEAT OUT BRITNEY SPEARS FOR BILLBOARDS NUMBER ONE SLOT. THAT MUST BE IN THE \\"MUZAK\\" DIVISION. I'LL PROBLEY START HEARING THIS JUNK NEXT WEEK IN THE FROZEN FOOD SECTION OF WALMART. I GREW UP LISTENING TO THIS BAND AND THEY'VE BEEN ON A DOWNHILL SLIDE FOR A LONG TIME, BUT NOW I THINK THEY'VE HIT THE BOTTOM. I SPENT 12.99 FOR THIS MIND NUMBING CRAP AND WAS SO BUMMED I JUST THREW IT IN THE TRASH.TO QUOTE ANOTHER BAND \\"MONEY FOR NOTHING\\"
B000UCEJEQ|2.0|I'm one of those die-hard Annie Lennox fans that has bought every solo and Eurythmics CD (or cassette) released since I first laid ears on \\"Sweet Dreams\\" at the age of 13 -- until \\"Bare\\" and now \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" came out.  Don't get me wrong -- she still has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard but her last two albums have fallen flat for me.  I understand that artists change with time and, as a result, so does their work but that doesn't mean they always change for the better.  I don't think Annie has lost her passion as I can still sense that in her music.  She just doesn't convey it as well as she used to.  Annie's voice is so ethereal -- so above the rest of us mere mortals -- that to mix it with what can best be described as a more mainstream sound is to diminish it.  That's how this CD feels to me.  It seems like Annie is no longer experimenting or pushing musical boundaries any more.  I admit I do like her best as the cold, distant Ice Queen (something Dave Stewart exploited quite well) but I guess that's because said persona suits her sound best: Untouchable.  Looking at my iTunes ratings today, one can see how a lifetime of listening to Ms Lennox has evolved for me.  Most of her commercial hits (\\"Here Comes the Rain Again,\\" \\"Why\\" and \\"No More 'I Love You's'\\" being exceptions) rate three stars or lower while obscure songs like, \\"Jennifer,\\" \\"Aqua\\" and \\"Savage\\" endure with five stars, still haunting me to this day.  Annie Lennox is at her best when she's subtle -- insidiously slipping through your personal defenses with her siren melodies until, before you realize it, she has pierced straight through your soul.  Unfortunately, \\"Mass Destruction\\", while technically sound, well produced and well performed, has all the subtlety of a sledge hammer by comparison.  I want her to taunt, tease and tantalize yet remain painfully aloof.  I say bring back the Diva, Annie.  Nobody hurt oh-so-good as she did.
B00092ZL80|1.0|The Earth Wind & Fire section of this album is terriffic. Chicago sure can play great music, however their singing has a lot to be desired. Whoever produced this album for Chicago should find another job. Chicago's singing sounds like kids screaming.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|I have admired Ms. Lennox from her days with Eurythmics and throughout her solo career. Yet it seems that her efforts in this and her previous album have lost some of the initial steam that made her first two solo productions so powerful.<br /><br />I couldn't help but feel a \\"deja vu\\" type feel when I listened through the album the first time... and the second one... and every single time. It reminded me too much of classic Annie, which could be a good thing. But artists of her stature (I am thinking of Peter Gabriel when I say this) need to find ways to reinvent themselves to escape the risk of becoming classics.<br /><br />As much as I love Annie Lennox, I didn't find in this album what I was hoping for.
1401300529|5.0|This is an enormously fascinating and very detailed history of the first year of the Korean War. The author presents a superb account of the conflict from the corridors of power in Washington and Tokyo to the lives of individual soldiers and their unit commanders on the front lines. This book is a classic study in how politics, both in the military as well as government, come to bear on the conduct of war and the lives of those who serve in the battle zone. As such, I found it hard, if not impossible to put down. It is one of those rare books worth reading several times and becomes more rewarding each time it is reread.  In my opinion, this book should be a mandatory text, not only for graduate level history courses covering the Truman Era, but for senior service schools as well.
0374105235|5.0|This book is everything I wanted it to be. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The service I had at Amazon was wonderful. The information provided about this book was appropriate and gave me an adequate picture of what the book was about. Thanks!
B000TXNDUW|5.0|Breathless (1959) Crierion Release: October 2007<br />The most influential \\"art\\" movie ever made. Influenceed by everything that came before it. Influenced everything that has come after it. I keep watching it over and over. The best Criterion release I own.
0316067598|5.0|The author takes you from the beginning to the end of what it means to be a true warrior against a global jihad on Western Civilization.  I couldn't put the book down without wanting to pick it back up and read some more.  Everything you want to know about SEAL training, SEAL code of 'never quit', and the SEAL Brotherhood.  A heart-gripping story about the incredible bravery of our elite fighting men in the mountains of Afghanistan, the brave villagers that helped them, and the ultimate sacrifices made by our finest men who died there. Thank you Marcus Luttrell, I salute you.
B000VSBX34|4.0|That's right, there is no footage of the legendary deleted scene. However, there are many great still shots and commentary about it which is interesting but I think it's false advertisement to say \\"deleted scene\\" on the package leading us to believe it to be actual film footage.<br />The rest of the extra disc is just ok. Richard Lester's commentary is always good but the only original actor to be interviewed is Eleanor Bron (who is wonderful). Victor Spinetti is in it very briefly. There's not much here as opposed to the DVD of A Hard Days Night.<br />The film itself is incredible however. The restoration is amazing and the soundtrack is \\"interesting\\". It's definitely worth the $15.99 I paid for it but I'm still disappointed about the deleted scene not being there.
B000HT386M|3.0|I was struggling to keep this movie on throughout the first half of the movie.  I won't lie.  It was bland, predictable, and just NOT entertaining in the least.  However, the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the movie absolutely saved the picture for me.  When the remote began randomly fast forwarding on him, the movie began to take on a different kind of role.  It became an eye-opening film, in a way.  Not a movie that would blow you away, but certainly one that will make you 2nd guess how you are currently living your life, and you may shed a tear or two in the process.<br /><br />The previews for this movie made me think it was going to be a slapstick comedy.  Although it did have a few LOL moments, overall, especially towards the end, it was more dramatic than a full fledge comedy.<br /><br />It's worth seeing if you're a Sandler fan.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|My DW bought this series, which I'd never heard of.  I feared it was yet another sci fi series that ended after just a few episodes, deservedly.  But I have to say, instead I found the shows funny, surprising, and quite entertaining.  The characters are enjoyable, the dialog is not always predictable, and overall I'd rate this show as good as or better than most other sci fi on TV.  High art this is not, but fun it is.  I wish they'd made many more episodes and kept it on the air.  We also bought the related movie, which I'd also recommend.
B000VL9XNI|1.0|No closed caption  or subtitle in English for the deaf and hard of hearing viewers????  What's up with that??
0385333846|1.0|I saw that they had a whole bunch of books by Vonnegut, and I heard his name before, so I figured he must be a good writer.  Boy was I wrong!!!  His entire book goes all over the place like he was totally high while he was writing, and so his writing just gets all crazy and you can't make sense of it, and his characters are all boring.    If you want to know what the story is like, read below, but it may have spoilers (who cares though, because you shouldn't read it ever!).  So it goes like this:    Billy Pilgrim has a big wang and is unstuck in time and gets captured by aliens and went to world war ii where he helped carry around a bible (oh, ironic, maybe?  He thinks he is so clever, but he isn't).  A tree died.  So it goes.  A bug died.  So it goes. People thinking I am not a bad writer died.  So it goes.    Stay away from this book unless you want to talk to all your supposedly smart friends about how funny he is when he isn't funny, while Vonnegut is thumbing his nose at you-know-who with every check and still they have a million of his books on the shelves instead of good books.  If he wants to be funny he should just do fart jokes because I bet even he could manage those, and they'll be funny to people a million years from now.
B000UJ48U4|3.0|Well, all the other sites mentions this movie as rated R.  Only Amazon says Unrated.    The one I bought is the box set and was rated R.    Can someone explain what is going on?    By the way I always liked his last movie.    But seems to me there is not much difference beteween this version and the other one that I already have.
B0000844IT|5.0|I pop in AOD I start laughing every time.  Everything that is Evil Dead is just cool.<br />\\"Looks your ruling Jack and Shet right now and Jack just left town\\".
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This collection is epic. The Eurythmics with the commanding vocals of Annie Lennox surpasses the test of time. All of the classics as I remember them, in one place for all time.
B00005AXEL|4.0|I bought this CD years ago when it first came out (what was it, 2001, 2002 or so?)..... I inadvertently left it lying around and it got damaged and scratched, so for years I kept saying \\"I must buy a new copy of Shangri-la because it's so good.\\" So I finally did and rediscovered a great collection of songs by Stevie Nicks, one of my favorite artists.    The best song on the album has to be \\"Every Day\\", to me at least, because of the rhythmic running up and down of Stevie's voice. It's a beatiful song that has both beautiful music and lyrics and lingers on because of the drawn out ending to the phrases. I enjoy it every time I hear it!    \\"Sorcerer\\" and \\"Planets of the Universe\\" are equally great songs with powerful lyrics and hypnotic melodies.    I enjoyed this album so much and it is very soothing to listen to Stevie's beautiful voice over and over again!
038533348X|1.0|I've never read a Vonnegut book before, and now I know why.  He died and so I saw him on the news and figured I should give him a shot.  Cat's Cradle kind of sounded dumb and it turns out it doesn't mean anything, but I don't judge books by their covers because that can't tell you anything, so I decided to read it anyway.    After the first sentence I knew the book was stupid.  \\"Call me Jonah?\\"  I mean, why call him anything?  What kind of crappy book starts like that?  Is that some kind of in joke or something where all the Vonnegutians are laughing SO HARD because he is SO FUNNY again.  It only took three words for me to know the book was dumb, but I kept reading it because I didn't want to give up and figured it may grow on me, but it didn't, unless you mean grow on you like athlete's foot does, by which I mean in a bad way, not like it grows on you a whole lot, because it doesn't except in a bad way.
B000VSBX34|5.0|First of all, This is a review of the $20 version of this DVD (not the $100 version), and is a review of the actually DVD, and not the actually movie.     I purchased this DVD on a whim, as I was observing the New Releases.  I popped it in my DVD player and BANG!!.  I had to quickly turn down the volume.  The Audio is high powered, which I love.  Some older movies have lousy audio volume, even after remastering.  Not this one.  You barely need to turn up the volume on your surround sound system. The Audio is extremely sensitive to the volume dial, if you know what I mean.     Secondly, I was extremely worried about this movie being a FULL SCREEN movie, which I hate!!  I own a 42 inch, 16x9 Widescreen Television.  And full screen movies have annoying black bars on the left and right side of the screen, and the picture looks thinned out.  This is NOT the case for this DVD.  There are extremely THIN black bars on the left and right sides of the screen, but is not really visible.  So I would call this a Widescreen version (the DVD itself says: 16.9 aspect ratio.  It is posted differently on amazon).  I was extremely happy that the bars were hardly visible, and the picture image is NOT thinned out.   Last, I want to comment on the songs.  The songs sound much better than the LP versions, in my opinion.  I hear more of a \\"live\\" sound, rather than a studio sound.  The vocals, drums, and guitars just sound too perfect.     If you are hesitant on buying this DVD because of the technical aspects of this DVD, DONT BE.  They are tremendously great.  I had my doubts when purchasing the one, but after I saw/heard it for myself, I was pleasantly surprised.  This has got to be one of the BEST remastering jobs in DVD history.   Don't let this one pass you by.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Ok, first things first. This is a review for the Unrated version of Live Free Or Die Hard. I will not go into plot lines, as its been done already on this page. What I will say is what is different. I have just watched my imported copy of Die Hard 4.0 (just recieved it today from the UK). Keep in mind this is the uncut UK edition and as such, should be the same as our domestic release. If there are any changes, I will post another review. To answer one reviewer's question about the runtime being the same as the theatrical version, He's right. It is the same runtime. However, the movie is unrated, not extended. The changes are all in the dialog. Some lines have been changed or removed all together. The \\"that will wake the neighbors \\" line is now removed, now jumping straight to the action instead of the pause. The \\"I ran out of bullets\\" line is now changed as well. There are alot of F***s and mother f*****s now replaced in the dialog. There is still some strange editing and weird syncs with the dubbing matching the actors mouths. There is more blood added and yes, Bruce does say his full catch phrase. The movie in my opinion, with everythig put back in, is much better. It feels even more like Die Hard than it did in theatres. All in all, this is a very enjoyable film and you should reserve judgement until you'e seen the Unrated Cut. To me, the differences made a significant improvement to what was already a great action movie and a good sequel to a great franchise.
0618871713|5.0|Fun Home is an autobiographical comic written in a nuanced, literary style, intermingling the stories of the author's coming to grips with her sexual identity and her closeted father's untimely death. Bechdel, author of Dykes to Watch Out For, draws in a style that meshes comfortably with her narrative, neither outshining nor underwhelming it. To consider this comic simple autobiography, however, would be a disservice. Through its pages one sees the trials and tribulations suffered by generations of queer America, both in the cities and in the small towns of America.    This novel will appeal to all readers who enjoy thoughtful literature. Bechdel's work is clever, emotionally gripping in a way that moves beyond simple feelings such as joy or anger and into the strange sensations (or lack thereof) that arise at life's crossroads. She includes many snippets of other authors' works when the characters are reading, using the texts to replicate their various epiphanies, from Camus' The Stranger to Pauline Reage's The Story of O.
0517223546|5.0|I have read this book three times, and each time I am captivated!  Rutherford takes us from the very beginnings of time, and weaves the story of Britain's history in an exciting way that keeps me turning the pages.    His family lineages carry the story lines forward through the ages -- a technique that I really enjoyed as I read!    I travelled to England and visited Salisbury Cathedral after I read SARUM the first time -- it gave me a greater appreciation for the people of that land, and for the beautiful cathedral itself!    I highly recommend SARUM, it's one of my favorite books!
B000VPUIA6|5.0|If you're a Beatles collector, you should buy the deluxe version no question. It's been designed with so much class and attention to detail  rarely seen in \\"Special Editions\\". It is a bit pricey but so was \\"Anthology\\" and we all ran out and paid for the book and the Video's and then the DVD's a couple of years later. The Help! book and Dick Lester's script come wrapped in special Beatles logo paper sealed with a Help! sticker. It was like unwrapping a present. There is also a poster and \\"mini\\" lobby cards also included. The 2 disc set includes the movie Letterboxed for the first time. The new sountrack mix is phenominal. If you have 5:1 surround you will be stunned at the beauty of the mixes. It's a sampling of the entire Beatles catalog that will be released in 5:1 hopefully next year. The second disc has some never before seen material as well. The only problem is it's not to convienient to get to the DVD's. The deluxe package is \\"big\\" and not easily manupulated. I guess I'll buy the regular set to solve that problem.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Interesting way to merge a western with Sci-fi! This movie really pulls all of the Firefly episodes into focus and allows the audience to experience closure of a TV episode that was canceled way to early. I suppose if the Fox network would have shown the original series in order, it might have helped the audience go with the flow instead of trying to guess how or what or why things happened in a more chronological order. I suggest those that love this movie to get the series set and watch them in order. I know there are a lot of people out there that are not just fans, but are part of the Firefly Cult Group. It's also nice to see the actors that were in the movie and the series getting some action in Hollywood. The Captain is one of the newest additions to Desperate Housewifes and more of the original crew have been seen in other popular shows. Let's keep Firefly flying in our lives by purchasing this movie and the episodes package as well!
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics is an engaging analysis of comics that delights while it intrigues. Written in comics format itself, the book analyzes comics throughout history, discussing their evolution and the conventions and methods that make them work, and it explores the possibilities of what they can do. First published in 1993, this book has justifiably received much praise and become one of the primary books read by people who want to know about comics.    Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it provides a solid defense of the worth of comics, showing the traditions comics came from, how most readers tend to confuse the medium (words & pictures) with the content (brainless superheroes, impossible musculature, etc.). McCloud packs a lot of information into each chapter, and if you take the time to think about what he's saying, you'll find yourself thinking hard about things you might never have considered, from the ingredients that combine to form complex emotions on a person's face, to the ways we are indoctrinated into consuming art and literature, to the effect created by putting a frame around something.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|For the first 4 months I thought this product was a dream. I liked the fact that it was very light weight, great for quick pickups after meals. Then the problems started. First the battery lost its gusto, would only hold a charge for maybe 15 minutes. Next one of the clips on the top broke off. Then when the pole broke and there were wires showing I decided it was time to let it go. I am very sad at the failures of this product, I REALLY wanted to love it!
B000EYK2GE|5.0|What a joy to listen to! Everone on stage seems to be unabashed happy to be with Carl and just have a great unrestrained time. Recorded in 85 in front of a live and appreciative audience, Perkins brings his guests on one at a time to play with his band and sing solos and duets or harmonies. Perkins sounds absolutely great and his energy seems to infiltrate into everyone's soul. Harrison plays and sings with great confidence and clarity, Ringo reprises his Beatles copy of Perkin's \\"Honey Don't\\", Clapton sings and really turns it up on guitar, Edmonds plays great and Roseanne Cash rocks on \\"What Kind of Girl\\". The music is outstanding and is full of energy but their pure joy of being together comes through on this great album and closes quite touchingly as Perkins thanks his friends after the film stops but the tape rolls on as this all star band of friends plays on.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Look for my other review on Serenity. This is the Firefly series Package I was talking about. But as hard as it may seem, watch the series in order first, then watch Serenity. Don't spoil the fun and excitement without getting to know the characters first and how they began this exploration on the best Western Sci-fi show ever!
B000U618C8|5.0|I love this album. Every song on it is unique and beautiful. The lyrics are pure poetry and he has a timeless voice and good ear for melody. Buy it dammit!
0307346617|5.0|I have a craving for zombie stories.  Sounds weird, but after watching 28 Days and Shawn of the Dead, I was really in the mood for some good zombie action.  This was it.  I liked it so much, I read it twice! I also read Stephen King's Cell, not bad Steve, but no match for this book.<br /><br />I read some of the bad reviews and all I can say is those reviewers are completely wrong (again, reality has a liberal bias) this book is so exciting and frightening.<br /><br />I almost cried reading about the canine corps and the zack in the ocean, freaking horrible!  I was so scared I woke my husband up to check out a sound I heard in the basement!  I am still a little shaky.<br /><br />If you want a gorefest, lots of blood and entrails, then you should check out a different author, Poppy or Little maybe.<br /><br />Some people have mentioned Monster Island as comparable.  Not even close.<br /><br />I wish Max would write another book, because this was over too soon for me.
B00005JP5P|4.0|Is this movie flawed=yes, is it still an exciting and well made movie=heck yes!  Not sure how this film will translate when it goes to DVD (you are going to need to watch it on a big widescreen TV) but in the theatre it was beautiful to watch. The film makers stretched their limited budget and made a picture that has some amazing images.    The 1st and 2nd acts of this movie had me thinking \\"wow-this could be a classic\\" but the film does stumble in the 3rd act and what could have been a great film is turned into a good film. Yes, the film borrows/steals from the best but the images along with very good acting from the leads helps lift it above these weaknesses.   Watch it on as Big a Screen as you can and enjoy what I consider one of my favorite summer popcorn movie.    In Short - much better than most other so called \\"fun summer movies\\" that came out in 2007

B000O1799U|1.0|Time for an ounce of common sense and perspective, from a woman that sure has earned the right (me, of course!).  This movie is a crash-and-burn failure from the moment it begins to when the end credits roll.      The music never sounds authentic to the time frame of the movie.  Even if somehow this crud had been released by Motown back in the day, it would've killed their reputation because none of them would have been hits.  Worst of the bunch is the kidnergarden joke of a song, \\"Cadillac Car\\".      There was no need for it to be a true musical.  This could've been the phoney biopic that it is without having any of the actors singing their dialogue.    What Jennifer Hudson does in this movie is merely an approximation of singing.  It's more commonly known as histrionics.  Her big moment of \\"I'm Telling You I'm Not Going\\" (or whatever it's called) is painful and grating.      Eddie Murphy is the only participant who hints at something better (even if his singing hasn't improved beyond his old James Brown routines and inane recordings in the '80s) - but on a dramatic level he is given nearly nothing to do.  His performance is comprised almost entirely of onstage songs, which are delivered with much energy but do not result in a well-crafted character.    Not one single music biopic cliche is left unturned - and this is of course an entirely fictitous movie which COULD have resulted in some imagination.  Why not just watch a made-for-TV biopic like [[ASIN:B00005NSXV The Temptations]] or [[ASIN:B00005TQ44 The Jacksons - An American Dream (The Complete Miniseries)]] because those are at the very least based on true stories.  PLUS they have the genuine article when it comes to the music.
B00023B1LC|4.0|There is a compelling power to the Bourne trilogy films: The martial elegance of a supreme hunter; the beauty of reborn innocence; the inspired acting of Matt Damon - a stoic killing machine who protects children and whose goodness we admire more with each passing moment - and an action story deeply planted in character rather than built on gadgetry. In short this film delivers.<br /><br />The plot is excellent. Like Roger Zelazny's Amber Chronicles and Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, the protagonist wakes in critical condition unable to remember himself, immediately confronting death while piecing together the puzzle of his own shattered identity. Meantime a hostile world seeks Jason Bourne's destruction.<br /><br />Loosely based on the inspired works of fiction by former US Marine Robert Ludlum, the Bourne Identity portrays the CIA MKUltra program of creating \\"Manchurian Candidates\\" (through a smorgasbord of hypnosis, martial arts training, and torture). Ie, hypno-programmed robot assassins: \\"It's like behavioral software\\". But in Jason Bourne's case the software has crashed: \\"You're a malfunctioning thirty million dollar weapon\\". The movie is also a mute commentary on the bitter heartlessness of the modern intelligence state, and the moral twilight of CIA Clandestine Services.<br /><br />Fished from the sea, healed by a wise old man, aided by a beautiful maiden, assaulted by ghouls, seeking to escape a labyrinth of unknown dangers, the hero triumphs. That's the Bourne Identity. Pure heroic myth depicted in great cinema.<br /><br />This is a dynamic movie with nine lives. What's more it has a happy ending. One of my favorites.
B00005A0N5|5.0|Nightwish!!! A very powerful band! This album is AMAZING! It is heavy, and with awesome fills! This Album is a must have !!!
B00008LDPU|5.0|A great video, again purchased for my son, who really enjoyed it.  Amazon got it to him before his birthday which was an added bonus.  It's a great vidwo for many ages.
B0002XVQNU|1.0|This is one movie you won't want to not miss! Honestly, whose idea was it to have daredevil play fight Electra? That scene makes me so sick to my stomach. I tried to vomit but I couldn't because my vomit was afraid of seeing this movie. The soundtrack is the worst! It is as if they found a bad compilation cd on the ground in a highschool parking lot and decided, hey, lets use this instead of some composer and his crummy orchestra. I bought this movie hoping they would have cut out the horrible electra love scenes and changed the music but they hadn't. They kept everything that sucked about the original release and that makes it even suckier. This is the only comicbook movie worse than Fantastic 4. Keep your 7 dollars. Do not buy this dvd unless you want to hurt yourself.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Random thoughts on this movie...response to other reviews...<br /><br />On Keanu Reeves: I went to see this movie because I am a Keanu Reeves fan and I enjoy him most in his action/fantasy movie roles than in his attempts at straight drama. While this movie is not as enjoyable as a \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\\" or a \\"Matrix\\", it is not the hopeless mess that so many Amazon reviewers have indicated. It is a solid 3 star (mid-range) movie.  It is a must-see and perhaps must-have for Keanu Reeves fans.  I might not watch this movie over and over again as I have watched the \\"Matrix\\" and \\"Bill & Ted\\" but I will definitely watch it again.<br /><br />On the movie genre: I am not an expert on nor a die-hard fan of this movie genre. So my rating of this movie is intended for people who are not fans/experts on this genre, just ordinary movie goers like me. The antecedents of this movie -- that it is based on a comic book series -- are clear. Where else would such an arcane plot come from except the panels of a comic book? I like the fact that this movie does not take itself too seriously.  The movie is not produced with the extremely polished block-buster values of a \\"Batman\\" or \\"Spiderman\\" movie. I have no problem with that. Some movies with tons of money put into production become overly-polished and bland (the equivalent of waxed apples). I like my fruit and movies unwaxed.<br /><br />On offensiveness to Catholics/Christians: No real Catholics or Christians were harmed in the making of this movie. The intent of the movie is neither earnest (e.g. \\"Jesus Camp\\") nor satiric (e.g. Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian\\" or \\"South Park\\"). Its usage of the Catholic religion is a plot device only, a prop. I could detect no statements, negative or positive, about real religion in the movie. Nothing in this movie will cause a Christian to become an atheist. That said, I will state the obvious: this movie is inappropriate for impressionable and/or sensitive children (younger than 10), regardless of their religious upbringing. It is the kind of movie that would have given me nightmares as a child. (I have amended my review to add the preceding caution statement because I am always surprised at the age of children brought to some movies by their parents. What are those parents thinking? Are they crazy?)<br /><br />On why 3 stars: I would not have chosen to watch this movie if Keanu Reeves had not been in it. The biggest downfall of this movie is the script. There are no memorable scenes in the movie until the end. It was boring for short periods. The boring parts were never long enough for me to lose interest completely.  (I will not finish watching a thoroughly boring movie even if Keanu Reeves is the star.)<br /><br />Another movie in which Satan attempts to take over the world, comedy, non-comic book: Kevin Smith's \\"Dogma\\", solid 4 star movie, starring Ben Affleck, Matt Damon.

1594489505|5.0|Having loved Khaled Hosseini's first novel, The Kite Runner, I began reading A Thousand Splendid Suns the second day it came out.  I was not disappointed.  The book is powerful, revealing much about how we are as humans through the means of one woman's story.  I appreciate Hosseini's focus on how we heal from the wounds of our past, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys powerful fiction which also elucidates their own lives.
1556904355|5.0|My mother and I listened to this on a long road trip (found the CD at the library). I'm a huge fan of the movie, so I didn't know how I would like it, but O'Karma's performance is spot-on and amazing. We were sorry whenever we had to stop the car and couldn't wait to keep driving because it was that good. I didn't know how close the movie was to the book--very close--the book adds a lot of detail to my picture. Will probably actually read the print version sometime in the future.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What a delight this was. From the opening of the box, as the packaging for the DVD is fantastic. This is the way to watch the series, as watching the BBC via my cable channel means you see many, really bad commercials with great frequency. No eruptions just great TV viewing. Great cast and stories.  Love the old call box and the old show feel. I confess the old show did not  do it for me as it ran on PBS in the 70's. This one however has great effects and is really well written.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I think this is an incredible album.  This is my first Avenged Sevenfold album, so I don't know their earlier work (yet), but this album makes me want to.  The melodies are so beautiful.  The music is strong.  And the lead singer, Wow! His voice is awesome.  I can't say enough good things about this album.
0307236722|5.0|What I love about this book:<br /><br />*clear easy to follow directions<br />*color pictures for every recipe<br /><br />It not only goes through the recipes, but at the beginning of every chapter it outlines the important tools you will need as well as the technique for using them.  It teaches you how to bake, instead of merely putting the recipe out there and assuming you will understand the terminology.<br /><br />Great book, I've already made several recipes from tasty deserts (mmm mocha roulade) to daily staples like bagles.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|If this box set did not include the DVD, it would not take on the significance it has. After all, most long time fans of Loreena McKennitt are already quite familiar with most or all of the songs on it. Without the DVD, it would just be an excellent live concert CD. With it, the listener can grasp a fuller sense of the visual and aural extravaganza that Nights From the Alhambra was.<br />We all like McKennitt's unique sound and the way her songs borrow from a wide swath of cultures stretching from the Emerald Isle to Anatolia. Here we can not only relish that sound, but we can see how it is created by an array of strange and wonderful instruments, many of which are unfamiliar to the average listener.<br />Each CD offers a little more than three quarters of an hour's worth of music. The DVD is a bit longer than the two CDs combined because the songs are interspersed with McKennitt's commentary. On the DVD, the cameras wander around, providing the viewer not just with a lot of close-ups of McKennitt and her band, but also of the Alhambra itself.<br />Of course I have my favorites, but I find the entire package a delight. If you are already a fan of Loreena McKennitt and have not yet heard or seen Nights From the Alhambra, then its time to do so now. This is one of those CDs likely to be regarded by posterity as an essential work of the early 21st century.
0307165485|5.0|I remember this big, fat book with a million pictures inside as one of my very favorites as a child. Many of Scarry's amazing illustrations are \\"Where's Waldo\\"-like, with hundreds of details of, say, a mouse family visiting London. Others are larger and more simple. Some pages have stories, while others just have pictures with basic word titles. All this lends the book a wonderful sense of pacing -- busy-ness followed by calm, information followed by silliness.<br /><br />I recently gave this book to a 3 year old, who turned straight to the detailed pages of old fashioned trains and was immediately enraptured. His parents loved it, too.<br /><br />My top gift recommendation of all time, for ages 2-5 especially.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I admit that I am a Knopfler fanatic. But, with music like this, why wouldn't you be? Knopfler may be one of the most talented, most respected guitarists in the world, but he is really a storyteller. His lyrics haunt the soul. Heart Full of Holes is eloquent, personal, and sad, but vague and left open for interpretation. The swell of the accordian towards the middle of the song gives me goos bumps everytime I listen to it. Secondary Waltz is light, but not without honesty. Let It All Go is about a failed painter telling the up and comers to give it up while they're still ahead. Madame Geneva's, The Fish and the Bird, and In the Sky are all beautiful, and upsetting at the same time. Mark uses several old time instruments to give the songs a rusty, antique feeling. The only thing this album is lacking is one good rollicking song. There aren't any songs on this album that are like What It Is (Sailing to Philadelphia) or Why Aye Man (Ragpicker's Dream). I can only hope that Mark will give us a song or two that showcases that swinging style that he has perfected over the years. This is not a complaint, though. This album is perfect.

Of course, God is the meany and the dark angels are the \\"good guys\\". Blatant satanism in other words. The author serves the father of lies and after reading him you feel unclean.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|After 2 seasons of plodding along, Atlantis really picks up for its 3rd season.    Characters start to feel more fleshed out, with developments in their lifes and not feeling like the cardboard cut outs of the previous 2 seasons.      I wont give away any of the plots etc but there are a good couple of running b plots that show up every now and then, something season one and two had a lack of.    IN short, if you had given up on atlantis, season 3 is worth watching as it almost feels like its started again afresh.
B000K15UFE|5.0|Saxophone Colossus is a great album.  I'm writing this review to simply let everyone know that the Bonus tracks on this album really just make this a Double album.  Work Time is the other album.  This release does not have additional tracks from the Saxophone Colossus session as a review on Allmusic.com led me to believe.  If you don't have Saxophone Colossus get this disc and have two albums for the price of one!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Yes, this is a \\"soundtrack\\" and not really a \\"Beatles album\\" per se, but this is so incredible it stands on its own. The achievement in sound mixing alone is well worth the price. I wish I had time for a full proper review but I don't.<br /><br />The sound quality is better than anything I have heard before.<br /><br />The unique manner in which songs are combined = genius.<br /><br />Yoko, Paul and Ringo all worked together to make sure the songs were not abused or taken out of context and to ensure top quality in the new mixes.<br /><br />From the opening track \\"because\\" you can tell you are in for something original and very special.<br /><br />Abbey Road will always be my favorite album, but this now comes in at a close second. Perhaps one reason is the way so many of the songs run together just like the b-side of Abbey Road.<br /><br />Get it now!

B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is the first movie I ever saw.  It was 1967 in Billings, Montana with my mother.  She left the other six Irish Catholic kids at home with dad and took just me.  I still remember the smell of popcorn and the theater seat pushing up so hard on my little body that I had to sit in mom's lap.  Upon viewing Jungle Book again last week, this little boy cried tears of pure joy at the opening scene until the end.  That's saying something for a jaded 43-year old trial lawyer.  Buy it now and go in peace.

0790729628|4.0|Set in Los Angeles in November 2019, Harrison Ford stars as the \\"blade runner\\" Rick Deckard, a special police officer who must track down and \\"retire\\" four \\"replicants\\" who have returned to earth from \\"off-world\\" colonies. Their crime is that they want to be fully human; as it is, they are genetically manipulated humanoids, virtually indistinguishable from normal humans except that they are superior in strength and intellect, lack full emotions, and have a life span of four years. Deckard falls in love with Rachel, a fifth, experimental replicant who thinks she is truly human, and there are ambiguities that Deckard himself might be a replicant (\\"Did you ever take the test yourself?\\") and in the way the film ends. Blade Runner fared poorly when it was released in 1982, the same weekend as ET, but since then it has become a cult classic that regularly appears on lists of the best films ever. Much more than a sci-fi thriller, which it is, the film explores nothing less than what it means to be human in a very dark world. The year 2007 marks its twenty-fifth anniversary, and since its original release there have been seven versions of the film, including The Final Cut (2007)--notable because it's the only version over which the director Ridley Scott had total control. For a good artcile on Blade Runner see [...]

B0007MWZEK|5.0|It's now Sept. 16th 2008 and I still love it!<br /><br />Another thing I learned is to use the device included to clean the brushes.  I thought mine was needing to be charged too often, but it just turned out that the brushed needed cleaning.  Funny though, with a new charge, even with a ton of hair in the brushes, it still worked.  Now I clean the brushes a bit more regularly.<br /><br />I've had my sweeper for three months now and I am just thrilled!  It's great for kid messes in between regular vacuuming.  I'm going to get one for all of my family for Christmas.  It's great on my wood floor and carpet.  It will bog down a bit on the carpet when the battery charge is getting low, but that is easily remedied with a recharge.  Just remember DO NOT OVERCHARGE the battery.
0156012197|4.0|They say it is the translation that makes this book not very easy to read however I am not sure that is the case.

The Little Prince is a man who isn't happy with his wife (his single rose) and leaves her to discover other relationships (planets). With this in mind the story will make much more sense, I promise.

B00005V9HA|3.0|I enjoy a good zombie movie, especially the older ones.  Re-Animator worked because it pretty much lived up to my expectations of what a mid 80's zombie movie should look like.  It was cheap, yes, but some of the effects were pretty great in a low budget horror movie sort of way.  The acting wasn't anything to rave about, but it shouldn't try to be (although Jeffrey Combs gives us a perfectly restrained creepiness).  The music is even pretty good and doesn't feel incredibly outdated.    The first half is rather slow and it takes a while to get going, but once the zombie action begins, it doesn't fail to deliver rewarding you with a gruesome second half.  This edition is also remasted by THX so the picture and sound quality are supurb.  There is also no lack of features in this millennium edition.    It's no Evil Dead 2, but if you're a zombie horror fan and you haven't seen this, what are you waiting for?  The only thing that keeps me from bumping this one up a star is for the dull first half (a lot of setting up I know, but give us some kind of hook!) and is it too much to ask for a horror movie to try and be scary?  Other than that, there's lots of blood, some nudity and a decapitated zombie roaming around, what more could you want?
B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember when this came out in 1997... everyone was raving about it.  I turned up my nose, and went back to listen to my usual prog/heavy rock albums.    Every once in a while I'd hear a track from this album and think \\"hmm, that's not bad\\", but only recently, at the urging of a friend, I revisited this album... prepared to hate it so I could brag about the superiority of my own musical tastes.    ... however, I can no longer deny what my ears are telling me (borrowed the line from another review because it fits).... this is great (even with the blemishes of Fitter Happier and Electioneering).  The rest of it is great.
B000NA28I4|3.0|Ok, let me first say that the book is way, way, way better than the movie adaptation.  (Aren't all the books better than the movies?)  Being a fantasy genre, *Eragon* should have been directed by those who made LOTR and Harry Potter and the like.  I mean, hey, let's admit it, we're nerds!  However, seeing that *Eragon* was rated PG, then you should know that this was made with only kids in mind.  Not that this is an excuse for leaving out...what...80 or 90% of the story.<br /><br />But, to be fair, *Eragon* was somewhat an enjoyable movie...even though I knew what was missing.  It would have been nice to see more bonding between Saphira and Eragon.  Perhaps a montage would have helped or something like that.  It would have been nice to see Eragon bonding with Brom and learning ancient words of the Elves.<br /><br />I had a different image in my mind when I read the book.  For example, elves should look like elves...you know, pointed ears.  In the movie, you'd have no idea that there were Elves in the movie.  Scrying is a whole lot different in the movie.  To me, Eragon and Arya  just happened to connect on the same dream \\"wavelength\\".  And lastly, it would have been nice to show the Varden as more elaborate and breathtaking.<br /><br />Ah well, *Eragon* was made the way it was made.  Of course, I'm not satisfied with it.  However, if you can put away your expectations and just watch it, you might enjoy it...a little.
0525950079|1.0|Based on an interview I saw with Ken Follett, which was what prompted me to purchase this book, I thought this was a \\"historical\\" novel - after reading about 1/3 of it is, to me, just a novel set in the Middle Ages, with too many characters, most of whom I find uninteresting. I don't intend to read any more of it - this is going right to the Public Library as a donation.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.<br /><br />V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.<br /><br />Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.<br /><br />The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.<br /><br />The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.<br /><br />Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.<br /><br />Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.<br /><br />In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite someof the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them.

0525950079|1.0|I purchased World Without End (WWE) because I had read Pillars of the Earth when it first came out. Pillars was an OK book although on the second read last month (after I had already ordered World Without End) I realised it wasn't all I had thought it was the first time around.<br /><br />In WWE I had my hopes up thinking that Follett would have written a book similar to that of Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />The book is ok (though overly long) if you don't mind moving from one unbelieveable crisis to another each one more contrived and worse than the last. The whole book seems to be written as if the plauge had happened in the 20th Century rather than in the 1300's. There's enough sex in the book to make it seem like Desperate Houswive's set in a monastery -<br /><br />To put it mildly - I didn't like it. I expected more and was let down a lot.<br /><br />I would have probably given this book to someone as a gift but it was so bad I think I'll just donate it to a charity (one that doesn't expect too much).
B000I2J6K0|5.0|OMG! this is the best prenatal DVD I tried. I really felt like i got a good work-out. I was sweating big time & felt sored the next day. I'm also a runner. It was very simple and she explained everything well. I can already see my muscle toning up. It was just perfect!!!
B000JVSUS4|3.0|This movie is very enjoyable in plot and special effects. But, unfortunately the video transfer was poorly done in Blu-ray. If you already have standard DVD version, save your money.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This is the sound of a band growing up and growing out of the trite and tired metalcore scene.  Great album that requires an open mind and punishes musical myopia.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|First of all, a big congratulations goes out to everyone involved in the restoration on this film. It looks fantastic.  Also, the 5.1 mixes of the Beatles' songs are wonderful! Everyone involved deserves a big pat on the back for doing such an amazing job! Onto the many complaints posted here by others: Don't let the many wankers out there that have nothing more to do than to whine about the price of the limited edition keep you buying this DVD. If you'll notice, the price is about the only thing they can complain about! They didn't even mention the beautiful quality, both audio and video, of this DVD. I'm not wealthy, but I coughed up the 95.00 to buy the it and I'm GLAD I did. In a couple of years, maybe sooner, you will see the price of this much higher on the online auctions. ( Don't believe it? Check out the new Wilbury's limited edition.) Maybe the limited edition is out of reach for some people, but the regular package of Help! includes the very same restored, remixed version of this film. It is a must have. If you don't have a 5.1 system, search out a friend that does. You won't believe your ears when you hear the remixes of the songs. Now, this brings up another point - the songs on Help! have obviously been remastered, it's no secret now! Where, then, is the remastered CD of this title? Beatles Fans, buy this DVD! Don't let the crybabies ruin it for you. I'd love to be able to give this more than 5 stars. It deserves it.
B000W1V44I|4.0|Never a huge fan of the Backstreet Boys due to the fact of my age, I can appreciate them more now with the more mature sound. They have left the bubblegum pop behind and stepped into more of the Adult Contemporary facet.<br /><br />The latest release of `Unbreakable' consists mainly of power ballads. Although, at some times, some of the songs can be a bit overboard on the dramatic effect - they seem to pull it off. A lot of the songs on this effort have a similar theme which is heartache, breakup and love which at times get be a bit of a downer but they do throw a few up-tempo songs in there to mix it up a bit.<br /><br />I never would have thought of the Backstreet Boys as a group with good harmonies (simply from their past CD's) but, they do! The 4 of them sound really good together and their voices blend well on the power ballads.<br /><br />A few of my favorites and songs to listen to are:<br />\\"Love Will Keep You Up All Night\\" - my favorite track on here. Full of emotion and they guys sound remarkable together.<br />\\"Helpless When She Smiles\\" - Another great ballad that really showcases the growth with their voices.<br />\\"Everything But Mine\\" - A good up-tempo track that gets your toes tapping sans the bubblegum feeling. I like it!<br />\\"Unmistakable\\" - Another gem of a ballad. Really has a great melody and very radio friendly.<br /><br />I am glad that I put my thoughts of the BSB's (from the past) aside and purchased `Unbreakable'. You can tell they are making music geared toward an older crowd and it really works. I went with 4 stars because at times a few of the songs are just too sappy and overdone.<br /><br />~~~~~~JAC  07'
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Its got just about every hit song you could want wrapped in a nice 2-disc package.  My only gripe and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that these are the short cuts of each song.  Shock the Monkey in particular is the quick radio edit version.  I think that one should have been the 7\\" release if not the 12\\".  Aside from that minor detail, these are excellent sounding reproductions and an ideal pick for the compilation-collecting crowd.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt has it all: a unique, enchanting voice, great melodies and he is a great lyricist. He has proved that with his debut `Back To Bedlam' and he attempts it again on his most recent release: `All The Lost Souls' , and he succeeds! Not messing much with the formula that paid off so well for him the first time around makes this CD all the more brilliant. He sticks to the same great melodies and the sometimes haunting lyrics that make him standout in his genre.<br /><br />Standout tracks include:<br /><br />\\"1973\\" - the first single to be released. I really enjoy this song as it has a bit of a more upbeat tone to it.<br /><br />\\"One Of The Brightest Stars\\" - SO good!  Very melodic and has hit written all over it.<br /><br />\\"I'll Take Everything\\" - a great song and one of my favorites included on the set.<br /><br />If you are already a James Blunt fan you will love this CD from start to finish (as I do). It is a must have as he has all the potential to be around for a long while.<br /><br />~~~JAC 07'
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is a great film noir about has-been silent film actress Norma Desmond and never-will-be screenwriter Joe Gillis and the tragedy that occurs when both confuse mutual opportunism with romance set against the backdrop of an unforgiving and quick-to-forget Hollywood that has chewed up both characters. So many other people have analyzed this film and its extras, but let me just say that the most surprising thing about this particular DVD edition of this film was its superb treatment including the well-done commentary and three featurettes - \\"The Making of Sunset Boulevard\\", \\"Edith Head - The Paramount Years\\", and \\"The Music of Sunset Boulevard\\". Paramount has done such a poor job with its classics on DVD over the years this took me totally by surprise. I guess I can lump Universal in with Paramount on this one since Universal owns much of Paramount's pre-1948 catalog and usually just releases bare-bones DVDs of Paramount's films with no extras. If you like noir, and even if you've seen the film many times already as I did before I purchased the DVD, I highly recommend this edition since you'll get much interesting information such as insight into why this was a difficult film for Billy Wilder to make at the time. Apparently the Hollywood moguls and studio executives didn't want the general public seeing the callous nature of the business from the inside. Then there is the information on what the prologue to the film originally was and why it was changed after it was previewed by audiences and evoked howls of laughter. Highly recommended.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is by far the best tv series that I have watched since it's debut, and to have the entire series including both pilots (that was not released on the first season 1 box set) is a thrill in itself...I have been watching re runs every chance I can get...My only minute complaint is the way the DVDs were packaged...it's a tad too delicate and flimsy...
0552999652|4.0|Black Hawk Down is a fascinating book about an American war against Somali's, that goes terribly wrong. The American soldiers were dispatched from base on a mission that was expected to last only 3 hours, therefore they leave behind most of their equipment. Then once they get there, even before the battle starts, things start going wrong. From then on, event after event, the conditions just keep on getting worse, until a Black Hawk is seen dropping down fast from the sky, smoke coming from the tail. From then on, the American soldiers continue to lose hope, and believe that they will be stuck there forever, without their necessary supplies and equipment.    The 486 page long book, written by Mark Bowden, is an amazingly true story about a modern war taken from all aspects of the soldiers in the war. The book is written in 3rd person omniscient, and literally uses each soldier in the war as a character. In this book you will get to hear the war happening, and everything that each soldier is thinking and shooting. But there are many characters (emphasis on many) in this book, and to fully enjoy it, I would recommend re-reading it so that you can understand each character. In some points of the story the book does get slow, talking about some soldiers lives before the war, but in the long run, it helps you understand the behaviors and characteristics of each soldier, making the book that much more enjoyable.    Black Hawk Down does use some terminology that is war related and sophisticated, but you most likely won't need to be going into a dictionary to discover the meanings of their code words and weapon terminology. The novel is somewhat gory and graphic, but not extremely horrible. Ages +14 should be able to handle this book of a true war story.  Overall this novel is a great insider story on modern war. It shows what actually happens in wars, without the Hollywood effects added in. And since there are plenty of characters in this book, you should definitely be ableto relate to one of them, and see how you would do in a war situation such as this. Therefore I give this book a 4 out of 5 stars (I would give it 4.5 stars, but there is no option) because of its honesty of war, and its great detail in which it immerses you into the story with.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|Yes, it is a high quality and well written extravaganza from Pixar again. It is ruined by the Widescreen or as the box puts it, original theatrical aspect ratio. Once more jargon and bad decisions based on it rears its ugly head. Dizney's decision or Pixar's? Either way, not giving people an honest option of fullscreen or widescreen was an ugly and evil move. Keep doing this and the next review will be a two.
B000002BBY|5.0|Back in the mid 90's the music press (especially in Europe) hailed Oasis as the second coming of the Beatles.  The band often treated their fans with contempt and both of the Gallagher brothers had egos that would consistently land them in trouble with each other and the public in general.  The band never made it as big in the US as they did in England, but even with all the drama surrounding the group they have to be given credit for putting out some excellent music.  \\"Morning Glory\\" is a great album from start to finish and probably the band's high water mark as a recording unit.  Every song on this album is catchy as hell.  These guys may not be the greatest musicians in the world, but there is something here that transcends your average pop pabulum.  Several huge hits came from this disc including \\"Wonderwall\\", and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" both of which are great songs.  Other winners here include \\"Hello\\", \\"Roll With It\\", \\"Some Might Say\\", \\"She's Electric\\", and the best song about cocaine addiction ever written \\"Morning Glory\\".  For some reason this is the only Oasis album that I own, but each time I pull it out I remember how much I liked it and think about getting more of their stuff.  The one negative comment I have is the production.  The album is not recorded that well and has a very muddy sound in spots.  It's a pity as proper production could really have enhanced this material, but overall if you like well done pop rock this is about as good as it gets.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Ratatouille is a beautiful film and a wonderful showcase for your new Blu-ray player.  As beautiful as this film was on screen, it's even more breathtaking on Blu-ray.  Every detail and subtle color shine.  I was truly blown away by the quality of the picture.     As for the film itself, it holds up even better the second or third time around.  Definitely a more sophisticated tale than what's usually expected in an animated film.  And while really young children may squirm through a lot of this, that doesn't at all detract from the quality of this great film.  Creative, amusing, heartfelt and ultimately satisfying, Ratatouille defies the genre - raising the bar once again on American animated films.  PIXAR continues to create in an entirely different league than it's competitors.  You can't even compare this film to anything else.  It makes the ridiculously popular Shrek look, well, green.      Bonus features are entertaining, particularly the well-concieved short on the history of Rats.  New Blu-ray Bonus materials let you interact with the film in new ways making the \\"Making Of\\" featurette quite imersive.  Most of the info is for student's and hard core fans of animation.  The short LIFTED also appears on this disc as well as the just released PIXAR SHORTS DVD/Blu-ray.     While it lacks the high adventure and fan-boy characters of some of Pixar's earlier works, Rataouille will be regarded with more and more acclaim as time goes by.  Critic's rightfully praised the film in it's theatrical release but American audiences didn't take to it as eagerly as past films.  The overseas market has been strong, bringing in quite a bit more Internationally than other Pixar hits, which is an interesting side note I think.  What it says about American tastes and tolerance for animation that isn't Happy Meal ready is sobering.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Over the past 5 years of so, Nightwish have become one of the biggest gothic, progressive metal bands in the world.  Their mix of heavy guitars with almost operatic female vocals has become the blueprint that many similar bands have followed.  This album would prove to be the last for original vocalist Tarja Turunen.  Shortly after the release of this album and tour, she was uncerimonislly sacked by her bandmates.  It will be interesting to see how the band carries on without the voice who many consider the heart and soul of the band.  This is the only Nightwish album that I own, so I do not have anything to compare it to, but I think this one is very good.  The guys are progressive metal at its most bombastic.  They remind me a lot of Stradivarius only with a female singer.  Lots of operatic elements, big choruses, choirs, big keyboards, you name it they throw it into the mix.  Instrumentally the band is very good, although you won't find a ton of guitar solos here like you do in much music of this ilk.  Nightwish has become Finland's biggest musical export.  They are much bigger in the rest of the world than here in the U.S. but their fan base is growing here.  If you like over the top progressive, Goth, operatic metal, this one is for you.

B000001ES9|5.0|Canadian hard rockers Rush released their self titled debut album initially in Canada in March of 1974 on a very small independent record label entitled Moon Records and would not be released in the US until August of 1974 on Mercury Records after the label signed the band because this album got extensive airplay on rock radio in Cleveland thanks to DJ Donna Halper (Hello Cleveland as they'd say in Spinal Tap).<br />The lineup on this album was bass player and singer Geddy Lee (born Gary Lee Weinrib), guitarist Alex Lifeson (born Alex Zivojinovic) and original drummer John Rutsey whom were schoolmates and buddies in the Ontario, Canada suburb of Willowdale (outside of Toronto) and formed the group Rush in 1970 after initially going by the name The Projection and being a cover band. They would record its first single which was a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\" backed by \\"You Can't Fight It\\" which was a Rush original. The single is long out of print but would foreshadow what the band would record on its debut in late 1973.<br />When Rush's self-titled debut was released, many critics unjustly called this album Led Zeppelin on acid, bad Humble Pie or whatever the lamearse critics proclaimed. This album was a great straight ahead hard rock record (which would evolve and change as the years would go by) as I found out in August of 1990 when I first acquired on cassette (with an altered track listing, I would hear the album in proper tracklisting in April of 1991 when I acquired the Rush Archives album).<br />This album kicks off with the rocking \\"Finding My Way\\", which introduced the world to Geddy, Alex and John in a Zep-inspired mode. The track \\"Need Some Love\\" follows and sounds like hard/punk rock, two years before The Ramones came into existence. Other standouts on this album are the epic ballad \\"Here Again\\" (which closed side 1 of the original album), \\"What You're Doing\\", the future show closer \\"In the Mood\\" and the seven minute epic closer \\"Working Man\\". That track featured stellar guitar work from Alex and great musicianship from the band.<br />The other tracks \\"Take a Friend\\" and \\"Before and After\\" are great numbers as well. The former, a great rocker and the latter showed early signs that Rush could do epic songs.<br />Today, this album has aged well but is somewhat overlooked as it was missing a key member whom will be introduced on the next album's review.<br />Highly recommended!featured stellar guitar work from Alex and great musicianship from the band.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I was never a big fan of Bon Jovi but after hearing Lost Highway, I am convinced that they are highly talented and creative enough to pull off a country inspired cd. The music is country twanged but just rock and roll enough to blend the two genres. I love every song on this cd and would recommend it highly. You will not be disappointed!!
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Pink Floyd's seventh album Meddle was released in October of 1971 here in the US and November of 1971 in the UK.<br />Meddle was once again produced by the four Pink Floyd members and was recorded at Morgan Studios, Air Studios and Abbey Road throughout early to mid 1971 as the former two recording studios were among the first in the UK to be equipped 16-track recording studios to record more parts with ease.<br />Meddle kicks off with the classic instrumental \\"One of These Days\\" (which would remain a live staple until 1973 and was resurrected for both post-Waters Floyd tours) with the double tracked bass guitars from bass player/singer Roger Waters and guitarist/singer David Gilmour (whom also added some great slide and regular guitar work on this track), organ swirls from keyboard player Rick Wright and the notorious vocal phrase from drummer Nick Mason (this is his most famous vocal appearance, he had sung Corporal Clegg on A Saucerful of Secrets but David and Nick are embarrased about Clegg). The next track, the Waters/Gilmour penned \\"A Pillow of Winds sounds like an outtake from Wish You Were Here and a beautiful song. \\"Fearless (Interpolating \\"You'll Never Walk Alone)\\" is next and I first heard this track on the 1983 Floyd collection Works which I got in 1985 on tape and introduced me to the early pre-Dark Side Floyd and a nice song nevertheless. \\"San Tropez\\" follows and sounds like the father of Free Four musically with Roger singing his ode to the famed Mediterranean getaway spot. Then the band composed \\"Seamus\\" was a funny blues that ended the first half of the album which then was reworked as Mademoiselle Nobs on the Live at Pompeii film complete with a dog howling the blues.<br />The second half of the album is the reason to buy this album and it is the 23 and a half minute tour-de-force entitled \\"Echoes\\" which was originally called when performed live as either \\"Nothing (Parts 1-23)\\" or \\"Return of the Son of Nothing\\" or \\"How We Won the Double\\" among other proto-titles. This epic of a song features a classic double harmony lead vocal performance from Wright and Gilmour, excellent solos from Wright and Gilmour on organ and guitar respectively, a trippy middle section and great musicianship from the band and an ending where you sound like you are flying off to space.<br />However, when Meddle was initially released (I didn't get my first copy until November of 1987 on cassette as a gift from my father when my Floyd obsession went into overdrive and also after hearing the album on a classic rock station in my native Boston), the album was a big time commercial failure in the States peaking at #70 because most Americans at the time were not quite ready for Pink Floyd and were too busy focusing on forgettable artists like The Carpenters, Carole King, James Taylor and other Johnny come latelys. Those aforementioned groups and artists (save James Taylor) have gone the way of the 8-track tape since then. Meddle did eventually go Gold (in October, 1973 in the wake of Dark Side of the Moon's success) and Double Platinum (in March of 1994) with two million in US sales to date.<br />I recommend Meddle, especially this repackaged/remastered version released by Capitol in April of 1995, to all Floyd fans.<br />This album was the stepping stone towards The Dark Side of the Moon and is my fourth all time favorite Floyd album after Wish You Were Here, Obscured by Clouds and The Division Bell and just ahead of Animals.<br />Now in 2011, the album is re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign with a brilliantly newly remastered CD done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante. Also the artwork is reminiscent to the original UK album art. I hope that an Immersion version will be out and includes the band's 1971 BBC performance with it.<br />RECOMMENDED!itles.

0374280967|5.0|In Alan Bennett's THE UNCOMMON READER, a novella that's somehow reminiscent of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, The Queen of England makes her way among an army of servants and pompous courtiers as she transforms herself into a smart and elderly Alice who's looking for a quiet corner of the palace where she can sit down and read.<br /><br />It's an inspired concept since it also gives Bennett the chance to satirize writers, palace flunkies, protocol, PR control freaks, mindless bestsellers, the President of France, the British Prime Minister, politicians in general, the Duke of Edinburgh, and countless others while at the same time he shows, via the example of the Queen, the transformative power of reading fiction. And he does this without calling it anything as prescriptive as \\"transformative.\\"<br /><br />Like a child who pretends to be sick so she can stay home from school and remain in bed all day so she can read, the Queen soon begins to abandon her dull routine of \\"good works\\" so that she can squeeze more time into her schedule for clandestine reading. Her taste is wide-ranging---Proust, Philip Roth, Lauren Bacall, Sylvia Plath, Jean Genet---and the more she reads the more genuinely compassionate she becomes as a monarch of the realm in Bennett's inspired and very funny tribute to the written word.
B004ZN9OTG|5.0|Pink Floyd's fifth album Atom Heart Mother was released in October of 1970.<br />Atom Heart Mother was one of the band's more daring to date and was one their best in their so-called transitional period. I remember first getting this on cassette tape from my dad in August of 1987 and was just in awe on how great this album was and still is today (I have the remastered CD now).<br />Pink Floyd's history is really divided in five parts. First was the Syd Barrett era (1966-68), next was the transitional era (1968-70), then it was the classic Floyd era (1971-75), followed by the Waters era (1976-83) and lastly the post-Waters era (1987-2008).<br />Atom Heart Mother was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was produced by Pink Floyd and engineered by Peter Bown and Alan Parsons.<br />The album begins with the 23 and a half minute title cut which took up the whole of the first side of the original album and combined classical with rock with funk with avant-garde and was split into six parts (\\"Father's Shout\\" (with low E chord going into the track), \\"Breast Milky\\" (with the cello playing alongside Roger Waters' bass and Rick Wright's organ before giving away to some great overdubbed guitar work from David Gilmour and stellar drumming by Nick Mason), \\"Mother Fore\\" (which introduces us to the John Aldiss Choir), \\"Funky Dung\\" (my favorite section of the piece which combined David's guitar soloing with the choir doing some off-the-wall chants and worked excellent), \\"Mind Your Throats Please\\" (included some mellotron from Rick and tape effects which predates Dark Side) and the piece concludes with \\"Remergence\\" which was a summary of all of the parts of the album). The piece was written by all four Floyd members and Ron Geesin whom wrote the choral and orchestral parts on the track and worked with Roger on his solo debut Music From the Body.<br />The second half of the album/CD contained three shorter tracks starting with Waters' ballad \\"If\\" which is a great song and he would subsequently play it live on his Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Radio KAOS tours. Next is Wright's \\"Summer 68\\" and is one of his best numbers. We then have the atmospheric Gilmour masterpiece \\"Fat Old Sun\\" which was his first song he penned lyrics for by himself and is a beautiful song. The song would be resurrected for David Gilmour's unplugged concerts in London in 2001 and 2002 which is documented on his David Gilmour in Concert DVD and played it on his 2006 tour which is on the Remember That Night DVD and on his 2008 Live in Gdansk album. The album concludes with the 13 minute instrumental \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" which is a homage to Floyd's then roadie Alan Stiles and a collage of music and sound effects like water dripping, eating food, cooking and mumbling (eggs, bacon, marmalade) all recorded in Nick Mason's kitchen. The song is split in three parts (\\"Rise and Shine\\" (which combined piano, hi-hat, guitar and organ), \\"Sunny Side Up\\" (which is all acoustic guitar and sounds like an early version of \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" which would appear on the band's next disc Meddle) and \\"Morning Glory\\" (which has the intro to Rise and Shine that gives way into a jam and concludes with the water dripping)).<br />Atom Heart Mother was a sign of great things to come for the band and was the band's second disc to crack the American Top 100 peaking at a modest #55 and eventually went Gold in later years.<br />This was another stepping stone to the band's eventual world domination despite the fact that most of the band despise this album.<br />Now in 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd campaign, the Atom Heart Mother album is re-released in a brilliantly remastered CD version done by James Guthrie and Joel Plante. Also, the artwork restores just about everything that came with the original vinyl album.<br />Highly recommended!equently play it live on his Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking and Radio KAOS tours.

B000Y179KO|5.0|Eagles may have had some changes in personnel since their first album lit up the airwaves, but they have remained true to their sound in this welcome and joyous return to form.  The first single, \\"How Long\\" is classic Eagles and should keep the airwaves hoppin' for months.  There's a hint of Steely Dan in \\"Last Good Time In Town\\" and the title track is a ten plus minute opus that hold together shockingly well.  In addition there is some memorable guitar work from the master, Joe Walsh, throughout and harmony singing of the first caliber on nearly every cut.  It's good to have these guys working together again.

Those two tracks were staples of Floyd shows in 1973 on the Dark Side of the Moon tour. \\"Burning Bridges\\" follows and has a great vocal from Gilmour and Wright and is a great tune. \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" is a hard rocker with some great guitar work and vocals from Gilmour. \\"Wots...Uh the Deal\\" follows and is a great song with excellent keyboard work from Wright and great vocals and guitar work from Gilmour. the track was recently resurrected by Gilmour for his On an Island tour in 2006.

B000002J1O|5.0|Genesis' fifth studio effort Selling England by the Pound was released in October of 1973.<br />By 1973, Genesis (which comprised of singer Peter Gabriel, bass player Mike Rutherford, keyboard player Tony Banks, drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett) had developed a cult following and respect with rock fans. However, the band's commercial aspects in the US were not great as Buddah Records (who distributed Charisma in the US) did nothing for the band. Charisma changed distributors Stateside from Buddah to Atlantic (which was home to Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Cream and many others) and this gave the band some confidence to record its next album as they were now at the same home as Zeppelin and The Stones. Would Selling England By the Pound be a classic or would the band fall from grace. Read on and find out.<br />We open the album with Gabriel singing the acapella intro to \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" which told the tale of the demise of \\"good old England\\" and the rise of commercial, modern England. Gabriel's brilliant vocals and lyrics are matched by brilliant guitar work of Steve and Mike and additional musicianship from Tony and Phil as the song becomes a superb climactic rock number after its soft start. Next is the band's first UK Top 20 hit \\"I Know What I Like\\". This piece tells the story of a lawnmower sitting on the porch which was one of the band's first tracks to feature a synthesizer and a great piece. Next is the majestic \\"Firth of Fifth\\". It begins with a piano solo by Banks and launches into a grand epic. The song features a flute solo, a synthesizer solo and one of Hackett's most memorable guitar solos. The first half closed with \\"More Fool Me\\" which was Phil's second lead vocal with Genesis. A nice break-up song written by Mike and Phil.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" which is an epic about a gang fight with references back to medieval England and excellent muscianship by the Genesis members. Great piece. Next is one of Hackett's classic guitar pieces \\"After the Ordeal\\". Next is the epic \\"The Cinema Show\\" which is one of the band's best epics. From the opening 12-string guitar doodle, you are then thrown head first into a beautiful song for six minutes. Then, the song breaks into a superb synthesizer solo section which is hard to describe. We close the album with \\"Aisle of Plenty\\" which is somewhat of a reprise to the album's opening track but a nice piece nevertheless.<br />Selling England By the Pound gave Genesis their first crack in the US Top 100 album charts peaking at #70 in 1974 paving the way for more success in the future and eventually reached Gold status in US sales. It reached #3 in their native UK. Sales aside, Genesis were maturing and becoming a band to be reckoned with.<br />RECOMMENDED!piece.

B000UILH9U|4.0|Book Description  \\"Makeup should be fun, not fascist,\\" celebrity makeup artist KevynAucoin avers in Face Forward, his third book. One of the most adoredstylists among fashionistas, entertainment divas, and high-society jet setters,Southern-born Aucoin arrived on the New York fashion scene in the early '80s, aperiod he ridicules for its '50s-era conservatism and McCarthyistus-against-them values. His career since has been motivated by the feel-goodideals of acceptance, diversity, and self-love, and the vain world of beauty haseagerly participated in his vision. While one may puzzle on how it is he findsfulfillment in an industry known for its superficiality and elitism, Aucoin'swords are nonetheless infectious and the touches of his brushes inspired.Conceived as an exploration of the past, present, and future of beauty, FaceForward is an ingenious showcase of the transformative, creativepossibilities of makeup, with portraits of everyone from Julia Roberts to SharonStone, Martha Stewart to his mother, Thelma. His crafted visages range fromminimal-application makeovers of friends to elaborate re-creations of suchHollywood icons as Audrey Hepburn (Calista Flockhart), James Dean (GwynethPaltrow), and Veronica Lake (shockingly, Martha Stewart) and such pop-culturepersonalities as Cher (socialite Alexandra von Furstenberg) and Siouxsie Sioux(Winona Ryder). The final pages present his ideas for looks to come, such as\\"Explorer,\\" Mary J. Blige covered in eggplant body makeup with a rainbow ofmetallic eye shadows over her eyes and thickly glossed red lips; \\"Floralia,\\" afreckled Lucy Liu resembling a sprite from A Midsummer's Night Dream; and\\"Venusian de Milo,\\" Sharon Stone as an orange-haired, one-breast-baring sci-fifemme fatale. Throughout, Aucoin augments an already colorful book withstep-by-step instruction, chatty commentary on each look and model, and riffs onsuch topics as friendship, politics (he repeatedly applauds the ClintonAdministration for embracing diversity inthe '90s), and the environment.\\"Appreciating (even highlighting) individuality is one of the great things aboutmakeup,\\" asserts Aucoin, and Face Forward is a dazzling testament tothat belief. For those who see the fun of makeup and are eager to experimentwith the virtually unlimited possibilities of it, this book is a boon.--Rebecca Wright
B000001ESF|5.0|In March of 1976, Canadian rockers Rush released their fourth album entitled 2112.<br />2112 was seen as their make or break disc after the commercially disappointing results of its predecessor Caress of Steel.<br />The band were being faced with being dropped from Mercury and went into the same studio where the band's first three albums were recorded (Toronto Sound Studios) in the dead of the harsh 1976 Canadian winter and recorded an album that was harsh and cold in tone but was the album that got Rush a BIG following which continued to grow until they hit stardom in 1981 and I can see why (as I found out in July of 1990).<br />The epic 20 minute plus title suite kicks off the album. It tells the Brave New Worldish story of one man's quest to find change. The \\"Overture\\" is a great way to start the album and \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\" introduce us to the villians in this piece. Next is \\"Discovery\\", which introduces us to our hero and he discovers a guitar and thinks he will be known as a Hero. \\"On Presentation\\", the hero shows his guitar to the evil priests but they destroy the guy's discovery. \\"Oracle: The Dream\\" has our helpless hero dreaming of what life was like before the Priests of Syrinx ruined society. \\"Soliloquy\\" has our hero taking his own life at the conclusion of the track over dejection and despair of the Syrinx lifestyle. \\"The Grand Finale\\" was an awesome workout to end the piece. Bass player/singer Geddy Lee's work on this track is amazing. Guitarist Alex Lifeson wails on this track and drummer Neil Peart is on fire. Also of note, this was the first Rush track to feature synthesizers on the intro.<br />The second half features two more Rush composed tracks which are the rocker \\"A Passage to Bangkok\\" (which would be a live staple for the next few years and resurrected as part of the R30 Overture in 2004 and on the Snakes and Arrows tour back in 2007) and the melodic \\"The Twilight Zone\\" which was a homage to the TV show of the same name. Alex Lifeson's acoustic rocker \\"Lessons\\" follows and is a great tune. Geddy's ballad \\"Tears\\" follows and is a beautiful song and poignant with Hugh Syme on keyboards. The concluding rocker \\"Something for Nothing\\" is a great track and reminds us that we have to work for success and don't get things handed on a silver platter.<br />When initially released, 2112 was the first Rush album to crack the Top 100 but would not go Gold until the success of its successor A Farewell to Kings a year later here in the US as would the live disc released later in 1976 All The World's a Stage.<br />Highly recommended!r \\"Lessons\\" follows and is a great tune.

No one can harmonize the way they can and the writing on the songs is terrific.  Wait until you hear the soulful melodic \\"I dreamed there was no war\\".  Wow!  Treat yourself to this 2 disk album.

B000000OAC|5.0|Queen's sixth album News of the World was released in October of 1977.<br />The album was recorded in the height of the punk rock movement in the UK at Wessex Studios with the band self-producing once again with Mike Stone engineering.<br />Aside from the graphic album cover depicting a giant robot-like creature who killed the four Queen band members (thank drummer Roger Taylor for that concept), there are nothing but great songs throughout.<br />The album opens with the one-two punch of the US #4 charting \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\". The former was written by guitarist Brian May and is known for its stomp-stomp-clap beat and rally cry. The latter was frontman Freddie Mercury's victory cry which has become a victory song when sports teams would win championships. Next, is drummer Roger Taylor's answer to the punk movement \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (which was written for the album with the same title three years earlier but not finished until 1977). The song was as punk as Queen ever got (ironically The Sex Pistols were in the studio next door recording their only album when this track was recorded) and Roger plays drums, bass and rhythm guitar on this track. Brian's \\"All Dead, All Dead\\" is a soft beautiful ballad sung by Brian with Freddie on backing vocals. Bass player John Deacon's \\"Spread Your Wings\\" follows and is a mid-tempo rocker about one not giving up on his dreams. That track was released as a single in Europe and was the first single released where there were no backing vocals from the other Queen members. The first side closed with \\"Fight From The Inside\\" is another heavy rocker sung and written by Roger (whom also played guitar and bass on the track and did all the vocals on this track).<br />Side two began with the lyrically dirty \\"Get Down Make Love\\" and is one of the few blatant sexual anthems that Freddie wrote with raunchy guitar playing by Brian (lets see Britney Spears and/or Christina Aguilera, Beyonce sing (let alone attempt to write) something like that). Brian steps out in front on \\"Sleeping On The Sidewalk\\" which is a bluesy shuffle track with some great guitar work and was recorded without overdubs (save Brian's harmony vocals). John's \\"Who Needs You\\" is another great track with Freddie's elegant vocals and featuring Brian and John on acoustic guitars. Brian's \\"It's Late\\" is almost in the same vein as some of the epics they wrote in the past, but alot heavier and not strange. The ending is great as Roger goes into this insane Bonham/Peart like drumming, if not better. It was released as a heavily edited single in the US and flopped but the song rocks. The lyrically depressing but superb \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is an all-out jazz song featuring Freddie's sorrowful vocals which is a great song for those whom have had either broken hearts or bad days and ends the album in a relaxing fashion.<br />News Of the World peaked at #3 in the US and sold over 4 million in the US alone to date because of the songs and not the personalities in the band and News of the World became Queen's best American selling album until The Game in 1980 tied this.<br />This album is highly recommended!g like that).

B000002GYW|5.0|The Eagles' second album Desperado, released in April of 1973, is the band's best album from their early four-piece lineup.<br />The album was a concept album about the Wild West being used as a metaphor for modern day rock and rollers being seen as outlaws.<br />The album begins with \\"Doolin-Dalton\\", a nice slow ballad which has drummer Don Henley and guitarist/keyboard player Glenn Frey singing their hearts out. Next is guitarist Bernie Leadon's \\"Twenty One\\" which is the band's most country-tinged song ever. Next is \\"Out of Control\\" which had the heaviest guitars I've ever heard from the Eagles and is a stellar rocker. \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" is a great ballad to relax to after the heavy rock of the previous track and was the album's biggest hit. The title cut follows and is a superb ballad which is now the band's closing song.<br />Bass player Randy Meisner starts the second half with the rocker \\"Certain Kind of Fool\\" and is a great song. The \\"Doolin Dalton Instrumental\\" follows and segues into the rocker \\"Outlaw Man\\" which is a great song despite the fact none of the band wrote the track. \\"Saturday Night\\" is next and the harmonies are haunting but superb. \\"Bitter Creek\\" follows and is the second best song Leadon contributed to the band, behind My Man (from the follow-up On the Border). The album closes with the reprise to \\"Doolin Dalton\\" and \\"Desperado\\" and is a perfect way to close this fantastic album.<br />I first got this album on cassette as a 9 year old from my father and today it is still a classic, especially with its remastering (on the remastered CD) courtesy of Ted Jensen.<br />Highly recommended!
B000O76TA4|4.0|I won't review the movie as others have done a fine job at that already - just feel compelled to add that if you already have the brown-wrapper 2-disc issued in 2000 then this steelcase edition offers no new content.  Also, contrary to amazon's listing, this is NOT a DTS sound edition - it offers 5.1 dolby and below only.  This is an excellent film - if you don't have the 2000 2DSE then by all means pick this up - the extras are marvelous.  But don't make my mistake and buy it thinking it's new - it's just a repackaging of that 2000 edition.
B000002GXX|5.0|The Eagles' fourth album One Of These Nights was released in June of 1975.<br />Like its predecessor, was produced by Bill Szymczyk and has the same band lineup as the previous album (which was singer/drummer Don Henley, singer/rhythm guitarist Glenn Frey, singer/bass player Randy Meisner, singer/guitarist Bernie Leadon and lead guitarist Don Felder (this was his first FULL album with the band) and was recorded this time mostly at Criteria Studios in Miami, FL. Would the album be a continuation of first three efforts or go elsewhere, read ahead and find out (as I first did in February of 1985 when I got the cassette).<br />The opening title track, which was a #1 hit for the band, is a rock song with a funk/soul feel which was described as disco-like but it's not a disco number and featured a dynamic vocal from Don Henley whom sang normal in the first two verses and at the end goes into Barry Gibb mode with the falsetto at the end of the track. Next is bass player Randy Meisner's &#34;Too Many Hands&#34;, written by himself along with guitarist Don Felder (a bit of an odd couple) and is a superb mid-tempo rocker with killer guitar solos from Felder and ending dual solos from Henley and Frey with a great Meisner vocal. The countryish &#34;Hollywood Waltz&#34; (which was the only song written by Frey, Henley and guitarist Bernie Leadon) was, bless them, a real waltz. Don's vocal was great and has more superb falsetto work from Henley at the end of the track and the song was the first Eagles track to have a synthesizer at the end, you can hear clearly on headphones and on the 1999 remaster. The first side of the album ends with Bernie's first of two contributions, the wild but stately 7-minute instrumental &#34;Journey Of The Sorcerer&#34; which was a superb piece of music and would be used in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series on the BBC.<br />Side Two of the album starts with the album's second single &#34;Lyin' Eyes&#34;, which was one of Glenn's best lead vocals songs and one of few 6 minute tracks to top the charts and is a great country-rocker. Next was &#34;Take It To The Limit&#34;, a grand and melodious stop-and-go ballad, sung by Meisner whom gave his best vocal performance (especially the high notes at the end) on this track and was also a Top 3 hit.

Next, was &#34;After the Thrill is Gone&#34; which was sung by Frey and Henley and was a superb ballad about breaking up (and another Felder lead solo, fourth song to feature Felder's soloing).

B000V1Y43W|5.0|When Cars first came out on DVD, I was a little disappointed because there weren't very many extras on it.  I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B000068FXR|5.0|English art rockers Supertramp's fourth album entitled Crisis? What Crisis? was released in November of 1975.<br />Like its predecessor, 1974's Crime of the Century, the album was once again co-produced by the band and Ken Scott.<br />Crisis? What Crisis? was the second album by the band's classic lineup which were the two singer-songwriters Rick Davies( keyboards) and Roger Hodgson (guitars and occasional keyboards), saxophonist/woodwind expert John Helliwell, bass player Dougie Thomson and drummer Bob C. Benberg. This new lineup did a superb job fleshing out the sound and managed to do a great job of embelishing the prog pop sound that Davies and Hodgson had developed.<br />Hodgson's interest in spiritual themes comes to the fore with this album (although it was hinted at previously). Roger's guitar driven one-two punch of \\"Easy Does It\\" and \\"Sister Moonshine\\" kick the album off in full throttle. The latter track is called by some as the lost sequel to The Beatles' Here Comes The Sun (Hodgson is a huge Beatles nut). Hodgson also contributed the lovely \\"A Soapbox Opera\\", \\"Lady\\", \\"Meaning\\" and the acoustic-tinged closer \\"Two of Us\\".<br />Davies crafted four songs on this album starting with the shuffling \\"Ain't Nobody But Me\\" (a minor hit when released). That track was the first in a long string of Davies sung songs that played with the traditional pop love song in new and surprising ways. The playing on this particular track showcased the strengths of the band's new sound. Despite its quirkiness (and had an instrumental arrangement that matches the quirky, anti-love song sentiments) but doesn't try to coast on just that single merit. Rick's other tracks like the rocking \\"Another Man's Woman\\", the ballads \\"Poor Boy\\" and \\"Just a Normal Day\\" (which had Roger sharing vocals) are also great tunes.<br />Although Crisis tanked upon its release, peaking at a dismal #51 compared to Crime's Top 40 peak, Crisis sounds stunning today.<br />The remastering, done painstakingly by Greg Calbi and Jay Messina made the album sound much better than it did when first released.<br />Highly recommended!ay Messina made the album sound much better than it did when first released.   Highly recommended!
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is a great film that should satisfy the appetite of any viewer.  The picture and sound are both flawless!!!  The colors and textures are so life-like in some of the exterior shots, it looks like you are looking at a photograph.  The special features are also very informative and interesting to watch.  The cooking game is surprisingly entertaining, and I found myself  playing it a few times. So far I have found one Easter Egg on this disc.  While looking at the main menu, watch the stove in the upper left corner.  When you see a rat peek out from behind, click arrow to the left and a new menu pops up with 5 funny little clips.  I found this quite by accident, and it took me awhile to figure out to wait for the rat to appear.  Pixar has another hit on their hands with this one.  I am excited about what the future holds for their release of other titles on Blu-ray.
B000002GYN|5.0|It was in June of 1972 that classic rock legends The Eagles released their self-titled debut album, which was a great blend of pop, rock and country.<br />Drummer Don Henley, bass player Randy Meisner, guitarist Bernie Leadon and guitarist/keyboard player Glenn Frey would finally have the chance to prove to the world that they were musical geniuses whom not only could play well but sing so well with harmonies that were flawless after first playing together in legendary country/rock/pop singer Linda Ronstadt's backing band and after they finished the tour with Linda she blessed the guys to break out on their own and the band didn't forget her and she subsequently signed to Asylum thanks to The Eagles' success.<br />The band has since this debut became the best-selling American band of all time, and is also one of the Top 4 ahead of Pink Floyd and behind only Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.<br />This debut album was produced and engineered by Glyn Johns, the same man responsible for engineering albums by The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, The Faces and The Beatles among others.<br />The heavily country-influenced \\"Take It Easy\\" opens this stellar album and was a great intro to The Eagles. The rock classic \\"Witchy Woman\\" follows and was the world's intro to Henley's voice which would become more dominant in later albums (he would also sing the rocking Nightingale). The rocking \\"Chug All Night\\" follows and has superb vocals from Glenn. Randy steps out in front for the ballad \\"Most of Us Are Sad\\" which is a great song. The aforementioned \\"Nightingale\\" follows and is a great rocker.<br />The second half kicks off with guitarist Bernie's country tinged \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\" and is a great song. The countryish-rocker \\"Take The Devil\\" is chilling with a great Meisner vocal. The country-ish \\"Earlybird\\" follows and has Bernie on vocals and just is a great number. The slower but still excellent tune \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" follows and was the album's other hit single. The album closes with the rocker \\"Tryin'\\" which was one of Randy's best vocal performances.<br />This album has held up well and this was the last Eagles album I bought in 1991 when I was 15 on cassette and regretted not acquiring it earlier as I thought the album would stink aside from the three singles which are on the various best ofs (Take it Easy, Witchy Woman and Peaceful Easy Feeling).<br />This album is a classic and is highly recommended!um closes with the rocker \\"Tryin'\\" which was one of Randy's best vocal performances.

They are simple enough for the beginner, rich and tasty for the sweet-toothed, and presented beautifully for the most advanced chef!

B000001ESJ|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush released their sixth album A Farewell to Kings in September of 1977.<br />A Farewell to Kings was the band's first to be recorded in England at Rockfield Studios in Wales (and would not be their last).<br />I first heard this album in the summer of 1987 as an 11 year old on the radio and loved it at first listen and sent me to the record store looking for this album. I have the remastered CD today.<br />This album had matured musicianship and Rush experimenting with synthesizers (with bass player/singer Geddy Lee using them more and more) even more than on 1976's classic 2112 (which went Gold on the same day as Farewell to Kings and All the World's a Stage by the way).<br />The album begins with the title cut which sounds like it is gonna be a folk song thanks to guitarist Alex Lifeson's classical guitar work but then BANG into a full hard rock with electric guitars, drummer Neil Peart's lyrics about politicians being hypocrites and bigots and Geddy's voice wailing away. Next is the first of two epics, the 11-minute \\"Xanadu\\" (not the Olivia Newton John track but a grand epic) which is arguably one of Neil's best drum performances and Geddy starting the song at a lower octave in his singing then going to the high registers and Alex's guitar work just being excellent.<br />The second half kicks off with \\"Closer to the Heart\\", which was the first Rush track to get massive radio airplay, and some complained said the band sold out with this track but is a classic. \\"Cinderella Man\\" and \\"Madrigal\\" follow, both songs are great with Geddy writing lyrics for a change on the former and the latter a love song in disguise but beautiful. The album concludes with \\"Cygnus X-1 (Book One: The Voyage)\\", which starts off as if you were going into a spaceship and each instrument coming to life and rocking out for five minutes before the first vocal part appears and Geddy's just wailing on here and Alex's guitar just was amazing. Just when you thought it would get soft, they come in full throttle for the finale with Geddy's screaming like he is being pulled through a black hole and Alex's closing, ringing guitar chords being a reminder that this story would continue on 1978's follow-up Hemispheres.<br />A Farewell to Kings was their first album to hit the US Top 30 hitting #24 and going Gold in 1977. Because of this, its predecessors 2112 and All the World's a Stage would go Gold as well. A Farewell to Kings would subsequently hit Platinum in US sales.<br />This remaster buries the original CD released in the 80s. Bob Ludwig did a great job with the remastering and Mercury I commend for repackaging it just like the original album.<br />A great disc and highly recommended!me in full throttle for the finale with Geddy's screaming like he is being pulled through a black hole and Alex's closing, ringing guitar chords being a reminder that this story would continue on 1978's follow-up Hemispheres.

B000000OAH|5.0|Queen's seventh album entitled Jazz was released in November of 1978.<br />The album has always had the distinction to many of Queen's fans of being Queen's worst 1970s album but I think it is great (as I found out when I first got the CD in April of 1992).<br />The album saw the band co-producing with Roy Thomas Baker for the first time since 1975's A Night at the Opera and was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland and Superbear Studios in France.<br />We begin with lead singer Freddie Mercury's \\"Mustapha\\" which is a Middle Eastern sounding track and a unique opener. Freddie singing in Arabic is a grand way to kick off a diverse Queen record. Next was the album's US Top 30 hit \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and penned by guitarist Brian May and is a great rocker dedicated to Brian, Roger and John's wives (or in Roger's case girlfriend) and was a concert staple on the 1978/1980/1982 US tours. Freddie's ballad \\"Jealousy\\" follows and is a beautiful song which did come out as a single in the States but flopped. Next is the album's biggest US Top 30 hit \\"Bicycle Race\\" (which was the A-side to Fat Bottomed Girls) and this Freddie penned number was written whilst watching the Tour de France from his hotel suite. This song showed Queen did not ever take themselves too seriously. Next is bass player John Deacon's rocker \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\" which was John's first true rock number he wrote for the band. The first half ends with Freddie's homage to the excessive rock lifestyle called \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" which is a great rocker and was a staple live on the band's 1978/79 and 1980/81 tours.<br />We begin the second half with a May rocker called \\"Dead on Time\\" which is one of his best rockers. Next is a Deacon ballad \\"In Only Seven Days\\" about meeting someone and falling in love while on vacation. The track would not have sounded out of place on either Billy Joel's The Stranger or 52nd Street albums as it has the feel of a Billy Joel tune musically. Next is Brian's jazzy \\"Dreamers Ball\\" which is a song which may sound lazy on studio version but when played live on the Jazz tour was better. Next is drummer Roger Taylor's \\"Fun It\\" with Freddie and Roger trading lead vocals. The rock-disco track sounds like a pre-cursor to Another One Bites the Dust on the next album. Next is Brian's \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" and has Brian May on all vocals and is a nice, acoustic number. The big UK hit and song that stalled at #86 in the US \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" is next and one of Freddie's classic pop rock songs and a great song. We end the album with Roger's rocker \\"More of That Jazz\\" which had Roger on EVERYTHING (including all vocals, drums, guitars and bass) and is a great song. Before the song ends, the abrupt appearance of collage 'soundbites' of most of the tracks over the course of the album, probably spliced in to give the false sense of sounding like a commercial for Queen's Jazz album which Elektra Records probably did for radio promotion in 1978.<br />Jazz when released hit #6 in the US and went Platinum immediately but sales were sof compared to the earlier albums but still a great record nevertheless.<br />In 1991, Hollywood Records re-issued Jazz with two remixes, Fat Bottomed Girls (a rock re-mix) and a rappish Bicycle Race.<br />Recommended!ers Ball\\" which is a song which may sound lazy on studio version but when played live on the Jazz tour was better.

B000002NZO|5.0|English prog rockers Genesis released its second album Trespass in Ocober of 1970.<br />After the band's debut album From Genesis To Revelation in 1969, their then manager and producer Jonathan King (who admittedly tarnished the debut somewhat with some cheesy horn and string arrangements) parted ways with the band and then Tony Stratton-Smith took over as the band's manager after he started Charisma Records in the UK.<br />Then soon afterwards, lead singer Peter Gabriel, bass player Mike Rutherford, keyboard player Tony Banks and guitarist Anthony Phillips got first a new drummer out of John Mayhew (replacing Chris Silver) and a new producer John Anthony and recorded their sophomore effort at Trident Studios in London. As a result, the band switched gears with their second album and morphed from the pop outfit from their debut to the prog rock outfit that would define them over time.<br />\\"Looking For Someone\\" is the incredible opener, starting with Peter Gabriel's unique voice breaking through the silence alongside Banks' organ and the rest of the band coming in to create this masterwork. Next is the atmospheric \\"White Mountain\\" is so named that it features mellotron (first time that it appeared on a Genesis track) giving one the feeling of being in the snow-covered mountains somewhere plus the 12-string guitars of Phillips, Banks and Rutherford kick in and Gabriel's vocals give it a powerful feel. The first side concluded with \\"Visions Of Angels\\" which had a balladish sounding track but a great piece nevertheless.<br />The album's second half kicks off with \\"Stagnation\\" which is a Genesis classic which is still a great song and the band still holds this track in high regard still as the finale is still played live during \\"I Know What I Like\\" in live performances done to this day. Next is the quiet but powerful \\"Dusk\\" which includes a powerful flute solo from Gabriel in the bridge. We close the album with the ferocious \\"The Knife\\" which is one of the band's best epics. The band would continue to play this track live for the next few years and occaionally into 1980. The track goes through tempo and mood changes which would make things like King crimson look non-existant in comparison.<br />Despite the fact that Trespass didn't set the record charts on fire upon its 1970 release in either the US or UK, the album was Genesis' first masterpiece and a huge sign of things to come from this incredible band.<br />RECOMMENDED!d would continue to play this track live for the next few years and occaionally into 1980.

B000002GB2|5.0|Chicago bred art rockers Styx released their fifth studio album entitled Equinox in November of 1975.<br />The Equinox album (with its classic cover featuring a fire flame melting a block of ice) was the band's first album for A&M Records (they were on an independent label Wooden Nickel for years).<br />They were signed to A&M Records based largely on the strength of the success of the single \\"Lady\\" (from Styx's second album Styx II released in 1973), which became a hit a full two years after its 1973 release in 1975. Then Styx signed with veteran manager Derek Sutton before Equinox was recorded at Paragon Studios with Barry Mraz and Rob Kingsland doing the engineering.<br />Singer/keyboard player/songwriter Dennis DeYoung kicks the album off with the classic uptempo \\"Light Up\\" and he also wrote and sang the first half closing power ballad \\"Lonely Child\\", and the concluding epic \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" which is the arguably best song of the pre-Tommy Shaw era (and was a concert staple throughout the DeYoung years) and these tracks had some of DDY's best synth work with him using the ARP Solina String Synthesizers, ARP Pro-soloist and Mini-Moog synthesizers to their fullest potential.<br />DeYoung also co-wrote three songs to which he also does lead vocals which are the rocker \\"Lorelei\\" (which was a US Top 30 hit) and the ode to Robin Hood movie rocker \\"Born for Adventure\\" which were co-written by guitarist James \\"JY\\" Young and also \\"Mother Dear\\" co-written by late guitarist John Curulewski and both Dennis and John sang lead vocals.<br />JY also wrote and sang the hard rocking \\"Midnight Ride\\" which kicked off the second half of the album.<br />John Curulewski (who left the band after completing Equinox and the photo shoot for the Equinox album's inner sleeve) also wrote the 12-string acoustic guitar instrumental \\"Prelude 12\\" which was a prelude to Suite Madame Blue. As always, the Panozzo Brothers rhythm section (Chuck on bass and John on the drums) kept the machine rolling on the album.<br />All in all, Equinox was a great start to Styx's tenure at A&M and was an eventual Gold seller although it was a slow seller at first (outside Canada and the mid-West part of the United States). This album is slightly better than its followup and in my view was the first true Styx album with the sound fans would come to know and love.<br />Highly recommended!n all, Equinox was a great start to Styx's tenure at A&M and was an eventual Gold seller although it was a slow seller at first (outside Canada and the mid-West part of the United States).

B000002GB4|5.0|In October of 1976, Chicago based rockers Styx released their sixth studio album, and second overall for A&M Records, entitled Crystal Ball.<br />The album was their first with new guitarist and singer/songwriter Tommy Shaw (a Birmingham, Alabama native), whom joined in late 1975 replacing John Curulewski in time for the band's tours opening up for bands like Roxy Music, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Blue Oyster Cult and Rush.<br />Like its predecessor, 1975's Equinox, the band produced the album themselves with Barry Mraz and Rob Kingsland engineering and is still a classic.<br />The album starts with the hard rocking \\"Put Me On\\", which was written by Shaw, singer/keyboard player Dennis DeYoung and guitarist/singer James JY Young whom also does lead vocal on the track. The track has Shaw/DeYoung/JY singing the first verse and then JY does the second verse in the hard rock section and the slower section was sung by Dennis and the drum sound went from the 1972-75 sound to the drum sound that would be synonymous with the band in all of their later albums. Then, the track goes back to the hard rock section and ends with the ending riff speeding up on the tape (which sounds like the tape machine died) which then segues into Tommy's first lead vocal for the band, the US Top 40 hit \\"Mademoiselle\\" which was a great Shaw/DeYoung collaboration (first of many). Dennis' mid-tempo ballad \\"Jennifer\\" is a great song with excellent guitar leads by JY and Wurlitzer piano and Solina String Ensemble playing by DDY. The first half of the album ends with Tommy's classic title cut which is one of the best Styx songs ever and featured excellent rhythm section work by the bass playing and drumming twin brothers Chuck and John Panozzo respectively and one of DDY's best synthesizer solos and Tommy's phenomenal guitar solo at the end.<br />The Foghat sounding bluesy hard rocker \\"Shooz\\" starts the second half and Tommy sings and screams his heart out on this track and he cooks some excellent tasty slide guitar work whilst JY does a Jimi Hendrix like guitar solo in the middle of the track after one of Tommy's tasty slide solos. Next was Dennis' classic \\"This Old Man\\" which was a homage to his hard-working father. The album concludes with Dennis' piano arrangement of the classic DeBussy piece \\"Clair De Lune\\" which is changed from C# to C natural as a lead into the epic DeYoung/Shaw collaboration \\"Ballerina\\" (with a classic DeYoung vocal) which ends the album in a majestic way.<br />When it was released, it actually sold less than Equinox but eventually went Gold in 1978 after the success of the next album (see review).<br />If you like all of Styx's albums between 1975 and 1999, I recommend this album.ork whilst JY does a Jimi Hendrix like guitar solo in the middle of the track after one of Tommy's tasty slide solos.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Remy is an ordinary rat with extraordinarily acute senses. This leads him to a love of the finer flavors food has to offer, much to the puzzlement of his garbage eating brethren. His father has made him the clan's rat-poison detector, but Remy secretly yearns to become a great chef, and he risks life and limb to learn how by getting dangerously close to the human world. One night, however, things go horribly wrong and the whole group is forced to scatter from the cottage they have been furtively inhabiting. Remy soon finds himself separated from the others, being swept away through the sewer system and coming up under a fine restaurant in the heart of Paris. It's a dream come true for Remy, but when he can't control his urge to tamper with the dishes, he soon finds himself in a deceptive partnership with the hapless new garbage-boy, Alfredo Linguini. With Remy literally under his hat, Linguini quickly becomes the hot new chef in the city of light! But his boss, head chef Skinner, smells a rat, and the famed food critic Anton Ego poses no less a danger; not to mention the health inspector!<br /><br />To the Disney animation fan, \\"Ratatouille\\" may evoke memories of a cartoon short called \\"Ben and Me,\\" or even the classic story of Cyrano de Bergerac. But, don't sell this film short based on that. It's full of originality, heart, fun, excitement, and charm! Heavy on the Euro-atmosphere, and appropriately so, \\"Ratatouille\\" dives deep into the world of the culinary arts, making it a perfect film for an age when Emeril Lagasse and Rachael Ray are household names and shows like \\"Iron Chef\\" are hot stuff! Patton Oswalt is the star of the show as the perfect voice for the endearing Remy the rat, whose desire to be a great chef fuels his hope for a world where humans and rats can live together with mutual respect. The entire film is a feast for the senses in itself, as one always expects from PIXAR, and I definitely would call it several steps up from their last offering, \\"Cars,\\" which I found to be enjoyable, but not quite up to expectations (storywise). \\"Ratatouille,\\" on the other hand, is fairly unpredictable, smart, and thoroughly enjoyable, and, in my opinion, among PIXAR's best stuff. Director Brad Bird's animation track record remains excellent!<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is the deeper level to the film's story that may click with animation fans if they dare to take a closer look. \\"Ratatouille\\" could almost be called PIXAR's autobiography, telling the story of how a little studio that was bringing something new to the table had to stand on the shoulders of a giant and struggle to earn respect and a following amidst doubting peers, patrons, and critics. Deceased master chef Gusteau is clearly a take on the great Walt Disney himself, with his restaurant representing the Disney Studios trying to keep the magic going without him (and sticking to his proven recipes). Of course, looking at the film in that light puts an entirely different spin on it and opens the gates to all sorts of fascinating ideas as to just what PIXAR is saying about whom.<br /><br />This thankfully widescreen DVD edition, unfortunately, is less than worthy of the masterpiece it holds. Probably in an effort to encourage upgrading to Blu-Ray, but perhaps for other reasons, PIXAR has really gone downhill in the extras department. There are some sweet ones, but so few in comparison to previous releases, particularly those two-discers that came out prior to the \\"Cars\\" DVD. All this edition offers are 3 deleted scenes (though nicely put together), 2 Easter Eggs, a featurette where director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about their passions for their work, and the highlights, two original animated shorts. The first short is \\"Lifted,\\" the theatrical short that was shown with \\"Ratatouille.\\" This is a cute, physical comedy short about an alien abductor in training who is having trouble beaming up his sleeping victim. The second one I found HIGHLY enjoyable.

Deceased master chef Gusteau is clearly a take on the great Walt Disney himself, with his restaurant representing the Disney Studios trying to keep the magic going without him (and sticking to his proven recipes). Of course, looking at the film in that light puts an entirely different spin on it and opens the gates to all sorts of fascinating ideas as to just what PIXAR is saying about whom.      This thankfully widescreen DVD edition, unfortunately, is less than worthy of the masterpiece it holds. Probably in an effort to encourage upgrading to Blu-Ray, but perhaps for other reasons, PIXAR has really gone downhill in the extras department. There are some sweet ones, but so few in comparison to previous releases, particularly those two-discers that came out prior to the \\"Cars\\" DVD. All this edition offers are 3 deleted scenes (though nicely put together), 2 Easter Eggs, a featurette where director Brad Bird and chef Thomas Keller talk about their passions for their work, and the highlights, two original animated shorts. The first short is \\"Lifted,\\" the theatrical short that was shown with \\"Ratatouille.\\" This is a cute, physical comedy short about an alien abductor in training who is having trouble beaming up his sleeping victim. The second one I found HIGHLY enjoyable. It's called, \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" and is a hilarious lesson in rat-history hosted by Remy and his brother, Emile. What makes this particularly enjoyable is how its random art styles hark back to the days of Ludwig Von Drake and shorts like, \\"It's Tough to be a Bird.\\" A wonderful treat for the fan of classic Disney animation, and a fine compliment to another outstanding PIXAR feature achievement.
B000002J1M|5.0|Genesis' fourth album Foxtrot was released in October of 1972.<br />The album came out in a year that arguably prog was at its peak. That was the year that The Moody Blues hit #1 with Seventh Sojourn. ELP gave us the double whammy of Pictures at an Exhibition and Trilogy. Also, Yes gave us two classic out of Fragile and Close to the Edge. Jethro Tull gave us the album length suite Thick As a Brick (which hit #1). Also, Pink Floyd gave us Obscured by Clouds and were recording their masterpiece The Dark Side of the Moon.<br />It was also in 1972 that Genesis gave us Foxtrot (complete with the cover depicting a woman wearing a fox's head and a red dress). This was the album that saw lead singer Peter Gabriel, keyboard player Tony Banks, bass player Mike Rutherford, drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett refine the sound that they had hinted at on its predecessor, 1971's Nursery Cryme. Foxtrot was also the album that gave the band its first charting success in the UK and helped bring them a following as you will find out why in this review.<br />We open the album with the epic \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" which starts the album off. The piece begins with Banks' swirling mellotron intro and then morphs into a classic Genesis track with superb playing by the Genesis members and Gabriel's vocals just burn here. This piece remains a fan favorite to this day. Next is the nice balladish sounding \\"Time Table\\". Some write this beautiful song off as \\"filler\\" but is still a great piece. Next is another highlight of the album which is the album's second epic called \\"Get 'Em Out By Friday\\". The piece is a bizarre story with superb lyrics from Gabriel and superb music by the band. We conclude the album's first half closed with \\"Can-Utility and the Coastliners\\" which was a great song.<br />Now, the second half of the album starts with \\"Horizons\\" which shows why Hackett was arguably Genesis' best guitarist. This classical guitar solo is so superb. Then the album's last piece is the 23 minute \\"Supper's Ready\\". This suite is up there with \\"Tarkus\\", \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Echoes\\", \\"2112\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick\\" in greatest long epics. The first part \\"Lover's Leap\\" is exceptionally strong with Gabriel's multi-tracked vocals, bizarre lyrics and superb 12-string work from Messieurs Banks, Rutherford and Hackett. Then the suite has a piano solo from Banks which segues into \\"The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\" section. Quiet vocals lead into a major key section which has everyone playing (Hackett's lead playing and superb drumming from Collins). The \\"Ikhnaton and Itsacon and their Band of Merry Men\\" follows and includes arguably Hackett's guitar solo on a Genesis record. Then this segues into the atmospheric \\"How Dare I Be So Beautiful\\" which is dreamy and exquisite. Then we go into the section's classic funny part known as \\"Willow Farm\\" which is just wild. All I can see is Peter wearing his flower mask whilst performing it (he got the idea of the flower mask from watching an old British kids show when he was a child). Then after a wild music section we go into the superb \\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\" section which has powerful lyrics plus an instrumental part that is amazing. Phil's drumming here is TOP NOTCH and Banks proves why he is the master of the organ. We then segue with bells tolling into the final section called \\"As Sure as Eggs is Eggs\\". It starts with a reprise of the music of \\"Lovers Leap\\" then morphs into a slowed down reprise of \\"The Guaranteed Eternal\\" section. Gabriel sings this part like it was the last piece he would ever sing. It is that great.<br />Foxtrot would almost reach the UK Top 10 and just missed the American charts but sales notwithstanding, this album is a testament to the classic \\"prog rock\\" era of Genesis.<br />RECOMMENDED!\\"Supper's Ready\\".

0446577391|4.0|Peopled with ex-CIA hit men, random assassins and corrupt highly placed government officials, Stone Cold is a tale of mayhem and murder that reaches across time to Cold War American deeds performed in service to country. From the outside, everything runs smoothly, Homeland Security at work in Washington, DC, protecting the seat of power and those who do the people's business. Random corruption is to be expected in an era of corporate domination and fear of the unknown, the wheels of power greased with special interests and a few men's hubris. The Camel Club- a tightly knit group of men who know well the ways of surveillance- meets regularly under the leadership of Oliver Stone, all monitoring the powerful as they conduct the secret work of government.<br /><br />A former member of the Triple Sixes, a covert killing team for the CIA who carried out missions too delicate to become common knowledge, Stone is conversant with the ways of Washington politics and the behind-the-scenes machinations of Carter Gray, the former Chief of Intelligence who still wields considerable power and enjoys the perks of privilege. Stone is close friends with Annabelle Conroy, a young woman with considerable skills, an accomplished con artist and honorable member of the Camel Club. Currently pursued by a very angry casino owner, Jerry Bagger, who she has just swindled out of a fortune, Annabelle requests Stone's assistance. Oliver is happy to oblige.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things quickly get very complicated by a series of assassinations that point to missions from Stone's past that endanger Annabelle and the rest of the Camel Club. Baldacci adds one more twist to amp up the action- a virtual killing machine, Harry Finn, who makes his living testing security for the DHS and has a private vendetta of his own. Suddenly, Annabelle is without the backup she counted on, meeting her own past face-to-face, Oliver more hindrance than help. The best interests of his friends at heart, Stone goes directly to the source, a powerful man who once signed his orders before a demoralized Oliver opted out of the system.<br /><br />Layer upon layer, secret upon secret, Baldacci's characters come together in a dramatic confrontation that leaves few standing. Wrapped in obfuscation and clever lies, history resurfaces, acts that must be kept from the public no matter how many people die in the cover-up. Conscienceless villains, assassination teams, killers, crooks and patriotic ex-soldiers are tossed about in a violent stew, Jerry Bagger convinced he has finally captured his prize and Carter Gray squeezing the trigger, annihilating reputations, his victims turning from hero to traitor with a few well-chosen words. Somehow, Baldacci makes it all work, a few asides along the way- pointed sarcasm directed toward Beltway politics and the nature of politicians. In a town of facades and the parading of images, the few tackle the corrupt power broker and would-be-president, determined to return the government to the people.

B000002J1S|5.0|English art rockers Genesis released their seventh (and lone double studio) album entitled The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway in November of 1974.<br />The album was created at a time where tensions in the band were astronomically high. Lead singer Peter Gabriel was going through some personal and professional problems while this album was being created (his daughter was born prematurely and uncertainty if his daughter would live (luckily she survived), his failed attempt at a filmscript and his bandmates were angered that Peter was more concerned about his family than the band (in later years, all the members would become parents)).<br />Despite the on-going tensions in the group, Gabriel created one final masterpiece with Genesis before he left the band in May of 1975 after the tour in support of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway where the band did the WHOLE DOUBLE ALBUM live start to finish (only The Who and Pink Floyd were other bands of the era that played whole albums start to finish in their set, let's see Britney Spears or any pop fool try it).<br />The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was a concept album about a Puerto Rican kid named Rael whom falls into a netherworld known as New York and struggles to find himself throughout the course of the album. Some of the many standouts on this album are the title cut, \\"In the Cage\\" (arguably the best song on the album and was resurrected for the 2007 tour), \\"Back in NYC\\", \\"Counting Out Time\\" (released as a single but flopped), \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" (a concert staple for many years and resurrected for the 2007 reunion tour), \\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\\", \\"The Lamia\\", \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" and the closing track \\"It\\".<br />The album's other tracks \\"Fly On a Windshield\\", \\"Broadway Melody of 1974\\", \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", \\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\", \\"Hairless Heart\\", \\"Lilywhite Lilith\\", \\"The Waiting Room\\", \\"Anyway\\", \\"Here Come the Supernatural Anaesthetist\\", \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\\", \\"Ravine\\", \\"The Light Dies Down On Broadway\\", \\"Riding The Scree\\" and \\"In The Rapids\\" are no filler as well and are great songs though some may think these tracks stink.<br />I first discovered this album in early September of 1997, when I picked up a used cassette copy (would buy the remastered CD two months later), and I was shocked on how excellent it really is and is today one of my Top 20 favorite rock albums of all time.<br />Unfortunately Peter Gabriel left after the tour in support of this album and eventually guitarist Steve Hackett would quit as well in late 1977.<br />The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway peaked at #41 in early 1975 and would eventually go Gold in the US over time proving that people were willing to give pre-1980s Genesis a chance after discovering the band in the 1980s.<br />If you want the best of the Gabriel era Genesis, buy this album!Riding The Scree\\" and \\"In The Rapids\\" are no filler as well and are great songs though some may think these tracks stink.   I first discovered this album in early September of 1997, when I picked up a used cassette copy (would buy the remastered CD two months later), and I was shocked on how excellent it really is and is today one of my Top 20 favorite rock albums of all time.   Unfortunately Peter Gabriel left after the tour in support of this album and eventually guitarist Steve Hackett would quit as well in late 1977.   The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway peaked at #41 in early 1975 and would eventually go Gold in the US over time proving that people were willing to give pre-1980s Genesis a chance after discovering the band in the 1980s.

B000X3KZVI|5.0|The most anticipated DVD is almost here. I did not think the record company would release the concert in digital video disc. However, I am glad that they made a wise choice. I saw the preview on Mariahdaily dot com, and I felt in love with it ever since. A++
B000001ESP|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's ninth (and eighth studio overall) album entitled Moving Pictures was released in February of 1981 to fans whom were heavily anticipating a strong follow-up to the previous year's Permanent Waves, which was Rush's first Top 5 album here in the US thanks to songs like Freewill and The Spirit of Radio.<br />When fans first went to the stores to buy Moving Pictures (as my oldest sister did in 1981 and I would eventually on cassette in 1984 (then upgraded in 1988 and then CD in 1991 and then the 1997 remaster), the artwork must have caught some eyes. The title of the disc Moving Pictures had monumental multiple meanings. First, there is workers actually \\"moving pictures\\". Then, there are people crying because the pictures are so moving. Finally, there was a film crew making a moving picture of the whole scene on the back cover. Plus, actual moving pictures of the band at their respective instruments (on the original CD, drummer Neil Peart's photo was missing, luckily on this remaster, his photo was restored).<br />Also, Bob Ludwig (whom originally mastered the album), did a superb job on the remastering of this remastered version.<br />All of the songs on Moving Pictures were written by all three Rush members except * (with Pye Dubois) and + (by Geddy Lee/Peart).<br />The album starts at full throttle with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" *, which was talking about modern-day heroes and using one of Mark Twain's character as a metaphor and featured rapid playing by Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson and bass player/singer/keyboard player Lee, whom was singing more and more in a lower octave on this album than previous albums. The song \\"Red Barchetta\\" follows, and is about a person who goes to his uncle's farm and discovers a car. The music picks you up then accelerates as the song goes on and then ends as it began by dropping you off at the next location. Next is \\"YYZ\\" +, an instrumental named after the luggage tag code at Toronto airport. That track was used as the focal point for Neil's drum solo in concert off and on for the next nine years after this track came out. The first half ends with \\"Limelight\\", which was more of Neil's song about his problems dealing with fame and was more sensitive than Alex or Geddy were in dealing with autograph hounds and stalkers and was a Top 100 hit in 1981.<br />The second half kicks off with the 11 minute epic \\"The Camera Eye\\", which was the last 10 plus minute suite Rush ever recorded and is a classic and is split in two parts. First, we're in modern day New York and then we go back to ancient times London and featured excellent guitar work by Alex and synth and bass work by Geddy. Next is \\"Witch Hunt\\", which was the third part of a four-part saga called Fear and is about dealing with prejudices and injustices in the world. Interesting fact, the mob rants at the start of the track was actually multi-tracked rants and raves of the three Rush members whom were acting hyper after drinking bottles of Scotch outside of the studio (Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada) and it was cold outside (below freezing) and the band were drinking and bellowing to create that rant effect. Plus, the song had Rush album cover guru Hugh Syme on synthesizers and two drum tracks by Neil to create a synth drum sound years ahead of its time. The album concludes with \\"Vital Signs\\", which would not have sounded out of place on a Police album and is a great track.<br />Moving Pictures was an instant smash peaking at #3 on the Billboard album charts and selling over 4 million copies in the US alone making it Rush's biggest seller to date here in the US for good reason. The songs, production and the playing are all top notch and Rush proved music sold on music and not looks.<br />Today, this album still sounds fresh and hasn't aged at all over 25 years on.<br />This album belongs up there with classics like The Dark Side of the Moon, Who's Next, Hotel California, Back in Black, Appetite For Destruction, A Night atthe Opera and Sgt. Pepper.<br />A classic!!!r.   A classic!!!

B000002J1L|5.0|Genesis' third album Nursery Cryme was released in November of 1971.<br />By this point, lead singer Peter Gabriel, keyboard player Tony Banks and bass player Mike Rutherford were going through the motions as they lost original guitarist Anthony Phillips and went through drummers as drummer John Mayhew also quit.<br />The three surviving members of Genesis held auditions for a new drummer and guitarist and settled on then 20 year olds Phil Collins and Steve Hackett (who joined a few months after collins joined). The former also brought some needed humor and a singing voice to off-set Gabriel's theatrics and the latter a superb guitar style.<br />With a lineup they could be happy with, Genesis went to Trident Studios in London to work on Nursery Cryme, how would the album be, read on.<br />We begin with the ten minute epic \\"The Musical Box\\" which is the reason for buying this album. The beginning is wonderful enough. The overdubbing of 12-strings from Hackett, Banks and Rutherford is quasi-Victorian in its feel with some haunting electric guitar fills from Hackett and joined by Gabriel and Collins' voices and Gabriel's flute. Then it suddenly shifts to an explosive hard rock tune, dominated by the killer soloing of Hackett's guitar and the killer percussion of Collins. Every time I hear this song, I still get a shiver down the spine. The last two minutes of the song are like a religious experience. The virtuoso feel of Banks' organ, cymbal-heavy drumming from Collins, Rutherford's 12-string playing, Gabriel's repeated shouting of the word \\"now!\\" and the way Hackett's guitar suddenly bursts from the back to the foreground make for a glorious climax which you don't hear anymore. Next we have \\"For Absent Friends\\" which marked the vocal debut of Phil Collins whom would become a key member to this exciting band over the next 25 years. We then end the first half with another epic \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" which tells a haunting but light-hearted tale which is a great song and has an awesome intro with Hackett's guitar and Banks' organ playing a haunting riff.<br />The next song is \\"The Seven Stones\\" which kicks off the second half and is a good tune but not as superb as the first two epics on the album. Next is the comedic \\"Harold the Barrel\\" which shows the band were starting to become more light-hearted thanks to Collins' presence. \\"Harlequin\\" is next and is the calm before the album's final storm. The final storm is the nearly 8 minute epic entitled \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" which is a great way to end the album. It starts with Banks' organ and mellotron haunting playing then joined by that awesome bass riff from Rutherford and vocals from Gabriel and guitar from Hackett and drums from Collins. It starts at medium pace then we go fast for the middle section then goes back to the medium pace of most of song then ends slow and majestic. The highlight is the instrumental that occurs about three and a half minutes in. And the way it ends contains some of the most balanced musicianship on the album.<br />The album may not have sold but who cares about sales, Nursery Cryme is still a classic today despite being recorded in 1971.has an awesome intro with Hackett's guitar and Banks' organ playing a haunting riff.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|SO exciting!  This Kubrick film on Blu Ray is just superb!  The music is remixed into Dolby Digital 5.1 and is just amazing.  I've now seem all the Kubrick films on Blu Ray except for \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and this is one of the very best (with \\"2001\\" being the ultimate home video ever!)    I could go on and on about the film, which has NEVER looked this good, even upon it's initial release.      Kubrick's attention to detail and the fact that this is a masterpiece of set design, cinematography  and lighting.  A masterpiece!  The entire Overlook hotel was built inside a soundstage in England and shot with existing light.  (Barry Lyndon time...hopefully that will be coming up in high def). It was all shot in England.  This was the first film to use steady cam.  The shots of Danny riding his tricycle through the creepy hallways of the Overlook are just about as effective as they were at Hollywood's Chinese Theatre back in 1980.      It is a stunningly superb transfer to digital and should bring a whole new generation to this incredible achievement.
B000068FY0|5.0|When English rockers Supertramp released their third album Crime of the Century in October of 1974, the band had been together for almost four years and went through hardships before recording this album.<br />The only holdovers from the original Supertramp lineup in 1969 were the two main songwriters and vocalists, guitarist and occasional keyboard player Roger Hodgson and keyboard player Rick Davies. After releasing two failed received albums 1970's self-titled and 1971's Indelibly Stamped, Supertramp called it quits.<br />Then in late 1973, Hodgson and Davies reformed the group which featured fellow Englishman John Helliwell on saxophones, woodwinds and occasional keyboards (he would also bring along his excellent sense of humor to the band), a Scotsman named Dougie Thomson on bass guitar and drummer Bob C. Benberg (real spelling of last name is Siebenberg), whom hailed from Southern California, USA.<br />The new lineup of the band went into Ramport Studios (owned by The Who) with co-producer Ken Scott (whom had worked with artists like David Bowie, Elton John and The Beatles) and created their first masterpiece which also spawned a single \\"Land Ho\\" b/w \\"Summer Romance\\" which would not appear on an album until 2005's 2-disc Retrospectacle.<br />Crime kicks off with Hodgson's \\"School\\" with a classic Hodgson guitar riff and the haunting harmonica by Davies and complete with school kids playing and was a radio staple. Next is Davies' \\"Bloody Well Right\\" which has a memorable chorus and was Supertramp's first American Top 40 hit in the spring of 1975. \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" is next and my favorite Hodgson track on this album and has a synth effect played by a saw with a violin bow and a beautiful melody and vocal from Hodgson. The first half concludes with my favorite Davies track on Crime entitled \\"Asylum\\", which is about the character of Rudy going insane and complete with cuckoo clocks at the end and Davies saying he's mad mad mad and the music is haunting.<br />Side two (the second half) kicks off with \\"Dreamer\\", which was Supertramp's first UK Top 20 hit and a classic Hodgson track. Next, is the album's tour-de-force \\"Rudy\\", which is a classic Rick Davies composition and you feel like you are on a train with this song. \\"If Anyone Was Listening\\" is next and has a Beatles kind of vibe to it since Hodgson was a Beatles nut and a nice ballad. The album concludes with the title track which had Davies' blues and jazz influences and the lyrics summed up the album in a nutshell.<br />Crime of the Century was the beginning of the classic Supertramp era and was the first album for the band to hit the US Top 40 and eventually went Gold (it would hit Gold after the success of Even in the Quietest Moments in 1977).<br />Today, this album stills holds up 31 years after its release, especially with the remastering superbly done by Greg Calbi and Supertramp engineer Jay Messina, whom painstakingly remastered this album in 2002.nd half) kicks off with \\"Dreamer\\", which was Supertramp's first UK Top 20 hit and a classic Hodgson track.

B000V1Y43W|5.0|The original release on DVD was good enough but this Blu Ray release is a just great!     If you have the proper equipment, and you know who you are, this is a MUST HAVE!    It'll be playing in a lot of big screen high end audio showrooms for a long time to come.  Or it should be.  This is way the High Def format was invented.  Bravo to all involved.  It has finally sold me on the Blu Ray format over the excellent HD DVD format.  This is just video and audio nirvana!  Can it even get any better than this?    It cost a bit more, but for this level of excellence it doesn't matter.  This is still cheaper than the least expensive LaserDisc and it just doesn't come close in quality.     WOW!!!    Visually it is beyond perfect and the Dolby Digital 5.1 (actually 7.1) sound is just awesome.     This is just another Pixar masterpiece...
B000001ESN|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's eighth album (ninth technically if you are counting the Rush Archives 3-record set released before Hemispheres) entitled Permanent Waves was released in January of 1980.<br />Rush went to Le Studio in Morin Heights, Quebec, Canada in late 1979 to record their seventh studio album and were starting to do away with the long epics that were part of the band's identity in the 1970s.<br />The album opens with the classic rock radio staple one-two punch of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\", both of which still get plenty of airplay on rock and roll radio today and Rush still perform those two tracks in concert today. Guitarist Alex Lifeson and bass player/singer/keyboard player Geddy Lee were just on fire on these tracks and drummer Neil Peart shows why he became the successor to John Bonham for rock drummer supreme after Bonzo passed away later in 1980. Next is \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" which is a great near eight minue mainly instrumental epic with fantastic synthesizer work and a fantastic vocal from Geddy.<br />Side two starts with \\"Entre Nous\\" which is another good rocker (was recently resurrected for the 2007 Snakes and Arrows Tour). \\"Different Strings\\" follows and features Rush's version of Storm Thorgerson (Floyd's album cover designer) Hugh Syme on piano and this was the only track Neil didn't write lyrics for (Geddy wrote the lyrics). The album concludes with the nine minute plus epic \\"Natural Science\\". The track is split into three sections and doesn't disappoint.<br />Despite the fact the album only features six tracks and runs over 35 minutes, this album still remains a classic!<br />The album was Rush's first album of a decade where they would rule supreme, the 1980s. Permanent Waves was a huge hit peaking at #4 (Rush's first US Top 10 album) and went Gold immediately (subsequently Platinum).<br />When I was 14, I first bought this album on tape in June of 1990 and loved it at first listen.<br />This remastered CD, which was superbly remastered by Bob Ludwig, buries the original 80s CD issue and made the cassette sound bland. Plus, all of the artwork that was on the original album is restored as well., buries the original 80s CD issue and made the cassette sound bland.

B000VSBX34|5.0|I've always loved this film ever since I first saw it as a very young man in Buffalo NY.      This film has been given all the respect that it deserves with this brilliant restoration of picture and sound.  I only want to see it issued in High Def.      All of cinematographer David Watkin's visuals are back with pristine glory.  And there isn't a single speck on this digital transfer.  This has been well worth waiting for all these years, using today's technology.      The sound might just be a point of contention to anyone who can't access DTS surround, but there is a PCM track as well.  The DTS sound is just magnificent to my ears.  If you have the system, you know how you are. The image fills my 46\\" 16 by 9 screen and looks fantastic. There is a second disc of supplemental material, which is just icing on the cake.  And even the incidental music has been remixed into DTS surround stereo!  That makes things much more seamless than the recent release of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".  It all feels like modern sound.    The Beatles just go on and on and it actually makes aging worth it.  What would life have been without The Beatles, Walt Disney or \\"The Wizard Of Oz\\"?
B000GPIPSS|5.0|I have mixed emotions about this DVD set. Yes, it is an improvement over the last release in some ways, but there are many questions to be answered. I found the sound to be worse on this set than the last release but, it sounds clearer when you add the Glass soundtrack.?! The film looks very good and restoring the groans of Dracula to the finale of the film is a big plus, but is this the best they can do? I guess I'm expecting too much after seeing some truly amazing restorations come to DVD. The extras are carried over from the last release and they have added a new documentary called \\"Universal Horror\\" which is on the Frankenstein 75th Anniversary DVD set too. This is my third dip buying this film, forth..if you count my VHS version. I'm sure I will buy a HD version someday too. I wouldn't mind so much if Universal would stop draining my savings ever couple of years on minor improvements. Now reviewing the film.....<br /><br /> This is a monumental film and should be in everyone's collection. Lugosi would become forever associated with the role. The DVD set does include the Spanish version of Dracula which in many ways is better, but Lugosi's performance is the deciding factor and makes the American original reign supreme.  If you don't already own this film, then this might be the one to buy. Just remember that with the legacy set, you get all 4 of the Dracula related films from Universal, plus the Spanish version for about the same price including most of these extras. It's a toss up, but I would go with the Legacy set for now and skip this 75th edition. Wait for a Blue Ray version which hopefully will get it right on all \\"counts\\". ;-b
B000VWYNOG|3.0|I must agree with \\"Missed Opportunity\\"  A good collection, but it's still missing essential parts.  I was excited, but skeptical when I heard of a new \\"Best Of\\" Van Morrison.  Shall I list the \\"missed\\" tracks?    Ro Ro Rosey  T. B. Sheets  The Way Young Lovers Do  And It Stoned Me  Caravan  Blue Money  Tupelo Honey    It's sad, after all these years, it's still not right.  I would have also included \\"Caravan\\" from his appearance from \\"The Band's Last Waltz\\".  A shame.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|i just bought the bestbuy store exclusive 3 dvd set of amazing journey. it includes the chicago show of dec.8.79. as bonus disc 3. the show is not complete. missing songs are...who are you, see me, my generation, i can see for miles, won't get fooled, dancing in the street,dance it away, young man blues, roadrunner, and big boss man. 10 songs missing. i have a bootleg of this show and those songs were played. the audio is very good. the video looks like a commercial vhs transfer a little dark, grainy and some color bleed. but for a free bonus you can't complain.     the other discs are great stuff. for a fan the 10 minute railway hotel show as a bonus to disc 2 is worth the 22 bucks. i can't believe how tight and strong they sounded as just kids in their first moving images. the documentary itself is well done also. people are comparing this to the kids are alright, \\"kids\\" had great footage, introduced you to the band and told you a little about them. this tells you their whole story from day one til now by them, unlike the many other docs that are third person.      if you just recorded the two shows on vh1 there are a few more things on the  discs, like all of disc three. one more thing, the bestbuy sets are priced wrong from the distribution center. the limited 3 disc set is marked 32.99 the regular 2 disc sets are marked 33.99, but they all ring 22.99 at the register.
0446577391|5.0|Reviewed by Leslie Granier for Reader Views (9/07)<br /><br />\\"Stone Cold\\" is an exciting novel that focuses on the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency and its role in international politics.  Three of the main characters - Harry Finn, Oliver Stone, and Annabelle Conroy - share a common link.  They are all seeking revenge for the death of their loved ones.  As their paths become intertwined, they are unsure of who they can trust but realize they must rely upon each other in order to achieve success in their individual missions.  After several members of a covert government operation from years ago begin turning up dead under mysterious circumstances, many government secrets begin to be uncovered.  As a result, United States officials must scramble to prevent the truth from being discovered and take drastic measures to preserve the reputation of the US government.<br /><br />David Baldacci makes excellent use of short chapters to maintain a fast pace in the action.  By doing this, several different storylines can be followed concurrently, thus keeping the reader interested and wondering how the subplots will eventually be connected.  This book will appeal to all adults who like unexpected plot twists, suspense, and action.  Baldacci kept me guessing as to what would happen up until the final pages.  The story also caused me to question to what lengths world powers will go to attain their political goals.  My only difficulty in reading this book occurred in the first few chapters.  It was a little hard to learn about the characters because it seemed they all had two names - a given name and an alias.  Once I figured out which characters were the same person, it was much easier to follow.<br /><br />The primary characters in this book are likable even though they may have questionable pasts.  As the details of their interpersonal relationships are portrayed, it is evident that each of them is deeply passionate about his or her cause and I found myself rooting for justice to prevail for each of them.  \\"Stone Cold\\" will evoke strong opinions and will provide a great platform for debate among its readers.  The country's opinion of its government officials may never be the same.<br /><br />Book received free of charge.evail for each of them.  \\"Stone Cold\\" will evoke strong opinions and will provide a great platform for debate among its readers.

0345337581|5.0|This is a great book with fascinating memory skills (though quite basic after the first understanding of memory schemes).  It is well worth the read from ages 10 to 30.  After that your mind goes sorta numb and you should stick more with simple suduko and word searches.
B000Y179KO|2.0|Hard to believe that the two guys who wrote Desperado and Tequila Sunrise in one afternoon couldn't come up with better material than this.    Absolutely nothing new or different here.  It is perfectly arranged, recorded, and performed but the songs run together and the end product is boring except when Don Henley's negative political views become irritating.     This would still be the best album Vince Gill ever did but doesn't approach works of genius and passion like Hotel California or Desperado so save your money and buy those if you don't already have them.
B000Y179KO|2.0|I have been a huge fan of the Eagles for years. I was excited to hear about the new cd. I went out and bought it last week and was VERY disappointed in it.     It could have been a logical extention to The Long run (The last studio album) or even an extention on the four studio cuts on Hell Freezes Over. However I thought that maybe I bought a country album by mistake, say John Michael Montgomery.     The Eagles are known for their classic country rock but this is hardly rock. Most of it wouldn't sound out of place on a Tim McGraw album. Even the typical rock and roller Joe Walsh has been brainwashed into the country sound.     There are a few highlights. After an absolute AWFUL opening there are a few tracks that are pretty good. (How Long, Busy Being Fabulous, Guilty Of The Crime, Fast Company and ESPECIALLY What Do I Do With My Heart!) However the album dips down again and never recovers. The highlights of disc 2 (not as good as the ones on disc one) are Long Road Out Of Eden, Somebody & Last Good Time In Town.    I hate to say it but if you want the old Eagles sound, buy tracks 2-6 from disc one on i-tunes and forget the rest. If you like country music, this is for you!     Yes I know that oldies like Peaceful Easy Feeling and Lyin Eyes are pretty darn countrified. THIS IS MORE COUNTRY THAN THAT!
0349117047|3.0|THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN by Alexander McCall Smith. It's copyright 2002, and it was (is?) apparently a phenomenon of some sort, so you may be thinking, \\"Poor Michael. Living in Asia so he doesn't know what's going on anymore.\\" Nah. I was the same way in North Carolina.<br /><br />And hey, I just read about somebody who didn't read a single word of Harry Potter until the seventh was published. Then he sat down and read the entire series in a few weeks without having to wait a year between each book. Cool. Being behind the times has its advantages.<br /><br />Anyway, I lived in the US for 36 years and never met an African. I met a few in China. None in Thailand yet that I'm aware of. But I have read their literature and seen their films, and I get the impression that Africa is warm, welcoming, open and beautiful. I get that from this book as well.<br /><br />Set in Botswana, it features The #1 Ladies Detective Agency. The name of a business is very important, which is why The #1 Ladies Detective Agency is so successful. The name tells you everything you need to know. Whether you love a mystery or couldn't care less, you'll enjoy this book. I did.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|Well, like most people that are fans of the older (and newer) A7X,this album was a slight disappointment.To keep it straight to the point-if you were a fan of City Of Evil..you'll pretty much like the first half of this disc-the second half...ehh...NOT so much.Theres one song in particular that myself ,and my fiance thought was a joke at first(Dear God) we were like \\"ok,its gonna start rockin ANY minute now!\\"...BUT no...never happened...the song is basically a sappy, almost-country(AND I HATE COUNTRY)sound..IT SUCKS..(I actually read it was written by the Reverend-the drummer..PLEASE,NO MORE)My suggestion;Download the first 6-7 songs.
B0002GTWQA|3.0|I wouldn't have chosen this for myself, but a friend loaned it to me because the setting is Thailand, which is where we live. It's based on the novel by Joseph Conrad. Of all the authors I read in high school, I always considered him the most boring.<br /><br />I haven't read this novel, however. And since it's a movie, and in Technicolor at that, why not start watching? There's no law saying I have to finish.<br /><br />What we quickly learn is that Peter O'Toole, eyes so blue, is a hero wanting an adventure, Lord Jim who waits for something to happen. So he joins the merchant marine in search of adventure, holding himself above the anonymous human wreckage.<br /><br />Idealism is contrasted with reality, using dry subtle wit. I love that.<br /><br />Perhaps, in hindsight, that high school class made us read as much as possible in order to destroy my love of reading. If so, it failed. Or perhaps, since the movie stayed so true to the novel, this is one of those rare cases of a novelist whose work is better as a film.<br /><br />The themes aren't happy here. Fear, hatred, honor, racism, trust. Until Lord Jim no longer wanted to dream at all, but only to forget. And then he moves beyond that, although it never ceases to haunt him. Lots of quotable nuggets of macho philosophy. It's a very male movie. How male? There's only one female in it, and she's billed in the credits as \\"The Girl.\\" But fear not, she remains chaste AND does a hero turn.<br /><br />We see all the people that Lord Jim meets and affects as he does, through the eyes of an outsider. This gives us a realism that Conrad probably felt was missing from adventure novels. Also, when faced with the unknown, it's easier to invent racial stereotypes. They belong in the context of this book/movie, but they also fed into Hollywood's \\"look at those crazy Asians\\" mentality. And hey, we can even view other westerners through the lens of the stereotype. Racism, sexism, ageism, alcoholism.<br /><br />In the end, a very watchable movie, one that you can enjoy and think about, with a good old fashioned good vs evil war worthy of Rambo, minus the blood, and scenery that matches what I see when I look out my very own windows. I'm happy.<br /><br />But wait! There's more!<br /><br />I do enjoy a charismatic villain with screen presence. When our hero kills him off, and Conrad moves into one of the most ham-handed attempts at romance I've ever seen, the movie was only halfway over. Prequel and sequel packaged into one, with yet another charismatic villain, for 155 minutes of fun, with a good twisty plot to keep you alert.t, with a good old fashioned good vs evil war worthy of Rambo, minus the blood, and scenery that matches what I see when I look out my very own windows.

Also, the Center for children that can't read good? What a great idea! There are several memorable scenes and quotes in this movie, an it is a must watch.
0312330863|5.0|Is there anyone who read ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL and who didn't rush right out and buy this one next? I didn't think so. I gave the first one a rave review, and rightfully so, but somehow I don't recall enjoying it as much as I did this one. He's an amazing talent on so many levels. Read the real reviews by the real reviewers. They're all true. This man lived in the moment, and he enjoyed all in life that is enjoyable.
1594489505|5.0|Often the follow up to a very successful book disappoints,but in this case the second book may have exceeded the first book.  I found the story engrossing and the characters vivid and memorable.  Being set against real events made it even more moving, and helped me to understand the situation in Afghanistan.  I was able to overlook the faults the one star reviews find with the book.  Not for the faint-hearted, there are scenes that are difficult to read because of the violence.  I began listening to this book on an abridged CD set and reading it at the same time.  I found a lot of important gaps in the CD set, but I appreciated hearing the pronunciation of the names and places.
0440238609|5.0|Thank you, \\"Borealis\\" - - I echo your thoughts.  Being a teacher, I have survived the \\"Harry Potter\\" storm and I suppose this one will pass, as well.  To my knowledge, not one child from the legions of students who have read Harry Potter is currently sporting the broomstick as their primary mode of transportation, nor have evil spells been cast on parents.  I am ashamed to say that while I loathe all censorship, I didn't see \\"Harry\\" as worth fighting for.  The books remained on my shelves, despite parent protests, but I didn't take the intiative to make a real case for the series unless I was personally approached and asked to do so.  These books are different, as they are infinitely more well-written and, in my humble opinion, are a more important contribution to the fantasy genre.  I question why this fervent upheaval did not exist 15+ years ago when these beautifully written books were first published, and I believe I know the answer:  Those who attempt to squelch all ideas save their own tend not to READ.  Please consider reading a book and forming your own opinion before attempting the ultimate form of censorship...banning.  As a sidenote, I feel compelled to mention that I am a devout Catholic and was not the slightest bit offended by the content of these books. Don't believe everything you read and take my word for it...dare to crack the binding and see for yourself.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|After watching this movie, I don't think it's possible to say with intellectual honesty that the health care system in this country can continue. Moore profiles people who have been denied health care by HMOs, as well as current and former HMO workers who say that it's their job to find ways to deny people care. He then looks at the health care systems in Canada, Great Britain, and France, where the people he interviews are highly satisfied with their free care. Some have said that Moore does not show some of the bad side affects of socialized medicine (see the review in Reason magazine). Arguably, his interviews do not amount to a systematic investigation of the health care systems in Canada, Britain, and France, and there is probably much more than he is showing us. On the other hand, the single-payer systems that Moore explores cannot be dismissed out of hand, as many people seem apt to do. And clearly, the systems he examines do at least some things much better than ours does.<br /><br />In the end, his sermonizing about \\"world of me to world of we\\" is a overly sentimental. Furthermore, his praise of France's laws regarding paid vacation and child care is unnecessary and distract from the main points. But it's impossible to argue with Moore that our health care system is broken and needs to be fixed. What is the best solution- Single-payer? Mandatory health coverage? Tax credits for individual savings accounts? Government-subsidized and regulated private insurance? Whatever the case, we need a frank discussion of an issue that has been ignored for far too long, and hopefully Sicko will prompt this.
B000VSBX34|3.0|One of my movie faves growing up was always Help!  I was very disappointed that the 5.1 surround mix was only available for DTS and not Dolby 5.1 (just like Queens' Night At The Opera!!) I must say that the 2-track musical content sounded very fresh and remixed, but I wish the ads had mentioned DTS SURROUND ONLY - I might not have spent top dollar and pre-ordered.  After the brilliant Dolby surround mixes in The Beatles LOVE set, you can understand the frustration.<br /><br />The other letdown was the \\"missing scene.\\"  They only talk about it, show several stills and interview the leading lady of that scene (who didn't know she was cut from the film until she went to the premiere).<br /><br />The picture looks excellent, better than my Hong Kong DVD of Help!, purchased years ago, but that \\"import\\" had many extras that this set doesn't offer.  Next time, get me good British plugs - it's up to you - the voters!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I can only add to the glowing recommendations for this game. It is hard to find a game with rules this simple but yet so challenging (for ANY age!). There is really only ONE rule -- the correct way to place a piece on the board. A piece can only touch the corner (not the side) of another same color piece. I only have one recommendation regarding this game: it needs to be played with 4 people to really be enjoyed. It can be played with two people but each person must play two colors, so that the board can fill up. The strategy and fun is when the board starts filling up and you start running out of spots to place your piece. If you only play with two colors on the board, then their will be plenty of room and no strategy will be needed. Buy the game, you'll love it!

B0009EP052|5.0|This Japanese import of New Order's second album is one of the few instances where the expensive import is actually essential, and not merely a collector's piece. For starters, the actual running order of the disc is the original 8-track album (excluding 'Blue Monday' and its b-side, 'The Beach') which tightens up the album and gives it a much more natural flow. Secondly, instead of the American-ized cover art and liner notes, this cover is true to the LP, with no band name, title or track listing. Finally, this album, though not listed as remastered, is a great sonic improvement over the domestic cd pressing. While not sounding as magnificent as the 'Singles' set, the sound quality is on par with the 'Retro' box from a few years back. This is worth the extra cash for New Order fans. If one is too pressed for cash to buy the import, at least buy the domestic version and just burn a copy without 'Blue Monday' and 'The Beach' to hear this masterpiece the way it was intended to be heard.
B000FILW86|5.0|Okay, how many more decades does this highly respected quartet have to go on before ever truly getting the respect they deserve?    Now don't get me wrong as I am a fan of the Beastie Boys as well, but having to see them get inducted into the 2008 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame before legends like Cheap Trick tells me that those who vote on the inductees are perhaps the same clueless dopes who spent time as executives at commercial radio stations or record labels.    Keep up the great work Cheap Trick.  Your fans know how relevant you are and will always be!!!
B000TGJ80S|1.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula?  This should be retitled \\"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula\\" since it has almost nothing to do with the original source material.  If you'd like to see a faithful adaption of Bram Stoker's novel, buy the 1977 BBC production \\"Count Dracula\\" starring Louis Jourdan.  The 1977 BBC made for TV movie is the most accurate film version done to date -- the 1970's FX are cheesy, but the story and acting are fantastic.  Save your money and buy the BBC version instead, you'll be glad you did.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|What a great concept to have the dark side of spidey come out. Unfortunately it seemed more of a comedy than an action thriller. Storyline was lame and unfortunately poorly filmed. They threw this one together with not much thought to executing a potentially strong storyline.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|This has to be, by any measure, one of the most bizarre films ever made based, of course, upon one of the dottiest books!  With the character of Howard Roark, Rand personified her own unique `objectivist' philosophy and Vidor put it on the screen in the form of Gary Cooper who enunciates his lines even more robotically than usual rather as if he can't quite believe what he is being required to say!  The script, penned by Rand herself, requires that almost every character deliver their lines as if each were their last and most heroic utterance!  The symbolism, too, is hardly subtle.  For example, in one scene the heroine, Dominique Francon, played by Patricia Neal, beautiful but hard, frigid and sanctimonious, first encounters Roark while he chooses to work as a day labourer in her father's quarry rather than prostitute his architectural `genius' in the pursuit of wealth and wordly acclaim.  She stands looking down on this `tall, gaunt' man piercing the hard, rigid rock façade with a large drill that he holds tightly as if it were an extension of his arm.  Naturally, the rock crumbles under the force of this penetration! We then see her later, obsessed by this image, breaking the marble fireplace in her bedroom as a pretext to get Roark to come to her.  Needless, to say the course of this true love just wasn't meant to run smoothly and Roark deserts Dominique in order to return to New York in response to a request from a wealthy, and obviously discerning, patron to design and build an apartment block.  It is here, on the opening night of the controversial building, that the two are temporarily reunited.    The other central character Gail Wynand, who employs Dominique as a columnist on his paper `The Banner' - a kind of 1940's The Sun - shares many of Roark's characteristics although, ironically, his immense wealth is based upon pandering to the needs of the masses rather than standing alone as Roark chooses to do.  It is Roark's integrity that ultimately wins Wynand, played by Raymond Massey, over and the two men, recognizing a mutual kinship, become almost inseparable friends, much to the vexation and bewilderment of Dominique who, by now, is Wynand's wife.  Thus there ensues a curious, almost, troilistic relationship in which the female plays the role of  the observer.  In this respect Roark's treatment of Dominique might be viewed as somewhat sadistic.    Ultimately it is the patent absurdity of the script and the `heroic' style of acting that combine to produce a deliciously weird and compelling concoction that, because of these very qualities, one never tires of viewing.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Which is one hell of a monopoly. But the album is a great deal considering you get 20 tracks! Not all of them are smash hits, and I get the feeling that the Eagles style has mellowed with age. I especially like How Long, and The Long road out of Eden. The album explores different genres, some songs are slow and folksy, some have a smooth jazz flavor, and there are upbeat classic rock style songs as well. Some songs are a bit boring. All in all I highly recommend purchasing this album.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Iam not surpose to be a typical Eagles fan,i don't fit the mold.However,good music transcends everything race,color,culture,ethnicity even religeous values.The new Eagles album is one that changes everything.The quality of song writing,vocal harmany,musical production and value is mind blowing.I consider myself a lover of quality music of course this is all relative,people have different musical taste.This album is perfect for those of us with the sophistication to know quality music when it is created and to appreciate it when listen to.My recommendation is very high but get the Japan Limited Edition with two Bonus tracks if you can,remember this will be a collectors item some day.
0790729644|1.0|Unforgiven was a pretty bad western but not as bad as Pale Rider.  Again, Eastwood is given the perfect plot - a bad man turned good forced to return to his old ways for the want of money, the job, to kill two cattlemen who sliced up a prostitute's face.   These old veterans, reluctantly, go back to their old ways after the girls of the cathouse put together a big enough \\"steak\\" to kill them.  Again, the movie had too much talk and not enough action.  The ending was an improvement, but by the time I got there I felt like I wasted my time.  This movie did not merit the best picture Oscar Award.  There are many other westerns that are far more deserving.  If you liked: the Good the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few More Dollars, A Fist Full of Dollars, High Noon (Gary Cooper) or Stage Coach (John Wayne) do not watch this film unless you want to disappoint yourself.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Read the revewis for 1 stars... they all sound like this; Hey im a complete moron and dont know anything and i just found out that this was an HD DVD and im mad. I have a TV and DVD player but no one told me anything about this HD stuff. I cant even see my dvd because i would need some sort of futuristic HD DVD player, i am mad at amazon.    haha some people are morons. this HD DVD is awesome and if you dont already know, you will need a HD DVD player to watch it.    good luck!!!
6304698682|1.0|The Pale Rider is one of the worst westerns I have seen.  What makes it painful is the potential that it had to be a great movie.  It has all the elements, a town in trouble and a mysterious stranger with a past who can save it.  The whole idea with the symbolism in the movie was good, such as the Pale Rider, or Death, from the book of Revelations and the chance that this stranger might just be Jesus.  But the movie was just too dragged out.  There was not enough action.  The part where the girl tells Eastwood that she loves him is just laughable.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This new work obviously was not done in haste as I can't find one bad song on EITHER one of the two CD's!! The song Long Road Out Of Eden, written by Don Henley absolutely blew me away. In my opinion this is the best song Henley has ever written and recorded even though I don't fully agree on their political statements on some of their songs. The Eagles were worth waiting for and for $11.98 this is an incredible deal.  The ONE problem I have is the CD's are in a CARDBOARD case. Taking them in and out of this case will scratch the CD's so I'm thinking of putting them in a regular CD case. Not sure why they did that? To save money? I'm sure they could have afforded a regular case!! Anyway, GREAT work!!
B000002BVN|4.0|The should-have-been title song \\"Ghosts\\" is exactly like how it sounds in the music video, \\"2 Bad\\"---not so much.  But at least it's all enjoyable.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Title: Long Road Out Of Eden    Artist: Eagles (AKA, The Eagles)    Music: A    Performance: A+    Recording: A-    The Eagles placed their first chart hit in 1971 and went on to become the best country rock band in the land, and perhaps the world. I'm generally not much of a country music fan, but I gotta admit, those 5 guys made me an Eagles fan! If I had to sum up The Eagles' music in a single word, that word would be FANTABULOUS.    When The Eagles broke up in 1981, band members were asked when they would again perform together. I think it was Don Henley who replied... \\"when hell freezes over\\"    In 1994 The Eagles produced a reunion tour and a live MTV special. It was decided to record the MTV performance and release it on both standard CD & CD Surround formats. It seamed only logical that that CD was titled, Hell Freezes Over.    Since then, The Eagles have performed together on a regular basis and became one of the top grossing concert performers. The resulting CD's and DVD's from those concerts sold millions of copies.    But, there have been no new 'all studio' albums since 1979, until now. Long Road Out Of Eden is The Eagles' first such studio recording in 28 years and it is fantastic! Listen to these guys...especially on the opening track, No More Walks In the Wood...a cappella + solo guitar. With the exception of Don Felder, The Eagles have lost nothing, and if anything, vocally they sound better than ever and musically... the magic of The Eagles continues.    By now you must realize that I like this CD and I strongly recommend it to anyone who appreciates truly good music.  The only criticism I have is a very small one and it involves distribution of the CD by a single retailer. But that's a marketing decision made by people who know about these things than I do, and hey, Wal-Mart is for Carolyn May and I, a great place to shop. Plus the fact that Wal-Mart typically sells this 2 disc musical gem at under $12.00, makes it completely acceptable to us.Long Road Out Of Eden - my private edit & re-sequenced version    I recently purchased at 30 pack of `audiophile grade' black CD-R discs. Black colored discs are suppose to be able to reduce or eliminate laser light reflections that may be bouncing around in a cd player and thus, produce superior sound  from what is possible using the typical shinny silver discs.  I chose to test this with Long Road Out Of Eden. The reasons I had for choosing to use this cd are...    a. At about 88 minutes, I found it to be too long    b. Available recording time on all CD-R's is just under 80 minutes    c. For me, Long Road Out Of Eden contains a small amount of music that I prefer not to listen to.    d. I felt that the recording quality of Long Road Out Of  Eden was such that improvements afforded by a black cd would be evident    ... so thusly and so, it was for me, the perfect choice for this test.    I edited out 3 songs and did a bit of re-sequencing. The track listing on my `private version' of Long Road Out Of Eden is as follows:    I DREAMED THERE WAS NO WAR    NO MORE WALKS IN THE WOOD    HOW LONG    BUSY BEING FABULOUS    WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HEART    WAITING IN THE WEEDS    NO MORE CLOUDY DAYS    FAST COMPANY    DO SOMETHING    YOU ARE NOT ALONE    SOMEBODY    I LOVE TO WATCH A WOMAN DANCE    BUSINESS AS USUAL    CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE    IT'S YOUR WORLD NOW    LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN    In the process of all of this, I think I ended up with an overall program that is not only easier to listen to, but is more `user friendly' by being on a single disc. Insofar as the effect of recording on a black cd instead of a silver cd... it's all in the ear of the beholder.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It's Britney .....!!<br /><br />She's back and in a big way.  A whole lot more to this cd than most folks thought it would be (without hearing it).  I knew i was on to something when i first heard \\"Gimme More\\" and that's not even the best song on \\"Blackout\\".  The one that i'm really feeling in particular is \\"Piece of Me\\" where she's talking about being the target for the papparazzi and news media at every turn.  She asks if they really want a piece of her.<br /><br />They can't handle her or this cd as it brings something else for all the music lovers or ones that didnt know what Ms. B was capable of.  It's evident on the track \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan) that she's got something \\"else\\" on her mind.  Along with \\"Freakshow\\" as well.  Also really enjoyed \\"Hot As Ice\\" and \\"Perfect Lover\\".<br /><br />Standout tracks on Blackout:  \\"Gimme More\\", \\"Piece of Me\\", \\"Radar\\", \\"Heaven on Earth\\", \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan)\\", \\"Freakshow\\" and \\"Hot As Ice\\"<br /><br />Excellent cd from Britney and props to the producers and writers that helped her bring the heat back into the music scene and the energy into her music.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|take a breath, take a deep breath now ...  Gilmour is doing f**king yoga, man!  Right on !  Like all of us getting older Pink fans who survived the drugs the alchohol (ok still surviving the alcohol and hoping for more decriminalizing of the Mary Jane substance) Gilmour still hits it right on. The spaciousness of the mix is undeniably Pink.  Rant rant if you like about the seeming easy listening of this, but alot of Pink has been on the mellow side, so get over it and just dig this CD!
0765350386|5.0|My first Sanderson book was Elantris, and while I wasn't greatly impressed with the story (I frequently wanted to skip his religious zealot character), it seemed to me that the author had definite narrative talent and deserved a second chance.    With Mistborn, he wildly exceeded my expectations in delivering a novel that was not only completely unique, but that had a compelling magic system, great world building, and excellent characters.    One of the things that stunned me early on was how bleak an environment the reader is dropped into.  Slavery is the norm for much of the empire, and slaves that cannot work are completely disposable.  The ruling class sometimes bed their chattel, but are obligated to clean up after themselves by subsequently killing their conquests. Sanderson relates glimpses like these to the reader in a matter of fact way without dwelling on the iniquity of the situation, which I found all the more chilling.    Into this situation we are introduced to Kelsier, who wants to shake things up and unshackle the masses.  His plan is to destroy the Lord Ruler (think Sauron) who has created this disparity over the millenia of his rule.  Kelsier and the band of people that follow him are all experts in Allomancy to differing degrees, and will have to coordinate their skills if they are to overthrow the Lord Ruler.    Allomancy is the clever form of magic used in the world Sanderson has built.  Characters consume (swallow) alloys and 'burn' them.  Different alloys have different effects.  Most allomancers only develop skills with one alloy, but allomancers who have the ability to master all alloys are known as Mistborn.    Kelsier however is not the main protagonist in the novel.  That character is Vin, a latent Mistborn who has spent all of her short life surviving on the streets and being abused by people only interested in profiting off her allomantic skills of persuasion.  Early in the book Kelsier discovers her and recruits her into his band, saving her from what would no doubt have been a very short life.    Vin, as a product of the streets, is extremely distrustful and leery of anyone who would treat her with even an ounce of respect.  She is an unnaturally talented Mistborn and a fast study, but her fundamentally skiddish nature is the type of character flaw that keeps her believable.    On this point, Sanderson could have blown the book for me.  Vin's part in Kelsier's crew is to pose as nobility in order to gain information about where the ruling class might be weak.  Had Sanderson made Vin suddenly transform into a court sophisticate he would have undermined what she was all about.  As it is, Vin is never able to feel comfortable around the nobility, and while she projects genteel qualities and mannerisms that she has been taught for her role, she isn't really seen as anything special by the ruling class.    This is only the tip of the iceburg in a book that managed to throw in court intrigue, romance, betrayal, bitter fighting and executions, compelling magic, and characters that you could genuinely care about.  While I knew the general outline of the plot, Mistborn never failed to surprise me, and this made the book extremely hard to put down.    All in all, this is one of the best fantasy novels that I have ever had the pleasure to read.  Thank you Mr. Sanderson - you can be sure that whatever you write in the future, I will definitely be getting a copy of!
1881273156|5.0|I have not finished reading this book yet but I am loving it. It is opening my mind and heart to what my husband really needs.
075640407X|4.0|I really liked the writing in this book.  It shows a level of maturity that just astounds me when I consider that this was Rothfuss' first effort.  I've read many veteran fantasy authors who could not have pulled off this kind of writing.    This is not to say that I didn't have problems with the story however.  Kvothe wasn't good at anything, he was extraordinary.  It really didn't matter if it was languages, his grasp of sympathy, his memory, his music, knowing a good horse, being able to walk away from a brutal lashing looking like the coolest kid in school, knowing the correct application of medicinals, etc, etc, etc.  I would have loved to see this character attempt something only to fall flat on his face every now and then but instead Kvothe seemed possessed of such unnatural talent and skill that I found him really annoying at times.  And why was Tarbean Kvothe so different from University Kvothe?  Seems like the beggar on the streets of Tarbean wouldn't have needed three years - head chocked full of sympathetic knowledge and cleverness - to pull himself up by his bootstraps!    And then there is the whole annoying 'how much money has it got in its pocketses' angle.  I'd frankly be willing to contribute several dots, or perhaps even a silver talent to the author if he would never have his characters throw money issues in my face again.  Introduce a character named Salli Mae and give it a break already.    Still, all in all, I found myself able to really appreciate the writing and many of the author's scenes.  I developed a genuine connection with the characters, though I felt that some deserved better treatment (Fela, for instance, seems to have only served as a set piece).  I am looking forward to and will buy the next book in this trilogy.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is one that hearkens back when you bought albums, not songs, when you purchased music.  It is holistically good, not a bad or even mediocre song in the entire setlist.  There are some stand-outs but as others have noted, this is a to be enjoyed in its entirety.   It is also one of those moments when a mature artist seems to have caught a second creative wind that rises above recent material and resonates with their earlier creative roots without being plagiaristic.  This album deserves a Grammy as much as Dylan's resurgence 'Time Out of Mind', probably more so.  That is a deserved and warranted recognition for a great songwriter, singer and guitarist as well as a wonderful band and producer (Brendon O'Brien has the right touch to the music's impact - if someone calls the production poor, muddy or distorted then they have a simple lack of understanding the basis of American roots music).  We purchased the album on CD just before driving down Big Sur in a convertible.  The experience of driving down Highway 1 while viewing the majestic cliffs, beaches and open road with the music turned up was a totally honest redeeming experience with none of the false pretenses that seems to embody the past few years.  The American treasures, Springsteen and the beautiful landscapes, were intensely moving.

B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I think I may be the biggest fan of the Bourne movie series there is.  With the two times I saw Ultimatum in the theaters, plus the numerous times I've seen Identity and Supremacy on disc, I've probably watched the Bourne movies about 40 or 50 times.  And the amazing thing is, I never get tired of watching them.  In my opinion, this is the greatest trilogy ever made.  I suppose people would argue The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, and if fantasy is your thing, definitely.  But if you want a crisp, fast-moving, fantastic action thriller, look no further.  Ultimatum closes the story nicely, and as much as I like the movies, I hope they don't make another sequel; there's really nothing else to tell.  Matt Damon did a phenomenal job, throwing himself completely into this role with the extensive physical training and preparation for this part.  Fans of the first two movies will not be disappointed in Ultimatum.  The suspense, the fight scenes, the car chases; all amazing.  The fight scene with Bourne and Desh in Tangiers may be the best in the franchise.  In short, the Bourne trilogy is as good as thriller movies gets.  Enjoy.
B000FZERIG|5.0|All four Beatles released solo albums in 1973. This album has \\"Give me love\\" George's second #1 solo song. There are many great moments here but, there are a couple of song's that some might consider weaker than others. Some songs are slow and require a bit of listening. As with some of Harrison's solo work the hidden jewels are in the mix. (i.e. guitar parts, backing vocals, piano riff etc. etc.) It's worth the listen. Check out the guitar and sax parts on the title track. So cool. At this point in 1973 George was clearly into his own style of writing... somewhat different than \\"All things must pass\\" and a few years away from The Beatles break up. Great cover too. I did read somewhere a long time ago that those are George's hands on the cover. I always loved the poster/ lyric sheet of Krishna and Arjuna that was included with the original LP. The re-mastering job is excellent! Thankfully they aren't \\"remixing\\" George's albums like they are with John's. I'm so glad they put \\"Deep Blue\\" and \\"Miss O'Dell\\" as bonus tracks.
B00005R5G9|4.0|Mannequin starring Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall is such a guilty pleasure, I used to watch this fun disaster over and over again when I was a little kid. This film is so silly, you can't take it seriously, you just have to have a good laugh at this one. The both stars do have great chemistry even though the script and plot are cheesy as hell. Look out for Estelle Getty, she always steals the show. Defintely one to buy, I consider this a camp classic, enjoy!
B000002NG7|3.0|FNM really lost alot when Jim Martin left.  The last two albums just have such bland guitar riffs.<br /><br />I like what Patton did on his first two FNM albums, but FNM turned into MR. Bungle II after Martin left.  Mr. Bungle's style is just too weird, experimental & annoying, Martin's riffs sounded like a friggin war going on on all those songs, which was awesome.  The songs were just alot more tighter & you could headbang to them. Wish they would regroup with Martin.<br /><br />This album is decent, but I'd probably buy this one last of all their other discs.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|This was a sad end to the show that made watching TV all worth it.  There are a couple of eps which nearly up to par with the earlier seasons, but most are sad imitations and a shell of the show's former existence.  If you are fan of the show, then you must see how it ends.  If not, you should watch the show in order and savor the earlier seasons, then watch this knowing that, while it isn't great, it is fun.    Enjoy, Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows ever to appear on TV.  Thanks, AMY SHERMAN PALLADINO  for making it all possible.  We missed your presence this season!!!
B000QGEB12|5.0|Get this movie. It's great. The Matrix with comedy, kung-fu, and well, umm, Wile E. Coyote type action all rolled into a great little film! Don't try to think, just let the film take you where it's going. My highest recommedation.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is absolutely freakin' fantastic.  I am IN LOVE with this album.  BUY THIS!!!!!!!
B000002MZ6|5.0|I must admit that, when I first heard this album, I was put off by the fact that it sounded so unlike any of Mike Oldfield's other works. However, since then it has become a clear favourite. The pieces are beautifully put together, and take the listener on a journey across time and space, which is fitting when one bears in mind the purpose for which the album was written. If ever I need to relax, in need of a mental massage, then this is the remedy that works every time!
0375703861|4.0|Okay, I am torn here. This is a really good debut novel, but I feel like this novel was overhyped. Sometimes when a book makes the Bestseller's List, it doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. After reading On Beauty first, I know Zadie Smith is a good writer. However, White Teeth made me feel like, as a writer, she was putting too much into this novel. I believe one reviewer said that Smith was \\"trying too hard\\". Sometimes I think so too.<br /><br />There are so many themes here, so many angles, it leaves the reader (at times) confused and bored. Its called White Teeth and there were so many references and metaphors coinciding with molars, wisdom teeth, etc. to people and I am guessing their mistakes? Later on, it became mice and the past. How did teeth, mice and the past all go together, I don't know? Then you dive into way too many themes for one book here: race, gender, sexual orientation, politics, science, religion, etc. It just felt way too compacted. You can't fit a zoo into a cupboard. It's too grand. That's what I feel happened here. It's just too much.<br /><br />Granted, this book was funny- but the media made it seem like it was hilarious and it is not THAT funny. Perhaps it is because I am American and not British so I cannot exactly relate to the moments in British history that she touches upon in the book; but it was a bit of a struggle to continue with the book at times. Towards the end, you see why the media claims her work to be Dickensian, which is a great tool for the story. The Dickensian twist was something I really enjoyed. Great pay off. In conclusion, its a good book but the reader will see how messy it all is (which Zadie Smith had once said is a style that she admires from other writers and incorporated it into her own work) and one may or may not like it.

B0006Z2LCE|4.0|Except for two tracks,this collection contains those on the 1979 compilation ON THE RADIO VOL. I and VOL. II. The album version of HOT STUFF is here,though. The tracks do not dissolve into others here like OTR. Also,there is no long version of OTR. The Queen Of Disco aka Donna Summer was probably nominated for a Best New Artist of 1975 grammy. The nearly 59-year-old Boston native continues delighting audiences in small and large venues today. So pop these discs into your player and get down and funky!

B000UX6THK|5.0|Ok so the titles a bit subjective, but thats how I feel about the series. Wow is it good. So much depth in the characters, the world of Twin Peaks is so animated, interesting and strange things constantly happen. I havent seen it for some time and I was floored by the series all over again. It isnt watered down Lynch, he pulls no punches showing the deception, sex, violence, lurking under the surface of small town Americana.    All of these interesting people that we see are part of an overarching detective story. The viewer is kept on his toes by clues that are placed around and everyone seems to be strange enough(by sitcom tv standards) that everyone is a potential murderer.    Thats one of the main themes of the show, lighten up America, dont be afraid of having a personality. Dont be so paranoid. Weird does not equal murderer, or terrorist, or bad person. I think that theme is if nothing else more relevant today than when Twin Peaks was released.    Great, great show. Succeeds on all levels. Just as pure kooky, fun, entertainment. It also operates as a sort of voyeuristic expose of Americana its fun to look at our warts. And also as a kind of guide to the subtler side of life it succeeds.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have to say that I have been a fan of Britney since the Baby One More Time days, I have all of her CDs. With all the chaos that has been happening to her, lackluster performances and overall \\"what the hell is going on?\\"-ness, I was expecting nothing special with this CD. After the first few tracks I knew I was sorely mistaken, because this is an amazing album to sing and dance too.<br /><br />Yes, the lyrics are kind of raunchy, call them borderline sleazy - but thats OK because she, and most of her fans, are no longer 12 year olds. We've grown up, so has she. This album has a sexy, addictive sound and I strongly feel any fan of pop and/or dance/ hip hop even would appreciate the sounds this work.<br /><br />I would not say it is her greatest, but it is amazing nonetheless. Music fans won't regret this purchase at all. Ignoring her seemingly out of control lifestyle, none of that translates into this cd.
0743564413|1.0|William Hurt cannot read.  At all.  The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable.  I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether.  There should be a warning label, \\"Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is known to nauseate expectant listeners\\".      On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including \\"True at First Light\\" read by Brian Dennehy and \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" read by John Slattery.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a different reader.
B000000993|5.0|THE BAND: Maynard James Keenan (vocals), Adam Jones (guitars), Paul d'Amour (bass), Danny Carey (drums & percussion). Guest artist - Henry Rollins (vocals on \\"Bottom\\"). Band origin - Los Angeles, CA.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1993) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 53 minutes - plus an additional 60 track selections - 59 of these at 1 (silent) second each, plus one 'hidden' last track lasting just under 16 minutes. Included with the disc is a 5-page foldout containing song titles/credits, 'odd' photos (some including band members, as well as the pig & fork back cover photo again), and thank you's. Recorded at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, CA. This is the band's 2nd release (and 1st full length album, after the '92 EP, \\"Opiate\\"). Label - Zoo / BMG.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This \\"Undertow\\" was my introduction to California's band, Tool. It didn't hit me at first, but decades later I hear the brilliance in it. First and foremost this is a heavy metal album. Secondly, it's a progressive album. The music is heavy, dark, grinding and complex. Having played drums myself, listening to Carey's mastery behind the kit is a near religious experience for me. No tom-tom is safe and I bet he's cracked even the best Paiste cymbals. I put Carey up on my top tier of drummers - next to the likes of Neil Peart (Rush), Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Ian Paice (Deep Purple), and Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree). d'Amour hammers his bass guitar with style - like no one I've heard before. Keenan's vocals are unique. The emotional anger/lust/disgust fit the songs perfectly. Adam Jones' guitar technique is brilliant. I really admire a musician that brings his own style/sound to the table. Need an example? Try to channel out the other instruments and tune in to Jones' guitar work on  \\"Sober\\", \\"Intolerance\\" and \\"Bottom\\". Also check out \\"Swamp Song\\" (dancing in quicksand - \\"I hope it sucks you down\\") and the slower \\"4 degrees\\". For me, Tool's sound is so uncommonly different than anything else out there (not including the imitators that came after the fact)... and that still holds true today. The songs \\"Sober\\" (#13) and \\"Prison Sex\\" (#32) were well received - both made the mainstream rock charts. \\"Undertow\\" peaked at #50 on Billboard's best albums of 1993. Several publications (\\"Pause & Play\\", Classic Rock\\", \\"Raw\\", etc) rate this release among the best albums of the entire 1990's. The album cover - Jone's rib cage sculpture - is my favorite Tool cover. The only thing negative about the disc are the blank tracks after song 9 (\\"Flood\\"), as well as the hidden last track 69... 5-minutes of tribal chants/drums/percussion followed by 10 minutes of electronic crickets. I guess I've missed the (inside) joke or the statement here for years and I just find it bothersome (eject!). Tracks 10-69 should not take away from the album experience though. As \\"Opiate\\" found the band in raw form with a ton of promise, \\"Undertow\\" showed them perfecting their craft. Albums after \\"Undertow\\" have come close to matching the intensity of this one, but with a little less wow-factor. For me, you found out how remarkable and mighty the band was on \\"Undertow\\"... so you came to expect it on future releases. Brilliant album - start your Tool collection here (5 stars).uding the imitators that came after the fact)... and that still holds true today.

1582701709|1.0|Like everyone else, I guess I was curious as to what the big \\"secret\\" was.  The secret is they're ripping you off, people.  What a load of bull!! You have to be kidding me!  It saddens me to know that people actually believe in this.  I guess it just goes to show you the kind of world we live in (especially in the U.S.) and what their values are:  money, power, material possessions and looks. Not many people believe this but none of these things can make you happy.  There's more to life than just \\"getting what you want\\".  How childish.  How about growing as a person and using your life to benefit the world and making a difference?  What about God?  Not even mentioned - I guess He/She has nothing to do w/ any of this.  Oh wait matter fact, now I remember - we are God!!  Yeah, homegirl, you wish.  Check out this chick's picture - if that's God, we're all in trouble.  I believe that God is within us, but in and of ourselves, we are not God.  How grandiose can you get?  And lemme ask you a question - if we're all \\"gods\\" and can have anything we want and live the life of our dreams just by thinking positive thoughts, what's the point of being alive?  Huh?  I mean really, why are we even here?  I believe we're here to learn and grow our spirits, and that God is in control, always has been and always will be.  How self-important to imply we know better than God what we need.      She actually claims that even children and babies attract bad things to them with their thoughts.  What about babies who aren't even old enough to think yet?  What about babies who die shortly after being born- it's their own fault for \\"allowing in\\" negativity?  Yeah homegirl tell that to any mother who's lost an child - good luck not getting the s*** kicked out of you.  I'd like to expand on this though - she also claims that if you believe something with all your heart and soul, it will happen.  Well what about crazy people?  I've worked in mental institutions and anyone else who has can back meup on this - no one believes things that aren't true more than these people do.  For example - old, dirty, drooly, smelly bums who believe they're highly attractive and can get any girl they want.  I'm sure there's also crazy people who believe they're millionaires, or famous!  No one can convince them they're not - so why doesn't it ever come true??  Can you explain this?      Also - I've tried this whole \\"positive thinking\\" thing many, many times and it has never worked.  It seems like every time I think good things are going to happen and truly expect that they will, something bad happens and I'm disappointed.  Whenever I go into a situation expecting the worst, I am usually pleasantly surprised.  Can you explain this, Ms. Byrne?     Anyway, to sum up, save your money.
0895260131|5.0|In this book, the author explains much about Islam, Muhammad, jihad, and terrorism, and the relationships of Islam with the non-Muslim world as seen from the Muslim perspective and as documented in the Qur'an.  He shows us that Islam is not simply a continuation of Jewish or Christian traditions as documented in the old and new testaments, as many would have us believe, and that the Muslim's God Allah bears no resemblance to the Jewish or Christian concepts of God.  He also explains the history of Islam and shows us that jihad, war against all un-believers, is mandated by the Qur'an and that today's terrorists, financed largely by oil rich Islamic regimes, are in reality carrying on a jihad which has been ongoing for over 1000 years.  This jihad, he tells us, is to continue until all other religions, Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, etc., have been defeated and Allah is recognized as the one and only God.  At that time, there will be peace in the world with all of humanity being ruled by a Muslim state, under Islamic law, and with all remaining un-believers subservient to even the lowest Muslim.    Everyone who values his or her freedom and believes in equal rights for all human beings should read this book.  Even politicians, elected officials, and world leaders should read it.  But, perhaps that's too much to hope for.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Because Garth Brooks has so many hits, it had to be quite the feat, but they did an excellent job of putting this collection together. The set contains a vast collection of his work.  The DVD video collection could have been marketed as a stand alone and is worth the price of the set itself.<br /><br />Since I don't have any of Garth's past albums, I really wish \\"Somewhere Other Than the Night\\" and \\"Not Counting You\\" were included in the collection, but it includes Shameless, The Dance, Rodeo, What She's Doing Now, Friends In Low Places, Papa Loved Mama, If Tomorrow Never Comes, To Make You Feel My Love, We Shall Be Free, Two Pina Coladas, The Thunder Rolls, Much Too Young, Unanswered Prayers, and many others along with 3 new tracks (More Than A Memory, Midnight Sun and Workin' For A Livin') for a total of 33 tracks.<br /><br />For someone who buys a lot of albums but not generally hit collections, it was a stretch for me to buy this.  I'm glad I did because I feel as if I've won the jackpot.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|This was a real unexpected treat when it was announced on Angelo's myspace last year! The songs make it seem like I'm living in 1950's technicolor! If you liked any of the Twin Peaks sounds you'll dig this;or if you like Ange/Lynch scores give it a go! More on the lounge-jazz tip than dark ambient.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Warning... This review doesn't reveal the ending. But it drops a big hint.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" is a wonderful exercise in the use of CGI and digital processing to create a film with a unique visual style. But as a drama with a surprise ending, it's less than satisfactory.<br /><br />The problem is with dialog that telegraphs the ending. When Eisenheim asks Sophie if she wishes to run away with him, she replies that Leopold will hunt them down and kill them, no matter where they go. Given that they're obviously intelligent people, and they understand exactly how Leopold will react, the ending is all too predictable.<br /><br />The acting and directing are nothing if not exquisite, fully matching the magnificent art direction and scenes of period Vienna. Note how when Inspector Uhl feels the hands of Sophie's corpse to see if she really is dead, the director does nothing to draw our attention to it. He assumes the audience is paying attention, and is intelligent enough not to need having Uhl's actions explained.<br /><br />I suspect the implicit anti-Semitism of Leopold's hatred of Eisenheim (who's Jewish) and the line \\"Make us disappear!\\" anticipate the anguish of the millions of Jews who would be exterminated 40 years later. But the film doesn't acknowledge or develop these implications.<br /><br />By the way, the orange-tree illusion was created by the French illusionist Robert Houdin, the magician Houdini named himself after.
1400064287|5.0|I wish I had this book when I first started my business. It's informative, well written and it 'sticks' with what we need to do to get and stay in front of our target market. I've used several of the ideas and they definitely work!
B000EPFVDW|5.0|Lee Child took the world of literary thrillers by surprise--and by storm--with his excellent debut novel, Killing Floor. Child's first book introduced readers to Jack Reacher, ex-military cop turned rugged-individualist vigilante. Written in first person and featuring nonstop action, Killing Floor delighted readers and created new Lee Child fans in the U.S. and around the world.<br /><br />In a market that more often than not sees second books that fail to live up to the standard set by the author's first work, Die Trying is a surprising deviation from the norm. Even better, Child's second book is not in any way a carbon copy of his first. For one thing, the author proves himself quite capable of writing from multiple points of view, switching to the more familiar (and simpler) third person narrative. But beyond the writing style, the story is quite different from the first book as well.<br /><br />Die Trying opens with Jack Reacher and a woman he doesn't know being hustled off the street and into a cargo truck by an unknown assailant. As Reacher and the woman, who turns out to be a fairly high-profile FBI agent named Holly Johnson, brainstorm theories about the motivation behind their kidnapping and strategize about how they might escape, they gradually learn more about each other and about the bizarre and frightening situation in which they find themselves. As the story unfolds, Reacher proves to be every bit the chivalrous and ingenious nonconformist he was in Killing Floor, refusing escape on numerous occasions in order to provide whatever assistance he can to Holly.<br /><br />Die Trying has both a more convincing central premise and a more compelling eventual setting than Child's first book as well, as Reacher and Holly end up deep in the Montana wilderness, held captive by a renegade militiaman intent on using them as the impetus for his war with the federal government. Child builds the suspense throughout, climaxing in a literally explosive finale that leaves the reader cheering exhaustedly while finally climbing into bed (or eating a late dinner, or returning to work, or doing whatever was neglected during however long it took to finish reading the book).<br /><br />Child has stated publicly that he intentionally writes \\"clean\\" thrillers--books that contain no graphic sexuality and little language. This is true for the most part, though it should be pointed out that Child's idea of \\"clean\\" will undoubtedly differ from the definition of that concept held by some of his potential readers (Child began his career as a television writer, and in typical Hollywood fashion, Reacher and Holly do have a sexual encounter, though the scene is not graphic). Sensitive or younger readers should also be aware that frequent and often brutal violence is a trademark of Jack Reacher as well.<br /><br />Die Trying is a fun book to read--engrossing, entertaining, and hard to put down. Readers who enjoy fast-paced action novels with a moral rooted in traditional (and even, to a certain extent, biblical) literary principles like \\"you reap what you sow\\" and \\"what goes around comes around\\" will enjoy Child's writing. Highly recommended for fans of the action-thriller genre.haustedly while finally climbing into bed (or eating a late dinner, or returning to work, or doing whatever was neglected during however long it took to finish reading the book).

B000LBRQEQ|5.0|This is Zappa's first solo album and one of Zappa's only purely instrumental albums apart from the Shut up and Play Your Guitar series. It was recorded in the late 60's, right after the breakup of the original Mothers of Invention and is considered by many to be ahead of its time and one of the first Jazz Fusion albums. The only vocal is a Captain Beefheart rant over some searing Zappa blues guitar lines.<br /><br />The main genre is Jazz and if you listened to this album without being familiar with Zappa you might think it's a Jazz group. The opening track, Peaches En Regalia, is considered by some to be Zappa's masterpiece. This album put Zappa on the map as far as his guitar playing, compositional skills, and arrangements are concerned. As a producer & engineer he also breaks ground being the first to use a 16 track recording machine in an era where 4 and 8 tracks were the industry standard. Zappa was truly a well rounded man and one of the great studio masters.<br /><br />The supporting cast is great including Ian and Ruth Underwood, stalwarts of the later Zappa classic lineups. The dueling sections of long jams between Zappa on  guitar and violinists Sugar Cane Harris & Jean Luc Ponty are absolutely incredible and raw. This album can sound dated, but within its historical context, it is truly a masterpiece. Its refreshing  to listen the LP because Zappa later altered the recording by remixing it in 1989 (for better or worse) for CD-its rare to hear the original. This is great stuff!
B000W1V44I|5.0|That would definitely have to be my alternate title  for this gem. I must start off saying that these guys  are criticized and mocked way too much. No one said that  you have to like this type of music or any \\"boy and/or girl bands\\"  It it just ironic, because people would rather listen to a bunch  of \\"iced out\\" \\"grilled\\" idiots \\"rap\\" about raping, sex, \\"lookin  better from behind\\" drugs, money, money, money and oh yea money.  its sickening. that's not real music, its trash!   Anyways, back to the boys, we will all miss kevin and all wish him the best. You can see how much these guys grow on each album. This one, especially from the incredible 2005 Never Gone, has a lot of haunting and  chilling, goosebump worthy songs. Music and melodies at such a mature  and incredible level. Especially heard on Downpour, In Pieces, Unmistakable and Inconsolable. In my opinion, AJ has always had the best voice and is my favorite and his influences are awesome like Led Zeppelin. On this record he's got that 12-year or so legendary voice.  its a haunting in a good way. If you can appreciate one type of REAL  music check this album especially. You Won't be dissapointed.  Or you can go waste ur time, on Jay-Z's latest \\"American Gangster\\" a  plageristic title of Green Day's American Idiot, trying to copy  the idea of a concept album as well, he needs to sop trying to be  a rock star and be original. this is the second time he's done this.  Its your choice.
4893580914|5.0|This book is a God send, or Whatever send for you non-Christians. It is a wonderful workbook that gives you various questions and methods to teach you the multiple kanji used in basic Japanese. The only down side is that there isn't a Kana section, and all of the pronunciation listings are in Kana. The plus side is that it trains you to not always have an English backup plan.    It's meant to be written on, which is something the various other books I have don't have in mind. They show you everything, and teach you nothing. I recommend this to EVERYONE.
0765350386|5.0|If you like fantasy, or if you are just starting into the genre, Brandon Sanderson is the place! I loved his writing from the first book, Elantris. And continue to buy them. He takes Fantasy off the beaten path. His writing is refreshing and exciting.    With little swearing and no sex. These books make my list of christmas must haves... well except I have them already. ;)    So seriously, don't stop to think about it. Buy the book! But go for the Hardback cause you'll want to read it again.

B00005LK95|4.0|Johnny Five is annoying and funny at the same time. his search for input made me feel like laughing. his voice on the other hand, is very annoying. I forgot to mention the sad part and that is when he is being hacked to pieces and his so-called friend Oscar is directing the demolition. he gets revenge on Oscar toward the end and then temporarily dies, being brought back to life by Ben. all in all, get this movie if you're a kid at heart.
0786930640|5.0|You can't judge a book by its cover, eh? Back in 1990 my cousin and I got into all things fantasy, mostly because we loved the 80's fantasy movies like Willow, Legend, Dragonslayer, etc., but because we wanted to further our love of fantasy into reading novels, which we had heard were always better in book form. man, were they right!    Being total fantasy literature newbies, we literally went to the bookstore and decided to get into any fantasy series that looked appealing to us. We didn't know of any authors in the genre, what any of it was about or anything, so I just walked in and looked around for a bit and the first thing that really caught my eye was the artwork Larry Elmore did for the covers of the Chronicles trilogy. The colors and detail in the artwork instantly drew my eye to the books and I picked them up and read the synopsis on the back. It sounded interesting, so I bought the entire chronicles trilogy. Which I did just by chance... I had no idea that was the first trilogy in the series, so I guess I just lucked out and picked the right ones to start with. By 1990, there were already quite a few novels out, so it's cool I started where I was supposed to.    When I got home I read Dragons Of Autumn Twilight and COULD NOT put it down. I had read few books by that time, and to sit and read a whole book in an entire day was something I never thought I could do until that day. The way Weis and Hickman described battlefields, how lovingly they described the detail of each and every dwelling the story took place in, and most of all, how much I ended up caring about those original Comapnions... man, I was and still am in love with those books. My cousin happaened to pick up a Forgotten Relams trilogy when he was in the store, and after we both finsihed our books, we swapped trilogies. Forgotten Realms didn't appeal to me nearly as much, so I decided to get into the Dragonlance novel universe as much as I could after that, and after reading my Dragonlance novels, my cousin did the same!    Over the years I read a lot of other fantasy from the likes Mercedes Lackey, Robert Jordan, George RR Martin, the Discworld books and a ton more, but none of them appealed to me as much as the Dragonlance universe. I own all 200 plus Dragonlance novels now and I can honestly say that they all range from good to excellent except for like 5 of them, mostly the ones written by Roland Green. It's amazing how the qaulity has stayed so high since so many authors have added their input to the world of Krynn.    Is Dragons Of Autumn Twilight and the Chronicles trilogy the best Dragonlance has to offer? No, that honor goes to Weis and HIckman's newest Dragonlance trilogy The Lost Chronicles. These are novels that revolve around what the original companions did between the books in the Chronicles trilogy. These books are extremely well written, and also far more adult oriented than the early novels. But as good as the new Chronicles is, they can't compare to the memories of reading Autumn Twilight for the first time. Nothing can.
0552550299|4.0|I picked this book up because my seven year old son had listened to it on my iPod every night while he was falling asleep and loved it.  I found the Amulet of Samarkand funnier and more gripping than the Harry Potter series (not to bash Harry Potter as I thought the final book was most excellent).      There are a lot of similarities between this book and the Harry Potter books.  Both describe a world in which magicians run the world in current times. In addition, the main protagonist is a teenage boy in both.  He is also terrorized by the head of his household (Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter series and Arthur Underwood in the Amulet of Samarkand).  However, I enjoyed the Amulet of Samarkand even more than the Harry Potter books because of the sarcastic humor of the demons, the great use of historical events and figures (like the destruction of Santorini), and the more ambiguous motivations of the book's heroes.     That being said, I did find the author's use of footnotes to be very annoying.  The information contained in the footnotes could have been easily worked into the main body of the story.    All in all a good yarn.
0385340559|1.0|Bad Luck and Trouble was my introduction to the Jack Reacher thrillers and it may be unfortunate, based on some other reviewers assertions that this title is unlike Lee Child's earlier Reacher novels. Regrettable, if true, but I have no intention of wasting time or money to find out.<br /><br />This book is a hopelessly contrived novel about a group of self-important, arrogant, and self congratulatory characters who supposedly were the best \\"special investigators\\" in the Military Police Corps. However, after plodding along through half the book, it became painfully obvious to me that Lee Childs knows nothing about the military or those who serve in it. He knows nothing about investigative techniques, nothing about firearms, nothing about police firearms training, nothing about surface to air missiles, nothing about the Patriot Act, nothing about terrorists, and nothing about defense contracts or weapons system procurement.<br /><br />Evidently the only research this pathetically Liberal author was willing to do was give the reader details about Los Angeles traffic conditions, geography and worthless statistics about Las Vegas.<br /><br />Much has been made about the nomadic lifestyle of the main character, Jack Reacher. As if that, and his folding toothbrush, make him notable. Actually, the character seems quite derivative of the Travis Magee character from John D. MacDonald's novels, except Magee was much more likable and much less arrogant. Which, of course means he wouldn't be marketable in the 21st century.<br /><br />After having read about 70% of this book I shuddered with disgust and closed it for the last time, completely willing to not know how it ends. But I do know this, it will take a lot more than a folding toothbrush to get the bad taste of Jack Reacher and Lee Child out of my mouth.

0316067598|5.0|As a combat veteran in Viet-Nam, I think every American should read this book. Especially the law makers and judiciary of this nation. Marcus Luttrell has captured, and put into words, the true concept of war and fighting against America's enemies with restrictions placed on these heroes. As he says, probably less than 1% of our population knows what real combat is really like. Maybe, just maybe, if this book were to be read by everyone, this country might wake up before it's too late.

B00006AW2G|5.0|This is a great album although I think the definitive Midnight Rambler is on Ya-Ya's and the definitive Let it Bleed on Stripped. I also think they should've put a bass line on Country Honk. That nitpicking aside, this a must have for Stones fans. Even if you have the big hits on 40 Licks or Hot Rocks, you need this and Sticky Fingers.
B000000XCA|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! The album Bayou Country peaked at #7 on the charts. \\"Proud Mary\\" is the only hit from here, peaking at #2 but it's the worst track on the album (Ouch! Did someone just throw a shoe at me?) The \\"Proud  Mary\\" track stands  out like a sore thumb in conjunction with the other songs on here. There are only seven songs on the album without a single misstep.    The album opens with \\"Born on the Bayou\\", one of the best non-hit album track you'll ever hear on an album. \\"Bootleg\\" is a decent enough song which is followed by \\"Graveyard Train\\", another outstanding track. Fogerty then reworks a Little Richard classic, \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\", turning it into a dynamite rocker. \\"Penthouse Pauper\\" is next, a more than adequate song. Then \\"Proud Mary\\" is next, which still feels like it doesn't belong here. The closing song is the incredible \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\", where Fogerty shines on lead guitar. John Fogerty has never been my first choice on guitar but, on certain types of songs, like good ol' standard rock 'n' roll, the man can lay down some incredible leads.    This is a great ROCK album. As an whole album CCR would never rock again this hard. I remember in high school the rock bands I played in played a total of 5 songs from this (yes, including \\"Proud Mary\\"). It sounds great today,  a timeless classic that should be in everyone's collection.
B0002234LS|4.0|While I wouldn't exactly call this movie suspenseful or scary, I really enjoy watching it. I think what makes it most enjoyable for me is the acting. Johnny Depp does a fabulous job as writer Mort Rainey, and John Turturro gives an unforgetable performance as well. The two of them hold the movie together for me.  Don't see this movie expecting to be glued to the edge of your seat with your heart in your throaght, jumping out of your skin at the slightest noises. I also don't think that there is anything new or innovative about this particular film. What you have here is something that is quite nicely done acting-wise, especially if you enjoy Johnny Depp's and John Turturro's work, and moves along well. I'd call it a quiet surprise.
0920668364|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter-in-law after the birth of our grandson. She LOVES the book. The story is about how love never changes between parent and child, no matter what the age. I get misty eyed everytime I read my own copy. It is just a sweet story.
0375842209|5.0|This is a story wrapped in sadness, humor, fantasy and cruel realism, and a profoundness that moves and says a lot about human nature. It's written with subtle poignancy, with clarity and a masterful command of the written word that makes reading it a bittersweet delight. Although unique in his literary talent, Markus Zusak reminds me a little of Heinrich Boll (\\"Billiards at Half Past Nine\\", \\"The Clown\\"), and seems by no measure less gifted. If you will only read one book this year, make it \\"The Book Thief\\" - it's unforgettable...

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Once again, Michael Moore exhibits his unique ability to make documentaries palatable to entertainment-addicted Americans.  We will take our medicine, but it better be concealed by attractive coloring agents, laced with artificial sweeteners, and packaged in attractive bright containers.  We have an almost instinctive reaction to receiving too much factual information at one sitting, perhaps developed back in third grade when nodding off to those tortuous flickering filmstrips (some of which Moore magically resuscitates to humorously illustrate various inconvenient truths...a strange and fitting revenge).  Moore counters this effectively with an ever-changing admixture of anecdotal personal interviews and interactions, interviews with and opinions from a wide array of experts and dullards (often leaving it up to his audience to decide which is which), strategic use of seldom-seen pictures and films, music, factual narratives, and those controversial and often maligned shock interviews (which accomplish what I believe is their chief purpose of keeping the viewer's attention on the subject matter).<br /><br />Moore knows that it is extremely easy to come up with a litany of facts that Americans are unfamiliar with.  Anyone can do it.  Our corporate media spoonfeeds the brainwashed masses with nearly fact-free drivel, making it easy for any movie maker to come up with facts and statistics that even the more educated and better informed amongst American audiences are unaware of.  The secret of success is the method of delivery.  Hence, the much deserved success of Mr. Moore.<br /><br />Moore cruelly allows the enemies of universal healthcare to speak for themselves, without the assistance of their mainstream media protectors whose job it is to edit, \\"interpret\\", interject, and shield them from serious inquiry and rebuttal.  Thus, we have raw Ronald Reagan hilariously and moronically explaining his universal-healthcare-as-slippery-slope-into-communist-dictatorship theory for suckers, Tricky Dick and henchman Erlichman endorsing the HMO concept of providing less healthcare for more money, the attack of the corporate clones on Hillary Clinton's attempt to give all Americans access to healthcare, Congressman Billy Tauzin using his momma to shill for insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and then becoming a lobbyist for Big Pharma to make it official....and much more with Moore's calm, dry, lackadaisical, understating commentary throughout captioning the absurdity unfolding before the viewer.<br /><br />The interviews with people actually experiencing universal healthcare in Canada, England, France, and Cuba provide the most direct and devastating refutation of the lies and propaganda against it from a variety of pro-insurance company shills.  Try sitting in a waiting room full of American HMO victims and compare their responses to those of the patients in Moore's film.  Or, for the ultimate refutation, try, if you dare, the same thing in an American healthcare detention center's emergency room, the facility where those who committed the egregious crime of having no insurance are sentenced to.<br /><br />It is hilarious to watch the corporate lackeys on Fox experiencing on-air hysterical fluster frustration fits totally devoid of any substantive rebuttals whatsoever.  I especially liked the scene in one of the DVD extras with Sean Hannity on-air where his female co-lackey nearly passes out from a massive shill-swoon hysterical episode while attacking universal healthcare, Michael Moore, and \\"Sicko\\", reason enough to watch the DVD.  The DVD is a different reality than the theatrical movie, since it contains extra scenes that aren't extras at all.  Unlike most extras on DVDs, which usually range from supplemental to total wastes of time, the extra selections on the DVD are actually essential parts of the movie, and you haven't seen \\"Sicko\\" if you haven't seen them.<br /><br />Perhaps the most damaging single fact to emerge from the film is the disclosure, almost made in passing so you may miss it the first time, that approximately 18,000 uninsured Americans die each year from not having healthcare.  If true, this is arguably prosecutable genocide against the poor.  What we then have is a genuine, albeit much more inconspicuous and lower-scale, Holocaust - the use of a vast corporate \\"healthcare\\" system as a means of extermination of a particular class of people, the very definition of genocide, especially when the main method used, neglect, is one the most common tools used to commit genocide.  So, why go to Darfur to seek out genocide when you may have to travel just one city block to find it?<br /><br />Whether or not it is Moore's best film, it is the best film on the criminal travesty that is America's failed healthcare system.passing so you may miss it the first time, that approximately 18,000 uninsured Americans die each year from not having healthcare.

B00005V0X5|4.0|There is a school of thought that says 'good things are even better if they don't drag on' and this album proves it. The original release was only 29 minutes long but there is a lot of quality musicianship and songwriting packed into the 8 songs found herein (not to mention aggression). The only short-fall was the somewhat-tinny production (which has been rectified to some extent).     That aside this stands along-side 'Rust...' as my equal second-favourite Megadeth album ('Peace...' being the favourite). From 'Countdown...' on they lost the aggro (to an extent), although the last couple, from what I've heard, go some way towards retrieving it.    In short, this album kicks arse so don't let the lesser production put you off. Buy it now. You need it! MK
B000R7HY0K|2.0|[[ASIN:B000R7HY0K Grindhouse Presents, Death Proof - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />Stuntman Mike, a former stuntman and stunt driver has found a new hobby. He likes killing attractive young girls with his custom built stunt car......<br /><br />This movie was pretty bad. I know Quentin Tarantino has made some outstanding movies but this movie is anything but.<br /><br />The Good: The performances given by the actors are pretty solid. The action sequences that there are play well and are entertaining to watch with the exception of the scenes that are way over the top.<br /><br />The Bad: Quentin Tarantino needs to let go of the 70's. I am sure he had a great time in the 70's and feels very nostalgic while looking back but I am willing to bet that the larger portion of the regular movie going population doesn't share his sentiment. His force feeding it down the throats of movie goers doesn't work. An example would be that the story opens up following around a group of 20ish girls as they go to a bar. Not once is a modern song played or listened to by the group and there are a lot of songs played. I am supposed to believe that a group of young girls hangs out all night and not one modern song played? They get in a car to leave and again we get something on the radio from days gone by. It all just feels a little \\"Trying too hard\\" to me and not believable.<br /><br />I understand that this was something of an homage to the old 70's grind house movies. Honoring old films is fine however the movie needs to be able to stand on its own and not simply be just an homage. This move can't stand alone. If Quentin feels the need to devote so much attention to these types of movie why doesn't he try making a documentary?<br /><br />I don't see the need in intentionally adding in \\"Missing reel\\" scenes, the rough editing and the worn look of the film. I get it, you are trying to create a feel, but it just doesn't work and again feels like he is trying too hard. Essentially he was trying to make a bad movie and in this he succeeded and some are calling him a genius for it. I am of the opinion that a bad movie is a bad movie whether or not you intended to make it that way.<br /><br />The story overall was extremely boring. 75% of the movie is devoted to the conversations of 4 women none of whom had any redeeming qualities with almost nothing of interest to say with the ending of the movie being the ultimate \\"Girl power\\" moment. I have no problem with strong female characters but they have to be done the right way and these weren't.<br /><br />Overall: I could go on an on about how poor this movie is. A boring story coupled with annoying characters and a poor attempt at force fed nostalgia. I honestly believe that Quentin Tarantino could film a dog fertilizing a lawn, sell people tickets for $9.50 and people would call him a cinematic genius. If Quentin had put this move out using a pseudonym the same people propping up this film would be tearing it down. Pass this movie up; there are plenty of other things to watch.movie and in this he succeeded and some are calling him a genius for it.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|This version of Flash Gordon is truly a sci-fi classic.  I've waited for years for the DVD release, I was not disappointed.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|I rented this the other day and was really looking forward to seeing it.   Spiderman 1 was great, and 2 was excellent.  3, however, has too many villians, not enough action, and too much drama.  I felt like my wife put on the Lifetime Network for a while. Sandman was hardly in the film, and   the whole scene with Tobey dancing down the streets was EMBARRASING to watch. Don't waste your time on this one. Let's hope 4 is a better one!
B000UR9T7I|4.0|As far as the format war goes i am purple. I used to be Die hard HD DVD until finally Blu has been putting out quality ransfers. Spiderman 3 looks great on my SXRD, and the Uncompressed PCM is amazing. I do have a onkyo 605 that will decode lossless sound, but no players right now can send that signal via bitstream. Except the A35 which I only own the A-2. But let me say that Bluray has impressed me and that SM3 is a good buy.
0143038419|5.0|This book is truly a journey that any woman can relate to.  There were times during this journey that I laughed out loud, and others where I was exactly where the author was, feeling her same emotions, though my life has taken a much different path than hers.  I think that the author relates to women of all ages who are on different paths in their lives.  I will read this book again and recommended to all of my loved ones.
B000Y1CWDS|4.0|Anyone who has been to Target recently and has perused their DVD section will know that Target has been going all out in the \\"Exclusive\\" edition craze. A special edition of season 4 of Nip/Tuck, an awesome transforming DVD case for the 2-Disc Transformers DVD and now an exclusive Spider-Man 3 DVD. I'll admit, I've fallen for all 3 exclusives, and have enjoyed them very much.   Whenever you get a bonus disc or extra booklet with a movie, you always think \\"Cool!\\" and this is one case where \\"Coll!\\" is very appropriate. The bonus booklet that comes with this set is comprised of: production notes, character/actor bios and more. This is the gem of the set (besides the awesome box) because it gives you little details that you might not otherwise find in the making-of featurettes. I always find that pleasing since I like trivia.  If you can still find this, get it, it's cool. What more needs to be said?
B000OLGCI4|5.0|One of my all time favorite Disney films. I remember as a kid I loved this film because I could really identify with the little brown boy.I look forward to sharing this film with my children.  Not too keen on the African American sounding monkeys, which really took me by surprise watching this again after nearly 20 years. In fact it was a bit off putting and I certainly plan on explaining the sociological factors surrounding this to my children as soon as they are old enough to grasp the idea.  However this film is so charming and the music is just so wonderful that despite my aversion I still can't help but love this film. The bonus features on this release are amazing and a must watch.
B000UCEJEQ|3.0|I bought all of my friends copies of \\"Bare\\" when it was released. It's very rare an album moves me like that one did. I was so psyched when I found out that she was releasing \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\". I pre-ordered it. I have to say I like it, but don't love it. It's a great album to put on when you are in break up mode!
006112429X|1.0|\\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" may be a work of fiction, but while reading it I was forced to question author Lionel Shriver's credibility. And I am not the only one. As a member of a working moms' book club that recently read this book, I felt the same need as my six peers to research whether or not Lionel, better yet Margaret Ann (the author's real given name), was a mother herself. The idea seemed impossible right from the start - and made the story's premise absolutely preposterous as a result.    Had Shriver never claimed that her novel accurately depicted motherhood in our modern world, I would not be wasting my time writing this review. But at the back of my Harper Perennial edition, I was confronted with Shriver's glorified biography and it nauseated me.    So, dear Margaret Ann, instead of reading \\"every article that commends the nutritional benefits of red wine\\" and quoting one episode of the comedy series Desperate Housewives in defense of your storyline, why didn't you at least try to research a subject of which you have absolutely no concept? You may have a \\"vivid imagination,\\" but you are irrefutably no mother. To say that you \\"have friends with children\\" and were \\"on the short side once\\" yourself displays an unbounded ignorance that is shocking for a woman your age, especially one who perpetually attempts to prove her intelligence by using pretentious vocabulary.    In the Harper Perennial afterward, you write: \\"No reader has yet to approach me in indignation, charging that I didn't know what I was talking about.\\"    Well, this group of American women (who, like you, have lived abroad for many years) is approaching you now with indignation, charging you with having no idea of what it means to be a mother and a lot of nerve implying through your 400-page novel that you do
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This DVD is my favorite, all the characters are very \\"cartoonished\\", the voices are very good, the performances are very funny, I really believe that this is the best DVD if you want to start someone into the Opera wold.
B000VEA38E|1.0|Listen - this is ONLY as good as all prior Star Wars soundtracks have been.  The digital remastering has in no way been brought to any new noticeable level.  If you already have the soundtracks and like them, then stick with it and save yourself the money.    If you do not have the soundtracks yet, then this edition does have some pretty cool printwork and a cd rom to go along with.  But it is not worth the extra money if you already own the music.    I took the flying leap to find out for myself but will be giving it to my brother as a gift.    I WOULD like Sony to remove the \\"hiss\\" that lingers behind many of these analong tracks.
B0007Q6PBK|4.0|The Opera is excellent, the voices of Pavarotti and Scotto are very good, unfortunatelly Pavarotti didn´t get the aria Che gelida manina as clean as I have heard him in another videos but still, is exciting and beautiful. The bonus tracks have some interesting interviews with Scotto, Levine and Pavarotti.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Remy (voiced by Oswell Patton) is a special rat with a talent in cooking much like his hero who happens to be a famous recently deceased chef named Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett, he gets seperated from his family and friends in a drain all the way to Paris where he is destined to live out his dreams of becoming a chef. He goes inside the popular restraunt where Gusteau build that's now run by Gusteau's assistant Skinner (Ian Holm) and now a new employee named Linguini (Lou Ramano) joins in with the crew as a janitor, but Remy helps the talentless Linguini with the soup that he spilled accidently to improve on it and the soup becomes a success with the costumers. Together Remy and Linguini work with each other to help make the restraunt more successful until Skinner gets jealous and must do something to stop him, but will Linguini and Remy's friendship last?<br /><br />co-starring the voices of Peter O'Toole, John Ratzenberger and Brian Dennehy this is Pixar and Disney at their finest! the film is a slight improvement over their very good but not great \\"Cars\\". Brad Bird (director of \\"The Iron Giant\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\") with John Lassester have just made another Pixar winner much like their \\"Incredibles\\" and has stunning CGI with an original storyline and emotion helps makes this another magical animated movie for all ages.<br /><br />This DVD contains some fairly good extras like deleted scenes, two animated shorts and a behind the scenes look at hte film with director Brad Bird chef Thomas Keller.
B000GCFO08|4.0|Silent Hill is a movie that is fast paced and action packed from the very beginning. My only dissapointment with this movie is the director never shows the audience exactly how the mother, daughter, and policewoman died in the crash. Although the writing for this movie was really good, I did find the director's ommition of not showing their dead bodies to be very confusing.    In this horror, a mother searches for her missing daughter in a creepy town that is quiet during the day, but is plagued by spirits and a \\"reaper\\" like figure during the night.   The mother soon finds others hiding in the town.  The ending is very good. Also, the actors are good.  Because of the awesome special effects and good cast of actors, including the children (who were believable in their roles) I rate this movie with 4 stars.  I left a star off due to the major loop hole of the director not showing the audience exactly how the mother and daughter died in the accident or what happened to their bodies, even when her husband came to search for her, he was never shown claiming or at least identifying his families' bodies.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I AM NOT A SITCOM FAN BUT SEINFELD IS THE BEST SHOW EVER MADE........IT'S LIKE REAL LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT THEY BASED THIS SHOW ON, SO PEOPLE RELATE TO IT, I STILL WATCH THIS SHOW EVERY NIGHT I OWN ALL THE SEASONS, I JUST PURCHASED SEASON 9.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I remember when this first came out, I thought it was going to be stupid.<br />Another dumb love story, it truly was more than a love story it was history in the making.<br />It shows how unhappy rich people can be in their life, and how money doesn't buy happiness.<br />It also shows when you don't have money how to make the best of what you got.<br />It shows as well how opposites attract like Jack & Rose.<br />Even though there was some what of a sex seen in the movie that's not what Jack & Rose revolved around, I thought the story had to do with living life to the fullest in whatever you do.<br />In the end I thought this movie is one of the best movies made in my life time.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B00003CXSP|4.0|Having read this book twice over a two year period, reveals some kind of fascination with the main character. The novel itself is the best of the series, and the film, directed by one of my all time favourite directors, Ridley Scott, had to be a perfect combination, and Scott's artistic sensibility as a methodical director, certainly shows in this gripping film.<br /><br />There is so much in this film that needs to be pointed out in terms of its artistic \\"film\\" qualities: all aspects - score, location, costume, art direction, screenplay adaptation and of course the impeccable performance by Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />Ridley Scott began as an art student and is well adept at pen and ink. It is known that he would show up early on location in Florence, and know one, not even the producers or Hopkins for that matter, knew what he would do next: because he would sketch the scenes in his note book at night, visualizing every scene - from the camera angles to the actors lines... for Ridley Scott, film is a real & true art form.<br /><br />Hannibal is one of the more interesting characters in popular literature/culture. An anti-hero of sorts, whose main reason for killing is rude people. In other words there seems to be a method to his madness.<br /><br />My wish was that the film ended in the same way as the book: much more final and chilling - which made more sense.<br /><br />Agent Starling relents in the book and through Hannibal's strength of will and power takes her to the dark side, both living quite well all over the world.<br /><br />However censorship is alive and well...<br /><br />For Starling to relent to Hannibal's hypnosis and power, to my way of thought, this was the perfect break through for a new story...rather than the terrible novel \\"Hannibal Rising\\" though the film however is exceptional; the tale should have moved forward rather than to its beginnings.<br /><br />Most fans disliked this film for strange reasons...though it is the best of the trilogy.
B000W1V44I|5.0|I love this album from beginning to end!  You can tell that there is a missing piece with the departure of Kevin from the group, but they make it work with just four.  Their harmonies are displayed in the Intro.  What a wonderful way to start the album!  They pump it up with Everything But Mine, a catchy dance track that gets you moving.  Inconsolable follows, which slows it down a bit, but shows that they are still the kings of ballads.  Now, it's pretty weird that a song that sounds similar to Inconsolable follows, but Something That I Already Know is one of my favorite songs on the album.  The boys sound so wonderful on this song!  Other favorites on the album include You Can Let Go, Trouble Is, and Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon.  The bonus tracks are also exceptional.  Downpour is a soft ballad, but I think I like In Pieces more because Nick's vocals sound so strong at the beginning of the song.  Each one of the boys gets to sing on this album, which is so awesome.  Howie sounds so good on Trouble Is!  Why didn't they let him sing more on the other albums?!  I can't stop listening to this album, which isn't anything new when it comes to a Backstreet Boys album and me, but if you are a BSB fanatic like me, this album is perfect!
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This album is definitely different from the stuff that Avenged Sevenfold has done in the past, but that is what A7X does. Every one of their CDs is different, and yet they are all amazing. Arguably this is their most experimental albums yet, but give it some time. Let all of the tracks sink in and appreciate the versatility of a band of this caliber. The great thing about Avenged Sevenfold is that you can easily identify what album a song is off of by listening to the first 10 seconds of it, because unlike other bands that stay with \\"the same sound\\" for all of their albums, A7X has talent and looks to showcase their abilities in many different forms. So rather than panning the album because it is different or making a bunch of stupid puns involving A7Xs other album names. just give this one a chance and you will like what you hear, and appreciate the fact that it is different.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|The first really \\"heavy\\" music I ever listened to was City of Evil.  And boy did I listen to that, it was the only music I listened to for over a year.  I thought that I would never get into music with screaming, but here I am after listening to Waking the Fallen for a few months.    This album is amazing.  It's just as good as City of Evil...  Which was almost perfect, in my eyes.  Waking the Fallen features great drumming, great guitar, and great singing/screaming, with of course how brilliant the songs are composed.  The bass is really good in this album, better than City of Evil, which I like.  Onto the in-depth review...    01: Waking the Fallen  It's an intro.  It's a damn good intro.  Rating: Intro    02: Unholy Confessions  I like how the bass keeps up with the guitar.  The song has a great structure, and I really like the opening verse.  Rating: Superb    03: Chapter Four  One of Avenged Sevenfold's greatest songs, in my opinion.  This song is brilliantly written, always moving, and is just a ton of fun to listen to.  Rating: Incredible    04: Reminissions  Here you can sort of hear their future coming out, such as with the integration of the Spanish guitars.  The song is pretty good, especially the chorus, although the middle section is kind of spotty.  Rating: Great    05: Desecrate Through Reverence  This song is filled with screaming, but also a great chorus and an excellent ending.  A very nice song to listen to, especially when you're angry.  Rating: Superb    06: Eternal Rest  The beginning is harsh and blistering, and you can hardly keep up until the rocking main riff comes in.  This song is great, the dual voice for the screaming parts sounds chilling.  Rating: Superb    07: Second Heartbeat  I can't say I like this song all too much...  probably the weakest song on the album.  But by no means is it bad.  The first half just seems pieced together of cool sounding riffs.  After the first time the chorus is sung though, the song really comes togetherand finishes off great (with an excellent outro solo)  Rating: Great    08: Radiant Eclipse  The intro really stacks some anticipation and suspense onto the whole song, and it suddenly smashes into M. Shadows and the song really starts moving.  I'm not a big fan of this song, really.  The first half of the chorus is good, but the second half doesn't really sound like it fits.  The second time it's sung however really brings out M. Shadow's singing skills.  Then the song fades away, creating the perfect set up for...  Rating: Superb    09: I Wont See You Tonight (Part 1)  Really, words cannot describe how amazing this song is.  There is no such thing as a perfect song...  but this comes very, very close.  I almost cried the first time I really sat down and listened to it...  It's really moving, and it's really amazing to just listen to.  A7X is excellent at writing slow songs, and their musical and compositional talents really shine in this song.  Everything fits, everything flows, and you can really feel the emotion in this song.  I would buy the album if this was the only song on it.  It's just so amazing.  Rating: Almost perfect    10: I Wont See You Tonight (Part 2)  As Part 1 fades to static you feel kind of sad...  and then all of a sudden screeching guitars and screaming come in changing the sadness to anger.  This is a good follow up to Part 1, and incorporates some of 1's elements into the song (such as after the guitar solo).  One of the heaviest songs on the album.  Rating: Superb    11: Clairvoyant Disease  Another well written song.  It starts off slowly and mysteriously and builds up a bit for the chorus before coming back down.  Where the song really shines is in the middle when it's really moving and the guitars and bass pedals are flowing.  Very good song, one of my favorites.  Rating: Excellent    12: All Things Will End  Aww, it's the last of the album.  :(  A great song to finish it though.  Good catch chorus...  I really like the middle where itgoes from whispering to screaming with the double bass.  The outro made me a little sad as the album had to end. (especially on such a depressing note as the entire song being slowed down)  Another one of my favorites.  Rating: Excellent
B000VNMMRA|5.0|Like many other people nervously anticipating Len Wiseman's debut as DH4 director, I could only hope that he could live up to, at the least, Die Hard 2.  But he has done a fantastic job with McClane, that lives up to the  previous trilogy.  In fact, I'd rank LFoDH just behind the first Die Hard movie.  No one can top Alan Rickman!  The small touches, e.g. Gennero/McClane, Agent Johnson, helicopter flying, are subtle, but add greatly to the movie.    There were a few things missing from the theatrical release, of course.  Most noticeably, the lack of swearing, McClane's trademark yippee-kai-yay being truncated.  The violence was all there, but it just wasn't intense enough.  Fear not fans!  The unrated version fixes all of that!  It's fantastic, McClane is back in all of his mf-in' glory!      **Spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk.**  --------------------------------------------  I was hoping for some more dialogue from Timothy Olyphant in the unrated version, but unfortunately, he is still a bit one-dimensional.  Run-times of the unrated vs. the theatrical are about the same, surprising considering that the unrated does add extra scenes.    What the unrated version includes:    Many more f-words and MF-ers.  - Extra dialogue between McClane and his captain, Clevino.  - Longer opening intro scene to Matt Long typing to the warlock,       listening to rock music.  - Extra banter when McClane and Matt first meet.  - More intro shots at the FBI command center.  - Shot of the National Transportation Center losing control of their       traffic grid.  - More shots of false anthrax alarm evacuation.  - Thomas Gabriel's hodgepodge of video of Nixon/Bush/Clinton speaking is     longer.  - Blood spurts!!! More gore, though not significantly more.  - More McClane-isms.  When John is driving the police car in the tunnel     towards the helicopter, Rand shoots the engine, which lights on fire.      McClane quips, \\"Well the car's on fire, that can't be good.\\"  - When Matt runs to his side after McClane destroys the helicopter,     McClane adds, \\"100,000 people are killed every year by cars.  What's       another 4?\\"  - Quick shot of dead guards in power plant.  - When Mai dies in the elevator explosion, McClane screams a profanity     laced tirade at her.  - McClane flying (and landing!) helicopter scene much longer.  - The guy getting crushed in the giant blades scene doesn't have much     more blood.  - Yippee-kay-yay mf-er is said in full!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This is without a doubt Megadeth's most underrated album not only from the 80's but in the band's entire catalog in my estimation as well. Being a huge fan of Megadeth and all, I've always enjoyed \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\", and it's also one of my favorite Megadeth albums as well. On this album, two of Megadeth's original members Chris Poland (guitar) and Gar Samuelson (drums) would be replaced by Jeff Young (guitar) and Chuck Behler (drums). Dave Mustaine's vocals on here are alot more aggressive and snarlier than on the band's previous masterpiece \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying\\", and his guitarwork is awesome as well. Jeff's guitar playing is very good as well. Lots of great dualing thrashing riffs and wild solos from both guys. Dave Ellefson's bass lines are very good, as well as the drumming by Chuck as well.<br /><br />\\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\" opens up with a great instrumental opener entitled \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" which is a biblical reference to the angel Michael's assault on hell after Lucifer's fall, while the next track \\"Set the World Afire\\" is an all out headbanging thrash assault that features technical thrash riffage, careening solos, and some fast hammering drumwork. This song is lyrically about the post apocalyptic future, and it's also the first song that Dave wrote after he left Metallica, musically and lyrically. Next up we have a cover of the Sex Pistols's \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" True the lyrics on this cover may be incorrect at times, but I thought it was pretty good, and the musicianship really made up for it. Track four \\"Mary Jane\\" is a fantastic melodic number which is about a girl who takes up witchcraft, and seeks forgiveness from her father only to be buried alive as punishment. The song starts off melodic, but then it garners up some speed around the 3 minute mark with some thrashing riffs and headbanging drums. \\"502\\" is another fast catchy thrasher which is about a high speed chase lyrically. I also learned that the song title is the Los Angeles police traffic code for impaired driving, for which Dave would be arrested in 1989. The crowning jewel on \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\" is without question the 6+minute epic tribute to Metallica's Cliff Burton \\"In My Darkest Hour\\". The song starts off with a nice blend of accoustic strings and electric chords, and then moments later some great catchy chugging riffs come in, and I like when the song garners up some speed around the 3:38 mark and so forth. Track seven \\"Liar\\" is a hilarious yet thrashy headbanging number which is an attack on former Megadeth guitarist Chirs Poland, who Dave accused of selling the band's equipment (especially guitars) for funding towards his buying of drugs. Finally we have the closing track \\"Hook in Mouth\\" which lyrically is an all out attack on the PMRC and music censorship in the United States. It also contains references to George Orwell's novel, Ninteen Eighty-Four. The guitar riffs, the solos, the drums, and especially that F-R-E-E-D-O-M chorus is just excellent and catchy, and of course one of the lines from The Star Spangled Banner is used in the chorus as well.<br /><br />Here's the song list and the ratings:<br /><br />1. Into the Lungs of Hell (Instrumental) (3:29) - 5/5<br />2. Set the World Afire (5:48) - 5/5<br />3. Anarchy in the U.K. (3:00) - 4/5<br />4. Mary Jane (4:25) - 5/5<br />5. 502 (3:28) - 5/5<br />6. In My Darkest Hour (6:16) - 10/5 Best Song<br />7. Liar (3:20) - 5/5<br />8. Hook In Mouth (4:43) - 5/5<br /><br />I didn't bother rating the bonus tracks, since I have the original version of this album, you know the one without the bonus tracks. So anyways if you're a fan of Megadeth, metal, thrash/speed metal, or if you're just a fan of good music in general, then by all means you must own this underrated classic. HAIL MEGADETH!!s Angeles police traffic code for impaired driving, for which Dave would be arrested in 1989.

B00008438V|5.0|Like most of the reviews that I've read, this one an instant classic starring Ilan Mitchell-Smith as Wyatt O'Donnelly and Anthony Michael Hall as Gary Wallace.  The show starts off as Gary and Wyatt who want nothing more than to be accepted by their peers and wanting to end their dateless social lives.  Gary sleeps over at Wyatt's house, while his parents are away meeting their daughter's fiancee'.  He suggests to Wyatt that they make a woman as a solution to help them be more popular and to have a few dates with.  After a few twists and turns from Wyatt's computer, the woman is made and lures Gary and Wyatt into things they really don't want to do like going to the bar or throwing a HUGE party that are against their wishes.  Although Lisa is pretty cunning, she does have her good side like getting even with Chet who is turned into a turd.  All in all, a GREAT, CLASSIC movie for one who wants to laugh or who is in a \\"weird\\" mood.  Not to mention that Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Michael Anthony Hall are HOTTIES in this flick.  I mean WHO would want to turn away from these CUTIES?!  Also, this DVD would've been better if Ilan Mitchell-Smith and Anthony Michael Hall did a commentary, along with John Hughes as well as having deleted scenes.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|So much 'good' has already been said of this 2-DVD set, that I'm basically adding my 5* rating to counteract some of the 'ridiculous' low ratings given - complaints about menus & not having the entire series have nothing to do w/ rating the quality & enjoyment of the present package; indeed, I really like the presentation w/ dialogue by K.K. et al & snippets of basically the musical performances - excellent & enough for me!
0805079831|5.0|Klein is such a thorough and exacting researcher.  She turns over many stones in the history of Milton Friedman's Chicago School's international economic influence.  Many situations are those we are somewhat familiar with or at least suspect of, but there are some surprises that need to be known.  Naomi Klein is the one who tells the tales.  This should be mandatory reading for every citizen of the United States.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Don't let the title fool you. These are very CONstructive songs. From the moody \\"Dark Road\\" to the uplifting \\"Sing\\" to the mellow \\"Fingernail Moon,\\" this is an album created as a labor of love. Anyone, even the most nasty critic, can find something to love here.     If you've ever had the privilege to see Annie in concert -- I did three years ago, when she toured with Sting -- you'll know that she's as talented in person as on CD. The lady can also dance with the best of them.    In the liner notes, Lennox talks about seeing Nelson Mandela standing in front of his former prison cell and talking about the AIDS pandemic in Africa. With a star-studded choir that includes Bonnie Raitt, Madonna, Anastasia, Sarah MacLachlan, Fergie, Gladys Knight, Pink, Melissa Etheridge and many more, this song is sure to get you singing.    \\"Ghosts in My Machine\\" is guaranteed to get you moving, although her \\"yeah\\" at the end of some choruses sounds a bit too much alike. Never mind, it still gets you rocking.    Overall, this is just a very enjoyable addition to your collection.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Much better than the reviewers rated it. It was critisized for its writing, but I think the dialogue is superb, as long as you accept that ancient Greeks didn't speak like Southern Californians.<br /><br />And great battle scenes.<br /><br />Most importanlty, the acting brought out a lot of the personal drama in the story that Homer fails to impart to a modern mind. \\"He died. He fell. Darkness covered his eyes.\\" Instead you feel how the characters are trapped by the conflict and the tragedy and you actually empathize with them--something of an accomplishment for a film based on a well-worn myth.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|If you can imagine David Lynch making an 8 hour home movie to test out a cheap digital camera, then you've pretty much got Inland Empire.  Really really long and rambling, without any of the sureal beauty of his other movies (many of which are fantastic).  Fan or not, give this one a pass.
B00005JPFH|4.0|You know what's really mind boggling are the dissective over-needling reviews I constantly read concerning hero movies and animation movies. It's like they are expecting the superhero action to actually fit the frames of real life as we know it. (laugh) Well, if they did that, there would certainly be no men swinging from webs born from the wrists or men flying in from Krypton.<br />Personally I feel a little slighted when superhero flicks take themselves too seriously. Unless we filter in the topical criminal mind, and what makes him tick, we need not bother with the plot at all.<br />OK, so they did that in the previous two flicks, and chose not to follow in the same avenue of what makes a \\"criminal tick\\" in this one, focusing more on the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane, which was fine with me. I don't view the superhero cartoons, or even Bugs Bunny with a yearning to find the origin of Yosemite Sam, and what's irking him. I simply accept his formidible non-compliance in dealing with his adversary.<br />Same with the multi villain plot here. Although we do get casual glimps of the villains \\"beefs\\", this movie does not dwell on them, and I accept that wholeheartedly. I spent enough time with Doc Ock's woes in the previous film, and I'm glad they chose to make this one more nonsense, as well as fun. I actually laughed more during this Spiderman, than the other ones, who took their subject matter very seriously. OH, WELL. . .it's still based on a \\"comic book\\"! HELLO!<br />One last note (no pun intended), I did not like the music video by Snow Patrol, and thought the movie ended on a solemn depressing exit for a dynamic series that has nothing to apologize for.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Gonna keep it short and sweet. If you are like myself, a fan of Systom Of A Down from the old days, but find most of their recent stuff unbearable because of daron's terrible vocals, then read on.   onto my review. Buy it! seriously! don't be put of off by SOAD recent releases. Serj's voice has always appealled to me and with this release he doesn't dissapoint. Each song lyrically is ofcourse very clever. Serj manages to politically rant through each song and whether you care what he is singing about or not (you should!) he has created an anthem based album. Every song is either a chop suey or toxicity. Maybe not quite as \\"metal\\", but easily was more eccentric and VERY catchy. With after 1 or two listens  you will find most songs sticking in you head and refusing to go away. Ofcourse it's missing Daron's guitar sound (the one thing he does get right) which is a shame, but either way it does rock pretty hard. Looking forward to Album 2!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We saw the show on PBS and just had to send for the DVD. It's an absolute delight and we loved it. My husband is english and I am german, and this type of music, combined with the flavor of ancient days, is right up our alley. Especially when it is so well done.
B00068CVJ4|4.0|Relationship of Command was the last album by At the Drive-In before they split up, the singer and a guitarist leaving to form The Mars Volta, the bassist, drummer, and other guitarist creating Sparta.  You can definitely see elements of both bands in Drive-In, although they're closer to Sparta in general sound.  Drive-In is like a combination of both bands that has the best parts of neither.  They don't have the more accessible catchiness of Sparta or eccentric creativity of Volta.  It doesn't mean they're worse than either though, just different.  They have a similar punk rock vibe, with more chaos and creativity in place of choruses and standard progression.  The singer is definitely better than Sparta's, although he's more prone to just shouting.  They're a loud, aggressive band, with a penchant for lyrics that don't make a lot of sense.  It can sound a little too much like the average modern punk band, but they have enough flourishes and good ideas to elevate them.    \\"Arcarsenal\\" gets things going with a flurry of drums and diddling guitar that explode into the song proper.  \\"Pattern Against User\\" is a solid rock song with a pleasant interlude stuffed in the middle.  \\"One Armed Scissor\\" is probably the most radio-friendly long song the album, which could explain why it was on the radio.  \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" is the longest track, and is pretty good, with spoken verses over nice guitars and a catchy chorus.  \\"Enfilade\\" starts with a creepy phone call and is one of the more out-there songs, with warbled vocals and a unique sounding refrain.  \\"Quarantined\\" is another good track with a stately pace and many enjoyable elements.  \\"Non-Zero Possibility\\" is the mellowest song and does some nice things, and is followed by two bonus tracks that keep bringing the off-kilter, loud sound they've been making the whole way through.  I'm not as into this kind of thing as I used to be, but it's still a very enjoyable album thanks to its less common elements.
6305922756|5.0|I also love rock music, and all the associated trappings.  There's not a genre of rock-n-roll that doesn't have SOMETHING that appeals to me.    I love satire.  I love cleverly done satire.  Satire generally requires more creativity than simple parody (Weird Al being the exception, of course).  I realize that many people use the words \\"satire\\" and \\"parody\\" synonymously, but they are two different things.    Now, combine those two things I love (rock and satire), do it well, and you have one of the best-performed, dry-humored, and dead-on comedies ever made!  And that's really the only way I can think of to describe this movie.      Why did I title my review \\"There oughta be a law...?\\"  Because I've often said that there ought to be a law in place requiring that every rock group watch this movie...just so they can see how utterly self-important and ridiculous they sound when they take themselves too seriously.  Maybe if they see this film, their sides will split open from laughter, and their oversized egos will deflate.    On Amazon's scale of 1 to 5, I give \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" an 11.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|this entire album is just epic , start to finish , its an emotional rollercoaster of musical bliss and although less angst then 3 cheers it wont dissapoint
B00005MM01|5.0|Reviewing a musical recording so many years after its initial release is a trip in itself.  You have the benefit of some acquired wisdom, perhaps clearer insight into things in general, and you aslo have had time to see if you STILL like the recording.  With regard to Donovan's GIFT....cd I can say I like it more today than I did years ago and I liked it a lot back then as well.  But I have been a Donovan fan since SUNNY GOODGE STREET and COLOURS and CATCH THE WIND....    This CD is so much a concept album as is SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND and BEGGAR'S BANQUET.  We all know the album was meant to be a homage to the Maharesh Yogi of Beatles fame.  Be that as it may, I am not here to argue for or against Transcendental Meditation.  However, I am here to say this album leaves me with a feeling of tranquility that is so much more satisfying than valium can ever be.    The songs all seem to celebrate the little things of life.  The everyday things we do as part of our ritual of life:  drinking tea with a friend; holding an infant in our arms; watching a child play in the sand at the beach.  There are songs about the value of love in our life (WEAR YOUR LOVE LIKE HEAVEN, the one true hit from the release.) or (THERE WAS A TIME).      Another thing I like about this record is that Donovan chose 4 or 5 musicians (bass, drums, organ and some laid back electric guitar) to back up his voice and his acoustic.  The level of the musicianship is tasteful and elegant.  I especially like the melodic, though understated, organ work.  And what's more, Donovan uses these players on almost every song giving the feeling of a true band ambience.    So, the next time you kick back at home on a cool Autumn day with the wind blowing blustery and quick and the silver lined clouds begin to dance in a azure-gold and lavender sky...put Donovan's GIFT cd into the disc player and celebrate the little things...and I would hope that not only Baby Boomers do so....we all could use a little\\"GIFT FROM A FLOWER......\\"  peace  Vince Lucie
B000Y179KO|5.0|Britney Spears fans are livid that the Eagles are number ONE on the charts, but lets be honest here, who are the Eagles and who is Britney Spears. Britney Spears is a studio creation, there is no real talent there.  She cannot sing LIVE, for just one reason, SHE CAN'T SING!  Anything that gets fixed in the studio with a computer or with special effects in a video, It's NOT REAL!  Take off everything, and lets see what she can do.  The Eagles may be old, but who cares?! They are a respected legendary rock band who don't need to take off their clothes and act unproffessional to sell music. They have REAL talent. If they are number ONE, they've earned it.
1592332803|5.0|I've made at least a dozen recipes from this book so far and-- WOW! You don't have to be vegan to buy this book. You just have to enjoy delicious cookies, cakes, cobblers, brownies, pastries, and other sweets. And, honestly, who doesn't like dessert? Even if you're missing your sweet tooth, this book also contains recipes for other wonderful baked goods such as olive bread and biscuits. The recipes couldn't be simpler to follow. And the results are simply scrumptious!
B000002IVF|4.0|I was always a fan of CSNY but didn't really know anything about Crosby's solo work until this album was released back in 1993. To be honest, I mostly bought this album becuz the hit single \\"Hero\\" was all over the radio at the time and I am also a big fan of Phil Collins. So I knew i'd get at least one great song but I wasn't expecting too much for the rest of the album. Well I just gotta say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of work here and there really aren't any throwaways. The first half of the album has most of the best tracks but the second has a few gems as well.  \\"Hero\\" is the best track & as you'd expect has excellent harmonies by both Phil & David. Phil also provides solid drumming as always. But I also really enjoyed \\"Too Young to Die\\"(a duet with Graham Nash that's right up there with CSN's best work), \\"Old Soldier\\", \\"Through Your Hands\\", \\"Yvette in English\\" and \\"Natalie\\" are all exceptional as well.  All in all, a really good album with some really great songs that is definitely worth a listen.  Especially if you're a fan of CSNY.

0066620996|5.0|There are dozens of long, favorable reviews heaping praise on Jim Collins and team. Suffice it to say, this book offers useful insights and tangible concepts.   Equally important for the small business person, this offers a unique insight into the composition and attributes of successful companies.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|This war film contains precious little action. It's anti-war in the sense that the main character never gets to fire a shot (as Gulf War I is over so quickly) and so is left frustrated - and the viewer is left with this feeling too. We certainly get to experience the boredom and tension that came with the six months preparation for the war. Well made and well acted but not that entertaining.
B000001DQG|5.0|Ticking may be one of the best Elton John and Bernie Taupin compositions. You know what? I changed my mind, It is THE best composition by them.<br />Emotional, sad and beautiful.<br /><br />Caribou is an extremely musical album. An excellent sequence to boot, which in turn compliments the incredible musical diversity of each song.<br />Thouroughly enjoyable.<br />The Coffin Dragger has spoken.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Blade Runner.  The name alone conjures up an ambience, a palpable onscreen mood that many directors have attempted to replicate for 25 years now.  The film's monumental influence on the substance and style of science fiction is indisputable, with echoes of Ridley Scott's dark vision and interpretation of Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep\\" continuing to haunt a number of notable productions, most recently that of the \\"reimagined\\" Battlestar Galactica and the new Cylons who struggle with determining who they are and how to relate to their human creators.  The philosophical concept of what humanity is, both to humans and to the machines they've created in their own image, continues to be a theme that resonates.      This \\"Final Cut\\" of Blade Runner does not offer any new insights into that premise that the \\"Director's Cut\\" did not provide fifteen years ago.  There are some minor changes to dialogue and special effects that will continue to be debated by the fans, but by and large this is the Blade Runner that comes closest to Scott's true vision.    For the fans, the most important point of note is that the visual quality has been cleaned up and given the professional treatment that such an amazing film deserves [presumably, that is -- I write this after only having seen the \\"Final Cut\\" in the theater].  No more will we have to watch the wobbly and muddy straight-from-vhs transfer of the \\"Director's Cut\\" dvd and bemoan the fact that the movie was treated like an unwanted stepchild by all parties involved.  Perhaps with it's release Ridley and co. can finally let go of the film that caused so much bitterness and heartache during it's production and marketing.
0316067598|5.0|When I first heard about Marcus Luttrell's amazing fight with his SEAL team, I was skeptical.  Could a person really survive everything he said had happened?  By the end of the book, I was convinced that not only did he survive the attack in Afghanistan, but that he minimized the true devastation this event had on his life.  I cried...during the preface.  I was extremely interested in the tough tests to become a SEAL.  I cried when his teammates and friends died...their valiant efforts were amazing.  Now, having said that I cried, I highly recommend this book to young men...although there is some language, the indepth coverage into a SEALs life and the giving of the ultimate sacrifice is inspiring.
B000001ESP|5.0|I'm tired of people whining that \\"'Moving Pictures' is the end of the true Rush,\\" and \\"Sell outs!  Their last great album was 'Hemispheres.'\\"  As I said in another review, it's a classic example of what happens when a cult band gets big: All the hardcore, \\"original\\" fans get angry because \\"their band\\" is now enjoyed by the masses.    All Rush did on 'Moving Pictures' was take their approach to song crafting and improve upon it.  The music and lyrics are still fantastic, but the songs are shorter.  Geddy's singing is in a lower register, but you can still hear the depth and emotion that you'd find in the high-pitched cry of earlier songs.  Everything that made \\"early Rush\\" great is still there, it's just been slicked up with synthesizers and better production.    I mean seriously...The Beatles still had it even after the suits and ties of '64 gave way to \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  Who says Rush can't evolve and still be the same musicians we love?
B000UK73QO|5.0|This is such an excellent narrative by Eckhart that I find I have a hard time deciding which should be read first: The Power of Now or A New Earth.  I have the CD's of both.  The Power of Now is the only book (on cd or not) that I have read/listened to consecutively more than once.  For me, four times with the Power and I'm on my third with Earth.  My sister is listening to my copy of Now and I suggested to her that she will be as moved by Earth.  She says that, \\"I am not ready to give up the Power of Now - It means so much to me I can think of little else.\\"  This is much the same for me, though both are brilliant.  I wonder where such knowledge as Eckhart has, and so eloquently conveys, comes from.  I am constantly amazed that so much can be known so well by one person, particularly as young as he.  In short, life changing.

0793518326|5.0|The original scores are just something else. Other reviews alreadly stated about the small print; you can copy and enlarge it. Here you have all the Beatle songs in one hard copy volume. It's not too great for playing directly from it due to the fact that it doesn't balance too well on the piano sheet holder or on a music stand. But I still think it's a must for Beatle lovers.

0205313426|5.0|William Strunk's book is entertaining for the sheer audacity and confidence of his voice.  But the true gems in this book surface when you begin to apply his suggestions to the text of the suggestions themselves.  He follows his own rules to the point that his text is often self-illustrating.  Reading this way requires a high level of concentration but provides a level of entertainment rare in literature and unique among textbooks.<br /><br />My poor knowledge of sentence construction prevented me from making it through the first chapter for 14 years.  I finally sat down with a grammar book and looked up the terms I didn't know, such as \\"independent clause.\\"  After that it was such a joy that I read it through several times in succession.  Excluding the influence of my wife and years of practice, nothing has had a greater positive effect on my writing than this book.<br /><br />I read the \\"Third Edition\\" several times.  It includes a chapter by E.B. White on style which is well worth reading.  All editions prior to the fourth have been criticized as stereotyping women in traditional roles, which they do, but in 1935, that was simply part of the culture.  The fourth edition has been cleaned up so that women and men bear equal weight.  I did not notice any other changes in the text, but my Third Edition is 85 pages and the Fourth is 95.  Maybe they use a larger type face.

B000Y179KO|5.0|Commercially, the first Eagles studio album in 28 years was always going to be a winner.     Critically, though, it's a much harder test, in some ways an almost no-win situation. If the band had sounded just like they did in the '70s, they'd have pleased the fan base but been panned as has-beens by the critics; on the other hand, producing something radically different would have been equally hazardous.     As if following their own past catalogue wasn't a tough enough call, they also had to follow on from some superb solo albums, most notably from Don and Glenn. Though I'm die-hard Eagles fan since schooldays (Dad brought 'One of These Nights' back from the US in '75, and I went straight out and bought the other albums!), I'd have expected to be giving this four stars at best.     By the second listen, it had to be five stars. It's a tour de force - original, but consistent with what we expect from one of the greatest rock bands in history.     This album is evolutionary rather than revolutionary. It pays tribute to the legacy, but it also moves on, seamlessly and with great originality. For example, if the single 'How Long' sounds like Eagles, 70s-vintage, that's because it was written (by the great JD Souther) back in '72. A strong thread here has been taking the best of the guys' solo styles - for example, 'Busy Being Fabulous' would fit on any of Henley's solo albums - and then making the total into more than the sum of the parts.     This album surpasses my expectations, so much so that, in 2 discs' worth of music, it's very hard to find an even halfway disappointing track (if pushed, 'Guilty of the Crime' and 'It's Your World Now' are as near as I can get to a 'don't like this one' cut).     I know there are loads of reviews out there saying 'it's the Eagles, of course it's great', which perhaps doesn't help.     Honestly, though, forget the hype, buy it, judge it on its merits.     'Long Road Out of Eden' isn't flawless, of course, but this is a truly superbalbum, and an effortless five stars.

0307275639|5.0|Item was received on time, the condition of the book is in excellent condition. Tuesday with Morrie was riveting I highly recommend this book. Well thought and extremely expressive.
0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is a terrific tragic story.  Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue play their parts extraordinary.  A truly remarkable film.    Ban Sanderson (Cage) drinks.  He drinks a lot.  And after losing everything he heads to Vegas to drink himself to death.  Elisabeth Shue plays a prostitute who falls for him.  These two stories are quite disturbing, depressing, and tragic.    The only problem I had was the cheesy Vegas music.  It fits into the story, but it's really grating.  It could be because the musci was LOUD while the dialog was soft, but it really got on my nerves.    Other than the sound issue, there's not much to talk about the DVD.  It's the unrated edition.    Highly recommended.
B000I2J5UG|4.0|I'll start out by saying that as a self-proclaimed rock aficionado, I was surprised to see that The Black Parade received this type of deluxe treatment here in the United States.  Typically, this kind of packaging is done for the Japanese market and that's about it.  Having said that, I think the only reason that a person would buy this is if they are like me--bought The Black Parade standard release and became transfixed on it and borderline obesessed with it to the point that it's almost the only thing that they've listened to, day in and day out, for the past year.  At that point, owning the deluxe edition is a must.    I finally got my hands on a copy of The Black Parade deluxe box set just about a week ago.  The box is a luxurious black velvet (the only CD that I own where the packaging can be lint-rolled) and, like the album, there is no filler.  The 72-page booklet, full of essays and treatises on the music by all members of the band feed this person's obsession with not My Chemical Romance, but their alter egos, The Black Parade.  Stunning behind-the-scenes photographs, great writing, and, of course, all the lyrics.  The extra cards of artwork is great, too.      The only suggestions that I could make that would not improve, but intensify, this package would be to actually include the b-side that is written about in the booklet, \\"Kill All Your Friends.\\"  Plus at some point releasing the deluxe edition with all of the music videos.  The first 2 videos directed by Samuel Bayer are no less important than the songs themselves.  The videos are the songs and the songs are the videos.  They are necessary for each other.  Same goes for \\"I Don't Love You\\" and \\"Teenagers.\\"    In my book, there have only been a few classic albums put out in the first 10 years of the 21st Century; Brutal Planet, by Alice Cooper (2000), American Idiot, by Green Day (2004), and The Black Parade (2006).  In an age where most albums that are released will more than likely be forgotten in the decades to come and be destined for oblivion and discount cut-out bins, the above albums that I have mentioned are ones that will surely be re-discovered by subsuquent generations of rock fans, much like 4 generations of young rockers have unearthed Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, there will always be some kid who finds their parents' archaic CD's of a dust-covered velvet box that is simply labeled THE BLACK PARADE.  I will be interested to see how history regards this album.    We will carry on.    Brett Cooper  Anchorage, Alaska
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  He has made some of the best movies in history.  This, obviously, doesn't disappoint.  Although a little dated (rotary phone, TV), it's still a wonderful movie, full of great performances and issues still affecting us to this day.    Jack Lemmon plays Bud Baster, an unlucky pushover who rents his apartment out to his bosses for their extramarrital affairs.  All this while trying to woo the elevator girl (Shirley MacLaine).  Problems arise when he allows the Big Boss to use his apartment and his mistress is the elevator girl.  So Lemmon has to choose between his job and his love.    The DVD is shown in it's original aspect ratio of 2.35.1 and that's probably the best thing I can say about this DVD.    Must See, though.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|A great soundtrack to a very cool movie.  Very original songwriting, reminds me of the late great Elliott Smith, or even the melancholy ballads of Leonard Cohen.  This indie soundtrack reminds of the music from the recent independent film \\"Time and Tide\\" directed by Michael Carvaines.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|In the interests of full disclosure, I have actually seen the show LOVE at the Mirage in Vegas.  It is a phenomenal production and I highly recommend it.  One amazing part was the sound.  The opening of the show has you in complete darkness, just listening to \\"Because.\\"  Just the vocals...no music.  It gives me chills now just remembering it.    When this CD/DVD combo came out, I had to have it...because it is the best way to try to reproduce the experience of the show.  Try this if you're listening for the first time.  But the DVD on your surround sound, tuned to 5.1.  Turn off all the lights and turn it on fairly loud.  Not ear crunching loud, but a nice pleasing loudness.  Then sit back and enjoy the first three minutes or so.  The rendition of \\"Because\\" which flows into \\"Get Back\\" will make you rediscover the Beatles.  It's not quite a religious experience...but it gets pretty close.    In reality, what you are getting is a hodge-podge of Beatles songs, some incomplete and some in unfamiliar versions...all remastered brilliantly.  That is kinda fun but it is not in and of itself indispensible.      I've never listened to just the CD, except in my car with its poor speakers.  That is okay...but truthfully, the truly compelling reason to own this set is to enjoy the surround sound DVD.  It is mind-blowing!!    I hope I've convinced you.  I wish like heck the set had come with even some DVD images of just a few clips from the Cirque du Soleil show itself, or something like that...but Cirque is pretty careful about keeping its images controlled.  If you go to their website, you can catch a few brief videos of the show.  If you ever have the chance to see the show...grab it.  It's not cheap...but it's unforgettable for the Beatles fan.    Meanwhile, this DVD/CD set is pretty darn good!  Check it out!!!
0739356135|5.0|Needed an easy to listen to book on CD for a 24 hour trip.  Book surpassed every expectation and kept me entertained from start to finish. Overall an excellent narrator along with a funny action packed story made it a great book on tape
B00003CWL5|5.0|American Beauty is perhaps the finest assembled film EVER!  It has the rare combination of a perfectly written script, perfect direction, a cast whose acting blends so well together that you truly forget you are watching a movie, rather you feel like you are looking through a window in your neighborhood and watching the lives of others.  When this is all combined with unbelievable lighting and a score that is magical, dream like, and just perfect for the story, well, I must admit, I can not think of a better movie.  This movie is a triumph of film making, as I stated, every role, cast and crew, was filled perfectly.  Starting with a story that Alan Ball wrote, he brought the world the perfect mix of drama, dark humor, irony, depression, and at times, a feeling of triumph.  The story has, hands down, the best character development ever.  As a viewer I truly feel for the characters in this film, and actually can relate to what many of them are going through.  Whether it brought up memories of high school, both good and bad, or feelings of my own current existence as one of the billions on this  planet who is not necessarily content with career choices, or just life choices in general, I can relate.  The musical score, when mixed with repetitive cinematography, such as when Mena Suvari goes to touch Spacey's shoulder in the kitchen, which is replayed three times, it is perfect.  Everything about this movie is perfect, there has never been such a well made movie before, and as I continue to watch the mindless drivel Hollywood loves to throw at us, I can firmly say, there has not been such a well made movie since.  I offer my most sincere thanks to Allan Ball, Sam Mendes, the entire cast and crew of American Beauty for blessing us with the truly perfect example of just how well film translates as a true art form.  If you have never seen this movie, buy it now, and give it time to sink in, it took me a couple viewings before it really set in for me, and now, I simply cannot say enough good about it.  This movie is an experience, every single time I watch it, and it just keeps getting better with each viewing.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|Pros: Loads of action, fluid animation, the bikes, the storyline, and the totally 1980s attitude.<br /><br />Cons: The creepy little kids, Kai and Yamagata needs a bigger part, the two main characters (Kaneda and Tetsuo) always yelling at each other names(hence my title), and the movie seems too short.
0446677450|2.0|Although undoubtedly his techniques worked well for the author, I am more inclined to think his inate talents/abilities played a bigger part than the author might admit - I am skeptical that his teachings are going to work for the masses.  Mainly I believe one has to start out with something in order to develop it into something more - otherwise it is an uphill battle that few can endure.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I hate to say it, but this is Britney's WORST album.  The lyrics are horrible, with no significant messages at all.  I've heard several of her other albums, and they had great lyrics and musical notation.  The beats are off and the songs don't flow AT ALL.  It's very possible that the producer and Britney were both on nerve medication, which distorted their perception of what IS good.  I bought this because so many people were giving rave reviews, even on Rolling Stones.  I'm sick.  I paid $15 for this piece of plastic.  The only good thing out of that CD was the sample of her new fragrance.  I already sold the CD on e-bay.      DON'T BUY IT!!

B00005221M|5.0|Great movie! Soundtrack astounding and passionate! Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis! Virginian mountatins scenes are fantastic with the fog rolling in. Annoyed that some of the best dialogues are cut from this and they called it a Directors Expanded Edition.... Hey! It should be expanded and not deleted! ArgggH!
B000UBMWG4|3.0|Like a previous reviewer noted, only having the \\"final cut\\" in 1080p is a bit disappointing.  Who cares if the original, international, and director's cut are included if they are in SD?  Well, it's still good, but just disappointing that they could not at least have the original cut in HD.  Guess we'll have to wait for the next special edition for that.  That said, I recently saw the \\"final cut\\" on the big screen in NY and it is very impressive.  Looks and sounds incredible.

068987751X|4.0|The pop-up version is good, but the original, lift-the-flap version is better, in my opinion.  Dear Zoo is one of the best read-aloud stories I've come across.  As a children's librarian, when I'm running around at the last minute looking for storytime books, I can always grab Dear Zoo.  No matter what age group I've got, no matter how many times they've already heard the story, they always love Dear Zoo.
0780628551|2.0|THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE is quite polished and well made.  However, it fails to interest, excite or satisfy for a number of reasons.    First, it is a blatant update of a classic thriller, ROSEMARY'S BABY, so lacks any sort of suspense.  We know where the plot is going. Second, we only have one scene with Depp's character before his outer space experience, so are unable to notice the subtle changes that occur after this event; therefore, we are unable to be drawn into the film's premise and the heroine's predicament. This is the fault of the screenplay.  Third, the title - this has to be one of the weakest titles ever to come out of Hollywood, a title that promises nothing interesting and at least does deliver in that one aspect.  ENEMY WITHIN, LOST ENCOUNTER, ALIEN HUSBAND - yes, terrible all, but better than the bland THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE.    The cinematography is impressive - dark but well lit.  The editing effects are top notch.  The musical score is properly menacing and edgy.  Theron seems to be on medication through much of her performance - there is no registration of apprehension, processing of the pieces that don't fit, fear, mistrust, and ultimate terror.  If we didn't know that this was going the way of ROSEMARY'S BABY, and with our knowledge of her character's breakdown and hallucinations at her recent parents' deaths, we'd wonder if this was really happening to her or whether she was imaginging it - this could have made a similar film subject edgier.    Depp plays a villain - a suave villain.  He is given light brown hair with blonde highlights, he adopts a good old boy Texas accent and is properly solicitous and controlling in the role of the possessed husband. His character is written and directed one dimensionally, so he is not really allowed to shine. The script is slanted toward Theron's character as the lead with Depp in strong support, rather than co-lead.    One must applaud the brief supporting performance of the ever wonderful Donna Murphy (two time Tony winner) as the other wife.  She is vivid and unforgettable.  When she is on screen with Theron, you can't watch Theron. You're riveted on Murphy-she commands the screen.    To sum up the film, it's beautiful to look at, but unremarkable, uninteresting and tepid.  Not a bad film, just an okay film.
1582701709|1.0|and believe that every movie it puts out is true, then this is the book for you!  From Dumbo's magic feather to Jiminy Cricket's wishing star, the \\"science\\" behind \\"the secret\\" is the same.  Just hope for something hard enough and it will be yours.  If only controlling the universe were that easy, then every cancer patient would be cured, every mother's child would grow up handsome and smart, and the world would be populated solely by billionaires.  Why is this not happening?  According to the author's dictates it has nothing to do with economics, biology or governments, we are all just not WANTING it enough!        This is the perfect book to soothe the egotist's soul, to make him (or her) feel that he really does have power over the universe just like he imagined when he was a child.  To consider that one person's thoughts have enough power to overcome the thoughts of everyone else on the planet  in order to fulfill one's wishes is not only egocentric but irrational.        I hope that there are no battered women out there who are using these principles to get out of an abusive relationship, or a terminally underemployed individual wishing herself into a better job.  In these cases, and many others, \\"the secret\\" is not only foolish, but continues a cycle of pain or failure that can only be overcome by action and hard, sweaty work.     As a wise woman once told me \\"The harder I work, the luckier I get\\".
0345479092|3.0|This book had some good tips for maybe first time parents. However, I have twins and I can tell quite obviously that the author never did. I would not recommend the twin advice, it will have you doing nothing but caring for your multiples all day and night on a staggered schedule. BAD IDEA, I would do the opposite and do everything at the same time. Anyway, It does give good general info for people who don't know much about babies. But I sold my copy on Ebay b/c I have no desire to use it for my next baby. A lot of things in it just weren't practical with my twins.
B000VSBX34|5.0|If you're a Beatles collector, you should buy the deluxe version no question. It's been designed with so much class and attention to detail rarely seen in \\"Special Editions\\". It is a bit pricey but so was \\"Anthology\\" and we all ran out and paid for the book and the Video's and then the DVD's a couple of years later. The Help! book and Dick Lester's script come wrapped in special Beatles logo paper sealed with a Help! sticker. It was like unwrapping a present. There is also a poster and \\"mini\\" lobby cards also included. The 2 disc set includes the movie Letterboxed for the first time. The new sountrack mix is phenominal. If you have 5:1 surround you will be stunned at the beauty of the mixes. It's a sampling of the entire Beatles catalog that will be released in 5:1 hopefully next year. The second disc has some never before seen material as well. The only problem is it's not to convienient to get to the DVD's. The deluxe package is \\"big\\" and not easily manupulated. I guess I'll buy the regular set to solve that problem.
0316236535|5.0|Hands down, one of the best storytime books ever...Go Away, Big Green Monster will have your children screaming \\"Go away!\\" with every page, then yelling \\"Come back!\\" at the end.  Be prepared to read this one over and over and over...best for ages 2-7.
0743298020|5.0|I am not sure why I bought the book other than the fact that the hard cover was printed up sidedown. But I am so glad I did! The characters are both strange and interesting. I could not decide if I liked Miss. Winter or not. The twists and turns the story takes kept pulling me back for more. I felt like I was there witnessing it all, a little like seeing an accident and you can't look away. I even tryed to put it down a couple of times. But I could not stay away,I HAD to see how it ended, and I was not disapointed! I look forward to more stories by Miss. Setterfield.
0743535308|5.0|As a huge fan of David Allen's previous book/philosophy, \\"Getting Things Done,\\" I was already ready for this \\"black-belt\\" CD class and now I'm on my third listen-through during daily commutes.     If you didn't appreciate the initial GTD, then you shouldn't start here anymore than a karate student should start with black belt classes. You should already be reasonably familiar with the GTD process of: In-basket, Process, Organize, Review, and Do - because this new work is all about the subtleties and implications of these steps. Wait until you are a bit experienced in GTD and either feel like you're missing something or want more depth and nuance before starting this new book/CD, or you will not appreciate nor benefit from these great insites and expositions on living a productive life as an imperfect human.    As a real black belt in a traditional Japanese martial art, I appreciate the links Mr. Allen makes between karate forms and organization, and again between real-world fights and dealing with real-life emergencies. You can't be truly creative or take advantage of spontaneous opportunities if you're not practicing staying on top of your commitments and tasks with a good system in place that you trust.    So - start with \\"Getting Things Done\\" to learn all the forms. Then get \\"Ready for Anything\\" to continue improving at the black belt level.    My highest recommendation, if you're ready for it.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|We all struggle at some point in our lifes. This movie is based on the true story of Chris Gardner, a salesman, that went from selling medical scanners to being a stock broker for Dean Witter. That of course is not the amazing part of the story. The true test he endured was managing to raise a son while he was flat broke and chasing down his stolen scanners. Will Smith gives a dramatic performance that will not easily be bested by others that have done them so well. He obviously reached down deep to pull up a true understanding of suffering as a poor father that would give anything to provide for his family. Thandie Newton turns in a wonderful performance as his wife and Janden Smith does a fine job as his son. This movie takes us along with a father from the brink of disaster to the heights of joy and happiness. Keep the Kleenex handy. Good quality DVD with a few standard extras.
B000GY729M|5.0|Well, I got this CD after much deliberation. I had heard many people saying that it was completely different from The Killers first shot, and not in a good way. Well, I listened to it and was disappointed. I really wanted to like it, but it was too different. Since I wanted to love it like I love The Killers, I checked it out again and found myself singing along with some of the tracks. Then again I listened and I kept thinking \\"Wow, this is really well done!\\" Well, after listening to it quite a few times, I am starting to like it more than Hot Fuss. I really can't wait to see what these musicians have in store for us next.
0743486285|5.0|This book is interesting book and definately hard to put down.  If you were ever into Motley Crue you will enjoy what was really going on that you didn't get to hear about before the internet.  Nikki Sixx has made great improvements and this book will help the addicted.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|I bought this album after hearing D.A.N.C.E. and while the rest of the album doesn't sound exactly like that one tune (which I didn't expect it to) it's still just as catchy, dance-y, and enjoyable. A lot of the album is mostly sans vocals but it is still full of hooks and definitely warrants repeated listenings. Definitely a fun one.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Great tunes, great singing (beautiful harmonizing)... Great, tasteful playing.  And outselling Britney by more than 2 to 1.  Wow, people over 15 years of age like music too!  Perhaps the older music-loving public will no longer be ignored by the business... GO EAGLES! A strong, mature addition to their illustrious catalog.
B0009LNRLE|5.0|As a music-making mode, \\"psychedelic\\" music is something of a highwire act. The music's perilous disdain for rigour and structure lends it a haphazard predilection for earnestly vacuous displays of directionless squawks and jangles.<br /><br />Yet emerging from the radicalist commune movement of 1960s Munich, Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II injected their anarchic leanings with a force that drove the green fuse through the flower (power) of the \\"jam band\\" archetype. After the fitful brilliance of their debut Phallus Dei, Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II's efforts came to fruition with this epic 1970 masterpiece.<br /><br />The fecund ground laid by Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II with Yeti continue to be plowed by admirable acts like Animal Collective and their wonderfully addled ilk, but this superlative opus remains one of the essential records of this, or any other, genre.
B000TGGJKK|5.0|This was my first HD DVD purchase along with my Toshiba HD-A35 and the first film I chose to watch after hearing wonderful things about it. I enjoyed the theatrical version, but this DC version is FAR better. Lots of added scenes...action, blood, and some offensive (but realistic) scenarios.  The TrueHD sound is magnificent even though I'm using 5.1 analog inputs with an older receiver. It's still better than anything I've heard on any standard DVD and that's all that really matters to me.     The video transfer is stunning...I never thought night scenes over the ocean could look so sharp in 1080p. Oh, and Helen of Troy (Sparta, whatever) looks absolutely gorgeous...oh my my my...her in HD is almost worth the purchase alone. Hey, girls will likely go gaga over Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana in HD, so why can't the boys have something to look forward to? :) Having watch a few other HD DVDs since (300, Bourne, MI3, Fearless), I can say that Troy is a standout in regards to video and audio. I very highly recommend this title. It's a keeper and definitely reference material.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|While it is clear that Britney herself was only a small portion of the making of this CD, the beats, lyrics, and general tone are just what I'd expect from a Britney album - fun, light, and very catchy.<br /><br />You can hear that Britney's voice has been played with in the studio - it sounds like she came in, did a bit of singing, and left them to perfect the sound. But even with that, the album is a lot of fun to listen to and one that I have been enjoying a lot. I love dance beats and songs that make me want to sing along and move, and this CD is great on both of those.<br /><br />The best song is easily Gimme More, but the rest are all pretty good as well. Not a whole lot of character, but the songs are all catchy and there aren't any real losers in the bunch, which is more than I can say about most CDs I have bought!<br /><br />If you are a Britney fan, go ahead and get this latest from her - it isn't as good as B in the Mix or her other top CDs, but it will stick to your player for a good long time!<br /><br />Two months later: I wanted to add that this CD really has staying power. Most of the songs have really grown on me, and I have found that when I want to listen to something catchy and dancy, which is most days, I reach for this CD over other ones - even mix CD's of my own making! There is only one song I consistently skip past (track six) and the rest are pretty darn good. I have gotten most of the songs on the CD stuck in my head over the past months, and listened to it over sixty times, and I am still not tired of it. So overall I'd say this is a no-brainer purchase for those who like a fun dance beat.
B000W1V44I|3.0|The Backstreet Boys, in my opinion, with their last album, \\"Never Gone\\", stepped outside of the \\"Boy Band\\" category once and for all.  But now, with \\"Unbreakable\\", they're WAY out of there.  This album is sophisticated, melodic, experimental, and I won't say groundbreaking, but not too many quartet's have put together this kind of music before.<br /><br />One of the benefits (or downsides, depending how you look at it), is that very few of the songs on the album are straightforward pop.  They make very few attempts to make a radio friendly song, which is refreshing.  The few attempts that they do make on this album, they fail.  The flow of this album was creativity and sending them off in a new direction.  Not creating a forced pop sound, so they can get a few cheap pops on radio.<br /><br />I like the new direction.  However, one noticeable difference, is the tone of Nick's voice.  He almost completely stopped singing through the nose, and his voice sounds A LOT different.  Better, but not the voice the world has grown to know.  AJ's voice also sounds a lot different, but not an upgrade.  Seems like he lost some of the energy/passion that he's put into songs in the past.<br /><br />All in all, good album, but I can easily understand 1 or 2 star reviews, because this album IS a lot different than what I expected.

0060090367|4.0|I chose this book based on a Listmania, and really enjoyed reading Keyes' book. The book is a little over-descriptive at times, but has a good story to follow. This is the first of 4 books about this family, and I am currently on the second. I ordered them all after reading this one. Claire, the main character, has a hard time dealing with her loser husband leaving her. There is a lot of driking in the book (Oddly enough it takes place in Ireland), and a lot of conflict between all of the characters. However, this is very similar to how this would all play out in real life...This is a good story of really rough times, but that makes you want to follow it.

B000V9KFLY|5.0|This is just an amazing gift an artist could give. The songs are amazing and just so greatly sung. From the powerful Oh Holly Night, to the softest Another Year Has Gone By, all the songs tell a story and magically takes to that amazing place where Xmas has always a perfect or blue felling.  Her voice is just at that perfect point, and now we get to see and listen at the same time. This network special is just one of the best, she looks amazing as always, and features 2 great artists the amazing tenor Andrea Bocelli and the actress/ entertainer/ singer-to-be Rosie O'Donnel...  Celine's flawless and it is certainly an amazing item to your music library or to your collection!!!  An edition to buy for sure!!!
B000Y44LBG|3.0|Harlem thug Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) wants very much to be Somebody, and his ticket to the top is heroin, imported from Vietnam  with the help of the military there and a large contingent of dirty cops here.  Frank is alternately urbane and vicious, a businessman and a killer.  Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a street-wise cop who makes it his business to track down the man who's running this drug racket.<br /><br />This was the longest 157 minutes I've ever spent in a movie theatre.  One of the problems with this film was that neither the hero (Richie) nor the villain (Frank) was a sympathetic character and I didn't care how it ended (although the epilogue shocked me).  Gum-chomping Richie admits he's not a fit father and has no qualms about roughing people up in the line of duty.  Frank is a slick, soulless fiend with no regard for human life.  To say this movie is violent would be an understatement, but after watching so much depravity and cruelty, one becomes jaded and I stopped caring altogether.<br /><br />The biggest weakness was that the two stars share the screen for a only few minutes.  I was waiting and waiting to see these acting titans play off each other, and when it finally happened, it was disappointing.  Washington definitely out-acts Crowe in a flashier role, and for his memorable performance, I gave the movie three stars.  Very much a guy-film.

B000P7V45S|5.0|The mix is different here. Does that make it good or bad ? Guess it depends on your point of view. I'll keep the one from '94 , AND this one. Great for back to back listens. \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" is classic Genesis after all is said and done. You be your own judge. The MUSIC is what stands all these years later. Although I'm partial to the Gabriel-era , this record is IMHO , the single best Genesis record note for note.
B0001US8EO|4.0|A long movie that takes awhile to pick up steam, particularly since it serves as a virtual biography of Wyatt from his youth to the aftermath of Tombstone. Costner plays a very pensive and hard character sharply in contrast to Kurt Russell's version, which may be why Costner needed to show Earp's loss of his young wife. But once the film evolves after showing Wyatt's difficulties and steps up into the mature portion of his life, the film becomes very interesting particularly when he meets the Masterson brothers. The movie is pretty accurate in historic detail such as the death of Ed Masterson with Wyatt moving on to other towns with emphasis of course on Tombstone. The heavy part of this Wyatt version is his domination over his brothers, which seems less likely as his older brother Virgil was already in the southwest New Mexico or Arizona area before and they were all interested in the mining boom town potential of Tombstone. Costner's character is pretty sublime and not too dimensional; however, historians describe the real Earp as a true quiet, strong, no nonsense type that was action oriented with a unique ability to talk people out of causing trouble in a direct style or he would use the buffalo technique with his pistol rather than shooting at first opportunity. The cast is very good, the action not as dynamic as the movie Tombstone but realistic. Dennis Quaid does a fantastic job as Doc Holiday, not as memorable as Val Kilmer's in Tombstone, but very well done. Between the two films, Tombstone and Costner's, Costner's Earp is very believable as a driven man who without much emotion stands up at the end in his revenge drive to kill the responsible cowboys that murdered his brother Morgan and crippled his brother Virgil in an ambush. The strongest part of the film of course occurs at the end of the Tombstone saga when the Earps confront their enemies directly near the back lot of the OK corral and when Wyatt goes on his revenge raid after the cowardly shooting of his brothers. This is where Costner's Earp is very believable as he methodical goes after the killers. I recommend seeing both, Tombstone first than Wyatt Earp, they are both worth seeing and an interesting contrast. Just prepare yourself for the three hour plus time of Costner's. Editting wouldhave enhanced the film but after seeing it through, it will go down as being a superior film. I have recently visited Tombstone and it is truly a wonderful place to visit with many historic buildings and a well preserved section of the town. Best to go in the third week of October during Helldarado  days when western re-enactors invest the town in authentic period regalia.f his brothers.

B000Y179KO|4.0|So far all the reviews online I've read were negatively mixed. But since the Eagles were in my blood even before I was born I decided to brave the walmart harridans and buy the CD...I had already fallen in love with the first single so that's one good track. So track by track...<br /><br />Disc 1<br />1. No More Walks In The Wood 2. How Long 3. Busy Being Fabulous 4. What Do I Do With My Heart 5. Guilty Of The Crime 6. I Don't Want To Hear Any More 7. Waiting In The Weeds 8. No More Cloudy Days 9. Fast Company 10. Do Something 11. You Are Not Alone<br /><br />1. No more...good lord are we back in the sixties, felt like I was in a Frost poem, but still pleasing to the ear.<br /><br />2. Mucho love for \\"how long\\"...so catchy so like the old Eagles yet fused with newness, of course it could be b/c we haven't had a new Eagles except for \\"Hole in the world\\" for 20 odd years.<br /><br />3. I love the \\"fabulous\\" nature of this tune. I get it and I love it.<br /><br />4. It's not my heart I want to do anything with...I want to smash my head in the wall. It's pretty but so not the \\"Eagles\\" I loved growing up. Very quiet, you can tell it's 50 year old men behind the music, they're jaded despite having been in \\"eden\\" so long.<br /><br />5. Supposedly this was a \\"lively tune\\" according to some review...I so did not like it, it was too techno and too 80's if that makes sense...you can soooo tell Joe Walsh is singing in the band now.  They did not do this remake justice whatsoever.<br /><br />6. Lyrically it's very pretty but god it's also why they don't sing tenor on albums like this...Henley, Fry, and even Walsh is a yes in some respects but good god not the other guy.<br /><br />7. This is maybe one the best tracks, god do I love Henley's voice. I like the lyrics, the vocals, and plus it has enough beauty it counteracts the bitterness.<br /><br />8. It's very folk-y just like the rest of the cd, it's very mixed with blues and rock...I haven't decided yet.<br /><br />9. Yuck. That's all there is. It's so old and out dated. It's like I threw up an 80's remix that went sour.<br /><br />10. Another male jaded song...I do like it however. Even though their lives have been happy, all they seem to sing about is sadness. Bitter love is a hard pill to swallow, as is the song.<br /><br />11. OOOOH I like this song. It makes me relax, it's very folk, very pretty. Lyrics while predictable are very pretty. It seems this CD is most def not the fast paced rock and roll we're used too...you can tell it's been 28 years and they've moved on and gotten older as have their fans....so if you like mellow folk/rock/country/blues this is one for you...at least the first disc is.<br /><br />1. This is a VERY long 10 minute beautiful diatribe that quietly rails against our consumerist and war torn etc society that we live in. They mix what we all hope for with what we live with throughout the lyrics, very pretty. Very expected too, since it's the trendy song to do nowadays.<br /><br />2. Pretty and with no words, it kinda is optimistic and hopeful, what we could all have if we all loved one another.<br /><br />3. The second disc goes from desert oasis to a rock and roll embittered world. This is one of 5 non Fry or Henley songs on the CDs, it's very raspy, very old school feeling here. I like it. So much better than the other 80's esque songs one the 1st disc.<br /><br />4. Well finally someone puts reality into plain words, and it's not even a historian etc...I have mixed feelings on this. I like the lyrics but not the music it's set too etc...very pointing of the finger etc, this whole CD reminds me of Huey Lewis musically, I do like it somewhat.<br /><br />5. Like the shakers in the song I'm ready to move, but then you read the lyrics and not so much anymore. Why is this Joe Walsh typical song in the middle of a political statement disc. I mean it's not exactly a vacation song, but it's not even good in the world is ending song way...The song is not for me atall, you want a vacation from Walsh's voice.<br /><br />(Frankly I don't like the 2nd disc at all, it's all mixed up, no order whatsoever, at least w/ the 1st one, it was all folk but w/ a point...)<br /><br />6. Now onto the ballad I DO like, this time the soft tenor works, I like the softness of the song, it should've been on the 1st disc (maybe.) I like the song though, it makes me want to dance with somebody.<br /><br />7. Oh god those reviews I didn't like were right, this song is lyrically good musically so dated it makes my eyes bleed. I do like it however, for some odd screwed up reason.<br /><br />8. From the start the song is beautiful. I love the Henley typical song, and this is it.<br /><br />9. First the woods on a snowy evening, then a barren desert(sp?)now the tropics...I like the feel of the song, maybe not the lyrics.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~<br />It's a bonanza of Jimmy Buffet, bitter rock and roll, ballads and techno 80's through the whole set of cds. I like the majority of the music, lyrically Henley and Fry still \\"rock\\" but god they needed someone in touch with our tastes and world today to at least arrange it, and good god Walsh does not count.<br /><br />The 1st disc put me to sleep and in a relaxed state of mind, depending. But the 2nd disc woke even the neighbor's dog up at some points. The ballads were pretty throughout, Henley's voice is still awesome, and Fry's not too bad. They so fail at the politics part, it just wasn't cohesive enough too count. There was no real order throughout, but still the songs were mostly good. If you look at each artist separately, you'll see they did good work, but together it really didn't fly.<br /><br />It's worth the 11.88 at Walmart and the embarrassing trip inside if you hate the place that much, b/c at least you'll have been a part of forgetting how tyrannical Wal-Mart is and supporting the \\"so called comeback\\" of a still great if a little out of touch band.least w/ the 1st one, it was all folk but w/ a point...)    6.

038572179X|3.0|The most compelling reason to read Atonement by Ian McEwan is for the authors writing style that evokes permanent dream like trances that are entertaining and engaging, while also creating three-dimensional characters of varying literary satisfaction.  Like in his other books, McEwan's prose is easily identifiable as unique and is consistent from the start to finish, through many chapters, time periods and points of view.    For me, (just like in Saturday), the plot is secondary and a few sentences could sum up the events.  If you require your books to be of the \\"what will happen next\\" variety, then alas, Atonement is not for you.  The main characters go through interesting self-realizations and growth and there are a couple of accelerated plot device moments, but again, I feel the writing style is flow of words on the page is the biggest strength of this book and it will be interesting to see what kind of movie this will make.    I would not recommend this book to people who don't read regularly and if you don't like the novel by page 50, I would reason tenacity might not be rewarded.  I don't think is the literary masterpiece of the last decade some have claimed, as a stronger story and more conflict were needed for larger appeal.    Bottom Line:  If you are the type of person that can appreciate art for the technical aspect of the piece instead of the overall impression, or music for the musicianship instead of the actual song, then you should give Atonement a read.
B00000255F|5.0|Remember albums ? They were two sided discs that you had to flip over after \\"x\\" amount of minutes. Usually somewhere between 15 and 20.Well , when I first bought the \\"Born To Run\\" album in '75 , the title track was all over the radio. It EXPLODED out of the speakers ! It didn't matter if you were listening on a little transistor , or a home stereo. And if you were listening in your car , the pedal AUTOMATICALLY went closer to the floor-board. So , of course , side two was the first side to be played when I picked up the record. O-h m-y H-e-a-v-e-n-s ! \\"Born To Run\\" ,\\"She's The One\\" , \\"Meeting Across The River\\" and concluding with \\"Jungleland\\". I think my listening to this album didn't even include the first side for a solid 6 months ! When anyone mentions \\"great album sides\\"---this \\"Born To Run\\" side two is the one that is top of my list!
0525950079|5.0|\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" one on my all time favorite books. (In the top three at least!) I tried to keep my expectations low for \\"World Without End\\" since it would be next to impossible to match the brilliance of \\"Pillars.\\" I enjoyed \\"Pillars\\" more than \\"World\\" the new book was still a wonderful read. I rarely read books twice, but I'm going to give \\"World\\" another read.   Great story, I got attached to the characters, nice message. It was nice to have little references to the characters from the previous book but I'm glad that wasn't overdone. Like others have said, you don't have to read \\"Pillars\\" to enjoy \\"World\\".  Some of the characters from the new book mirrored characters from \\"Pillars\\" but that didn't really bother me. How about others that have read it?  Good work Mr. Follet. I hope we get to return to Kingsbridge during the renaissance!
B000H305U0|1.0|where's the no star option? for Godsakes, ppl need to get a grip and stop listening to bad music. what in the world is this exactly? if anyone calls this 'quality music' then that person has no ears for music whatsoever.     this album is written by some of the socalled \\"most talented writers\\" in the music business today. so i guess these \\"talented writers\\" are horrible themselves then. if this is music and if JT is catagorized as \\"talented\\", then what are the real artists/bands such as celine dion, elton john, metallica, pink floyd??? gimme a break my ears are bleeding
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|Where do they even come up with some of these jokes?  \\"Slap Bet\\" could rank as one of the most hilarious and creatively written episodes of all time.  Without giving anything away, several other episodes have nearly unlimited replay value at my house.  Many of the jokes appeal to a younger audience, but I think anyone can appreciate what's happening here.    The cast is amazing -- each character has their own unique qualities that make it a lot like Seinfeld's cast.  They do a great job of developing each character, but they never take the focus off the main goal of making people laugh.  I can't get enough of this show and I've never made an easier decision on whether or not to buy the DVD box set.    It's a wildly underrated show, even in its third season.  It's unlike other sitcoms in the fact that the jokes are genuinely good and the writing never makes you cringe.  I can't wait to see \\"how they meet the mother\\".  If you love comedies, do yourself a favor and watch at least one episode -- you won't be disappointed!
B000E97X66|5.0|A quality listen from the first second to the last. Great song choice , great pacing , great song sequencing.I can only imagine the energy at the show. Bruce takes the audience (and now the listener) through high after high. Wish I'd been there.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|After all the stuff happening on Britney's life, I was extremely pleased to see that her personal life and her entertainment life are not in synch, because this album is very, very good.  All the songs are so mature, very well produced, extremely catchy and just plain superb.  Kudos to Britney for showing us her performer side, and show off to all her detractors.
B000002HMH|3.0|metallica will always be one of the greatest bands of all time no matter what ppl say. and just like every other band, even the greatest band is bound to have ups and downs. so what this album is not as great as the black album or master of puppets? it's still pretty darn good! what ppl need to realize is that it's not the 80s anymore and no matter how metallica wants to stick to writing the way they used to write when they were in their 20s, it's just not goin to be the same.     instead, old fans tend to hate on this album w/o really givin it a chance. i don't like it as much as the black album but that's okay b/c this is still a decent CD. while some of the songs are...uh...let's not talk about that...others are quite good if u keep an open mind. ain't my bitch and outlaw are pretty good even tho they both lack that charisma metallica used to have.     hey, it's at least better than 2003's \\"st.anger\\"! so do give it a chance
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I actually went to Target and bought the cd. I am pretty impressed. The songs are upbeat and danceable. I can workout to them. My favorite is track # 1, 2, 4, and 9 (Hot as Ice, I think). I miss the old Britney, the pre-Federline Britney. I hope the success of the CD will help bring her back to the good ol' ways.
B0007W0MTA|4.0|Toots and the Maytals were one of 'the' reggae groups of all time.  While Bob Marley could inspire millions throughout the world with his lyrics Toots and the Maytals could do likewise but had a style and rhythm that seemed to also borrow from American soul.<br /><br />While Trojan often sacrifice quality for quantity (and by that I mean sound quality) This double CD is of fairly strong solid quality.  It includes many of their well known tracks and some lesser known.<br /><br />Toots and the Maytals were always popular in the UK riding both on the crest of Ska musics popularity (especially the Ska revival of the 80s with the Specials who brought new interest to many classic Ska bands) and also through the legend himself Bob Marley.<br /><br />This CD is well worth getting for anyone who has a love of good music or anyone who wants a good quality introduction to reggae music.  Especially as this is such good value for money.
0385340559|5.0|Excellent book as are all of his. Can't wait for the next one. I've read all of his books and I love every single one of them.
B000VR824S|5.0|I was at the Crosroads Festival in July.  I have to say the two best songs of the day were A DAY IN THE LIFE by Jeff Beck and ISNT IT A PITY done by Eric Clapton.  But why isnt the Beck version of the Beatles tune on the DVD????   Can I get a witness??  Can I get an answer???
0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein's book is a well-researched, well-reasoned piece of anti-propaganda and a must-read for every college student in America. \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" provides a detailed analysis of the political and economic context that undergirds the current plundering of the US Treasury and the corporate sabotage of our democracy.
0375823360|5.0|These books are amazing. I love the story. At first, i'll admit I didn't quite get what the fuss was all about. After a little more reading, I found the story so captivating!    It's a story about magic and fantasy with religious undertones. Be warned: Christians may find these books offensive, but not necessarily.    Overall, wonderfully written, fun and beautiful that keeps you going page by page. If you like the books... this set is also great. I like that the spines, when held together, form the words 'his dark materials.' For some reason it just makes for a nicer set.    ...oh and the movie is coming out soon and these don't have movie tie-in covers like you'll soon be finding. Come December this will likely be the next big thing.
B000UFAURI|4.0|I guess I expected a little more from Dave and the boys. There are some truly great songs on here, but most of the songs sound like something I've heard before from them. I have enjoyed this album more each time I've listened to it, but I find the reduced amount of heavier songs to be disappointing. Still, they are one of the best bands in the business and they should continue to do quite well with this album. The best song on here is the first single, \\"The Pretender\\". And that is the heaviest song on the album. If you only like the hard rocking tunes, I would download the ones you like off itunes or something.
B000V7B90C|5.0|Being an absolutely HUGE AC/DC fan, this was quite a treat for myself... Family Jewels was so so... and I've had several concert videos on VHS, but this was just such a great release for the fans, probably since the Bonfire Box. Two DVD's, one dedicated dedicated to each of the both phenomenal vocalists, being that I'm impartial to either singer (RIP Bon), Both DVD's are just great to throw on, hook up the audio cables to the Hi-Fi and let'er rip... The audio and video quality are both great, spanning the decades of Rock, All you whiny audiophiles out there who have to have HD tv and dolby 5.1 and all that jazz need to suck it up and crank up the good ol' fashioned VOLUME knob!!! Highly recommended purchase for fans!!
B000TX7B5U|5.0|First of all, this may be the release that so many SOAD fans were waiting for after Toxicity. To me, Elect the Dead is a more natural progression after that album, and even could have been a sister album to Toxicity. It doesn't really remind me of the self-titled debut as much, which was far more raw (but great).   Everyone knows that Daron Malakian (the guitarist for SOAD) took over a huge chunk of the vocal duties on Mesmerize/Hypnotize. While I don't have a problem with his voice, it is best suited as a back-up, harmonizing voice. Let's face it, Serj is the voice that everyone wants to hear. If System never got back together, I think that Serj would continue to do just fine on his own, as evidenced by this masterful solo debut.  There are a wide range of songs on his album, from the hyperactive heavy songs, to the more acoustic and emotional offerings that all SOAD fans are familiar with. You'll also find a couple of truly bizarre songs, and while initially strange to the ear, they also become supremely catchy and highlights of this album. Many folks have heard \\"Empty Walls\\" and \\"The Unthinking Majority\\", and while those are two of the best songs on this album, don't just download those, because you'll miss one of the best albums of the year.  5/5 stars!!!!!!
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|Lately Amazon has been leaving out valuable information on it's DVD's description, in this case the listing is even incorrect. The Italian language is incorrect, the available languages are  English 5.1 DTS HD Lossless Master Audio plus English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Amazon omitted the available subtitles : English SDH, English, French, Spanish and the fact that this is a 50GB and includes the exclusive high definition BD-Java multi-level strategy game 'Black Hat Intercept!'. If I had to rate Amazon on it's descriptions it would get only 2 stars, but the movie and the Blu-ray contents are rated 5 stars. I only wish they had included the unrated version available on regular DVDs.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Hey everybody, I saw this DVD package yesterday and it is HUGE!!!!!! The book is the size of the yellow pages!!!!!!! If you notice all the negative reviews were written prior to the release. Most people assume it will be some TV Guide size 30 page paperback.
B000UR366S|5.0|As usual Joni is superb in her latest gift. Her lyrics continue to inspire and are very appropriate for our times.
B000SBUCEA|4.0|Not an essential set but a nice treat for diehard fans.  As the previous reviewer noted the track listing here on Amazon is not completely accurate.  However, the box itself does not contain these errors.  As for the music, well most ELP fans will already have the remastered studio albums so the real treat here is a set of live tracks that are far superior than the offical \\"Bootleg\\" series and one truly previously unheard, unreleased track.    The new track \\"Oh My Father\\" by Lake is very interesting in that it was recorded during the Tarkus sessions but sounds nothing like that album.  I don't know Lake's personal history but it seems to be a tribute to his late father.  Did his father pass away at an early age?  If so, it is a very personal song, otherwise it's just an ELP oddity.  Still, it is a decent ballad with some tasty electric guitar.    The Holy Grail for fans is the complete Mar Y Sol concert recorded in Puerto Rico in 1972.  An excerpt of Take A Pebble was the only offically released track from this festival that was included on an Atlantic Records compilation in the early '70's.  The whole concert is fantastic with an amazing Tarkus, an exciting, truncated Pictures and a frantic Rondo for an encore.  What I love about the Tarkus is the muscular bass by Lake that just propels the music along.  Emerson and Palmer are their usual excellent selves.    So, you have remastered tracks, alternate or early mixes of some classic tunes and enough unreleased live tracks from their prime that you could build your own private concert with.  For the casual fan?  Nope.  But for the diehard, it is big time fun.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|A tabloid basically serves two functions: one, to give people something to gawk at while they're in line at the supermarket, and two, to highlight and amplify everything negative about the celebrities du jour until they seem almost sub-human. Certainly, the tabloids have not been kind to Britney Spears, though she's been serving as her own tabloid since breaking up with Justin Timberlake in 2002. Her life is an overwhelming mix of unfathomable superstardom and personal nuclear meltdowns that play right into the National Enquirer's unapologetic hands. Yet it's difficult to judge whether her actions are, in fact, reactions to continual tabloid bombardment or are due to something else for which she should be held more personally responsible. In the video of her umbrella attack on a paparazzi SUV, there is an ever-so-brief moment when the cameras assault her and you can see the agony on her face, as she sits in the car, head shaved, and takes it. It takes a moment like that to realize what separates Britney Spears from Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Justin Timberlake and every single Backstreet Boy: She's breakable.<br /><br />Now that her personal life is hitting record lows (drug rehabilitation, losing custody of her children, a hit-and-run with a possible jail sentence), it's as good a time as any to release Blackout, a \\"comeback album\\" of sorts that aims to combat all of the negative attention she's received in the last couple of years. But perhaps to avoid sleeping with the enemy, it didn't arrive with the media blitz that typically accompanies a Britney Spears record. No major promotions, no interviews, no performances save for her stumbling through a lip-synched rendition of lead single \\"Gimme More\\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards: Blackout just sort of appeared, garish cover and all. The space usually reserved for a \\"thank you\\" section in the CD booklet is replaced with an image of crumpled tabloid articles lying on the floor. Blackout's second track, \\"Piece of Me,\\" is essentially one long threat to the press, with its verse of \\"I'm Mrs. `You Want a Piece of Me?' / Trying and pissing me off / Well get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off / Hoping I'll resort to starting havoc / And end up settling in court / Now are you sure you want a piece of me?\\" It's a remarkably cold-blooded affair.<br /><br />A fun tabloid game this year was \\"Who Can Make Britney Spears Look the Most Unattractive?\\" in which they would play up her shaved head, her new motherhood and the weight she gained as a consequence. Spears (or whoever was really behind the controls) attempts to squash this by conceiving most of Blackout as a batch of sex jams that pits her as a titillating club goddess sent down to Earth to show a man how it's done. You don't have to look too far for double-entendres. Check \\"Freakshow,\\" where Spears suggests that she and her partner \\"Make it a freakshow, freakshow / We can give `em a peepshow, peepshow,\\" or \\"Hot as Ice,\\" with its boasts of \\"I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy / Make him call me mama / Make him my new baby.\\" It's not Shakespeare; she rhymes \\"tingle\\" with \\"mingle\\" and doesn't rise above genre clich&eacute;s into the realm of, say, clever puns or wicked put-downs. But nobody ever said that Britney wasn't stupid.<br /><br />As sex jams go though, they're of surprisingly high quality, bathing Spears in the kind of calculated raunch that Timbaland and The Neptunes popularized in the 2000s. The beats slam, dart and thump; the synth melodies are grimy and buzzy like they're being squeezed through a giant perforated sheet with powerful force. (The aforementioned line in \\"Freakshow\\" would not have worked without that fat bass bulging at the very bottom of the track.) What makes Blackout an enjoyable listen is the production, and at times, it seems as though the smattering of producers made a better album than Britney deserves or is capable of delivering on her own merits. \\"Gimme More,\\" produced by Timbaland prot&eacute;g&eacute; Danja (who also helmed Justin Timberlake's \\"My Love\\" last year), is flat-out addictive. During the chorus, Britney does her best M.I.A. impression while Danja screws with her voice to the point of unrecognizability, and something inexplicable is making you say \\"gimme more\\" as she's saying it to you. \\"Radar\\" sports that unmistakable shuffling beat from Kompakt \\"schaffel\\" techno that sets it immediately apart, in a wonderful way.<br /><br />Through it all, Spears herself is curiously missing in action--a robot to be tinkered with at a given producer's will. The album's credits read like a list of ingredients in a Little Debbie snack cake: recorded and mixed at a dozen different locations and featuring more guests than I care to count, but no Britney anywhere. Most of what we hear of her is nicely manipulated for maximum sexual effect, but her voice is still thin and reedy when it's unimpeded, which ironically causes the music to sound better by contrast. Blackout is exponentially richer than 2003's limp In the Zone, yet it succeeds on the basis of wise studio decisions that Spears in all likelihood had nothing to do with. And that's ultimately what keeps it from being the triumphant comeback it sets out to be: This isn't Britney's album, but everyone else's. For Spears to prove to us that she's transcended the ugly milieu that still hovers around her, she'll have to release something that she can truly call her own.mbaland protégé Danja (who also helmed Justin Timberlake's \\"My Love\\" last year), is flat-out addictive.

0553582038|2.0|Okay, I'm perverse, I liked reading these books because they are only mildly interesting and VERY easy to put down, its great bathroom reading, but only there, and oh my god, who cares about all the customs, food, family trees if they are not in service to the story, yes, yes yes, all you Renaisance pleasure faire groupies love this stuff, but its not about the writing, which mostly sucks, there was one glorious point in all the four books that achieved something close to good writing where the dragon queen does not give up her one dragon and takes the army of slaves, this was an emotionally well wrought and satisfying plot turn, most everything else goes too slowly, and in strange, inappropriate directions, the worst problem is that I like the idea of complex characters changing through time, but this effort is buried in the sludge of extraneous detail and confusing, episodic inclusion of unimportant characters and actions.

If you use this ONCE, you will never again understand why people use old style calendars.  It stops oversights, double-booking, over booking of a child or a day, and many other problems.  Get one for anyone you know who has one or more children.  My husband and I use it (no kids) - a column each for us, one for 'Family' one for 'Pets' and one for his business.  They're PERFECT! We originally gave them as gifts to families and now they all buy their own and recommend to others.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I actually saw this tour when Christina came down to Miami and all I have to say is WOW OMG!! I thought the Stripped tour was something this one just topped that one. She was fantastic. Didn't lypsing anything(unlike some other popstars that shall remain nameless),and the selections of songs that she sang were phenomenal. I swear I could talk about this show all day long but there's not enough time.        Seriously, if you are a Christina fan and didn't get the chance to see her on this tour this is a must have. This tour just proves that Christina is a true artist.
B00005V1B2|5.0|Lets face it, a lot of Prog Rock doesn't stand the test of time and can sound self-indulgent and pointless. Not the case here - this is a fine instrumental album with some memorable melodies and great orchestration from the wonderful David Bedford (who worked with Kevin Ayers and Mike Oldfield, among many others).     In keeping with the source material, the album has a simple, sometimes childlike feel to it. No rock-out, for sure, but a long way from the vapid fare of contemporaries. If you own the original, the new material here may not be worth the price of the import with additional tracks. Otherwise, buy it.

1416523359|1.0|I have always been an avid fan of Stephen King.  It is Stephen King who brought me to my love of reading. The first book I read for pleasure was Salems Lot, and I have always eagerly awaited his next installment.  Obviously a review is one persons feelings on a subject, and that is what this represents.  I am also not sure if I should review this book in that I have not finished it (I still have 30 pages left, and I just cannot get through them).  With that said, I thoroughly did not enjoy this book and it is one of only two books that I have not finished in my life.  The story is wierd, disconnected, and while I have only 30 pages left, I cannot for the life of me figure out how I got here, and what this whole story is about.  The continual flashbacks and wierd language (words used by the main character and her deceased husband) are creepy (but not on a Stephen King creepy kind of level.  My recommendation is to look on the bargain racks if you must buy this book, it is definitely not worth the standard price.
B000R7GKQE|1.0|I was very disappointed with the quality of the Season 2 box set of Supernatural. I bought Season 1 from Amazon last year and it was perfect, but unfortunately I can't say the same for this set.     I was in the process of watching Night Shifter on Disc 4 when the picture started freezing up and then stopped playing all togther. The DVD player then gave me the \\"check the disc as it may be dirty or damaged\\" message. I was shocked. I knew the disc couldn't be dirty since I'm very fussy with my discs and never touch them with food on my hands, and as for it being damaged, I thought that was impossible since it was brand new and never been played before. Anyway, I took the disc out of the dvd player and checked it. I was horrified to discover that it was very badly scratched. I hadn't checked the discs when I first got them  - I assumed that because the box set was new and sealed the discs would be in perfect condition.     I contacted Amazon who were fantastic. They sent me another box set and it arrived just yesterday. The first thing I did was check all the discs. I couldn't believe my eyes when, once again, I found one of the discs was very badly scratched, and not only  was it scratched, it actually had cracks in the plastic around the hole in the middle. Luckily it was Disc 5 and not Disc 4. And since Amazon told me to keep the original box set since posting it back to the States was too costly, I was able to put together an unscratched box set using discs from both sets.    I was very impressed with the way Amazon dealt with my problem - they are a great company to deal with. And I'm very glad they're around because here in Australia the Supernatural box sets are lacking in the Special Features department.    Not so impressed with the manufacturers of the box set though.    But apart from the manufacturers crappy quality control standards this show is AWESOME!!

Some may find his assertions to be exaggerated and say \\"so what\\" to the links he describes between business interests and the denatured quality of much of what we eat - and his is a thoughtful and powerful statement about how we could, as consumers, begin to be aware of and make changes to what we buy and consume in the hope of getting closer to what's good for us...
B000UX6THK|4.0|'Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition' (2007) offers viewers both the American and European versions of the pilot film and every episode of the landmark television series, which debuted in 1990 to rave reviews and briefly became a cultural phenomenon in the United States. 'Twin Peaks' famously inspired a number of television series in the 1990s, including 'Northern Exposure' (1990-1995), 'Eerie, Indiana' (1991-1992), 'Picket Fences' (1992-1996) and 'The X-Files' (1993-2002).<br /><br />Centered around the mysterious murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), a teenage prom queen in the small northwestern town of Twin Peaks, the first season, which was meticulously overseen by filmmaker and co-creator David Lynch, is a surreal mosaic of Jungian psychology, literalized metaphor, violence, demonology, incest, and folksy, deadpan humor. Like Lynch's earlier groundbreaking film 'Blue Velvet' (1986), the series can be concisely summed up in a single line provided by Laura's secret lover, biker James Hurley (James Marshall): \\"Everyone's hurt inside.\\"<br /><br />There's no doubt that the first season and those portions of the second which deal with the Palmer killing remain some of the most suspenseful, riveting, and surprising drama ever aired on American television. As incest was not a prominent theme in primetime television drama in that era, 'Twin Peaks' further pushed the envelope of what the networks considered acceptable.<br /><br />However, Lynch moved on to other creative projects between the first and second seasons, and once Palmer's murderer was finally identified and brought to justice, 'Twin Peaks' simply fell spectacularly and painfully apart.<br /><br />An abundance of unnecessary new characters were introduced, and established characters like James, Bobby (Dana Ashbrook), Josie (Joan Chen) and Leo (Erik Da Re) were so badly written that they were no longer recognizable or appealing. The extended storyline in which Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer) becomes obsessed with recreating the Civil War in miniature is excruciatingly banal, and the decision to have Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn) and Bobby, the attractive rebels of the first season, become young career professionals was a woeful mistake indeed.<br /><br />The show's previously crisp and carefully balanced directorial tone collapsed with the writing, leaving fine actors like Kyle MacLachlan, Peggy Lipton, and Michael Ontkean looking hesitant, disoriented and embarrassed. The concluding episodes of the second season can rightfully be seen as an unintential parody of the gripping first season.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, both MacLachlan and Fenn publicly expressed their anger at Lynch's unexpected departure as creative overseer, and the series was abruptly cancelled in 1991, leaving at least one key plot unsolved.<br /><br />'Twin Peaks' also brought a number of technical innovations to American television. One has only to compare a random episode to any episode of 'L.A. Law' (1986-1994), for example, to observe the enormous positive shift in production values that Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost instituted. As has been frequently noted, each episode is like a short high-quality film, with immaculate set design, costuming, lightning, photography, editing, and scoring.<br /><br />The highly varied cast included Lynch favorites Jack Nance, Grace Zabriskie, and MacLachlan, older stars of film and television like Jane Greer, Piper Laurie, Beymer, Lipton and Ontkean, and a plethora of talented newcomers like Lara Flynn Boyle, Madchen Amick, and David Duchovny in addition to Lee, Marshall, Fenn, and Ashbrook.<br /><br />Perhaps the show's abrupt cancellation was a difficult pill for Lynch to swallow: in 1992, he wrote and directed 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,' a feature-length film which explored the last several days in the life of Laura Palmer, who had already been murdered as the pilot film opened. A critical and commercial failure upon release, the film features a flat, sober tone throughout, an incredibly moody score by Angelo Badalamenti,  and one of the grimmest endings in all of cinema, but one which would be outdone by the conclusion of Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' (2001), which remains Lynch's most nihilistic cinematic work to date.ober tone throughout, an incredibly moody score by Angelo Badalamenti,  and one of the grimmest endings in all of cinema, but one which would be outdone by the conclusion of Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' (2001), which remains Lynch's most nihilistic cinematic work to date.
0375842209|5.0|You know, this book deserves to have the title \\"A Heatbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.\\" Too bad that title is already taken by a book that doesn't live up it. My dad loaned me this book--he's 65 years old and probably hasn't read a YA book since he was in eighth grade. He thought the writing was daring and experimental and you know, he's right. In return I am loaning him my library of David Almond titles, the only other YA writer who has moved me to this degree. Very highly recommended.
B000TXZVGQ|4.0|I love this show so much.   The acting is what really gets me.  Claire Danes and Jared Leto were both so real.  And the friends, and the parents.  It would have been interesting to watch them grow up on more seasons.  Oh well.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The third, and alas, the final installment of the Bourne series has landed, and what a landing it was.  The strongest of the three installments (the first two being excellent in their own right) propels the viewer through almost non-stop, high-tense action, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats.  For those who have missed either of the first two motion pictures ... and shame on you if you did;), it's a must to see at least the second installment (The Bourne Supremacy) in order not to get totally lost in this one.  Do yourself a favor and see both fine films (The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy) before seeing The Bourne Ultimatum.    As with the other two films, The Bourne Ultimatum was shot at several different exotic locals (a trademark of this series).  \\"Ultimatum\\" starts where \\"Supremacy\\" left off.  Actually, it sort of spans The Bourne Supremacy, telling us what transpired at the end of that 2nd installment that we did not see.    Now, when I mean non-stop action, that doesn't mean it's the entire picture.  The story of Bourne's identity and his role in \\"Treadstone\\" (a CIA Black-Ops program) comes full circle and the scenes inside the CIA (especially the Pamela Landy character, played wonderfully by Joan Allen) are as intense as they are interesting.  More important still, nothing is telegraphed in the entire series.  We don't know what is going to happen, all the way to (and including) the end.  Also, the character Nicky Parsons (played nicely by Julia Stiles) is expanded in the third episode, adding another interesting branch to the Bourne saga.    And one cannot (or should not) underrate the performance of Matt Damon in yet another demanding Bourne role.  While he puts the \\"E\\" in exciting fight sequences, he also puts the \\"I\\" in intelligence.  His character is thinking every second of every day and has a purpose in everything he does (which is not always known by the audience at the time).  Damon brings this out (often subtly) in each film,making Bourne the super-agent of super-agents, but never in an unbelievable or plastic (James Bond) type of way (not to say the Bond series wasn't good at times, but Bond is pretty light fare -- almost comic book in depth -- compared to the Bourne series).    This is a hard-hitting series, intelligently written and wonderfully acted and directed.    And as had been said by many people, many times, this is exactly what a secret agent movie should be (and very rarely is).  The only problem I have with this series is the over-use of the hand-held camera technique.  While not as jerky or blurry as the second episode, it can still be distracting at times.  However, the use of the hand-held camera tends to put the audience in the middle of everything, giving it that extra intensity and realism not found in most films.  And believe me, you will be right in the middle of the action in this brilliant installment ... and at times, amazingly so.  This is one heck of a series and one heck of a movie.    Because this film essentially completes the trilogy, and I feel it is the strongest of the series (part 1 being very good, part 2 even better, while part 3 the best), I rate this installment the highest of the three.  Between 1 and 10, I feel The Bourne Ultimatum deserves a solid 9.    Sadly, I think this is the logical end to this series, and for that I am somewhat bummed that we won't see another installment.  But hey, this is Hollywood where ANYTHING can happen.  I can only hope if Hollywood reprises the Bourne role (and Hollywood is quite renown for doing this), they don't muck it up, and will maintain the integrity and excitement of the other three films.  And no, I don't want anyone but Matt Damon playing the lead role, nor anyone but Paul Greengrass directing it.
0060012358|5.0|While this is technically a Discworld novel (even Death makes a cameo appearance), it's really an independent story intended for young adult readers. However, Pratchett (like Heinlein) writes books for younger readers that actually appeal to all readers. The thing is, the wizards of Unseen University have a toxic spell-dump behind their institution that often has unpredictable effects on living (and previously nonliving) things. In this case, the rats that live and take their meals there find themselves with suddenly advanced intelligence. They learn to think, to act in concert, to read, to wear selected clothing and use weapons, and to dream of a utopian future. However, Maurice, who has also become intelligent, is a cat with imagination and the soul of a con man, and he organizes a Pied Piper scam with the aid of the rats and a stupid-looking young musician named Keith. And they're making good money, until they choose as their next target the town of Bad Blintz, where a mysterious and very dangerous force is at work among the rats and rat-catchers. As his fans know, Pratchett understands the feline psychology, and Maurice is a hoot: \\"Cats are good at steering people. A miaow here, a purr there, a little gentle pressure with a claw . . . and Maurice had never had to think about it before. Cats didn't have to think. They just had to know what they wanted. Humans had to do the thinking. That's what they were for.\\" But it turns out he also knows a lot about the social life of rats. (He read \\"more about rats than is good for me,\\" he says in the Afterword.) Among the rats, there's the practical engineer with a military bent, the old-fashioned boss who distrusts change, the nearly blind intellectual mystic, the politically astute lieutenant (and tap dancer), the loyal young female -- all the characters you would expect in an epic. The dialogue is believable (and not nearly as off the wall as in the \\"mainstream\\" Discworld novels), the characterization is spot on (especially Malicia, the mayor's daughter, who considers life just one long fairy tale and packs accordingly), and Pratchett never hesitates to bring in a bit of shocking truth.

B000I2IT44|5.0|If your a fan of porcupine Tree, you'll love this DVD. Shot during the \\"Deadwing\\" tour (when I was first exposed to the band) This DVD highlights the amazing musicianship of the band. Their renditions of \\"Open Car\\" and \\"Blackest Eyes\\" shows that this progressive rock band can ROCK hard as anybody as well a being a sonically atmospheric band as a Radiohead with songs like \\"Arriving Somewhere\\" and \\"Start of Something Beautiful. And if your a johnny come lately fan like I am; you'll be pining to check out their back catalog because of old songs like the aural epic \\"Mother and Child Divided and the lyrically caustic but brilliant \\"So Called Friend\\". But what really makes this a \\"must have\\" is the musically air tight brilliance of all 5 members and the visionary genius of Steve Wilson PT's front man and songwriter. This dvd is beautifully shot and artistically interspersed with black and white, grainy and filtered color effects as well as multi-camera angles that punctuates the well paced editing. This film documentary, as I see it is a masterpiece in cinematic style. A must HAVE for any Porcupine Tree fan and a great introductory to this underrated great band.

And hence one approaches a story about the Queen with some trepidation -- it seems so easy for the writer to score cheap shots.<br /><br />Alan Bennett eschews this approach, and has produced a delightful little book which I imagine the Queen would find pleasure in reading (as she may well have already done).<br /><br />The story gives us many reminders about the pleasures and benefits of reading, and the often consequential appeal of trying to write.<br /><br />A beautifully written tale, with a perfect denouement.

B000VLOKQI|5.0|I speak with extreme prejudice when I write this because The Who is my utmost favorite band in the history of modern music. That said, for people that already love The Who, will love them even more at the conclusion of viewing this collection of films. Those who are not fond of The Who, will be if they view these films.<br />  The main film is cut up nicely into chapters, and each chapter is titled with a line from a Who song that pertains to stories described in that given chapter. Which many of the stories talked about in these film can be truly quite moving.<br />  The end of the main two hour film has the most emotional parts. They describe trying to move on after the death of Keith Moon. Pete Townshend gives much heartfelt praise about John Entwhistle, and goes to talk of his death and moving on thereafter. The film also talks a lot about the Cincinnati tragedy, better than they ever had in the past. They even get brave enough to tackle Pete's legal problems he faced regarding the Child Pornography incident. In fact Pete speaks more clearly and eloquently in these films than I have ever heard before.<br />  The second disc has short films that are collectively called \\"6 Quick Ones\\" which has mini-documentaries about the main four members. They even speak of Pete's guitar techniques witch is quite interesting as a guitar player myself.<br />  This is a great piece to be viewed by anyone whether or not they think they are interested. It is captivating film for anyone.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Songs in the Key of Life is, in my opinion, Stevie's masterpiece.  This generation of young people MUST listen to this album.  Double album with each and every tune becoming a #1 hit on Billboard at the time.  Village Ghetto Land will haunt you with its honesty, Have a Talk With God will give anyone in pain hope, Knocks Me Off My Feet is one of the most romantic songs I've ever heard.  Young people must listen to En Historia to learn of all the pioneers in medicine and all fields that happen to be people of color.  This genius composer lyricist is for ALL people, ALL generations, the messages in this double album are priceless, I dare anyone not to be moved to tears by at least one of these songs.  It would be worth it if it sold for $50 or $100 bucks.  A MUST HAVE.  Set a couple of hours aside, I guarantee you will talk about this album to everyone if you have never heard it before, you will be as persistent and annoying as me.  A fan for life,    Irene
0767802659|5.0|I just saw some idiotic slide show on CNN that had this movie grouped with 20 other movies as the worst movies ever made. I just want to say for the record I vote this as one of the 20 best movies ever made. If you know anything about Heinlein's book from which this movie was made you would understand more why it was made the way it was.  Heinlein's two basic themes - 1) only those individuals willing to give their lives for a nations political system should be the only ones allowed to participate in it. 2) war is sometimes necessary    Lots of action in this film.  Special effects were excellent. Dialog and plot excellent.  Young, beautiful actors wearing costumes borrows from the Third Reicht.      Enjoy

Be like me and many others - go format neutral and love every minute of it!
6304712499|3.0|I liked the movie , but as usual , Hollywood screwed up , just like they always do , so what if half of America doesn't get it in it's original form , Todd Mcfarlane is a great artist and writer , Hw got robbed when he let the movie be made , just like all the other comic to movies.<br />Bottom line Hollywood will never get it right , Comic Book artists and writers are not treated with respect in Hollywood.<br />HBO was the only one I think did a good job , skip this and get the animated HBO series.
B00062RCBW|5.0|Best DVD box set I have ever bought, for TNG or star trek fans well worth the money. I've had it for a month so far and I'm still on season one. If your pondering whether to its worth the money it is, you will be enjoying this for months to come!
B000002J6H|4.0|Very solid solo debut from Stills released during the seven-year gap between D&eacute;j&agrave; vu and CSN. It contains Stills' biggest solo hit by far - the catchy \\"Love the One You're With\\", an already fantastic gospel-folk crossover that could've been ever better had Stills simply gotten rid of the hordes of backup vocalists (David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Mama Cass among them. Anyone surprised?) adding a completely unneeded \\"doo doot doot doot doot doot doo-doot!\\" sequence stolen right from \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\". Eh, why the hell am I complaining? They're all great singers, it's just that I don't like the \\"doo doot doot etc.\\" part. And there is occasional bombast - those hordes of backup vocalists from \\"Love the One You're With\\" return to throw \\"Church (Part of Someone)\\" and \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" overboard. And what's with all of those flutes and strings and whatnot on \\"To a Flame\\" and \\"Cherokee\\"? Steve Stills, master of Baroque pop? I think not! It's much better when Stills sticks to his guns, especially when Jimi Hendrix (yeah, that Jimi Hendrix) shows him who his daddy is on the careening rocker \\"Old Times, Good Times\\". You know, Stills plays a nice little solo, and then Jimi Hendrix comes along and mops the floor with Steve's nice little solo. Eric Clapton also provides guitar on the long blues-rocker \\"Go Back Home\\", a song that suits Slowhand much better than a lot of the solo work he would later put out. He shows Stills who his daddy is, too. Again, Stills plays a pretty nice wah-wah part, and then Clapton comes along and does his Eric Clapton stuff. Oh yeah, and this is the only studio album to feature both Hendrix and Clapton on it. \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" has more hordes of backing singers on it, but they actually add to the song, so I'm not gonna complain about them. And while the acoustic ballads aren't like Neil Young's acoustic ballads, they aren't without their charms: the raw \\"Black Queen\\" is arguably the best on the record, in fact, if only for Stills' bluesy vocal. Oh, wait, changed my mind... \\"Go Back Home\\" is better by just a bit. And \\"Do for the Others\\" has a pretty melody. This won't change anyone's life, and sometimes Stills' ambitions get the best of him. But it's a great companion to the first two Crosby, Stills, Nash, and occasionally Young albums.vocal.

0316776963|4.0|I was first introduced to the writing of David Sedaris in a Literary Nonfiction class.  The excerpt we read was the one from which the title of this book is taken, \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\"  I thought it was pretty funny and bought the book.  Well, it is a lot funnier than that.  The funniest parts of this book deal with his various looney family members, and Sedaris' deadpan style reminds me of Dave Barry with an edge.  I took this book to read in the doctor's office  while my husband had his colonoscopy and I think the people in the waiting room thought I was certifiable...Several times I had to wipe the tears from my eyes.  Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great comic read.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie as my mother hails from East Germany and fled across the West in the early 1950s.  I lived with horror stories of the Stasi, heard about my East German relatives and was well aware that the Communists had information on me.  This movie rang home.    The acting, directing and cinematography in this movie are above par.  I was glued to the screen, both amazed at the reality of the movie and stunned that people could do such horrific things under duress.  How evil could people go to save themselves?  How far will people go to survive?  This movie touches on those topics.    The playwright, his actress girlfriend and the man who surveilled them both all came across as very human and likable characters.  It was the surveiller, though, who had me on edge, both for his coolness and for his stifled kind heart that had been turned cold by his own government.  He himself was captivated by Christa Marie's acting yet he couldn't allow himself an ounce of enjoyment because of his mission.  One could see how he struggled in the end, and his final reaction is what made me gasp in disbelief.    This movie is both an artistic film as well as a hair-raising thriller.  This is definitely one of Germany's better films of the last five years, with more disturbing realism than other recent Oscar contenders from Germany.  I don't think there is an East German or eastern European Communist alive who won't be haunted by this film.
B00005JPRD|4.0|I went to see ACROSS THE UNIVERSE in San Francisco with an appreciative crowd and a great artist as my date (*Wayne Smith*) a man who had been an obsessive fan of the Beatles as a boy.  He wasn't sure how he could handle Julie Taymor's interpretative take on the Beatles' music, but by the end of the movie he was all smiles.  She has done a magnificent job of rethinking what the Beatles were trying to do with their music, and yet by setting it in the sixties she seems to be underlining how very long ago it was!  I kept looking at the dingy, scarred up Manhattan pictured in the film and wondering how they could afford the budget they must have used to slum it down.  Same with Liverpool--could it really be as dire?  And yet the press materials the theater handed out insisted that the opening scenes were really shot in the Cavern Club and not some studio recreation.<br /><br />I loved the movie, but yeah, all through it I kept thinking that, even if it is not a disaster on the scale of that Robert Stigwood Sgt Pepper film, it certainly has script problems!  Evan Rachel Wood--love her, but she is not capable of playing the part of Lucy and convincing us of her passionate love for a boy killed in VietNam, her radicalization as a result of his death, or a growing comradeship with a charismatic movement leader.  She can sing, but her overenunciation reminds you of Julie Andrews or Barbra Streisand trying to go rock.  Wood is excellent however in her scenes with Jim Sturgess who plays Jude, but even there, the storyline sinks with predictable tension built into the storyline (as an allegory, I guess, for the way the 60s collapsed of their own weight).  Sturgess is enormously appealing when he smiles--a star is born--but when he's grim or trying to act tough forget it, it's not on his calendar.<br /><br />The other performers are very good but basically, script problems ruin the story.  The commune setup run by sexy landlady Sadie is cute but you've seen it all before done much better in HAIR and RENT.  Indeed ACROSS THE UNIVERSE should be paying HAIR and RENT royalties for all the setups the new film takes from these older touchstones (can't call them classics exactly).  The giant \\"I Want You\\" number just replays the title sequence in \\"Hair\\" of the draftees moving through the system in their undershorts, stripped of their human rights and turned into machines, though it adds a few surrealist touches like the scene in which GIs lift a statue of liberty onto the camouflaged jungles of VietNam.  There's also a Wall Street bit right out of HAIR, while the RENT parallels are too many to mention.  (Couldn't they have just hired Adam Pascal--Roger in RENT--to play Max in ATU, instead of directing poor Joe Anderson to mimic him in every single detail of acting, singing, tossing his hair?)  Nevertheless one watches the movie in fascination at so much daring, so much imagination, so much sheer Busky Berkeley craziness thrown up at the screen in a titanio effort to take you to a strawberry fields-like place in your mind.  For me it worked pretty much, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of the sophisticated people I know.R and RENT.

0743486285|5.0|Motley Crue was my favorite band back in the Shout at the devil days so I'd say that qualifies me as a fan. I have this thing about celebrities. I admire many times what they do but really find them annoying. They don't have to pay for anything, they get special treatement when they go places and get waited on hand and foot and then they b-tch and complain about having their photo taken. Nikki fulfills the celebrity image in this book. There is even one point where their manager(I think), makes my point. Motley Crue are complaining about their long tour and the guy mentions that they were four men in their early twenties complaining about playing five two hour shows five nights a week. They complained that they were being overworked. He compared that to a man who gets up and lays bricks 10 hours a day all week. That's exactly why I don't like celebs. Nikki talks about a drug dealer resenting Nikki because he saw him as a spoiled brat. The guy mentioned a Harley that he really liked and then Nikki went and bought the exact bike and rode it over to the guys house which made the guy very jealous. When I was reading that I was thinking \\"What a as-h-le.\\" (Nikki that is). Nikki's story supports why I dislike celebs but it also tells a great story of the drug induced madman. If he would have died of a drug overdose at the end, this book would have made a good movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|(A: Because the Himalayas were too far away.)<br /><br />Abbey Road was the last album Beatles made before their breakup, but it was my introduction to their music, not to mention the first real pop record I can remember digging out of my parents meager vinyl collection.  Probably it's nostalgia that makes it my favorite, but heck if the hair on the back of my neck doesn't stand at attention after all these years when I drop the needle and John whispers \\"shoot me\\" and the bass peaks and slides down that cascading tom fill.  Don't even bother listening to any cover versions of Come Together. None comes close to the exhalation of pure swamp mojo that permeates the original.<br /><br />And that sums up what I love about Abbey Road. It's the Beatles album that  showcases the refined outcome of nearly a decade of constant adventures in arrangement and instrumental sound and style on the part of both the group and their production team.  It's a studio album that's named after a studio, with a literally pedestrian front cover and a blurry back shot of a woman's bum passing swiftly by -- no time left for pretension or wild experimentation, just final statements to made (and a bit of fun to be had) before the members got on with their separate lives.  The sense of closure and movement is palpable.<br /><br />Listen for George's aching slide solos against John's garage blues rhythm guitar, for Paul's inventive and melodic bass work played with a tone like an engine warming, for Ringo's ability to guide the listener through the wild tempo and meter changes in the medley without making us feel like we've entered the land of Prog.  Listen for how George Martin takes a brand new instrument, the Moog modular synth, and threads it naturally into the mix (those rising and brightening layers of texture on the repeated refrain \\"Sun, sun, sun, here it comes\\" in Here Comes The Sun are all Moog), and to the intricacy of his string arrangement on the verse of Golden Slumbers.<br /><br />The best pure songwriting belongs to Harrison, who outdid himself with Something (my millennium pick for \\"most inspired and unforced use of key change on a bridge\\") and Here Comes the Sun, though Come Together and You Never Give Me Your Money come in as close seconds, and the only real clinker for me is Maxwell's Silver Hammer.<br /><br />Lyrically, the half-described characters in the medley are intriguing: Lennon's sneering pictures from the fringe - a ne'er-do-well in his fifties heckling the royal family at a parade, the body-suited poster-girl/boy for London's growing freak scene - sit across from McCartney's  struggling working squares in She Came in through the Bathroom Window.  And the buildup of The End contains the one sensible piece of advice in the band's notoriously preachy catalog. \\"And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\\"  A realistic equation to ride out on, after each member has shed their studio polish and left the stage with a jubilant rawk solo from the old Hamburg days and the screen is fading out in a sunset wash of strings and guitar.<br /><br />And then there's Her Majesty.  A beautiful little accident. A reminder that somewhere, someone is still strumming an acoustic guitar and hatching a plot to get drunk and kiss the queen.

Some traditions deserve to be passed on from generation to generation, and this is one of them. Thanks to the 'Harold' stories, I gained a love for reading at a young age. A love that I hope my son will have as well. Theses books inspire imagination and creativity, as well as curiosity. I would recommend them to anyone with kids. The perfect books to learn and grow with!

0316067598|3.0|This story is an account of U.S. Navy SEALs, heroic warriors who are in a class far above typical service men and women. More than half the book details what it takes to be a SEAL. The rest is of four SEAL's dedication to carrying out a mission to protect you and me against terrorist while facing staggering odds. I give thanks for all those who serve to protect us.  The foul language used is typical and real to life, but adds nothing to the genuiness of the story and will limit the number of readers about these heroic men.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth are one of the most unique bands in progressive metal at the moment.  They are incredible musicians and posses a lead singer who can not only take on the best \\"cookie monster\\" vocal growls, but also has a flawless melodic singing voice.  The band uses this to full advantage on their releases and has gained a world wide following.  \\"Damnation\\" is a bit of a departure for the band.  It is somewhat considered to be their acoustic album (although electric instruments are to be found throughout the disc).  There are no growling vocals to be found here, and the album probably has more in common with Pink Floyd or Porcupine Tree than it does death metal.  This will be a huge turnoff to some, thus some of the negative reviews I have read from metal purists, but this album is very rewarding and might attract a different audience from Opeth's usual fans.  The album is quite depressing with music and lyrics that create a somber mood.  With titles like \\"In My Time Of Need\\", \\"Death Whispered A Lullaby\\", and \\"Hope Leaves\\" you can pretty much tell that this is not going to be an upbeat listen.  As previously mentioned the vocals from Mikael Akrerfeldt are simply gorgeous and the music is all melodic and moody.  This album was released with a companion disc \\"Deliverance\\" which is mostly metal oriented stuff.  Personally I like \\"Damnation\\" a lot better, but opinions will vary on this.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|First and foremost, these films are based on my favorite author's works. Robert Ludlum was great!     Now, about the Bourne Ultimatum; it has nothing to do with the book. None of the movies really did except for the character, Jason Bourne. Yet, as with so many movies, if you view the movie as a separate work, you can enjoy the book and movie separately.     I am not a big Matt Damon fan, but he was very good as Bourne. Sulking, confused, and deadly. I believe he must have worked hard on his action sequences. Kudos for the physical work you put in, Matt.     Action is the real theme of this movie. I believe that at least 90% of the filming was done with hand-held cameras. Shaky! The initial effect is to effectively create a feeling of panicked and hectic action. After a while it really wears on your nerves. I would like to focus at some point. Parts of the story line are blurred because of the jittery camera.     The car chase through New York was done the old-fashioned way. I understand that they shut down the streets and really did it, no miniatures or models. You know, like McQueen did in \\"Bullitt\\". Great job!    The ending actually is more the ending of the first book. Again, no objections. I have seperated the movies and books.    I could go on, but I'm not trying to sell anybody anything. If you like action, see \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\". My 15 year-old son really likes it, too. I'm glad we have another thing we can share as father and son.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Iron Maiden's fourth full length release Piece of Mind was released in June of 1983.<br />The album was the band's first album for Capitol Records after its subsidiary Harvest folded in the US and it was also the band's debut with new drummer Nicko McBrain.<br />McBrain joined singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris and guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith to go with producer Martin Birch to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas (the same place AC/DC recorded Back in Black) to record an album that would solidify Maiden's place in hard rock/metal history.<br />Would the album be as great as it was poised to be or were they a flash in the pan, read on and find out (as I did when I first acquired the album on cassette in June, 1988 (Capitol version) and then CD in September of 1993 (Capitol version), then the Castle 1995 re-issue and the 2002 Sanctuary/Columbia remastered CD).<br />We begin the album with \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" penned by Harris. What a killer opening track! The track was lyrically inspired by the 1969 Clint Eastwood World War II movie on the same name and is a fast paced metal rocker. Next was Dickinson's first sole-penned Maiden track \\"Revelations\\" which is a classic masterpiece. Next is the classic Smith/Dickinson penned \\"Flight of Icarus\\" which is a killer rocker that got extensive rock radio and MTV airplay (when MTV showed real music). The song told the classic tale of the legend of Icarus. Dickinson's vocals here go from sing to croon to screaming, especially the last scream at the end! Murray and Smith belt out the addicting solos. The first half ended with \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" which is another song about going out in fashion and even if it means on the road.<br />The album's second half kicks off with the Harris penned rocker \\"The Trooper\\" which is a great song about war chant and a riff that mesmerizes you. We then have a goofy backwards message from McBrain before we start the Harris/Murray penned rocker \\"Still Life\\" and is a great song. The Harris penned \\"Quest For Fire\\" follows and is another majestic song with lyrics that was inspired by the ancient BC times or the movie of the same name. Next is the Dickinson/Smith penned \\"Sun and Steel\\" which is another great rocker. The Harris penned epic \\"To Tame A Land\\" closes the album in majestic style. Murray and Smith do a stellar riff which sets the tone and finishes the track. Then the main riff comes in and its lyrics tell of the book Dune. The song was to be called Dune but the writer of the book rejected it. The song ends with another Dickinson scream before turning into a killer instrumental to finish off a classic album.<br />Piece of Mind put Iron Maiden in the spotlight for keeps as the album would become the band's first US Top 20 and Platinum selling album and would not be their last.<br />Piece of Mind may have been recorded in 1983 but it still sounds great almost 25 years on.<br />RECOMMENDED!ris penned \\"Quest For Fire\\" follows and is another majestic song with lyrics that was inspired by the ancient BC times or the movie of the same name.

B000000OQF|5.0|Los Angeles based hard rockers Guns and Roses' debut album entitled Appetite for Destruction was released in the summer of 1987.<br />The album was the album that introduced us to guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin (on lead and rhythm respectively), bass player Duff McKagan, drummer Steven Adler and howling frontman Axl Rose.<br />The group was started by Slash and Steven only to then be joined by Izzy, Axl and finally Duff (who were in a rival band at the time). The group got such a following that Geffen Records signed the band.<br />Their debut EP Live Like a Suicide was well received in the underground. However, their first major label album was Appetite For Destruction which was recorded in late 1986 with producer Mike Clink. When it was first released, it sold slowly and the band jumped on tours opening for The Cult and Aerosmith (among others). It took over a year for Appetite For Destruction to catch on as hair metal was infesting music (thanks to bands like Poison, Bon Jovi and Cinderella) but when Appetite struck, Guns and Roses gave us metal dudes some hope (although it took years for the album to grow on me as I was into Metallica and Iron Maiden at the time of this album's release and initially dismissed G 'n' R as another hair metal band, so I was wrong).<br />The opening \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" is one of the greatest hard rock songs ever and has been used in a number of films like the 1988 Dirty Harry movie The Dead Pool in which the band had cameos and a then unknown Jim Carrey miming Jungle. That track is one of the best rockers ever. The song \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" was the song that gave the album the success it deserved as the song hit #1 and indirectly pushed AFD to #1 on the US charts and sold over 18 million plus copies to date in the US (as of 2011 and the album that gave Guns and Roses its induction into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its first year of eligibility).<br />The three big hits were \\"Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child\\" and of course \\"Paradise City\\". I overlooked this album for a long time as radio, MTV, certain siblings of mine and junior high school classmates overkilled it with playing and airing but today it has held up extremely well.<br />The rest of the tracks on the album which are the bludgeoning \\"It's So Easy\\" (complete with obscenities in tow), the rocking \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Out Ta Get Me\\", the ode to heroin entitled \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"My Michelle\\", \\"Think About You\\", \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Anything Goes\\" and the closing epic \\"Rocket Queen\\" all rock, especially Rocket Queen which is probably my favorite Guns 'n' Roses track ever.<br />Guns and Roses will always be Slash, Axl, Duff, Matt, Steven and Izzy IMHO. Any other incarnation like Axl and friends just isn't Guns n'Roses to me.<br />If you want to hear good old killer hard rock, buy Appetite For Destruction (as over 18 million copies have been rightfully sold to date)!<br />Highly recommended!ooked this album for a long time as radio, MTV, certain siblings of mine and junior high school classmates overkilled it with playing and airing but today it has held up extremely well.

0525950079|5.0|We're frankly a little surprised that \\"World Without End\\" is getting somewhat mixed reviews, although most are in the 4-5 of 5-star territory.  We immensely enjoyed Ken Follett's original \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", a tale he penned in 1989, set in 12th century England.  This saga, revealed through mostly the life of Jack Builder, named for his Herculean efforts to design and build a massive Cathedral in medieval Knightsbridge, taught us much about the church's positive role in spawning human and economic development, while entertaining with stories of love and life in hard times.  We frankly didn't know how well a sequel to that great work would fly.<br /><br />To our delight, if anything, we feel \\"World\\" might eventually be regarded as Follett's masterpiece.  Set 200 years later, again in Knightsbridge, we follow predominantly the lives of four leading characters, whose lives overlap in an almost unbelievable set of developments over the roughly 40-year span of the tome:  Ralph, who would become a ruthless soldier and tyrant; his brother Merthin, eventually an incredibly smart architect and businessman; Caris, the intelligent and ambitious daughter of a wealthy merchant whose every effort to \\"get ahead\\" seemed to be foiled in the most dastardly of manners; and Gwenda, a poor wench who scrabbles for everything her entire life.  Meanwhile, the church is now little more than a handicap to anything progressive, and does its best to inhibit the advance of medicine, architecture, business, and the feudal system of land use.  And so again we have a saga of love and hate, morality and immorality, good versus evil, science versus religion, and so on.  By the end of these ten hundred and fourteen pages, the sustained suspense is such we can hardly put the book down!!<br /><br />While some of the murders and sexual scenarios herein are not for the feint of heart, not to mention enough heartaches and storyline twists that we sometimes wonder how much more we can stand, we come away feeling we have just read one of the great books of our times.  Despite its setting of some 800 years in the past, Follett's ability to educate us, entertain us, and draw us into his fascinating story are really pretty incredible.  This one goes onto our lifetime top 20 list - and we'd give it 10 stars if we could !!ave just read one of the great books of our times.

B000002GBB|5.0|Chicago based rockers Styx released its eighth album coincidentally titled Pieces of Eight in September of 1978.<br />The album was their fourth for A&M and was the band's fourth self-produced disc.<br />The cover art is just as gripping and was designed by Storm Thorgerson and Hipgnosis, the same people responsible for album sleeves from Pink Floyd, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Yes and many others.<br />I first got this album on cassette at age 9 on July 12, 1985 and loved it from first listen (we need a remastered CD of this).<br />The album kicks off with one of guitarist James \\"JY\\" Young's best rockers \\"Great White Hope\\", a song about the pressure of being an underdog (the band maintained this mentality throught the rest of the DeYoung years). Next was the JY and keyboard player Dennis DeYoung collaboration \\"I'm OK\\" with Dennis on lead vocal, organ and synthesizer and pipe organ and had excellent guitar solos by Tommy Shaw. Tommy wrote and sang the next track \\"Sing For the Day\\", which was like Crystal Ball, a folk-influenced tune but unlike it, it has no distorted electric guitar and sounds like a song from medieval times although synthesizers, bass guitars and drum kits were not invented in the medieval period. The track has superb harmonies by Tommy (who sang the highest parts) and Dennis (the lowest parts). The first half concluded with two Dennis compositions, the synthesizer collage instrumental \\"The Message\\" (which proved that Dennis is the greatest American rock keyboardist that ever walked, not bad for an accordion player) and the first half closing majestic \\"Lords of the Ring\\" with JY on vocal and JY and Tommy doing lead guitar solos in the middle and end of the track respectively (Dennis always was generous on letting the other members share the spotlight which is something JY and Tommy have forgotten about in recent years).<br />Side two starts with the Top 30 hit \\"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\\" written, sung and guitar solos by Tommy and is one of the greatest Styx rockers ever. Next is the second JY and Dennis collaboration on the album \\"Queen of Spades\\" with the former playing some killer guitar and the latter on vocals and had that sinister laugh on the track before the final chorus. Tommy Shaw's \\"Renegade\\" follows and was the Top 20 hit from the album and featured great guitar work by JY and is one Hell of a song. Next is the title cut, written and sung by Dennis, and with lead guitar by Tommy and is one of Dennis' best ballads which was the bench mark for what style he would continue to write in on all subsequent albums. The album concludes with the Tommy instrumental \\"Aku-Aku\\" which was a nice way to end another masterpiece jewel in Styx's A&M crown of classic albums.<br />Pieces of Eight was the third album with the band's classic lineup and their second consecutive Triple Platinum seller peaking at #6 here in the States and for good reason, the songs on here are Styx at their hard-rocking best.<br />The album still sounds fresh for a 27 year old recording. Styx in my view will always be Dennis, the rhythm section brothers drummer John and bass player Chuck Panozzo, JY and Tommy but the new version without Dennis isn't Styx to me.<br />Scoop this album up if you are a fan of classic 70s American rock that really rocks.rs ever.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Writer and director Brad Bird offers a hilarious, generous take on food snobbery in \\"Ratatouille\\". Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose discerning palette has earned him the derision of his fellow rodents and the wrath of humans horrified to find a rat plundering their pantries. Fleeing one of his kitchen adventures, Remy lands in Paris, food snob capital of the world and home to Gusteau's, the restaurant of Remy's culinary hero. The restaurant's reputation has dimmed since the great chef's death, and a garbage boy named Linguine (Lou Romano) tampering with the soup doesn't bode well. When Remy intervenes to save the soup, he enables an unprecedented human-rat collaboration that may restore Gusteau's to its former glory -if the Head Chef (Ian Holm) doesn't sabotage his success.<br /><br />The folks at Pixar have rediscovered how to make an animated film to please all ages. \\"Ratatouille\\" is Pixar's best animated feature since 2001's \\"Monsters, Inc.\\".

B000002GB9|5.0|Chicago based art rockers Styx released its seventh album in as many years entitled The Grand Illusion on fittingly July 7, 1977 (7/7/77) to an unsuspecting audience around the world.<br />After seven years of success in the mid-west US and in Canada (but national acclaim alluding the band), Styx (which comprised of singer/keyboard player/songwriter Dennis DeYoung, guitarist/singer/songwriter Tommy Shaw, guitarist James \\"JY\\" Young and the rhythm section Panozzo brothers drummer John and bass player Chuck) were on the verge of being dropped from A&M Records if the next album would do worse than either Equinox or Crystal Ball. The members of Styx didn't need to worry as (metaphorically) the number seven would prove to be Styx's magic number.<br />I first bought this album after hearing the live versions of Tommy Shaw's \\"Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\\" (a US Top 30 hit), James \\"JY\\" Young's \\"Miss America\\" (which was inspired by the Miss America pageants and musically by Jethro Tull's \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\") and of course Dennis DeYoung's classic second US Top 10 hit \\"Come Sail Away\\" (later humorously covered by the character Eric Cartman on South Park) on the double live album Caught in the Act, which I got on tape in 1984 (I was eight then).<br />I subsequently received The Grand Illusion on cassette when I was 9 in March, 1985 (bought it at Caldor for $5 in my native Brockton, MA) and was immediately blown away by every song including Dennis' classic rock radio staple title cut about not being fooled by what the celebs and glamorous people's fake lives, the Shaw/DeYoung/Young collaboration \\"Superstars\\", plus the underrated gems such as Tommy's \\"Man in the Wilderness\\" (a great track ) and Dennis' masterpiece (my personal favorite Styx track) \\"Castle Walls\\" (which he resurrected for his solo shows in recent years at the behest of his youngest son Matthew who said that was the best Styx song ever and lyrically was written at a dark time in Dennis' life  and was musically inspired by The Exorcist the movie, ironically Styx member Tommy Shaw would later date that film's famed star Linda Blair (around either 1980 or 1981 was when they dated)) and the concluding reprise to the title cut dubbed \\"The Grand Finale\\" (a half-step lower and tempo slower than the title cut).<br />I eventually got the CD version of the album in November of 1993 and then rebought the disc after it got stolen but is the one Styx album one should own. Also, the classic Kelley and Mouse Studios cover is still one of rock's greatest album sleeves ever.<br />The Grand Illusion was Styx's first US Top 10 album peaking at #6 here in the US and would be the first of FOUR Triple Platinum (FIVE Double Platinum) albums in a row for the band!<br />I love this album and hope they remaster it soon.

B000002H33|5.0|San Francisco based heavy metal rockers Metallica's third album, 1986's Master of Puppets, was the second jewel in Metallica's triple crown of classic thrash metal era albums (the other two were 1984's major label debut Ride the Lightning and 1988's Top 10 charting And Justice For All).<br />After the Ride the Lightning tour was over, Metallica (which was comprised of once again singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and bass player Cliff Burton(on his last album with the band here)) went back to Denmark with Flemming Rasmussen once again engineering and this time also co-producing to create arguably one of metal's masterpieces as I found out in December of 1987 when I was given this album on tape.<br />This album begins with the masterpiece \\"Battery\\". At first listen, it sounds like it is going to start off to be an acoustic piece but then it goes into full throttle heavy metal and you are in for a ride on this album which some say is better than its predecessor, 1984's Ride the Lightning (I like Ride a tad better). Next, is the title cut which is one of Metallica's best songs and James Hetfield even gets to do a guitar solo here and he is no slouch on lead. \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" follows and is another great rocker as well. The first half ends with \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", which is arguably the best song from the Burton era next to Fade to Black.<br />The second half of this album is strong also and we kick things off with another thrashy rocker \\"Disposable Heroes\\" which just tears the roof off. We then follow with another great rocker called \\"Leper Messiah\\". Next was the album's obligatory instrumental entitled \\"Orion\\" and it is a great piece of music and features a stellar bass solo from Cliff. The album ends like it began with another speed rocker \\"Damage Inc.\\" and does not fail.<br />This album was the first Metallica album to go hit the US Top 30 and went Platinum without either a radio hit or a video, it just goes to show you didn't need MTV for fame but opening for metal legend Ozzy Osbourne helped Metallica get poised for stardom.<br />However, tragedy struck and on the band's headlining European tour that September as bass player Cliff Burton passed away at the age of 24 in a bus crash in Sweden after their bus skidded off the road. Master of Puppets is a fitting epitaph to the majesty of Metallica's first lineup.<br />If you are new Metallica, buy Kill, Lightning, Master, Justice and The Black Album and then the later catalog.<br />Highly recommended!goes to show you didn't need MTV for fame but opening for metal legend Ozzy Osbourne helped Metallica get poised for stardom.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album impresses me more each time I listen to it. All of the emotions Bruce and the E Street Band illicit are profound for me. Hope, Joy, Freedom, Anger, Despair, Resolve. It is at once comforting and provoking, songs written by the talented, world-wise Springsteen, performed and arranged to perfection. The themes are familiar yet fresh and applicable to the world right now. And isn't that what all Springsteen classics are? The production could be sharper but I'm loathe to criticize anything about Magic, not because Bruce is untouchable, but because this album truly deserves its title. It's Magic, through and through.  I bought all of Bruce's incarnations. I road the Tom Joad and Devils and Dust trains, got on board We Shall Overcome. And I enjoyed the detours. But this is a homecoming for the E Street Band and fans of Bruce's classic sound. It feels powerful yet effortless. It feels like home on a day when the world is an exciting, interesting place to live. And even on a mundane day, it's okay. Turn it up.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever.<br />First released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release.<br />After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette.<br />The album starts off with \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with \\"Fade to Black\\" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale.<br />The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number \\"Escape\\". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks \\"Creeping Death\\" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively.<br />While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today.<br />Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you.<br />Highly recommended!come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks \\"Creeping Death\\" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN films are something of legend amongst the comic-book-to-film fans. The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million [[ASIN:B00005JPFV Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.<br /><br />But no...<br /><br />Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.<br /><br />This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, [[ASIN:B000OY8NBK The Good German]]) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco ([[ASIN:B000EPFCPE Tristan and Isolde]]); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily \\"more,\\" if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.<br /><br />Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud!<br /><br />It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst ([[ASIN:B000CNESJO Elizabethtown]]) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.<br /><br />Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.<br /><br />It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.<br /><br />Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as \\"the bad one.\\" We can all hope that Mr. Raimi gets back to doing character shots that help strengthen our superhero rather than making him appear like a crybaby.ets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.

B000000OQY|5.0|Guns and Roses' second major label release G 'N' R Lies was released in November of 1988.<br />Lies was released as a sort of cash-in on the success of the band's debut blockbuster Appetite for Destruction.<br />The album comprised of two EPs in one album. First, the long deleted Live Like a Suicide is comprised of covers namely Aerosmith's \\"Mama Kin\\" and the superb \\"Nice Boys\\". Ironically, the latter was what the band were not to the press as their image of being bad boy rockers followed them. \\"Reckless Life\\" and \\"Move to the City\\" were great tracks as well.<br />The second of the two EPs on this album was G'N'R semi-unplugged. First song is the ballad \\"Patience\\" which was a huge hit and was one of the first tracks to have Axl sing in a lower octave for almost an entire song for a change rather than hearing him screech (which was his trademark) and is a great ballad. \\"Used to Love Her\\" is a funny ode to Axl's dog and not a song about him killing his girlfriend/wife as many sexists claim. An acoustic remake of the Appetite track \\"You're Crazy\\" is arguably better in its slow, unplugged style with Axl singing rather than screaming half the time. The controversial \\"One in a Million\\" closes the album with its lyrics which caused certain groups to call G'n'R racist, anti-gays, etc but the words were used to describe low-lifes and those supporting drug habits.<br />As always, the album hit the US Top 5 and sold millions. Unfortunately, this was the last gasp with original drummer Steven Adler as he was dismissed from the band in 1990.<br />Recommended!

074356619X|5.0|I am totally and always inspired by this audio.  It has much more than the DVD movie.  I listen to it wherever I go in my vehicle.  I never grow tired of this.  It's much much more than positive thinking.  It's soul changing unlocking what we inherently know deep down.
075640407X|5.0|Basically, the book was one of the most engrossing and well developed books I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  It is classic storytelling literature that doesn't overpower you with flowery adjectives or confusing ideas.      For comparison, it felt like when I read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in my youth.  It is very vivid and I was experiencing Kvothe's growth as a young man as though I was there.  Twain was a great \\"storyteller\\" in the sense that you experienced what was happening in the books rather than just reading text and comprehending it.  Rothfuss comes across in a similar way and brings you along for a ride rather than making you work to get through chapters of a book.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I wasn't keeping up with the current projects of the Eagles, but I have always been a long time fan. I saw them in concert two years ago for the first time, and I thought, the Eagles are simply awesome. I didn't even know they were coming out with a new album. So, when I happened to be at Sam's club and saw the 20 song CD, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the Eagles? 20 songs? something in it will be worth listening to. Man, am I glad that I picked it up. There are a few songs that I probably won't listen to very often, and how can there not be with 20 songs. Maybe some of the people that don't really like it, are people that were waiting, and expecting too much. They were way too hyped up. Usually, when we get too hyped up, we are disappointed. Let's face it, classics are classics. Maybe some day this album will have a couple classic songs, maybe not. In the mean time, I'll just in enjoy some great new Eagles tunes.     A few have complained about the sappy ballads, but I personally like the ballads (from all rock bands), so sue me.    Personal favorites (not necessarily in this order):    Long Road out of Eden - Epic - yes, Hotel California - no; Whatever the case I love Epic songs especially when they have a great sound and this one has it.    How Long - Classic Eagles Southern Rock sound    Waiting in the Weeds - Love the melody of the chorus - song gave me chills - the lyrics are great    Busy Being Fabulous - Don Henley, what can I say    No More Cloudy Days - I actually heard this in concert 2 years ago.    Your Not Alone - Great lyrics and it brought out some great emotions that I have for my own daughter (Glenn wrote for his teenage daughter)    Do Something - Reminds me of \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\", which I love.    Somebody - I swear I've heard this song before, but whatever, I love it, then again, I love almost anything that Don sings.    Frail Grasp on the Big Picture - I like it, but it is sort of a remake (different sound/beat though) of \\"Get Over It\\" from Hell Freezes Over.  I like the last part, where he says, \\"And we pray to our lord, who we know is America...\\"    I will need to listen to the CDs a few more time, but I liked all of these songs on the first pass.    I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Before the release of her second major LP, Christina Aguilera was an unsatisfied pop superstar. Although her debut album had sold well over 10 million copies the world over, her face a fixture in all the hottest magazines, and with legions of drooling fans, she knew the material she was singing muffled her gift.     Determined to become a true artist, she brings \\"Stripped,\\" a defiant statement of sexuality, love,  and self-confidence. Although clear on her first record, \\"Stripped\\" clenches Aguilera's grip as a premier vocalist. Displaying raw power and a range rarely seen in today's music market, Aguilera sweeps and swoons effortlessly on each track, dispaying extraordinary versatility with diverse subject matter. Songs like \\"Walk Away,\\" a smokey, sinfully sweet ode to an addictive lover, and \\"Impossible,\\" a strong R&B statement cowritten and produced by soulful songstress Alicia Keys, showcase an incredibly captivating singer. Aguilera's conviction to what she sings shows on each track, from anthemic rockers like \\"Fighter\\" to chilling, autobiographical songs of abuse like \\"I'm OK.\\" Although created at the tender age of 21, \\"Stripped\\" provides the proper grown-up music suitable for Aguilera's grown-up voice.     The only qualm is that at 20 tracks, Aguilera gives slightly too much of a good thing. While still enjoyable, one may need more than one sitting to fully appreciate this great album.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|I wanted to like this film because it seemed like it had something important to say about the human condition.  Instead it turned out to be a disappointing mess.  There's no explanation given for the major premise of the movie (universal infertility) and very little background to any of the major characters.  Michael Caine is mostly annoying with the way he keeps saying \\"Amigo\\" over and over again.  He should be forced to give back his Oscar after this performance.  Our hero acts like a numbskull - he thinks the best thing to do with the first baby in 18 years is to row out into the ocean in a dinky boat on the off chance that they might meet some \\"rescue\\" group he has no personal knowledge of and, oh by the way, he's bleeding to death.  But the most pathetic part of this DVD is the featurette entitled \\"The Possibility of Hope\\".  This is a disjointed, moronic rant against the evils of market capitalism.  Yes, the same free market that raised our standard of living to an all time high and brought us such advances as the Internet, cell phones, jet travel, microwave ovens, modern medicine and a Starbucks on every corner.  The solution, according to the assembled experts, seems to be taking another crack at Soviet style communism.  Gee whiz,that sure worked out well the first time didn't it?  What a bunch of morons.  The bleak future portrayed in the movie is a lot closer to the smoldering ruins of Marxism than it is to vibrant, thriving Western cities like London, New York and LA.  Don't waste your time on this nonsense.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I must say, I was thoroughly delighted by this movie.  Pixar has truly done it again.  Was there more violence, compared to previous Pixar adventures?  Yes.  Was it a rat in the kitchen, supporting a possibly disease laden food supply?  Yes.  Was it more adult than other Pixar movies?  A RESOUNDING yes.    I think Pixar is realizing that not all movies have to be aimed at children, but \\"young-at-heart\\" is going to be a cash cow.  I loved this movie.  I read many complaints about this one, from \\"violent\\" to \\"too loud\\".  All I can say to those people is \\"get over it...\\"  It was neither.  Violent?  Please...  Disney's (Pixar's PARENT, people...) \\"Little Mermaid\\" had as much violence in the kitchen when Chef Louis was going after Sebastian.  Horror?  How about when Ursula was stabbed by the boat's bow in the tempest?  These people need to get lives.  They watch as much violence on TV, and they let their kids watch the Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh, Transformers, Pikachu, Harry Potter, (not to mention the totally anti-Christian belief in \\"super-powers\\" and witchcraft, but I'm not going THERE!) the list goes on....  Violence aplenty there...  These people are two-faced and support double standards.    I can't say enough how much I loved this movie.  A highly recommended fun-filled, emotion-charged, love-story.  Yep, a love-story.  (There's always a twist, isn't there?)  See it.  In fact, don't bother renting it, just buy it, you'll love it.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I admit it:  I LOVE Christmas music!  Every year, on November 1, I begin listening to my collection of Christmas CDs.  (Oh, that's not entirely true; I have one Christmas CD loaded in my car that I blast whenever I need a \\"fix,\\" despite the season!)    If you like Sarah McLachlan, you'll relish \\"Wintersong.\\"  My sweet husband tolerates my eclectic Christmas music taste rather well---everything from Andy Williams to Vanessa Williams---but he adores Sarah's \\"Wintersong.\\"    \\"River\\" and \\"Christmas Time is Here,\\" the third and last track, respectively, are two favorites, but all the selections are superb.  Truly, \\"Wintersong\\" is a stellar compilation of traditional and unique Christmas tunes.      Be an elf to yourself and purchase \\"Wintersong.\\"  One of my greatest pleasures in life is listening to Christmas music as I wrap presents, and \\"Wintersong\\" is certainly inspirational for gift-wrapping!        After posting this review, I'm ordering three more for birthday and Thanksgiving gifts so the recipients can enjoy \\"Wintersong\\" before the holidays!      Wishing you all a blessed Yuletide!
0525950079|2.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" years ago but never forgot the detailed history, the splendor of this story about the building of the cathedral and the enormously entertaining story of Tom the builder and his family.  I loved that book and so it was with eager anticipation that I started World Without End.  Sad to say, this is no \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". This is over a thousand pages of gratuitous sex, mindless killing and people who are very very good, or very very bad. Not one character is likeable or engaging.  Follet's historical background of England and the Church  at this time, adds depth to the book but that's about all that I found enjoyable.    This book was a huge disappointment. It lacks Follet's previous expressions of the glory man offers up to God  and his deep appreciation for the accomplishments of man, the engaging characters and the grand sweep of history found in \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". Perhaps this book falters because it lacks the cohesive element of the building of a great cathedral but whatever the reason  I don't recommmend this book unless you are a diehard fan of historical novels and have time to burn.  I slogged to the finish  which says something in the writer's favor but it was an effort.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|this cd is great. i love every song on it. rihanna has a new sound on it and i hope it stays. there's lots of great beats and awesome duets. definetly an excellent addition to any cd collection!
0525950079|5.0|Pillars of the Earth is one of my favorite books of all time: so much so that when I went to Europe several years ago, I carved out an afternoon in Paris to go to St. Denis to see the buttresses.  We also had an excursion to the Salisbury Cathedral to see that amazing architecture personally.  I was thrilled to learn he was writing about the middle ages again, and I lost sleep for several days because I just didn't want to leave Kingbridge behind.  His discussion about the rift between male and female religious was interesting (and continues today in many cases).  The vividness of the plague was compelling.  The protagonist was as awful as they come, and his demise was, frankly, delicious.  Knowing that Follet does his homework, it was interesting to learn about the impact of the plague on serfs, and the changing structure of the economy of England.  An excellent read!
B00005JPS5|3.0|Jerry Seinfeld has been away from the spotlight for some time now and 2007 marks the year of his return - but only as a voice in a computer animated film. While the premise is unique, the approach is generic, and the excellently animated, poorly executed family film will have difficulty avoiding the already popular classification that Bee Movie is indeed a B-movie.<br /><br />Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is an average bee approaching adulthood, who must decide upon a job in the hive. The catch is that once he chooses his job, he must keep it for the rest of his life. Unsatisfied with the monotony of working in the hive, he ventures outside where he meets a human woman, Vanessa (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), who saves his life. Indebted, he breaks the Cardinal bee rule: never talk to humans. At first Vanessa has difficulty accepting the talking bee, but the two soon spend quite a bit of time together and Barry gets overly comfortable as she reveals that she is a florist. Enamored with Vanessa, despite the interspecies barrier, Barry learns that humans have been stealing honey from bees and selling and eating it. Infuriated, he sets out to sue the honey company, with the help of Vanessa and his bee pals.<br /><br />Apparently bees drive cars, they are all cousins, and they can use their antennas as cell phones. The comical world the creators have devised for the bees is perhaps the most creative aspect of the film. Many parallels reside with Barry's rebellious teen years and human childhood, as specifically referenced by a sensationally hysterical homage to The Graduate. From voting the queen bee into monarchy, to pollination, to insects on windshields and their attraction to lights, many of the typical insect behaviors are addressed and translated into humorous gags - supposedly their thinking is shockingly similar to humans.<br /><br />The animation (from Dreamworks, the studio that brought us Shrek) as always continues to excel in its realism, from the cartoon movements and facial expressions of the characters, to the nearly flawless reflections and refractions of the inanimate objects and background environments. Barry gets stuck to a tennis ball and batted around in slow motion, and sucked into the engine of a car: both scenes and many more are executed with amazing editing and stunning camera movement that can only be achieved in computer animation.<br /><br />Hysterical character designs and voice acting also add to the fun, with jocose performances by John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, Chris Rock and even voice cameos by Michael Richards (who many joked would play the role of an Africanized bee) and Larry King as Bee Larry King. What doesn't work as well is the execution of the story. The film often contradicts itself with the reactions of the humans to talking bees, and with what Barry is capable of realistically doing as nothing more than a heavily personified insect. Some of the jokes elicit laughter, but most are on an unexpectedly low intelligence level, and ultimately the many entertaining bits are specifically aimed at younger audiences. As is often with computer animated films, visual perfection oftentimes overshadows the time spent trying to devise an enticing story, and Bee Movie falls in with the too-kid-friendly films that are quickly forgotten.<br /><br />- Mike Massiethe characters, to the nearly flawless reflections and refractions of the inanimate objects and background environments.

0143038419|5.0|I am about half way through this book. Elizabeth Gilbert is a very bright author, witty, but very serious and enlightening too.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Okay... I don't write many reviews but for this particular purchase, I felt I had to make an exception.  Along with most other fans, I was worried about the future of Nightwish after all of the (somewhat) recent hullabaloo over the band's change of lead singer. Those worries, I am pleased to say, were completely unnecessary.  Right up front I will say that this is one of the best albums I've had the pleasure of listening to.  The opening song \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" grabs you by the throat and holds you enthralled for its entire 14 minute duration.  It is classic Nightwish - powerful and bombastic, soft and melancholy - full of musical twists and turns and amazing lyrics; epic in every sense of the word.  Wow.  And that is only the beginning.      I won't go into a track by track analysis because so many others have done a better job with that then I ever could (and these things are so subjective anyway).  Let it suffice to say that unlike any other Nightwish album (and I own and love them all), there is not one single track on this album that I have any urge to skip over.  Not one.  Even after many repeated spins. There is so much variety in the musical styles presented here that the sound never becomes boring or repetitive. Yet it all the while maintains that distinctive flavor that is uniquely Nightwish; with the power to evoke a visceral response in the listener (me). That, to me, is quite an accomplishment.      Now, I don't really want to bring up any singer comparisons here because it has already been hashed to death (and not always in the most respectful fashion, which is a shame), but I will say, while not the soprano we're used to, Anette Olzon is a powerful vocalist in her own right.  And as the new lead singer for Nightwish, she services the music very well.  Exceptionally well, in fact.  This is made all the more impressive considering the album was not tailored to her particular strengths.  The songs were written and the music recorded before she was even brought on board.  That being the case, I can't wait to see what the \\"new\\" Nightwish has in store for future albums where her input will have more consideration.  But she does a very, very fine job here.  Her voice is warm and accessible but can pack considerable punch.  And her vocals blend with Marco's beautifully (\\"The Islander\\" made my jaw drop).  I can't wait to hear more harmonizing from them in the future.  Consider me a fan.    I know that certain aspects of this album are going to be nitpicked to death because of the controversy surrounding the band's lineup.  But music is so subjective and everyone's tastes are so different.  So I guess what I really would like to say is, regardless of any of the reviews you've read (mine included), if you are a fan of Nightwish or are someone just looking for some new music to try, you owe it to yourself to give this album a listen without bias (or at least with an open mind).  Hopefully, you'll decide it's worth picking up. I did.  And I couldn't be more pleased.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I wish this show didn't end.  I'm watching and rewatching the DVDs all the time just so I don't miss it so much. My most favorite show EVER!  And that's saying a lot! You must get the whole series.  There's no doubt about it! You'll be friends with the most lovable characters on TV-land.  You'll love them so much that you'll wish your town could be just like Stars Hollow.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|after hearing that it did not gross as expected in the US and overseas, i felt it was very unfair for warner bros and the people involved.  the movie is a great masterpiece by petersen. in order to truly appreciate this gem, please do not put into your mind that an earlier version existed, 1972's poseidon adventure.<br /><br />poseidon does not waste any second to show the tragey that befell the luxury ship. more graphic, more violent and more realistic, the movie presented real life situations that one must encounter in the face of the capsizing (and eventual sinking) of the ship.<br /><br />the actors are all well known in their respctive genres: freddy rodriguez (six feet under) emma rossum (the day after tomorrow/phantom of the opera), richard dreyfus (jaws/close encounters), josh lucas (deep end/sweet home alabama), kurt russel (soldier/backdraft/unlawful entry, and so many others!), and mike vogel (texas chainsaw massacre/supercross). it even starred black eyed peas' stacy ferguson (fergie - my humps, shut up, clumsy, glamorous, big girls dont cry) in a special (and tragic) role.<br /><br />the story was based on a novel by gallico about rogue waves. petersen gave the book and original movie a fresh take and makes it his own.<br /><br />the second disc featured behind the scenes look of the movie. after watching this, the more that you will appreciate the movie for all the efforts (and flawless effects) thrown in the movie. it did offer something new not in the original movie - the luxury ship sank!<br /><br />i guess all the negative reviews before are so unfair. the movie is great and i have my own dvd to prove it!<br /><br />buy it: if you are more into an action-packed remake than the original 1972 drama version of the movie.<br /><br />avoid it: if you liked the original version better.<br /><br />im looking forward to petersen's next movie. i also liked his \\"perfect storm\\" by the way.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the beginnings of one of my favorite TV shows. The characters, stories and action are exciting, and getting to watch on DVD is unbeatable. Anyone who's into legal dramas and hasn't seen much of The Practice should indulge themselves. I can't wait till more DVDs are available!    One thing that makes this series stand out is the way it explores the human element of the law business. We see defense/litigation attorneys, prosecutors, and judges, as normal people. Shades of gray in the law itself are debated, along with the biases of everyone involved. Defendants and litigants involve themselves in decisions, often using their own knowledge of the legal system, in hopes of contributing to or manipulating their cases. And, we get to see into the characters' personal lives, often in very entertaining ways.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Haven't listened to Avenged before this cd.  Its not normally something i would listen to but i figured that i would give them a shot...while its not something that i can say i will always listen to.  It is something that i can enjoy.  Obviously i'm not a hardcore Avenged Sevenfold fan or anything.  So i berate or debate on how this cd sucks compared to their previous one.  I just like listenting to City of Evil every now and then thats all i can say on it. A pretty decent release from the guys.
0143038419|5.0|I like the Italian experience but the India and Indonesia chapters were over the top. I totally enjoyed this book. It brought me to my own life spiritual challenges. Well Done!
B000093OUA|5.0|I thought this was a great CD, I think this was the first Gary Moore CD I bought. If you love the Blues, and are into heavy guitar, this CD is for you!
B00006JJ51|5.0|The rhymes feel a little 80s-style and the beats are minimalistic compared to what you'd hear today, but N.W.A. have a style and sense of humor that makes this album essential for hip-hop fans.
B00005JLR2|5.0|A truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation. The movie has a lot of heart, as you would expect from the directors of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. I don't think Treasure Planet will disappoint the imaginative audience.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|We got this DVD last night and watched it after dinner with our 5 year old. We did not see the movie in the theater and were excited to watch it.... actually we purchased it for christmas... but that didn't last. Our 5 year old was excited about the movie. The movie is very cute but I found myself wandering away from the movie and not caring if I was missing parts of it. Our 5 year old watched it but seemed that he would have been just as happy watching one of our other movies. So... while the movie is cute, and there are scenes that are funny, the story lags in places. I did enjoy the movie, and plan to watch the whole thing next time.... but I wish there was less running around the kitchen and maybe more story. Very cute and kids will love it.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I wasn't into James Blunt when his first album came out.  I was attracted to \\"1973\\" the first track from this album.  I didn't go wrong buying the CD.  It is great listening.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie, and thought the effects were fantastic.  It's too bad Tobey McGuire doesn't want to do any more SM films, but I still think this movie was a great prelude for several other Spider Man films.  Now we need to see if they will continue to follow the comic book stories and develop MJ's character.  The bad reviews had me expecting to be disappointed, but I really had fun watching this movie.  Tobey McGuire is a very versatile, talented actor!
B0050G3NWG|5.0|After the disappointing previous DVD release of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" which was gray, smeary and over-processed to the point of looking like it was shot on videotape instead of film, I was hoping the new hi-def Blu-Ray version would reverse those errors are restore the evocatively shadowy and contrasty look of cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful black-and-white photography. It does so, and more. The images are now perfect, pristine, luminous; the shadows are deep and black, the whites sparkle.  Faces that were intended to be in deep shadow are. With the photographic style of the film meticulously honored in this hi-def version, it is amazing how compelling the images are, and how they convey and deepen the poetic and psychological aspects of the story.  After watching this movie at least 25 times -- first on TV in the 50s (where its modern reputation began to build), later on 16mm and 35mm film, VHS and DVD -- watching this hi-def Blu-Ray is almost like seeing it for the first time, with the subtlety and nuance of the images visible as never before.  The sound is also perfect.  Pops, hiss, clicks: all gone.  Bernard Hermann's music regains its startling and layered complexity, and Welles' orchestration of every aspect of the soundtrack (using techniques from his years directing radio dramas) is a master class in sound design.  If you have one of the old DVDs, now's the time to upgrade.  On this 2011 Blu-Ray disc, \\"Citizen Kane\\" is brand new again, and timeless.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book is a significant film for several reasons. First, it was the last film that Walt Disney himself was involved in directly. Walt had not been happy with some of the company's recent efforts such as \\"Sword in the Stone\\" and he took a more hands-on role with Jungle Book. Unfortunately, Disney would not see the fruits of his efforts. He passed away in December 1966, about seven months before the film was released. Still, Disney's handprints are all over the film. Initially conceived as a darker, more dramatic film, and more influenced by Rudyard Kipling's original story, Disney tossed out the idea, along with the original director. The result was the last great Disney animated film before the company was rejuvenated in the 1990's with films like \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". By anyone's account, their films of the 70's and 80's were lacking the passion of earlier efforts.<br /><br />Yet another significant difference in this movie was the use of major Hollywood talent to supply the voices for most of the characters. This is common practice today but was not the norm in the 1960's. And you probably could not have selected a more eclectic group of actors. At one of the spectrum you have stately British actors Sebastion Cabot as Bagheera the Panther and George Sanders (one of Hollywood's great voices) as the sinister tiger Shere Khan. At the polar opposite was Comedian/actor /bandleader Phil Harris and his southern drawl playing happy-go-lucky bear Baloo, along with Jazz bandleader and swing singer Louis Prima as the voice of orangutan King Louis. Additional voices were provided by Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake. Holloway is better known for providing the voice of another Disney character, Winnie the Pooh. Ron Howard's brother, Clint, voiced baby elephant Junior. One other footnote, the singing voice of Shere Khan was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger, as well as the singer of the \\"Grinch\\" song.<br /><br />The story oh Jungle Book is simple. Little boy Mowgli was found in the jungle and raised by wolves. But when the wolves find out that the evil Shere Khan is returning to the jungle, they enlist the aid of Bagheera and Baloo to escort Mowgli back to the man village. The only problem is that Mowgli doesn't want to go. He's grown up in the jungle and the animals are his friends and only family. Complicating masters is not one, but three villains. Besides Shere Khan, Kaa and King Louie all want Mowgli for their own reasons. Bagheera and Baloo have to keep him safe from the villains and convince him that the man village is the best place for him.<br /><br />Jungle book contains two of the best songs in Disney history, \\"The Bare Necessities\\" and the swinging `I Wanna be Like You\\". These are timeless songs which were both Oscar-nominated. Not to be forgotten is the menacing and hypnotic \\"Trust in Me\\" sung by Kaa to Mowgli as he prepares to make a meal of him. It's a fantastic production and the animation is simply gorgeous. Watch the scene when Mowgli is walking by himself through the jungle, kicking at the ground. The fluidity of movement is perfect, and watch how his hair blows in the gentle breeze. 3D animation may be the rage today but there's nothing like outstanding 2D animation.<br /><br />This is the latest Disney classic to get the platinum treatment and while it doesn't have as many special features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it's still a solid lineup of extras. The making of documentary runs about 45 minutes and includes current and vintage interviews with many of the writers, animators, actors, and the composers who were involved in the project. This takes you through the complete process and there's great footage of Prima and his band dancing about as they perform \\"I Wanna Be Like you\\". In \\"Mowgli's Return to the Jungle\\", Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli, shares his memories of making the film and how the experiences influenced his current job as a wildlife filmmaker. Reitherman's father, Wolfgang, was the film's director.<br /><br />There's an interesting short featurette on a lost character from the film. The near-sighted, short-tempered rhinoceros named Rocky is brought to the screen using original storyboards and original voice recordings by Frank Fontaine. In addition there's a couple of other featurettes, audio commentary, sill gallery, music videos, and games. The word classic is over used today but it definitely applies to The Jungle Book. Forty years later this is still a wonderful film for the whole family.<br /><br />REVIEWED BY TIM JANSONher, Wolfgang, was the film's director.

B000VSBX34|5.0|When I was a kid in the early '70s, my local Baltimore TV station use to run something called, \\"The Million Dollar Movie\\". It featured loads of old movies featuring the likes of Abbott & Costello, Tarzan, Blondie (not the band) and King Kong. But every once in awhile in their rotation would pop up the 1965 Beatles movie, \\"Help!\\". Being about eight or so, I was instantly sucked in by this film's antic comedy style, crazy characters, exotic locations and instantly hummable songs. But most of all I was totally turned on by the Beatles and their charismatic screen presence. It was the begining of my 'long and winding road' of becoming a full fledge, Beatle-maniac.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the plotline is pretty simple. A crazy, Far East religious cult is about to make a human sacrifice. But wait! They can't make the sacrifice because the 'official sacrificial ring' (to be worn by the victim) is missing! Well of course the ring turns up on the jewlery bedecked finger of a certain Beatles drummer named Ringo Starr. The cult makes multiple comic attempts to steal the ring off his finger. When that fails, they spend the rest of the film chasing the Fab Four across the world (actually England, Austria and the Bahammas), while trying to douse poor Ringo in red paint and make him the next sacrificial offering!<br /><br />Is the plot ridiculous? Absurb? Even stupid? Sure! But who cares, because it is so outrageously funny! Its' basically a cross between a 'Road Runner/Looney Tune' and an old Marx Brothers movie. Like Groucho and his brothers, the plot is just a contrivance for John, Paul, George and Ringo to take on and mockingly make fun of society's staunch institutions. Through the sheer force of their free-spirited personalities and some really hilarious dialogue, they take a poke at religion, science, the govenment, police and military. Oh and lets not forget that between (and even during) the laughs, the boys are performing a few little musical ditties including \\"Help!\\", You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"The Night Before\\", \\"I Need you\\" and \\"Another Girl\\".<br /><br />The movie \\"Help!\\" was out of print, for what seems like forever. Now it has finally been released to the DVD format and it looks wonderful. The picture is crystal clear and the color just POPS! This is great for any Beatles fan, who is use to seeing just grainy black & white footage or decades, faded color. My hat is off to the restoration team (featured in the extras) that put this all together! Furthemore the soundtrack is just beautiful. After years of listening to the muddy soundtrack album it is a revelation to hear crystal clear versions of the Beatles music. Every guitar note, every bass thump, every cymbal crash is just pure joy!<br /><br />So here I am a couple of decades after I first saw \\"Help!\\" on local TV. I'm now a middle aged Dad, watching this DVD with my 6 year son, who's a Beatle-maniac in training (he got hooked on the Fab Four, after watching \\"Yellow Submarine\\").

B00028HBKM|4.0|Artistically, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a masterpiece.  It combines fine acting, good cinematography, truely disturbing though not pointless imagery, and even a couple of ancient languages (Latin and Aramaic).  It also got a lot of Christians thinking more about their Lord's sufferings.  On the whole these were the good parts and I recommend the film though it is suitable only for mature audiences.       The film is not perfect historically and I think it may have some theological weaknesses as well.  For instance, Greek should have been employed in the film and Christ was likely nailed to a Tau cross (T) rather than a Latin cross (t).  Dr. Zugibe does a nice but short critique of the film in his book \\"The Crucifixion of Jesus: Second Edition.\\"  Theologically, I think this film may make Christians look too much at Christ's physical sufferings.  After all, crucifixion is often considered one of the worst forms of execution but there are others likely as bad or worse.  Even regarding crucifixion, many men, women, and children have sadly died on crosses.  What made Christ's sufferings unique was the spiritual atoning angle, not purely physical pain.  That said, that may be imposible to capture well in a film so I should perhaps let Gibson off the hook there.  Overall, a well-made film that is not anti-semetic though it is not a film for all viewers.
B000UVT3OI|1.0|Dear Garth, I ALREADY OWN ALL YOUR ALBUMS, Therefore I do not need ANOTHER greatest hits collection but would LOVE the 4 songs in my ipod. HOWEVER your EGO/agent/Bank Account (however you want to look at it) will not let them be sold electronically. I refuse to purchase another set of the same music I have already PAID you for just to get 4 new songs. Besides don't you think after 10 years you could have released a complete CD of new material. If you are retired stay that way. PEACE    Just to confirm this is a shot at the marketing, not at Garth. I love GB however just to compare, Sara Evans New [[ASIN:B000V9KE3S Greatest Hits]] just got $4.00 from me for the same reason. I already owned all 5 CD's but unlike Garth I was able to go to iTunes and purchase the 4 new songs. Works Great for LONG TIME, complete discography ownership fans that do not need Greatest hit CD's.
B000FZESY4|5.0|I'm a big Opeth fan, and I really wanted this version of GR.     First, the artwork is outstanding, It has an excelent quality, really beautiful texture on the box.     I'm not going to comment on the cd, since there's no news that GR is one of the best metal albums of the last few years.    Regarding the DVD, the 'making of' is great, and it has some pretty cool interviews and nice scenes.    In closing, awesome buying :D
B000G759LW|1.0|My main problem with \\"back to basics\\" is the blatant ego of the singer that infests this album. Christina is not even close to the greatest singer, even in this current day and age. It's fairly obvious that she loves her own voice and wants to express the alleged greatness of it-- not just by riding the scales like Space Mountain but by one of the most narcissistic songs I've ever heard in my life. One of the said tracks, Here to Stay, portrays this beautifully. Also notable is the \\"Thank you\\" track, which serves more as a dedication to herself than the fans and their unreal testimonials.    What makes this joke of an album even more laughable is that of all the ditched efforts of making it actually good musically were invested in the appearance of the album cover art, tracklistings, credits, and whatnot. The music is utter garbage. The first disc is a compilation of boring songs that serve no purpose but to show off the singer's supposedly majestic, powerful voice. Something that can't be drilled into our heads enough; in fact it passes on to the second disc. The second disc samples the type of music that it's advertised to be inspired from, but fails to create a memorable listening experience. Why? Because it's nothing NEW.    And another thing: just because one was inspired by talented, soulful, legendary singers of the past does not make anyone a legendary soul singer in their own right. By listening to this album, you are hearing the voice of a girl who never had to break a sweat trying to break into this industry. Now that Ms. Mickey Mouse Club alumna has a man to rest her little head on, it surprises me that she's still hinting about her childhood past. It's easy to assume that she literally has nothing to say about herself, besides her boring relationship with her partner, yet her overt narcissism desperately tries to manipulate listeners into pouring out their sympathy to her. You're hearing the voice of a conceited little brat who thinks she's original andinnovative when throughout the span of her career she has done nothing that hasn't been done by somebody else.     Yes, Christina may have a better voice than some of her contemporaries, but that's the result of the fact that people are aiming REALLY low these days. Try out the less marketable but exceptionally talented, TRUE r&b singers who are doing wonderful things in music. Such as Keyshia Cole and Teedra Moses. A great jazz singer and saxaphone player that may be of interest is the lovely Mindi Abair. Go check her out as well.
B000001A3H|5.0|I love all of Kyuss's works, as well as Queens of the Stone Age and the Eagles of Death Metal (all projects of Josh Homme) and this album is where you can really see an evolution of their stoner-rock style.  It's a great album for background music while you're hanging out with friends.
B000002P7R|5.0|Excellent for a compilation of basically unfinished work. Alot of raw power and playing here. Of course its not as good as Jimi's first three studio albums, Band of Gypsies or Live at Woodstock, but I listen to this alot more than First Rays of the New Rising Sun even though (or because) it is not as polished or clean. I prefer the raw, more bluesy sound here. Not something Jimi would have released but still recommended for Hendrix fans.
0553805460|5.0|Wow, I just finished The Wolf of Wall Street and I must say that I feel like I have known Mr. Belfort for the past 20 years.  Whether that is a good or bad thing I'm not quite sure; nonetheless, I feel that this book is essential for any aspiring stockbroker, panhandler, or existentialist as a warning sign (or a welcome sign) before one embarks on their pursuit of materialistic happiness. On a side, I apologize to you Mr. Belfort for I did not purchase your book because I felt it was the least I could do in repaying the favor of the thousands you scammed throughout your life. However, I must admit that I drove the employees at my local bookstore crazy for coming in daily to read the book.  For anyone to regard the book as a \\"joke\\" without having actually read it simply on the basis of Mr. Belfort's unfair business tactics they are being completely naïve and overly prejudice. Fact of the matter is, you must take the book for what it is: a suspenseful autobiography preaching the lessons in life of personal prosperity. Don't get me wrong; I am the first to admit that Mr. Belfort is a no-good swindling thieve that deserves far more than the merely 20 months in prison and the 25 days in a drug rehabilitation center (which seemed more like a five star resort by the way he depicts it) that he received, but all things considered, you cannot dispute the fact that the man is a pathological genius with a true knack for center stage. In the book he keeps you on the edge of your seat anticipating every next move that he is about to make, all the while bringing it home with antipathetic-twists and counter foreshadowing.  The greatest part of it all is that he does not have to think up some enthralling frictional plot to focus his next literary move around; rather, he simply follows his blueprints that consist of merely chronological journal entries. He is absolutely correct when he states that he believes his life is the perfect script for a movie and the 2010 movie debut with DeCaprio further reinforces this notion. Ultimately, this is a must read, mustn't support book that can teach essential lessons in life on numerous different levels. I'm glad that he pitched a sequel in the last line of the book because that gives me more of a reason to hangout at the bookstore in the future than simply to check out the pretty girls there. :)

0316067598|3.0|This book started off well, had me on the edge of my seat while reading about the SEAL training and the doomed mission in the mountains of Afghanistan. All very interesting. BUT. What I really could do without was the never-ending all-American, excuse me, all-Texan, good ol' boy, Christian comments of the writer, the incessant attacks on the 'liberal media' and the  over-the-top evangelical stuff. Most readers of 'Lone Survivor' must have read \\"Bravo Two Zero\\" by Andy McNab. Just compare that book to this one. McNab does a much better job in writing down his thoughts, you really can identify with him. I had no such feeling for  Lutrell, unfortunately, though of course I do recognise his unbelievable actions. The similarities between those two mission btw is astonishing : both highly secretive special ops missions were totally screwed because of... goats.     Anyway, this book is well worth reading but certainly not a classic. Bravo Two Zero is, because Andy McNab just writes about the things that happened to him, and he let his readers judge for themselves about who or what is to blame for his misfortunes. Does Lutrell really want me to believe that US Special Forces have discussions about the US 'liberal media' while they are having to make split-second, live-and-death decisions? If that's anywhere near true, than the US Army is in a bad shape.    And may I add a little highly controversial point perhaps? I dare to call into question wheter all of the things Lutrell describes (during and after the firefight) really happened that way. Sometimes there's just too much unbelievable Rambo-stuff going on. I hope I'm wrong.

B000Y179KO|5.0|The Eagles are back with an excellent new disc.  This disc is rock, but these musicians also blend some country stylings in their music.  However you want to classify the Eagles, they are one of the most successful bands in history.  My favorite track is \\"How Long\\".  Glenn Frey sounds great singing lead vocals on this fun song.  \\"What Do I Do With My Heart\\" is a beautiful love song with Tim singing lead vocals.  \\"Last Good Time In Town\\" is anoher standout track with Joe Walsh singing lead.  I love the guitar playing on this track.  Don Henley shines on lead vocals on the track \\"Long Road Out Eden\\" and \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\".  I love this new album so much.
1416911049|4.0|A girl named Tally, in a world with a brain killing, making you pretty, operation. Tally finds a girl named Shay, who knows of life outside of Uglie and Pretty town, Tally goes on a mission to find Shay and finally turn pretty, but when she gets there, her heart starts to change.<br />My favorite part in the book is when Tally learns to hoverboard. It's funny because of how the crash bracelets catch her. You can really feel all that she's feeling, the way Scott gets into it.<br />Uglies is a interesting book, because of the way he writes it. He puts you in Tally's shoes. This book gives me a peek of how I don't want my future to turn out, except the electronics. He gives me better ways to write, myself. He is also a good detailer. Uglies is a book I would reccomend.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I was eagerly anticipating the new release from Bruce Springsteen. I'm glad the day finally came. Magic is one fantastic album. Hearing \\"Radio Nowhere\\" prior to the release got me hooked. Any Bruce fan would love to have this addition to their collection. The tunes are old Bruce with a new edge, yet again Bruce does not dissapoint. E Street band sounds great and tight. Pick this one up ASAP.
006112429X|5.0|Although I can say right now that this review is going to be a long one, I can tell you right now that I will never be able to express how affected I was by this book.  I've read one other book by Lionel Shriver, \\"The Port Birthday World\\", which while good, did not live up to my hopes.<br /><br />But THIS book - WOW!!!  The more I think about it - the more I appreciate the incredible amount of work Shriver must have put into this.  The subject matter - a mother's reflections on her son, Kevin, and the harrowing details of their relationship and his ultimate defining act of mass murder - doesn't lead one to eager anticipation.  But once I started reading, started to think about the issues of nature vs. nurture, is evil innate and impossible to cure, what responsibility does a parent have for the actions of a child...I just couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />I really wonder from which point of view she started.  Did she look at one of the mothers, say, of one of the Columbine killers and try to imagine what kind of a mother would have a son that did such a thing?  Or did she imagine this woman first and try to imagine what would happen if she had a child?<br /><br />There are so many horrifying moments in this book - made even scarier by the fact that they felt TRUE.  The description of Kevin's birth, when Eva feels not a second of joy or maternal instinct... \\"In the very instant of his birth, I associated Kevin with my own limitations - with not only suffering, but defeat.\\"<br /><br />The scene where Eva stands whispering to a screaming infant Kevin might be one of the creepiest scenes I've ever read.  And again, once you've been in Eva's thoughts long enough - you not only find yourself understanding how she feels the way she does - you find yourself agreeing with her.  (Although I wasn't happy about doing so!)<br /><br />Time goes back and forth in the book.  The reader is aware of Kevin's crimes, though not their full details, nor their full implications.  The reader's emotions also swing back and forth between the sick fascination of watching a train wreck happen in slow motion, frustration with Kevin and Eva, sympathy for Franklin (Kevin's father) and anger at his apparent total self-delusion, fear for other main characters and numb acceptance of what is bound to happen.<br /><br />Eva and Kevin are at odds from the second he is born.  She is not happy with her life once he enters it and he is not happy with his life, period.  It is a constant battle of wills, one that pits Franklin in the middle.  He loves them both, but doesn't understand either of them and his delusions end up doing far more harm than good.<br /><br />But whose fault is the shooting?  This book looks at all sides, give the reader numerous sides of the argument, throws up for review many suspects...the mother? The father? The son? Society?  I still don't have an answer for that.  Shriver looks at every possible aspect of these characters lives - allowing someone like me, who is lucky enough to not have much common ground with them, to feel like I might be able to understand their actions and feelings.  Her creation of Eva's voice is so eloquent at times that as removed as I am from her circumstances as the mother of an infamous mass murderer - I can immediately relate:<br /><br />\\"It might seem, in the circumstances, a little embarrassing for me to continue to need a sweater or a muff, or to object to being cheated out of a dollar and fifty cents.  But since that Thursday my whole life has been smothered in such a blanket of embarrassment that I have chosen to find these passing pinpricks solace instead, emblems of surviving propriety.  Being inadequately dressed for the season or chafing that in a Wal-Mart the size of a cattle market I cannot locate a single box of kitchen matches, I glory in the emotionally commonplace.\\"<br /><br />At the novel's end...I was just drained.  I found myself questioning everything that happened in the book and almost wanting to read it again now that I knew how it ended.  Kevin and Eva are fascinating, if upsetting, characters.  They feel real, and probably in some part of this world, are accurate representations of real human beings.  In every sense, they could not exist without the other - and ultimately they finally take the first step towards admitting that need.<br /><br />(WARNING - SPOILER ALERT - sort of):<br /><br />One of the most powerful sections of the book is the final one.  In a mirror image of an experience Kevin had - Eva realizes:<br /><br />\\"Because after three days short of eighteen years, I can finally announce that I am too exhausted and too confused and too lonely to keep fighting and if only out of desperation or even loneliness I love my son.  He has five grim years left to serve in an adult penitentiary and I cannot vouch for what will walk out the other side.  But in the meantime, there is a second bedroom in my serviceable apartment.  The bedspread is plain, a copy of Robin Hood lies on the bookshelf.  And the sheets are clean.\\"<br /><br />Like son, like mother.ascinating, if upsetting, characters.

Everything in book was to the extreme and an insult to people everywhere who actually have to deal with illness like this. Only book I've read by author and will remain so. With all the other books out there do yourself a favor and bybass this one and find one you can enjoy. If you like the tear jerkers look for one that doesn't insult your intelligence like this one!
B000V39KDO|4.0|This extremely entertaining  action packed movie, is loosely based on the battle of Thermopylae which pitted the 7,000 man coalition armies of the Grecian States including 300 Spartan troops with the huge army of the Persian King Xerxes which is estimated to has been between 200,000 and 1,000,000 men.<br /><br />First the action . . . well filmed and choreographed combat scenes of close in hand to hand combat is thrilling and chilling. Not for the faint hearted. The tactical strengths of the Spartan warriors is captured as the Persian's crash against the Grecian phalanx, a well disciplined wall of heavily armed Grecian men locking shields together and thrusting spears to the front of the shields. The lightly armored Persians (light armor worked for the Persians on the wide planes of their homeland, but not now) are cut to pieces. It is thought that 20,000 Persians died in the course of this battle. The pass at Thermopylae is really thought to be as narrow as it looks in this film, around 100 yards.<br /><br />The strategic weakness of the Thermopylae was a locally known path that would not allow for cavalry, but would support foot soldiers. In the confusion of battle the men guarding this path left and the Persians used it to attack the Greeks from the rear. It is at this point that the Spartan King dismissed his Grecian allies and formed a rear guard. The men from several other Greek states also refused to leave giving the rear guard around 1,000 troupes which were all killed after being surrounded. A heroic stand it certainly was.<br /><br />Not to detract from the entertainment value of the movie the following should be pointed out: Sparta was an extremely oppressive Grecian state; it enslaved an entire bordering Grecian state so as to exploit it for food while Sparta trained for war; Sparta embarked on a brutal repression of these people using murder, torture and other atrocities to keep them under control; Sparta was no friend of freedom . . . after conqueringthe republic of Athens, Sparta forced Athens to return to a King as ruler, and through intimidation managed to keep its allies as monarchies; Sparta engaged in institutionalized homosexuality; Sparta was ultra conservative in their military strategy and unable to adapt to changing military advances such as the use of the bow and strategic movement of troops  which was ultimately the reason for its down fall; their was no free combat for the Spartan warrior; Spartans warriors could and did surrender; the Spartans were not the only warriors to stay and die at the Battle of Thermopylae  . . . there were 1000 other Grecian warriors who stayed and died. The Spartans did display many admirable attributes such as loyalty, bravery, etc.<br /><br />If you want to get the full story about Sparta there are many such books such as Thermopylae: The Battle for the West or Ancient Wars: Sparta which are available at [...] Or look it up in Wikipedia which has a really extensive and well documented account.<br /><br />Still, this is a great movie!!!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|It a sweet funny romance true to it's genre. Best with a glass of wine.
0375842381|5.0|There are a series of myths and taboos taken on by the author in this series, and he does it extremely well. I enjoyed the series completely, and wish that there were more follow-on novels to join it.   Pullman, did a masterful job with character development and visuals, it will be interesting to see how they translate to the theater.  I am a senior adult, and found the stories challenging and entertaining. This series is a good foundation for future reading in philosophy, you might go to the DaVinci Code next, if you haven't already.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|As a fan, I feel cheated. Contrary to what I have read, Britney does have talent. Sadly, her new CD is a disappointment because is does not demonstrate the talent she possesses. You can't even hear her singing on it really. I do not consider what is on this CD or her larger one to be singing at all. Anyone can talk words that someone else wrote. It is cookiecutter singing that was hand fed to her and I don't consider that talent at all. It is difficult to set aside the media circus that surrounds Britney and all of her negative publicity, especially when you have to take into consideration her fans and her children. I have been a fan of hers for a long time. I enjoyed her music and I never really got into her personal life; however, I find it very difficult to overlook the fact that she is overlooking her fans and taking them for granted, not to mention her own children. She needs to get some help in the worst way and for once I would like to hear her actually sing again and put forth some effort. She has gotten lazy and is forgetting what is filling her pocket with all that money, her fans. Her music isn't bad to dance to but that does not make it good music. It seems that she has become a sellout and sellout music to me is not worth even listening to.
0440238609|5.0|I loved this series. It was impossible to put down. Pullman is brilliant.  The story is appropriate for teens to 90 year olds. The characters are so real and you fall into the story by page 3. I loved it!!!!

B00011F5DK|5.0|We bought this last year for Christmas.  It is still, by far, our favorite game (and I'm not just saying that because I won tonight with 2 pieces totaling 8 squares left!).  We have an 8 and 10 year old and the 4 of us can play together and have a great time.  Our 8 year old daughter ALWAYS finds a place for someone to put down a piece when we think we're finished!    It's a great problem solving/puzzle type game that is quick and as much fun for adults as kids.  My only complaint is you have to have steady hands as the pieces don't fit really securely into the frame, but we usually only knock 1-2 out before we remember to be careful.    Now on the lookout for this year's \\"Blokus\\" to add to our collection!  A definite best buy!
B000FP7MHO|5.0|Melody is a film about two 10 year school children who fall in love, then face constant adult opposition, as well as nonstop harassment from the other children. The two main characters, Daniel Lattimer (Mark Lester) and Melody Perkins (Tracy Hyde) are seeking someone to love and to provide companionship. Daniel is largely ignored by his trendy, upper middle class parents, while Melody longs for something other than her existence in a poor, lower end housing project. The story is a tender, sweet story of innocent love between two children, backed by a great music track by the pre-disco BeeGees. It contains no objectionable language, no sexual content, and no violence. Melody is a thoroughly entertaining film, one which will grab your attention from the opening, and hold it throughout the movie. This reviewer would give it 10 stars and a thumbs-up.
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|Reading the numerous positive reviews of the 2006 television production of \\"Jane Eyre\\" one could be led to expect the definitive version of Charlotte Brontë's classic novel. It is not. In fact, of all the six noteworthy adaptations which have been made of the novel since the Welles/Fontaine movie in 1944 this is by far the worst. And all the positive reviews must have been written by people who either do not know the novel, do not appreciate it or for whom a lavish production with stunning settings and two attractive leading actors is enough to send them into ecstasies. Admirers of the novel, however, and lovers of good period movies must cringe at this \\"Jane Eyre\\" (as they dare to call it).     Although the length of this adaptation would allow for great faithfulness to the novel, many of the novel's most crucial scenes are either deleted, severely changed or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel. The same goes for the language: The novel has become immortal for the unsurpassed beauty and originality of the dialogues between Rochester and Jane. In the 2006 version however, nearly all the novel's beautiful lines have been substituted with trite and stupid ones. And if this were not already bad enough, also the characters are portrayed in a way as to make you wonder if anybody of the cast and crew ever cared to read the novel. Whosever fault it may be, the actors', the scriptwriter's or the director's - but the fact is that Toby Stephens' Rochester and Ruth Wilson's Jane have nothing in common with the novel's main characters. Toby Stephens in particular does not resemble at all the charismatic, masterful, imperious, moody and irresistible Rochester of the novel. Where are Rochester's torment, his regrets about his past, his struggle with his conscience, and where is his wit? Played by Toby Stephens, the attractive, complex and three-dimensional character of the novel has become a one-dimensional weakling. Ruth Wilson tries her best, but neither does she physically fit the part of the small and elfin-like Jane, nor does the bold, self-confident and outspoken young female she portrays render the true character of the novel's shy and guarded heroine.    Furthermore, instead of showing the subtle gradual development of the special relationship between the main characters - a love born out of the affinity of souls - the filmmakers just emphasize the sexual attraction between Rochester and Jane, thereby reducing one of the most complex and interesting love relationships in English literature to high school movie level. Apparently the filmmakers considered the emphasis on the sexual element as an appropriate means of modernizing the novel and securing the interest of a younger and supposedly shallow audience in the story.  And this is exactly the main offence of this production: Of course every director is perfectly free to adopt a novel according to his or her own notion, to change the plot, change the dialogues, change the characters and to call that film \\"Jane Eyre\\" - but to set that movie in the period of the 1850ies and to completely disregard that period's language and behaviour, etiquette and sense of decency is just plain bad movie making. This Jane Eyre is a silly soap opera in the disguise of a period movie in which the actors talk and behave as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake. The most striking example of that is the scene after the aborted wedding - the novel's pivotal scene in which Jane won't allow even the slightest attempt of Rochester's caressing her. Considering what they did to the rest of the novel it should come as no surprise that this scene is completely butchered in the 2006 production. Rochester lies on top of Jane, they kiss repeatedly and seem both near to taking off their clothes. Not only is this an outrage to Charlotte Brontë, it is also a complete misrepresentation of how people would behave in the middle of the 19th century.     There havebeen many beautiful adaptations of famous novels in the last decade, which were true both to the literary models as well as to the period in which the novels play and which have charmed the audience without their having to be sexed up. The makers of the latest version of Jane Eyre unfortunately failed to recognize what is timeless in the novel and what is unchangeably bound to its time. This TV production is therefore a striking example of a senseless and totally superfluous attempt to modernize a classic novel. As a period drama it is a complete failure - as an adaptation of Jane Eyre it is a slap in the face of its author.    If you simply want a better Jane Eyre you can take any of the other productions - if you want the definitive Jane Eyre there is only one to watch: the '83 BBC mini series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton. This Jane Eyre is in every respect the very opposite of the 2006 series. It has a brilliant script, the dialogues are straight from the novel and the plot is followed with the greatest possible accuracy. Moreover, it has two leading actors who truly capture the essence of the characters they portray. Timothy Dalton in particular is a revelation as Rochester. Like no other actor before him or after him he renders all the different facets of Rochester's character and does so to perfection. Zelah Clarke is equally excellent in the role of Jane in that she portrays exactly the Jane of the novel and does not try to make her bolder, more modern and more feminist than described by Charlotte Brontë. The interplay between Clarke and Dalton is wonderful and they render all the passion and intensity of the novel without their having to fall back on the means of modern eroticism and without once digressing from the literary model. This superb production is and will remain the only true, the definitive \\"Jane Eyre\\".

Ooh Ooh Baby 9/10- Nice melody. Pop-love song  11. Perfect Lover- 6/10 Forgettable song  12. Why Should I Be Sad- 6/10 Forgettable song    Overall, I this album is pretty good. Its a great dance, feel-good album. Compared to previous Britney CD's which were pop with hiphop flavor, this one is a whole lot more electronic. I like most of the songs and rated the songs to show contrast between which ones are great, good and okay.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Wall looks like just about every other English village, but it hides a secret.  It's not jolly old England on the other side of the wall.  Few mundane English travelers ever make it over the wall and back.  Drustan (Nathaniel Parker-Ben Barnes) is one of the few--and nine months later, a son was delivered to him at his doorstep.     The son Tristan (Charlie Cox) grows to 19 and falls in love with Victoria (Sienna Miller) a woman well above his means. He fears his ability to capture her heart is failing, til they see a star fall on the other side of the wall--and Victoria tells him if he will seek out the star, she will be his.     Thus, begins Tristan's quest for true love. Instead of a star, he finds a maiden Yvaine (Clare Danes) who turns out to be the earth-bound embodiment of the star.  Unfortunately, Victoria is not the only person who wants the star.      From here, we encounter a multiplicity of plot complications including a King (Peter O'Toole) who sets his sons against each other in a fight for succession to the throne, a pirate (Robert DeNiro) with an interesting secret) and a triad of witches who seek the star to extend their lives and (ahem) beauty.     I loved reading Neil Gaiman's story.  STARDUST is one of his best, but the film is one of those rare instances where the book has been improved.  The casting for STARDUST is some of the best I have seen.      This is one of the rare films that I paid full price for in the theatre and will purchase the DVD for later viewing.  STARDUST is going to be a fantasy classic and a great addition to any fantasy fan's library.     WARNING:  If you have very young children, please do not show this film without some advisory. We saw STARDUST in the theatre with a couple of young families close by and the littlest kids were crying at the rough parts and some families had to leave.
0316067598|3.0|I enjoyed this account of what it takes to become a SEAL and the incredible   sacrifices these men made on behalf of our country.  I got the impression though that Lutrell was more interested in making sure the reader knew where he stood on the issue of 'rules of engagement' and the western press than on the narrative.  It also got tiresome hearing about how great the state of Texas is.
B0000C2IQD|4.0|A favourite for generations, CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, based on the book by Ian Fleming with a musical score provided by Richard & Robert Sherman, now flies home with a brand new Special Edition.<br /><br />Dick Van Dyke stars as the zany inventor Caractacus Potts; with lovely Sally Ann Howes as the aptly-named Truly Scrumptious.  The story blends elements of reality and fantasy as the Potts family enjoys a colourful adventure aboard their \\"fantasmagorical\\" motorcar, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.<br /><br />The beautiful musical score provided by Richard & Robert Sherman (\\"Mary Poppins\\", \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\", \\"The Slipper and the Rose\\" and \\"The Happiest Millionaire\\"), perfectly sets the tone for every character and plot-point.<br /><br />Definitely one of the all-time family greats, CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG looks really spiffy on this Special Edition DVD--very glad that I finally decided to upgrade my fullscreen copy.  The Special Edition features a new widescreen transfer and some very worthwhile extra features.

B000HEWEE4|3.0|Suspension of disbelief is an essential element of film enjoyment - and you better have yours turbocharged for The Lake House.  What's nice about this movie is that it makes no attempt to explain the plot lunacies - it simply invites you to join in the fun.  If you do, you'll love it, it's a good natured, charming romance with a sweet - and certainly symbolic - twist.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is a consistently excellent actress, able to express a great deal of emotion with the smallest glance.  Keanu Reeves, by contrast, could be out-acted by a jar of olives - he has work to do before he could be described as wooden.  Listen to how he reads in the scenes where he is not on screen - simply awful.<br /><br />For contrast, listen to Shoreh Aghdashloo - Kate's co-worker and friend.  That, my friends, is a voice.  Ms. Aghdashloo could read quarterly crop reports and make them sound like 120 Days At Sodom.  Back story of emotionally inaccessible dad really not necessary.  Ignore the flotsam and jetsam and cheer for these ambitious lovers trying to conquer time - as if holding a normal relationship together isn't hard enough!
0805079831|3.0|`Disaster Capitalism', which with its soul-mate, hegemonic neoliberalism, feeds, like the real-life piranhas and parasitic 'gangster oligarchs' it spawns, from Johannesburg to Beijing via Moscow and Buenos Aires, off the human carcasses and physical wreckage of wars (Iraq and Afghanistan), tsunamis (Sri Lanka and Thailand), tornadoes (New Orleans/Gulf region, Caribbean/Mexico ) and similar eco-economic devastation, but it's a story that has not been fully synthesized before.<br /><br />This seems to be the major message of Naomi Klein's new book: \\"The Shock Doctrine - The Rise of Disaster Capitalism\\" [Metropolitan Books, NY, 2007]. Like her previously well received books, it will be a best seller, despite its size, 466 pages [alt. 533 pages].<br /><br />Transposing the metaphor from the world of the 50s `experimental psychiatry' [lobotomy, electro-shock treatment (ECT) to psychedelic drugs] to the real world of today's casino economics.  It is in revealing the inter-connectedness of the 'shocked'n'singed'  electrodes or nerve-centres to the Brains Trust that rules and directs this vicious system, that is Klein's greatest achievement.<br /><br />Economics, that infamous `dismal science' stands revealed in its latest apparition, as `voodoo economics' - enter Chief Witchdoctor, (the late) Milton Friedman, as chief villain in the piece, a modern Dr Strangelove of the academ&eacute; and his prescribed economic \\"shock treatment\\" doctrine. Where Klein could presumably claim originality is in identifying the taxonomy of this \\"shock doctrine\\", the latest in capitalism's phases of \\"creative destruction\\" [with its reference to `manic-depressive disorders'], as Schumpeter described the core of the system in the 1950s.<br /><br />So she describes the 'systemic shock' of a sudden overpowering attack, whether the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, or the bombing of Baghdad in 2003; the shock of torturers using sensory deprivation techniques and crude electrodes to instil fear and acquiescence. The methods used in Guant&aacute;namo Bay or Abu Ghirab. The economics of 'disaster capitalism' and contemporary global reality.<br /><br />Methodically combined and skilfully elaborated, these onslaughts now amount, on Klein's account, to a supposedly new and frightful chapter in the history of ghoulish capitalist predation. Maybe her core argument is a-historical, as globalizing capitalist penetration of `non-capitalist' environments is over 500 years old and its attendant social-psychic `culture shocks' on indigenous populations have already been recorded. It's as if Rosa Luxemburg, V.I. Lenin or Karl Polyani had never existed.<br /><br />In fact \\"shock therapy\\" neoliberalism really isn't most closely associated with Friedman at all, but rather with Jeffrey Sachs, note an ex-Harvard lecturer not a `Chicago Boy', to whom Klein devotes much space, even though Friedman remains the sinister dark emminence of her story. A straw man really, easily demolished and easily forgotten.<br /><br />Sachs first introduced shock therapy in Bolivia in the early 1990s. Then he went into Poland, Russia etc, with the same shock therapy model. Sachs' catchy phrase was that \\"you can't leap over an abyss step-by-step\\". This is really where contemporary neoliberalism emerged and morphed, like the Creature of the Black Lagoon, to terrorize the globe.<br /><br />Just as there has been continuity in capitalist predation, there is continuity, albeit uneven, in resistance. Here's where Klein's implicit catastrophism may distort the real picture - her controlling metaphor for the attack on Iraq, is the initial \\"shock and awe\\" bombardment, designed to numb Saddam's forces and the civilian population into instant surrender, long-term submission and re-colonization. But \\"shock and awe\\" was a myth - it spawned resistance to present-day `reconstruction' efforts, not defeat and apathy.<br /><br />The last chapters of her book point to this increasing resistance in many places around the globe, not least in Iraq, with its outsourced just-in-time mercenary genocide &aacute;-la Blackwater or Halliburton and Bechtel's corporate looting, and Latin America's Southern Cone, the site of the first modern neoliberal onslaught, over forty years ago.<br /><br />One is left with the numbing feeling of \\"something's missing\\". The body of evidence of neoliberalism destruction, not creation, is overwhelming - but from the anti-capitalist point of view she's far too pessimistic. A capitalism that thrives best on the `abnormal', on disasters, is by definition in decline [thus 'terminally sick', `in its death-throes'].<br /><br />In sum, Naomi Klein has done a sterling job to collate, record and reveal the workings of contemporary `Disaster Capitalism', and like fellow prize-winning investigative journalist John Pilger and writer Arundhati Roy, has exposed the nature and workings of the system today called neoliberalism. Whatever her theoretical `deficiencies' and `inconsistencies' (and there might be many), her work is in the admirable muckraking North American tradition of I.F. Stone, Upton Sinclair, John Steinbeck, or a contemporary like Mike Davis and the late Norman Mailer.<br /><br />Read Naomi Klein's work and discuss it, and despite my minor reservations, for example her chapter on South Africa is schematic and not convincing really, I fully endorse this important work as \\"essential reading\\". But the dark scenarios presented in chapter after grim chapter, backed by its well-researched evidence (thanks to her expert teams) leave one flat, as in `shock'.<br /><br />What happens when the `shock' wears off? \\"The point is to change it (the world)\\" is still as relevant as ever, but which social and political forces, tools or instruments, are there at hand? Put in another way, does Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales in Latin America show the way forward?<br /><br />Only time will tell...<br /><br />Selim Gool, November 14, 2007.<br />selimgool@yahoo.comrcenary genocide á-la Blackwater or Halliburton and Bechtel's corporate looting, and Latin America's Southern Cone, the site of the first modern neoliberal onslaught, over forty years ago.

6305428352|4.0|It was good. I bought the soundtrack and after listening to it several times; I decided to start looking around for the movie. Before buying the movie, I thought that it was going to be about one school year for a teacher. It is actually about his whole career over thirty years. It had me in tears at the end. Very awesome movie.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear window was taken from a short story entitled, \\"It had to be Murder\\" by Cornell Woolrich and adapted to the screen by John Michael Hayes  ([[ASIN:B000CCW2TS The Man Who Knew Too Much]]) & ([[ASIN:B000MX7V5M To Catch a Thief (Special Collector's Edition)]]). To Catch a Thief was Hayes's second collaboration with Hitchcock after Rear Window.<br /><br />What makes this particular thriller one of the all time greats in cinematic history is its simplicity, revealing human nature's tendency to voyeurism.<br /><br />L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) is a photo journalist, forced to sit in his apartment because of a broken leg. He becomes extremely bored because his only contact to the outside world is his editor by phone, his nurse played with humour and charm, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his stunning, rich girlfriend, Lisa Carole Fremont, (Grace Kelly) To alleviate his boredom, through the lens of his telescopic camera, he is able to spy on all his neighbours through his back window. It is through Jeffries eyes that the story is told as we get to know so many different characters with their interesting, mundane, sometimes lonely and murderous lives.<br /><br />Jefferies girlfriend, Lisa, visits him frequently, and in one scene brings in a catered dinner of lobster and fine champagne, looking absolutely ravishing to get Jefferies to stop obsessing with his telescope and his spying. Despite her beauty and the brilliant food, Jefferies has a suspicion: one of his neighbours has killed his wife, chopped up her body, and disposes the evidence in several trips with a suitcase. This fixation turns obsessive and suddenly manic as the evidence mounts against the \\"husband\\" (Raymond Burr).<br /><br />There are two story-telling devices that make a great thriller, mounting tension and the element of surprise. Rear Window has these qualities and much more.<br /><br />For me the best aspect of this film is the stories within the main story. Through the eyes of Jefferies we become intimate with his neighbours and their various situations, some interesting, some plain evil, some mostly sad and terribly lonely. It's like the old adage: if you feel your life is a drag, look at other lives and miraculously, your problems are not that serious or sad.<br /><br />I remember watching this film as a child and almost climbing the walls in fear at the end. Viewing the film so many years later, I didn't climb the walls but felt the same tension.<br /><br />Rear Window has to be one of the great thrillers in the history of film.r various situations, some interesting, some plain evil, some mostly sad and terribly lonely.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|I am always at a loss why so many media writers, fans and people who are supposed to know music seems to ignore the sensational contributions of Nils Lofgren. Why  should I go on?

0553582038|1.0|I just finished the book, and the more I read the more I felt it was simply written to get another big fat check. The author claims that he was really writing the continuation of the previous books, but it went too long and so he broke it into two books. BUT most of the characters in this book are insignificant in the previous ones, and we read hundred of pages that amount to nothing (Brienne, for sure, is there just for filling ...; so are the pages on the ironmen).     It's not that the book is written poorly - far from it - but I felt really cheated by an author who decides to write 680 pages of filling just because he knows he'll get paid.     Now I wouldn't be so pissed (I mean, I am giving this book a 1) if he had followed through on his promise and published the next book (this book ends with \\"a follow-up will come in an year, a promise dated June 2005). We all need to eat, so if he can get more money for the same story more power to him. BUT it is more then two years since he finished the last book in the series, and the next one is nowhere near.     So basically not only he wrote filling stuff because he wanted more money, but because he didn't know what to do with the other characters ... or where indeed is the whole story going. He still hasn't figure it out, and that is why I am so bitter. I guess at this point I should just give up his stories, or make my own endings ...
B000V1Y43W|4.0|As always, Animation looks great in HD and Cars is no exception. When I was able to get the movie to work, the picture and sound were incredible. This is a good disc to keep around in order to show off your system.    The reason I have it four stars:    I have the Samsung BD-P1200 and it took 5 tries before I was able to get the disc to load. Like Pirates, Fantastic Four and a few other discs, the java menus really overload the stand alone players. I made sure the disc was clean and after the 5th time of opening the tray and re-inserting the movie the player recognized the disc.    I'm of the opinion they should lay off the java menus and just stick to the basic menus for these movies.    -update-    I have purchased the Panasonic DMP-BD30K and it handles this title just fine. From my experience, it appears that some standalones just don't handle the java menus too well.
0897500482|3.0|This was puirchased for my youngest son,13, saw Bruce Lee's movie & became very interested in his practice of martial arts.
B000M4RG42|3.0|A war movie about Iwo Jima. This version centered on the raising of the two flags by the Marines on Mt. Suribachi. There's the problem. The iconic image we all have of the flag being raised is actually not the original moment. That was done in a less cerimonious way earlier with a different flag & a different cast of characters. The military didn't care. They wanted heroes for the home front to consume. The result was somebody getting credit & somebody being forgotten to history. Most people didn't know all this including the p.r. flaks who were ramrodding the the whole thing. The Marines that may have been aware didn't care or were already dead. The flag raisings (both of them) were done very early in the meat grinder that Iwo Jima was to become. The fighting for the island went on for weeks after. Several of the participants in one or the other were ordered unwillingly back to the states for the celebrations. The movie is a bit disorganized with action flashing back & forth from the island to the home front. Not Eastwood's best effort. Too much time spent on the problems of drunken Marine, Ira Hayes suffering from guilt & stupid remarks such as the U.S. running out of money to continue the war. Really? It also suffers from comparisions to Eastwood's other movie, Letters from Iwo Jima made at the same time which is a better movie.

B000VHPXR2|2.0|I don't want to get into the whole comparison bit (individual singers, studio cast vs movie vs 1990's revivals etc).  I know the studio cast album inside and out, so my preference is mostly there.  And I haven't even seen the movie in ages.  This is just my reaction to listening to this CD on its own.<br /><br />The sound is just plain weird.  To my ears, it sounds like they started with the studio cast multitrack, used parts of it as it was, remixed other parts, recorded new parts over some of it, and recorded some stuff from scratch. (I haven't been able to verify this independently, but I'm researching.) The vocals are obviously new, and the quality of those is incredibly uneven.  The net result of all this is a patchwork quilt of sound that never quite comes together.  Maybe on vinyl it wasn't so noticeable, but it's the biggest mark against the CD, and no remastering could fix that.  Remixing maybe, but not remastering.<br /><br />Andre Previn is credited as musical director, and with his resume, I'm surprised he didn't do the whole thing from scratch. (Andrew Lloyd Webber was involved with the orchestrations, but we all know how little he & Tim Rice were involved with the film, to their dismay.) At least all-new recordings would have meant balance & uniformity in the sound, and shouldn't that be numero uno when you're doing a musical? Maybe Previn or Jewison liked the sound of the studio cast album and wanted it part of the package, but the Broadway production worked from scratch and sounded just fine (yay Elliot Randall!).  Overlaying new stuff in a mostly standard movie musical style on top of the heavy rock of the original just doesn't work.  It needed integration, not layering.<br /><br />If you like the movie cast, this was a horrible way to present them; if you don't like the movie cast, it only makes things worse.  Personally, I like Carl Anderson but Ted Neely is just too weak, and Kurt Yaghjian as Annas is irritating beyond belief.  Overall, I give the whole thing a `C' grade, if only as a missed opportunity.ade, if only as a missed opportunity.

0765357151|3.0|I purchase and collect movie-tie in books for the sole purpose of reading the book prior to the movie. I have been waiting for this book to come out since I saw the trailer. The cover leads one to believe that this book is a movie-tie in book. It isn't unless Will Smith in the movie has blond hair and blue eyes.  However, aggravated I was with this misleading information, the book was good.  Not sure why the other short stories are added into this book. If publisher are going to put the movie cover on a book - the inside should reflect the movie not just a reprint. If I wanted to read the original I would have saved my 7.99 and went to the library months ago.  If you are looking to read the book that reflects the movie its not this so save your money and get it at the library.
0316010669|4.0|The first chapter was the hook, but as it went on it began to get a little repetitive. It wasn't really adding anything new and the topics began to feel scattered. It was as if the author had a bunch of really cool stories and facts that kinda-sorta all fit together, so he slapped them in.     That said, I found most of it very interesting. It was also pretty easy to read - despite feeling scattered. If you're interested in a collection of psychological research in a fun, easy to read and understand format, pick up a copy of Blink. I enjoyed reading it.     Also Recommended [[ASIN:1434322580 Understanding: Train of Thought]].

0688156819|4.0|Being a fan of Tim Burtons works which need no introduction here, I discovered after some cursory research that he had written a book of poetry with pictures that had a most interesting title.A little book all of one hundred fifteen pages or so that could be read in less than ten minutes. I had to get it.Well the binding is sure beautiful and the content is bizarre with children being the target of his illustrations.Not in an abusive way, but rather something the Addams family would enjoy.The individual parts are brief and the title work is quite good as well. Having recently reviewed a book on oysters, I remembered this one purchased many years ago and it has sat on my shelf long forgotten.I reread it again and still find it cool and thought provoking. Just a little ditty merely for fun. The illustrations are raw,minimalistic yet leave an imprint on your mind that stays there.So, if you're a Burton fan for whatever reason, you'll appreciate this little gem.Hey,don't get serious it's not high end poetry,prose or art we are talking about here just sillyness, but fun in a ghoulish sort of way.I just throw it out here for food for thought because its within my particular bent of literary preferences.Only four stars because for the price you should get more,but for originality it rates.Have fun!!
B000RW3YYA|5.0|I thought this season was the best yet! The writers incorporated cast and storylines from SG-1 into the ongoing story of Atlantis. If they can keep putting out quality like this, there will be no problem for Atlantis to follow the footsteps of SG-1 and go 10 seasons.
B000UFAURI|2.0|I hate to say it, but Foo Fighters are no longer on the short list of bands whose new albums I'll buy without hearing anything on them first.  I was disappointed with In Your Honor.  I thought it was bloated and had practically no interest at all in the acoustic cd.  Echoes Silence Patience & Grace is just like In Your Honor boiled down to fit on one cd.  About half of the songs rock.  The other songs are perfectly skippable.  I've only had this cd for about a week, and it is already out of heavy rotation.  I find it a very frustrating listen.  It's like a cd of rock like only Foo Fighters can do mixed with a mellow Tori Amos cd.  Since I end up skipping more than half of the songs on the album, I'm only giving the cd 2 stars.  In my opinion, this cd is a poster child for i-Tunes.  Download the handful of good songs.  Don't bother with the rest.

B00009MGGI|5.0|Another reviewer says many Americans don't have the sophistication to appreciate this level of satire, I must be an exception. Most of the other reviewers mention Ian Richardson's asides to his captive audience to which I confess I am one. His staring into camera with twinkling eye to highlight a perfidious plan, or the raised eyebrow, and the slight knowingly wicked smile as he comtemplates mischief, mayhem, or murder are all hilarious and classic. The scenes of the Parliament building in the background across the River Thames and the Rats in the foreground, I rolled with laughter the 1st time that showed on screen, and I have since imagined the US Capital across the Potomac River occupied by rodents. \\"You might say that, but I couldn't possibly comment\\", is one of the greatest lines ever written in English comedy-drama, and has to be the most potent form of caustic criticism said about the policies of ones own political \\"ally\\".
B000VKW7AK|3.0|First off let me say that I am a HUGE Megadeth fan.  I've seen 'em live 3 times, own every album, bought all the remasters, bought the darned VHS' and the Dvds.  It's safe to say that Megadeth is my favorite band.  I LOVE these guys.  Their songwriting is out of this world!  Megadeth is one of those bands that truely developed their own sound.  Megadeth is one of the most unique bands I've ever heard.  From the super angry agressive days of the 80s to the technical masterpiece of 1990s Rust in Peace to the more guitar hook driven stuff of Countdown and Youthanasia, I always loved Megadeth and loved how they crafted their songs.  They were so advanced for a group that only wrote about 4 minute songs.  You can go on and on about who's the BEST heavy metal band but I always thought Megadeth were something special.  No one put more into a 4 minute song than these guys and their riffs and songwriting was amazing.  So you get the picture, I'm a HUGE fan.  So why the low score?    Over half if this DVD is stuff I already have!!!  What's up with that!?  The first three discs are pretty much useless.  Its mostly songs from the albums I already own!!  The demos are interesting but not enough to justify the cost of three CDs.  I'll never listen to these.  I'll just get the albums that they're already on.  For that I had to knock off two stars, because there's nothing really new on the first three discs.  Come on guys(Dave Mustaine) what were you thinking?  Couldn't they have included one disc just with all the demos and then maybe had another live DVD on there!!!???      Although the first three discs are a major negative, let me go on to the postives:  the last two discs:    Disc number four rules.  A live show of Megadeth with their best lineup (Mustaine/Ellefson/Friedman/Menza) during their best years.  (1990)  This one is off the Rust in Peace tour so it's a killer 15 track live concert caught on tape.  This one's all classic metal Megadeth and captures the band when theirlive set was truely worthy of the moniker: \\"world's state of the art speed metal band.\\"  It's awesome to hear all classic deth being played live with \\"The Conjuring\\", \\"Skull Beneath the Skin\\", and \\"Black Friday\\" all making the cut.  The sound quality is fantastic here and I don't doubt that they remixed and remastered the original soundboard recording, because I know for a fact that 1990s soundrecordings never came out this good.      Disc 5: the DVD.  Oh this is what I was waiting for.  Live footage of Megadeth at their best!  1992 fresh off the Countdown to Extinction tour.  Fantastic set list and performances by all.  Great sound quality and great to see Marty Friedman ripping the solos to shreds.  Only criticism is that it's PAINFULLY short!  Only 10 songs clocking in at less than 50 minutes!  Ouch!  Just barely enough to satisfy the hardcore fan.  Still other than that its what you'd expect.  A great concert from the band during arguably their best years.      All that said, it's too hard to see this as a complete box set for Megadeth.  As I said before the first three discs are a wash pretty much although the last two will please any long time fan.  Still this is FAR from the definitive Megadeth collection that i thought it would be.  I felt kind of jipped by the Arsenal of Megadeth as well and I can't help but feel a little cheated by this one.  No live footage from the 1980s?  Only one DVD with only 10 songs?  A great live CD yes, but not enough.  And way too much of the same stuff.  They could've cut it down to three discs and lowered the price to around $30.00 and then you would've had a great collection.  Either that or they should've added another live concert DVD, but given the material of the disc, honestly it barely makes the grade.  I probably would've graded it lower but I'm too much a Megadeth fan to rate it any lower than three stars.  Still, you have my thoughts on this.  If you're a really hard core Megadeth freak you'll probably like it.  ButI'm a pretty big Megadeth fan and I still can't help but feel a little jipped...
B000002UB3|5.0|I've been an avid fan of the Beatles for 20 years, and this is my favourite album. George Harrison really shines on it. You Never Give Me Your Money - Th End sequence is just sheer brilliance. Golden Slumbers still makes me cry every time I listen to it - even though it says \\"do not cry\\" :-)
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|In short, this movie is a veritable visual spectacle on your 1080P television.  The content of the film itself is precisely what it aims to be and it is beautifully rendered in Blu-Ray in MOST instances.  There are certain darker scenes (such as when Dilios is addressing the assembled Spartan soldiers around the campfire) that simply did not seem to translate well.  While most of the dark scenes were rendered beautifully (i.e. not a calibration issue with the television), this and a few other dark scenes, had a noticeable amount of noise (over the entire area of the picture, not just the dark area).  By fine-tuning my LNT4671f I was able to mute the effect substantially from the out-of-box settings, but this problem is present ONLY in these scenes on THIS Blu-Ray movie (I have several).  Despite this minor quibble, the movie is spectacular, with all the glorious HD fight scenes you could ask for, and is really a stellar title for showcasing what your 1080p TV is capable of with the proper input.
0446577391|5.0|David Baldacci attended law school at the University of Virginia, and went on to work as a trial lawyer, and later as a corporate lawyer, in Washington, D.C. He is now a full-time writer whose best selling novels include Absolute Power, Total Control, The Winner, The Simple Truth and Saving Faith. He lives in Virginia with his wife and two children.    The publication date of a new David Baldacci novel is for me a cause for celebration and if the said novel is one of the Camel Club series, well I wouldn't exactly be doing backwards somersaults, but you know what I mean. I enjoyed the first two in the series so much that I was almost afraid that Stone Cold would not live up to my expectations and this is from someone who is not really into crime thrillers.    Well to be honest, I was a little disappointed, maybe I had hyped it up too much in my own mind. It was still a good read but not as good as I had expected. Maybe it was the fact that it was revisiting an old plot, I'm not sure. Oliver Stone and the Camel Club are back and this new novel revisits Casino king Jerry Bagger, who appeared in The Collectors. Yes he's the guy who was conned out of millions of dollars by Annabelle Conroy. She managed to set up one of the most outrageous scams ever pulled on any casino. The owners of casinos know all of the dodges ever invented for conning them out of their money and they also have the most sophisticated equipment, cameras etc. to stop this kind of thing happening, but Bagger didn't see this one coming.    Well Bagger is now hunting Annabelle and if he catches up with her it isn't going to be pretty. It is going to take all the resources of the Camel Club to keep Annabelle safe and maybe even that isn't going to be enough . . .
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is an awesome movie. My son wanted to watch it every night for a solid month, and I didn't mind because it was funny. And not just the silly child humor, but Billy Crystal funny (he played Mike or googly bear).<br /><br />There are just a few scary scenes for the little ones, that I jump through. But other than that, it is such a pleasure to have a movie the children like that I enjoy too. Especially after you've seen it 100 times!
0440238609|5.0|This is an amzing novel, I relly advise you to read it, So lovely and magical. I won't say more not to spoil the surprise, but it's about kids and animals when you get to the heart of things, but with a lot of suspense and action. Really wonderful book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is amazing.  Filmed in HD, Bluray really does this justice.  Amazing footage of African deltas from helicopters gives a close up view of nature without the animals even realizing there are humans in the area.  Scenes of the hunts in the ocean and on the tundra are riveting.
0891419195|5.0|This book delivers exactly what the reviewers say:  it's not a grand overview of the war.  It's only what one soldier saw through his eyes in two vicious campaigns.  A young idealistic soldier heads to combat and 6 months later he is attempting to salvage gold teeth from a Japanese corpse before he comes to his senses.  But plenty of other's don't.  The brutality of war is vividly brought home here:  the atrocities on both sides, the fear of constant bombardment by heavy guns, the friendly fire killings as well as one accidental discharge killing a best friend in the company.  The survival rates here are so low it's amazing more soldiers didn't lose their minds.  What this book covered that I have never seen before is the horrible conditions in the battlefield which he provides such as the stench of rotting dead bodies for days.  In addition to describing this so well he also adds details of basic human bodily waste while tied to a foxhole which you must now live in for days in the rain and mud of Okinawa or the heat and coral of Pelilui allowing no ability to bury this waste.  Covered for the first time are descriptions of moving equipment and supplies to the front line as well as the deadly stretcher duty of wounded soldiers with bullets flying.  Maybe the most terrifying story is an open field crossing with Japanese machine guns at the end setting up a killing zone allowing about a 50% survival rate but with no other choice.<br /><br />In summary this is just a powerful story that needs to be read.  It's neither sexy nor filled with Patriotic fervor.  It's about soldiers in the worst possible conditions and the 20 feet in front of them that will determine whether they survive.  And it's absolutely a chilling, must read.
B000Y179KO|2.0|Hey, I am a music fan, I love Rock, Heavy Metal, Classical, Jazz and Blues.  I know for a fact just because an artist gets older doesn't mean they can't Rock!  John Fogerty did it, Maiden and others continue too.  But the Eagles decided to record one for the country's retirement homes.  Out of the 20 tracks only one reminds me of that familiar Eagles sound, \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\".  The rest are very mellow, very forgetable, very depressing, songs that neither pull at your heart strings nor make you want to go back for a second listen.  The melodies aren't as tight as in their younger days, and yawn (sorry it is playing in the background), they seem to be playing with all the energy of a group needing a break to suck down a can of Ensure.  After a 15 year wait, all I can say is, where is the passion!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a collection of the complete Season 1 of the Firefly TV show that was cancelled.  Firefly chronicles the tales of the spunky crew of the spaceship Serenity in a never before seen Sci-Fi/Western style of storytelling. The characters are lovable, the writing is hysterical and I was sooo sad to see the season end. After viewing, be sure to rent/buy the movie called \\"Serenity\\" that followed.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This cd is fantastic!  All of the songs are very upbeat.  The CD is way better than Britney's personal life, so listen to it before you judge it.  You won't be sorry.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|My first consecutive nights of Springsteen happened this tour, so hearing this CD the first time was a huge disappointment.  It no way captured Radio Nowhere live.  Then the volume got turned up and wow!  That tune carries so much energy, has so many layers, as does the rest of this perfectly named album.  Bruce has a lot to say and sings it with infectious optimism.  He's an American and he wants his country back. Magic eloquently expresses our times with hits that mark history, but then anything less wouldn't be Bruce.
B000U618C8|5.0|I could go on and on about how great this album is, but I don't feel like doing that right now. I'd just like to say that this a great album to get totally baked and listen to... Although it's also a great album for casual listening too.  One of the most enjoyable albums, start to finish, that I've purchased in a long time.
B000007XUQ|5.0|As a 40-something whose tastes have matured with the years, the appreciation for the genuine genius of Richard and Karen Carpenter has increased exponentially.  I am old enough to remember hearing them on the radio as a kid, and while they didn't hit my radar until much later in life, it has been with decided relish that I've explored their work.<br /><br />The Christmas Collection, as has been pointed out, is a compilation release of two earlier albums: Christmas Portrait and An Old Fashioned Christmas.  The earlier work (in this set, it is Disc 1) is the definitive Carpenter's Christmas.  Richard's arrangements can only be described as lush, and the more one listens to these phenomenal orchestrations, the more one is awestruck by this gifted talent.  And of course, Karen's vocals are flawless and spot-on, with unfeigned pathos in many of the more somber renditions.<br /><br />The style of this collection runs the gamut from the whimsical to the endearing.  Her voice soars with haunting clarity on tunes like Christ is Born and the venerable Ave Maria.  And no \\"modern traditional\\" Christmas is complete without their holiday signature song, Merry Christmas Darling.  Sleigh Ride, Jingle Bells and other traditional secular tunes are fun and bouncy without becoming childish.<br /><br />The second disc in this collection, originally An Old Fashioned Christmas, is an organic continuation of the first disc, and played back-to-back, they form a seamless whole of enjoyable Christmas fare. The harmonies are rich without appearing over-produced.  They even included one of the few New Year's tunes anyone can think of besides Auld Lang Syne (Frank Loesser's What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?)<br /><br />You don't have to be a Carpenter's fan to enjoy this offering. Chances are, once you listen to it a few times, you'll become one anyway. After nearly three decades since the first album was released, this special holiday gift has aged extremely gracefully, and I can no longer imagine a Christmas without it as a backdrop to the season.backdrop to the season.
0802714544|5.0|John Le Carre's spy novels have thrilled readers for decades, and \\"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\\" is the novel that kick-started his writing career.  A surprisingly short novel, \\"Spy\\" packs in more high-quality twists and turns than most books twice its length.    Alec Leamus, Le Carre's protagonist, is a bitter British agent stationed in Cold War Berlin.  The Wall has gone up, which both divides the city and makes it a perfect hot-bed for agents of the communist and capitalist powers.  At the outset, the communists have the upper hand - they have killed all of Leamus's agents.  Leamus returns to England in disgrace and, worse, useless.    Or so one would think.  But Control, Leamus's boss, sends Leamus back out for one last mission - to bring down Mundt, the communist agent who destroyed Leamus's network.      What makes Le Carre's novels so special is how they unfold gradually.  This is not James Bond, where M conveniently briefs Bond at the beginning and clearly sets forth who the villain is and what his ambitions are.  Much of the action that occurs in \\"Spy\\" occurs for reasons that are only explained later.  As a result, Le Carre compels the reader to dig deeper into book, searching for clues and hints, only to have Le Carre reveal purposes and motives at the perfectly appropriate time.    Be warned - \\"Spy\\" is a bitter, cynical book.  Leamus has been around the block more than a few times, and he knows he is expendable. But even he is shocked and unnerved at the espionage game's ability to chew up and spit out individuals in pursuit of its own ends.  Readers seeking happy endings and tidy resolutions will be disappointed, but readers seeking a brilliant, unsettling, shocking spy tale will be thrilled.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Spider Man 3 is HORRIBLE!  The first two movies were decent, so I was actually wanting to see the third, but it turned out to be a HUGE disappointment.  Topher Grace was just awful.  Kirsten Dunst's character whines too much and don't even get me started on Toby McGuire.  This movie is a huge letdown for the Spider Man trilogy.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Don't be fooled into thinking this is a DVD movie with extras. If you want just the movie, then go buy the 2 DVD set. But if you want a beautifully packaged set of books with the movie then this is for you.    I'm also a book collector so something like this is great for me. I'm willing to spend this type of money for a handsome slipcase containing the script book that mimics the real deal, and a photograph book which contains the dvd's, poster, and postcards. It's really a beautiful production, and as mentioned it's large at 8.5\\" x 11\\", and weighs a lot. This is something to read once, view once and put away on your book shelf to keep in mint condition. It's too nice for repeated viewing. In fact I'll probably buy the 2DVD set and keep this one horded away.    Buy this if you want a collector's set of Beatles memorabilia, you'll be happy you did as they really give you a lot for your money. But if you just want the movie then pass it by, as this is not for you. It's strictly for collector's and they did deliver a quality product for collectors, in my opinion.    btw, in reference to the below poster both of my discs are correct. the first dvd is the movies and the second is the extras. No problem here.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I've been looking for this movie on DVD for years (of course, it has never been released on DVD--which is hindering my efforts! =).  Perhaps if enough of us Electric Dreams fans shout loud enough, they will see a money-making opportunity and give us what we want to buy.  Here's hoping, anyway...
0385338694|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's writing and this exceeded my expectations.  Fast pace, light hearted and funny make this book a true delight.  Thank you!  I highly recommend!!!
B000AL730O|1.0|I bought this album because I saw a review of it by Barry Manilow in the Wall Street Journal. I am not a fan of Barry Manilow, but I was a fan of Paul McCartney's Ram, Venus and Mars are Alright Tonight and a few other oldies. I listened to this three or four times and sent it to the back of my CD storage. It's not bad, just boring as an album. If this album was a tribute to his love for his second wife, it is a good indication of how stilted that realationship was.
B000TGCR3I|4.0|Deep Storyline, unique setting,great soundtrack (by Plaid), interesting characters and art style... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of the best Pixar movies I have seen so far. The story line is well put together. The movie have tons of details from over looking Paris at night time, the sewers, restaurants and other vivid places. This movie shows a relationship between a human and a intelligent domestic rat trying to bring back Gusteau's good name. This movie mainly takes place at Gusteau's restaurant in Paris. Its very comical and will bring you tons of joy when you see Remy(rat) complete his goal.

B0001GMIOE|4.0|I bought a couple of these batteries to replace my original Canon batteries which were all suffering from a pretty serious memory effect. These batteries work fine. They are slightly smaller than my old ones, but fit in my D60 just as well. They seem to be slightly faster at recycling the flash than my old batteries, but then again my batteries were OLD. I am happy with my purchase although I am always a little bit annoyed by the price of genuine Canon parts.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|This movie wasn't what it was all cracked up to be. I was ready for a decent story line and some shocking scenes and it didn't come close. STAY away from this HD DVD since the film has a grainy look to it and you can't tell the difference from HD DVD to DVD format.
0425188809|5.0|I'm actually about half way through the book but its just amazing. I wasn't a fan of the synopsis and truly the only reason I started reading it was for a book club I'm a member of but now I can't put it down :)
B000HEWEDK|5.0|[[ASIN:1430310677 Violet Dawn]]<br /><br />Forbidden Planet is one of those unforgettable movies that remains with you for rest of your life. I loved this movie as a child, and I still love it today. I could never watch it too many times. Five stars!
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|okay, I am a huge music fan over all.  I do give everything at least one chance not being too over critical.  Now you can see what the press is doing to Britney. What the heck happened to this album. It was kind of a letdown. Yes I hear what people say about albums and stuff, yet I still give it a fair chance in case I liked it then I can definitely agree or disagree with them. Here is my take on this album.Good title for the album though.  I don't think there is a worse album out there. Makes Hanson sound 100 times better. Other then a few tracks (heaven on earth & Radar) this album should stay on the shelf. LIGHTS OUT ON THIS DISASTER.
B000Y179KO|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums I listened from any group in the last couple years. An instant classic.
0060899220|5.0|Anyone who has worked in a professional kitchen, from slop-house to steak house, will find something to love about this book. Written from the point of view of a real restaurant chef, not some phony who prances around on the Food Network. This book tells the true story of life in the trenches, the grueling, unappreciated job of pumping out dish after dish, night after night while suffering the effects of extreme heat, personal injury and indignities at the hands of coworkers and and uncaring public (\\"The cook lost a finger? Who cares?! Where's my steak!\\").   Some of the French terms used in this book may be hard to navigate for those who aren't familiar with fine dining, but they won't take away from the enjoyment of a tale that finally tells the real story of life on the line.   Anyone who buys in to the celebrity chef culture, and believes that a career in the culinary arts will ensure them a dignified and prosperous life needs to read this book first. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into!

0596527055|5.0|Anyone interested in how and why some innovations succeed (no matter what kind) and some fail (no matter what quality) should read Scott Berkun's THE MYTHS OF INNOVATION.  There are 10 myths associated with innovations in the modern world, and they are all illusions.<br /><br />I will briefly discuss two of these myths:<br /><br />\\"The best ideas win.\\"  This is actually a moral vision, NOT an accurate description.  People who say this (or even those who behave as if it were true) are telling others what they think \\"should\\" happen, not what actually does happen.  Execution (putting the idea into practice) depends on many more characteristics than the content or quality of the idea - such things as support from others, access to resources, technological wherewithal, absence of roadblocks, etc.  All of these other things influence the success of ideas (or lack of success) far more than the idea itself.<br /><br />\\"Innovation is always good.\\"  This is actually wishful thinking, not an accurate description.  If it is possible to use an innovation in malevolent or destructive ways, that will usually happen - the only way to prevent this is to design \\"affordances\\" into an innovation that would make it impossible to use except in designated ways.  This is actually impossible, despite certain claims to the contrary - the cost would be prohibitive, AND people's bloody-minded ingenuity can usually overcome whatever product constraints are put in place.  Effective social control requires conditioning as well as affordances, and people will always find ways to \\"think outside the boxes\\" that are designed to constrain their behaviour.  The capacity to regulate depends upon peoples' willingness to be regulated.<br /><br />Do you know, or know of any individual or group that has \\"beat their heads against the wall\\" of these constraints on innovation?  Let me make a few suggestions for where to look for them:  any person or group proposing individual or institutional re-construction will, by their very nature, have an \\"idealized\\" version of \\"what should be\\" that they would like to see replace \\"what is.\\"  It doesn't matter whether that vision of a better future is based on philosophy, psychology, sociology, or technology - all of these types of proposals extrapolate from \\"what is\\" to \\"what might be.\\"  Yet in reality we do not live in a perfect world - nor can we improve or revolutionize the existing world so that it does achieve (or even approach) perfection.  The best ideas don't necessariy prevail - just look around you.  Innovation is not always good - just look around you.<br /><br />There are 8 other myths of innovation, all of them just as incorrect and dangerous as those above - do yourself a favour - read the book, AND use the valuable life-lessons therein to reformulate your attitude about innovations and their role in life - readers should have better things to do with their heads than beating them against walls!an \\"idealized\\" version of \\"what should be\\" that they would like to see replace \\"what is.\\"  It doesn't matter whether that vision of a better future is based on philosophy, psychology, sociology, or technology - all of these types of proposals extrapolate from \\"what is\\" to \\"what might be.\\"  Yet in reality we do not live in a perfect world - nor can we improve or revolutionize the existing world so that it does achieve (or even approach) perfection.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|This is the type of movie that you'll want to watch again and again. It's pristine condition in this Criterion collection and lots of great special features. The photography is impeccable, the music is cool, the performances are engaging - this is a great movie in every aspect, pretty much flawless.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My six year daughter has fallen in love with this the same way my older children did years ago. I think Matilda must really possess magic powers because my daughter actually sits through it over and over again.
1594489505|5.0|I read The Kite Runner over the summer while on vacation.  I stayed up well past 3 am to finish it -- so enthralled by the characters and their circumstances.    I waited a while to read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  It was worth the wait!  Unfortunately, I was not on vacation when I read it, so I had to have use a little common sense to force myself to put the book down and go to bed (although it was well after midnight for three nights in a row).    I really enjoyed this book. I agree with the reviewer who said a more perfect ending could not be found.  The tragedies and triumphs of these woomen are exceptional.    Five stars, without a doubt.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best version I have seen of Pride and Prejudice. It is as close to the book as possible for a movie, and the actress playing Elizabeth is perfect. The visual quality does not quite match Hollywood, but if you are true fan of the book or Jane Austen, this is the version to see. For anyone not entirely familiar with the story, this movie  improves with each viewing: the language and plot become easier to understand and the ending is just as suspensful/exciting every time you see it.
B000050X31|4.0|As a huge classical music and Mozart fan, I'm giving this one four stars. Superb playing by James Levine and the Met orchestra, a dazzling Pamina played by Battle (who stands out the most IMO), great singing and acting by Papageno, and admirable stage production and direction (\\"Schnelle fusse\\" is wonderfully done). The Queen and Tamino aren't the greatest, but still good. Remember that opera is a massive work of art that requires the efforts of many people. It's really hard to get a \\"perfect\\" production with a \\"dream team\\" of the very best singers performing at their peak. Add to that that this is a live recording, and I'd say this is a hard-to-beat recording of Mozart's divine singspiel. Have seen only a couple of other \\"Flute\\" DVD's (although I've seen tons of \\"Don\\"'s), but this is probably a must-have for any Mozart opera fan.
0307237702|1.0|Let me first state that I like Barack Obama. I've even contributed to his Presidential campaign, not easy for one who lives on Social Insecurity. I am also a raging liberal who started life as an \\"America-right-or-wrong\\" conservative but who was so radicalized by a tour in Vietnam that on my return, except for the crazed excess of Lenin and Stalin, I would have proudly joined the Communist Party.    Nevertheless, I'm saddened to report that \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is so boring as to make one pray for the gift of blindness.    In my life, I've read from cover-to-cover with relish books most would describe as crushingly boring, such as \\"Being And Nothingness\\" by Jean-Paul Sarte and \\"The Database Relational Model\\" by E.F. Codd. \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is the only book I've tried reading that I've been unable to finish. It is world class insipid, an Inane Literature Hall of Fame slam dunk, a book that deserves its own entry in \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\" for its ability to induce comatose sleep, a book that should have a chapter devoted to it's mind-scrambling white noise in the American Psychiatric Association's \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\\"    I still like Obama and hope this book was ghost-written. If not...mere words fail me.    If you admire Barack Obama, don't read this book. Try instead to promote the idea that it was written by a different Barack Obama.
0143038419|4.0|Our bookclub meets monthly.  For our meeting to discuss this book, 5 people loved the book and 5 people passionately hated the book.  Those that really loved the book enjoyed the author's descriptions of the places she visited and her insights into trying to heal yourself.  Those that hated the book felt the author is a spoiled, selfish brat who's insights were about as valuable as the insights one has getting high in a dorm-room.  Approach the book cautiously and if you hate it, don't feel bad.  Even though the book is popular, many people who have read it, hated it.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|This album is a huge improvement. I mean it comes with videos and more extras than most hollywood dvd's. They have music videos and making of's. There are also 3 new wonderful tracks. This is a great gift for anyone who hasn't gotten the older version. Get this one it's much better.
